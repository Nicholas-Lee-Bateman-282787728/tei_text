     For the first time in the thirty years the Compiler has been publishing this

     has been made to pay for it, though uniformly ordered, authorized, accepted, and bound by the
     State since 1857. He confidently expects the next General Assembly to pay for this work in
     compliance with the terms of the customary order for its publication, in which case no notice
     will be taken of any infringement on the copyright.

     THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
     VOLUME TWENTY FOUR
     INDIANA LEGISLATURE

    
     IN SENATE.
     
       THURSDAY, January 6, 1887.
     
      In obedience to a provision in Section 9, Article IV, of the Constitution of the State of
      Indiana, to-wit:"The sessions of the General Assembly shall be held biennially, at the
      Capitol of the State, commencing on the Thursday next after the first Monday of January, in
      the year one thousand eight hundred and fifty-three, and on the same day of every second year
      thereafter, unless different day or place Shall have been appointed by law"--State
      Senators elected in 1884 and State Senators elected in 1886, came together in the west wing of
      the New Capitol Building in the City of Indianapolis, which was occupied this day for the firs
      time as a Senate Chamber.
      Since 1861 custom having fixed ten o'clock as the hour for the convening of the
      Regular Sessions of the Legislature, promptly at that time Hon. Alonzo G. Smith, elected in
      1884 a Senator from the counties of Jennings and Jackson, and who was selected as President
      pro. tempore, at the last meeting of the Senate, having ascended the President's
      platform, rapped with a gavel upon the desk and said: "The Senate of the Fifty-fifth
      General Assembly, will now come to order. Senators and Senators-elect will take their
      seats." 
     Mr WINTER: Mr. Chairman.
      The PRESIDENT pro tem. Senators are requested to keep order.
     Mr. WINTER: Mr. Chairman, I rise to a ant of order. 
     The PRESIDENT pro. tem.: There is nothing that can be brought before this body. It is not
      organized. Your point of order cannot be received or determined. 
     Mr. WINTER: My point of order is that we should proceed with the organization of the Senate
      according to law.
      The PRESIDENT pro. tem.: Your point of order is out of order [Using the gavel.]
      Mr. WINTER: I appeal from the decision of the Chair. 
     The PRESIDENT pro. tem.: Your appeal is out of order, and will not be entertained. [Pounding
      on the desk with the gavel.] 
     Mr. JOHNSON: I second the motion, for an appeal, and desire to give notice that I will file
      a protest with the Senator from Marion [Mr. Winter.]
     Mr. WINTER: Then I rise to a question of privilege.
     The PRESIDENT pro. tem.: Your question of privilege is out of order. [Using the gavel.] 
     Mr. WINTER: To raise a question of privilege is a right, possessed by every Senator for upon
      the floor. 
     The PRESIDENT pro. tem.: When an organization is perfected perhaps you are right. [Rapping
      with the gavel.] 
     Mr. WINTER: As a Senator on the floor, of this Senate, possessed of privileges guaranteed by
      the Constitution of the State, I protest against the act of the person assuming to act as
      President pro. tem. of the Senate as a thing improper, uncalled for, and without the expressed
      will of the Senate. [The Chair continued to rap on the desk with the gavel.] I shall reduce my
      protest to writing. 
     The PRESIDENT pro. tem.: You are out of order.--[Rapping with the gavel.]. Take your
      seat.
      Mr. JOHNSON: I don't recognize you, sir---- 
     The PRESIDENT pro. tem. [interposing and using the gavel vigorously:] I don't recognize
      you, sir. The first thing in order is a prayer by Bishop Knickerbacker. 
     Mr. WINTER: I protect against discharging the duties of the Lieutenant Governor in the
      organization of this Senate. 
     The PRESIDENT pro. tem. Reduce your protest to writing. Senators will rise while we have
      prayer.
     
     Mr. WINTER I appeal to the Senate as against this person who is assuming; the duties of a
      Lieutenant-Governor. 
     The PRESIDENT pro. tem. [still using the gavel:] Order while prayer is being offered. The
      Senate will now be opened with prayer by Bishop Knickerbacker, of the Episcopal Church.
      [From the, time the Senate was called to order till after the Bishop had repeated a portion
      of the Lord's Prayer the confusion caused by more than one speaking at once, and other
      noise on the floor, prevented the stenographer from hearing all that was said.] Continuing,
      the Bishop prayed as follows: "We, beseech Thee, O Lord, for the people of this State and
      especially for, the Legislators here assembled. Preserve them from error, from ignorance and
      from every evil thing. Direct all their counsels for the enactment of just and equitable laws
      for the preservation of liberty, for the punishment of evil doers, and for the praise of them
      that do well. Inspire them with true wisdom that cometh from above. Keep them in Thy fear that
      they may prove themselves good servants and in all things promote Thy Glory through Jesus
      Christ our Lord. Look with favor, upon thy servant the Governor of this Commonwealth; endow
      him with thy Holy Spirit, enrich him with Thy Grace and with Thy Wisdom so that he knowing
      whose minister he is will give Thee honor and glory, through Jesus Christ our Lord. The Grace
      of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Love of God and the Fellowship of the Holy Ghost be with us all,
      evermore, Amen."

      the gavel.]
      The PRESIDENT pro. tem.: The Auditor will call thirteen of the Senators-elect as their
      names appear upon the roll, and they will present themselves at the bar of the senate and be

      Judge Zollers administered the oath. 
     Mr. WINTER: I rise to a point of order, Mr. Chairman. My point of order now: goes to the
      organization of the Senate.
     The PRESIDENT pro. tem.: The Senator is out of order for two reasons: he addresses the
      President of the Senate as "Mr. Chairman," and this Senate cannot entertain a point
      of order until its organization. 
     Mr. WINTER: I desire to state my point of order.
      The PRESIDENT pro. tem.: You may state it, sir, 
     Mr. WINTER: My point of order is that there are present but twenty-four member of the last

      that the Senate proceed to  the election of a President.
      pro. tempore--the Lieutenant-Governor not being in attendance.
      Mr. PRESIDENT pro. tem.: Your point of order and your resolution is out of order and your
      resolution is out of order.
     Mr. WINTER: I appeal to the judgment of the Senate.
     The PRESIDENT pro. tem.: Your appeal out of order. You will take your seat.
     Mr. WINTER: I desire to rise to a question or privilege,
      The PRESIDENT pro. tem.: I say to the Senator, with all due respect to him, that he is out
      of order. You will take your seat. 
     Mr. WINTER: I desire to have my protest entered on the Journals of the Senate. 
     The PRESIDENT pro. tem.: You take your seat. [Using the gavel vigorously.] Take your seat,
      now. The first thing in order is the election of a Principal secretary of the Senate. 
     Mr. JOHNSON: I desire to suggest that the first thing in order is the election of a
      President pro. tempore of the Senate. 
     The PRESIDENT pro. tem.: I desire to suggest that you take your seat, sir. [laughter] and
      keep it. The first thing in order is election of a Principal Secretary. Nominations are now in

      Those not answering will be marked present and not voting, if they are present. 
     When the roll-call was completed--
     Mr. WINTER said "Please call my name." When, his name was called he said: "I,
      decline to vote on this occasion, for I regard this proceeding as in violation of law and
      precedent, and against the rights and privileges of the Senate and of Senators " 
     The. PRESIDENT pro. tem.: Call the name of the Senator from Marion--Senator Winter. [No
      response.] Call the names of Senators present and not voting.
      Mr. WINTER: I make the point of order that nothing but the election of President pro tem.

     After the roll-call 
     Mr. JOHNSON said: I would like to have my name called. [When his names was again called:] I
      have refrained from voting heretofore because I think the Senate is not competent to proceed
      tn this manner; and I desire my vote shall not be counted. 
     The PRESIDENT pro. tem.: There are 50 Senators present; 19 Senators present and not voting;
      31 present and voting. Mr. Pritchett having received 31 votes I declare him elected Doorkeeper
      of this Senate. 
     Judge Zollers administered the oath of office to the Doorkeeper. 
    
    
     ELECTION OF PRESIDENT.
     Mr. FRENCH: I desire to offer the following:
     
     
     
      
       
         Whereas, By reason of the acceptance of a federal office by Hon. Mahlon D. Manson,
         Lieutenant-Governor of Indiana, a vacancy exists in the office of Lieutenant-Governor of
         Indiana. 
        Whereas, Hon. Alonzo G. Smith, a member of this Senate, being a Senator from the counties
         of Jackson and Jennings, was, at the session of the General Assembly of 1885, elected
         President of this senate for the occasion; therefore, 
        Resolved, That Hon. Alonzo G. Smith is hereby recognized and elected as President of the
         Senate of Indiana. 
       
      
     
     Mr. FRENCH: I demand the previous question on the adoption of this resolution.
     
      The PRESIDENT pro. tem.: The Senator from White, Senator Sellers, will take the chair. 
     Mr. JOHNSON: I hope the Senate will not second the demand for the previous question. 
     The PRESIDING OFFICER [Mr. Sellers in the chair:] As many as favor seconding the demand [Mr.
      Winter and other Senators demanded the yeas and nays] will say "aye," those of the
      contrary opinion say "no." The demand is seconded. The question is "shall the
      main question be now put?" 
     The yeas and nays being demanded by Messrs. Winter and Drake, they were ordered. 
     Mr. WINTER: I demand a division of the question so that the vote be taken upon the preamble
      separate from the resolution. 
     The PRESIDING OFFICER:[Mr. Sellers in the chair:] Call the roll. 
     Mr. WINTER: I desire to appeal from the decision of the Chair.
     The PRESIDING OFFICER: Call the roll. 
     Mr. WINTER: I protest against the ruling of the Chair. 
     The PRESIDING OFFICER.: Call the roll.
     Mr. WINTER, when his name a called,said I desire to explain my vow. 
     The PRESIDING OFFICER [Mr. Sellers in the chair] Are there any objections? 
     Mr. WINTER: Mr. President: I wish to, say, without any disrespect to the Chair, that, as far
      as I am concerned, I recognize that the organization of the Senate so far is an accomplished
      fact. I regard the chair as de facto President and nothing else. On the question now before
      the Senate I wish to call attention to a few facts and state the position occupied by myself
      and colleagues. 
     The PRESIDING OFFICER: The Senator will be kind enough to be brief. 
     Mr. WINTER: I will be brief. At the session of the Senate in 1879, Mr. Viehe, of Knox, one
      of the most distinguished lawyers in the State, was selected as President pro. tem. of the
      Senate. At the beginning of the session of 1881, Lieutenant-Governor Gray had become Governor.
      Senator Viehe, as I am informed, refused to take part as President in the organization of the
      Senate, holding that his term President pro. tem. had expired. The records of the Senate of
      1881 show that while he was President, he took no part as an officer in the organization of
      the Senate, but that Auditor of State Manson called senate to order and called the roll, and
      then declined to proceed further, but left the organization of the Senate to itself. Senator
      Menzies, another distinguished Democratic lawyer, moved that the President pro. tem. be
      elected, and upon that motion Senator Viehe was re-elected President pro. tem. of the Senate.
      This proceeding recognizes the fact that the Senate of the State is not a continuing body. The
      Senate to-day is a new body. I understand according to, parliamentary law, the terms of all
      officers elected by the body expire ride the body, and an off leer, by virtue of his election
      by a previous Senate, has no right to take any part in the organization of a subsequent
      Senate. The records show that upon the floor of this Senate there are but twenty-four members
      who took part in the election of the President pro. tem. of the last Senate. It would be a
      most unheard-of proceeding that a selection by twenty-four members, ten less than a quorum of
      this body, can be imposed upon a new Senate composed of twenty-six members who were not
      members of the body when the selection was made. A minority cannot impose upon this Senate a
      President pro. tem. I vote "no." 

     Mr. JOHNSON: I ask unanimous consent of the Senate to explain the reason for my vote. The
      temper of this Senate heretofore has been such as to warrant the belief that it will not
      listen to an extended discussion, of the, questions involved. I therefore will confine myself
      to a succinct and parliamentary statement of a few of the reasons that influence my vote. In
      doing so I must say, in common with the Senator from Marion. [Mr. Winter,] I recognize the
      fact that the Senate has a de facto, if not a de jure, organization. I believe the President
      pro. tem. was not constitutionally or legally elected at the last session of the legislature,
      for the reason that, at the time, he was elected the constitutional conditions for an election
      did not exist. The Lieutenant Governor was not at that time acting as Governor, nor was he
      absent; but, as shown by the Senate journal, at the time of the election, of the President
      pro. tem., the Lieutenant-Governor was occupying, the chair.: But even if he was legally and
      constitutionally elected, he. could not hold over, and has no power to preside over this
      Senate. He was a mere creature of the Senate. Which elected him, and could not endure beyond
      its existence. A majority of the members of this Senate were not members of the Senate which
      elected him, and by no parliamentary or legal principle could he be, by the Senate which
      elected him, foisted upon this body. In my opinion, this Senate has the right to elect and
      choose, de novo, its own President pro. tem. I vote "no." 
     Mr. CAMPBFLL: I vote "no," and I want say just one word in explanation that while
      recognize the right of the members in the majority to elect a President pro. tem. we, were
      expecting they would put their candidate in nomination, call the roll, and by viva voce vote
      elect their man. Had they done so the minority would have acted in the same orderly manner. Of
      course the majority can elect by resolution if they choose. If they can accomplish any more in
      that way than by a viva voce: vote, I am not able to see it. 
     
     The PRESIDING OFFICER.: The yeas are thirty, the nays are nineteen, so the motion prevails,
      and the main question is ordered. The question is upon the adoption of the resolution; as many
      as are in favor of the resolution will say "aye," as many as are of a contrary
      opinion say, "no." The ayes seem to have it--the ayes have it; the motion is
      carried. Senator Smith, from the counties of Jackson and Jennings,is  recognized and elected as President of the Senate of Indiana
      [Applause.]
      The Hon. Alonzo G. Smith resumed the chair, and laid before the Senate a communication
      announcing that the Governor would give a reception at his residence tonight to members and
      officers of the General Assembly.
      Mr. FRENCH: I desire to move now at the vote by which the resolution was adopted be
      reconsidered, and that that motion lie on the table.
      The yeas and nays were demanded by Messers. Winter and Davis.
     
     
     The PRESIDENT: The Auditor of State will call the roll. [After the call was completed.] Hear
      the result of the vote: There are 3O votes in the affirmative and 17 in the negative. So the
      motion prevails.
     Mr. SELLERS: I offer the following:
     
     
     
      
       
         Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate be and is hereby instructed to inform the
         House that the Senate this day organized, having the Hon. Alonzo G. Smith,. a member
         thereof, as Presiding Officer, and has elected Webster Nixon, Principal Secretary of the
         Senate; John D. Carter, Assistant Secretary thereof, and Frank Pritchett, Doorkeeper of the
         Senate for the present session, and is now ready for the transaction of Public business.
        
       
      
     
     The resolution was read. 
     Mr. SELLERS: I move the adoption of the resolution,and upon that motion demand the previous
      question.
      The motion was agreed to.
     
     
      Mr. PRESIDENT: Shall the main question be now put? Those in favor, will say
      "aye." [Mr. Winter demanded the yeas and nays.] The Chair begs the Senator's
      pardon. I came very nearly directing the call without asking his permission. Ca11 the roll.
      [After the roll-call.] Hear the result: the yeas are 30, the nays 19; so the main question is
      ordered. The question is on the adoption of the resolution. 
     It was adopted, without a division. 
    
    
      SENATE RULES.
     Mr. BAILEY: I desire to move the adoption of the following as Senate rules and orders for
      the government of the Senate, and, upon, that motion, I move the previous question. 
     
       The President shall take the Chair every day precisely at ten o'clock in the
       fore noon and two o'clock in the afternoon, unless the Senate shall, by motion, have

       order; and, on the appearance of two-thirds, shall cause the journal of the preceding day to

       The President shall preserve order decorum, may speak to points of order
       preference to Senators, rising to his feet for that purpose; and shall decide questions of
       order , subject to an appeal to the Senate by any two Senators, on which appeal no Senator
       shall speak more than once,unless by leave of the Senate. Should the President fail or refuse
       at once to put such question of appeal., then it shall become the duty of the Secretary of
       the Senate, on the demand of two Senators, to put the question, call the roll, and declare
       the result. 
       The President shall rise to put a question, but may state it sitting. 
       Questions shall be distinctly put to this form, to-wit: "As many as are of
       the opinion that as the question may be say 'Aye,'"and after, the affirmative
       voice is expressed, "as many as are the contrary opinion, say 'No."' If
       the President doubts, or a division be called for, the Senate shall divide; those in the
       affirmative of the question, shall first arise front their seats, and after those in the
       negative. 
       The Doorkeeper shall have a general direction of the Senate Chamber. The
       President shall have the right to, name any Senator to perform the duties of the Chair, but

       Thirty-one standing Committees, not to exceed seven members each, shall be
       appointed by the Senate, at the commencement of each session, viz.:

       It shall be the duty: of the Committee on Elections to examine
       and report upon the Certificates and other credentials of the Senators returned to serve in
       the Senate, and take into consideration all petitions; documents and evidence relating to
       elections, which may be referred to them by the Senate; and each of the other committees
       shall perform such services, and take into consideration all subjects and matters required of
       them by the Senate. The Committee on Elections shall have leave to report
       at any time on the right of a member to his seat, by presenting their report to the Senate,
       or by filling the same with the Secretary thereof, and the report of such committee shall be
       a question of the highest privilege, and may be called up at any time by the Chairman of the
        Committee on Electionsor any member thereof; and when called up, the
       action of the Senate, and all proceedings thereon, shall be the same as if said report had
       been called up as provided in Rule 10. 
       As soon as the journal shall have been read and approved, or the reading thereof
       dispensed with, the President of the Senate shall call the Committee on
        Elections, and shall immediately recognize the chairman of said committee, who may
       report or who may call up for consideration any contest which may have been reported by said
       committee, or a majority thereof, and such contest shall be pending before the Senate when so
       called up, and the chairman of such committee shall be entitled too hold the floor after
       calling up any contest, and address the Senate thereon for one hour, unless the previous
       question shall be sooner ordered. The previous question, when ordered, shall have the effect
       to out off all debate and bring the Senate to a vote upon all questions pending in such
       contest, and no motion to take a recess, to adjourn,. or to fix a day to which the Senate
       shall adjourn, shall be in order until such contest shall have been determined by the Senate.
       In case any contest shall be determined under the operation of the previous question no
       motion shall be made except a motion to reconsider any vote so taken, and the previous
       question shall at once attach to such motion to reconsider, and no motion shall be in order
       except to lay the motion to reconsider upon the table, which motion or motions shall be put
       to a vote without debate. The President of the Senate shall promptly put all questions, in
       such contest, to a vote. and in case of his failure so to do the same shall be deemed as
       pending, and the Secretary shall immediately, on the demand of two Senators, sell the roll
       and record the vote on the ding question, and at the conclusion of the vote shall announce
       the result.

       When any Senator is about to speak in debate, or deliver any matter to the
       Senate, he shall rise from his seat, respectfully, address himself to the question under
       debate, and avoid personality. No Senator shall impeach the motives of any other
       Senator's vote or argument. 
      If any Senator, In speaking or otherwise, transgress the rules, of the Senate,
       the President shall, or any Senator may, call him to order, in which case the Senator so
       called to order shall immediately sit down, unless permitted to explain; and the Senate
       shall, if appealed to by such Senator, decide the case, but without debate. If there be no
       appeal by such Senator, the decision of the Chair, shall be submitted to. If the decision be
       in favor of the Senator called to order, he shall be at liberty to proceed. If otherwise, and
       the case require it, he shall be liable to the censure of the Senate. 
       When two or more Senators happen to rise at once, the President shall name who
       is to speak first,subject, however, to the right of appeal by either of said Senators, and if
       the President shall fail or refuse to entertain such appeal the same shall be pending before
       the Senate, upon demand of two Senators the Secretary shall call the roll, announce the
       result and record the same and such appeal shalt be decide without debate.
       No Senator shall speak more thaw twice on the same question, without leave of
       the Senate, nor more than once, until every member choosing to speak, shall have spoken. 
       While the President is putting the question, or addressing the Senate, no
       Senator shall walk, across or out of the House, nor when a Senator is speaking, shall any
       entertain private discourse or pass between him and the Chair. 
       No Senator shall be compelled to vote on any question in the event of which he
       is immediately and particularly interested, or in any case where he was not present when the
       question was put, but, appearing afterward, be may, by permission, have his name called and
       vote, provided his vote does not change the result. 
       Upon a division and count of the Senate on any question, no Senator without the
       bar should be counted. 
       Every Senator who shall be in the House when the question is put shall give his
       vote, unless the Senate for special reasons, excuse him. But the question of excusing a
       Senator shall be decided summarily, without debate. 
       When a motion is made and seconded, it shall be stated by the President or,
       being in writing. it shall be handed to, the Secretary, and then read aloud before debated. 
       Every motion shall be reduced to writing, if the President, or any Senator,

       the Secretary, before reading.

       possession of the Senate, but may be withdrawn at any time before decision or
       amendment.

       When a question is postponed indefinitely the same shall note be acted upon
       during the session. 
       The previous question shall be put in this form: "Shall the main question
       be now put?" It shall only be admitted when demanded by a majority of the Senators
       voting, and until it is decided shall preclude all debate, and the introduction of all
       further amendments. The main question shall be the first question in order, and its effect
       shall be to put an end to all debate, and bring the Senate to a direct vote on the subsidiary
       questions then pending, in their order, and then on the main question. 
       Motions and reports may be committee at the pleasure of the Senate. 
       Any member may call for the division of a question where the sense will admit of
       it.

       shall be admitted under color of amendment.
       When a motion has, once been made and carried in the affirmative or negative, it
       shall be in order for any Senator of the majority to move a reconsideration thereof, on the,
       same or any other day during the session, but such motion can be entertained but once during
       the session, and when made after the second day it shall lie over one day before being acted
       upon. :

       the President or by any Senator. 
      A motion to adjourn shall always be in order except when the previous question is
       pending, and shall be decided without debate except as provided in rules 9 and ten. The
       question pending on adjournment shall be resumed on re-assembling, unless otherwise ordered
       by the Senate,except as: provided in rules 9 and 10.

       the contray, be committed to a regular or select committee, or to a Committee of the
        Whole Senate. If the bill be referred to a Committee of the Whole
        Senate, the Senate shall determine on what day it shall be considered. 
       A committee to whom a bill shall be referred may report thereon, with or without
       amendments ; and the bill, when returned, if this be on a day subsequent to its first
       reading, shall be on its second reading, and after it has been read, the report of the
       committee shall be read; the question shall then be on concurring in the report of the
       committee either with or, without amendments;, the President shall: then state that the bill
       is ready for amendment or engrossment.

       said Revised statutes, 
     
     Any amendments to these rules shallbe referred to the Committee on Joint
       Rules.
      Mr. WINTER: I rise to a point of order, 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: We are acting under a demand for the previous question. 
     Mr WINTER: The point of order I desire to make is one arising from the question before the
      Senate. I insist it is a question of the highest privilege. I want to state  the point of order, because I understand it., is the intention to
      refuse: to entertain the point of order. [Reads from a Jefferson's Manual, page 236.] 
     They PRESIDENT pro tem: The chair will bear you, not recognizing that you have the right to
      make a point of order.
     Mr. WINTER The point of order that I propose to raise relates, to rules numbered 3 and 10
      and which provide that in a certain contingency the President of the Senate shall be
      superseded, and that his duties shall devolve upon the Secretary of the Senate which would be
      a violation of the Constitution, and it is not proper for the Senate, by a resolution to
      abrogate a constitutional rule: The point must be decided before the Senate can proceed. 
      The PRESIDENT pro tem: The point of order is not well taken.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I rise to a parliamentary inquiry. It is a custom in the administration of
      criminal law to allow a man under conviction to state any reason, if he has any, why he should
      not be punished. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Does the Senator now desire to give some reason why the judgment
      of the law should not be pronounced against him?
     Mr. DEMOTTE [continuing:] It is also the custom, when a criminal stands on the scaffold,
      that he is allowed a chance to speak. Is it parliamentary to suppress any expression from the
      minority, on this floor, and leave to them only the right to pretest? 
     Mr. WINTER: I desire to appeal from that decision of the Chair.
      The PRESIDENT pro tem: That is out of order, because we are operating under the previous
      question. The question is, Does the Senate second the demand for the previous question? 
     The demand was seconded by a viva voce vote,. 
     Mr. CAMPBELL demanded at division of the question. 
     Mr. SELLERS: A motion for a division of the question is not applicable. We are acting under
      the operation of the previous question. The motion is that these rules as a whole be adopted.
      Now there can be no division of the question. I make that point of order. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: The point of order is sustained. 
     Mr. WINTER: With the permission of the Chair, I desire to state briefly why I think the
      motion for a division of the question is in order. The former rules of this Senate provide
      that at any time a member has a right to demand : a separation of the question. The rules of
      the Senate of the United States upon this subject will be regarded as good authority, [Reads.]
      In Jefferson's Manual the same proposition is laid down on page. 242. [Reads.] The
      proposition of the Senator from White [Mr. Sellers] that these rules be adopted as a whole is
      susceptible of division and a demand for a division is in order. 
     The PRESIDENT : The Chair sustained the point: of order, not for the reason but at some time
      such a motion would not be right, but the motion was not made at the proper time. The, time is
      passed, for we are now operating under the previous question. The question is, shall the main
      question be now put? 
     
     
     The demand for the previous question was seconded by yeas 29, nays 19. 
     Mr. CAMPBELL: I now ask for a division of the question, that we may vote upon the rules
      separately, 
     The PRESIDENT pro. tem.: I think the previous question touches all along the line. 
     Mr. WINTER: I desire to appeal, from that decision to the Senate. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: We are operating under the previous question. The appeal is out of
      order. The question is on the adoption of the rules. 
     
      They were adopted--by yeas 29,nays 19.
    
    
     OPENING COURTESIES.
      Messrs. Weir and Winter were appointed a committee on the part of the Senate, to wait upon

     follows:
    Oh! Lord, Thou art Holy! Heaven and earth are full of Thy Glory, and we feel that we are
     unworthy to approach Thee in our own name. Holy, Lord God Almighty! before Thee we come in the
     name of Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Intercessor, and we would present our claims before God
     because He is our Redeemer. We pray for those to whom have been committed the welfare of the
     Commonwealth of Indiana. The wives and mother and children of this country are looking to use
     for the future, and we pray God would teach these Legislators wisdom, and to know the
     authority, understanding and knowledge of God. We pray to Thee, Blessed Lord, that all who are
     in authority may fear Thee, and that we may live consistent lives.
    Bless the Governor of the State of Indiana. Bless the members of the General Assembly, and
     grate that they may all have clearness of perception and wisdom from On High upon all State
     affairs, and, O Lord, grant to preside in our, hearts to-day and through all the, days of our
     lives; and as for this great house that has been erected for the people of the State may
     God's name always be revered in this building. Bless us and hear us in these our prayers
     and requests and ultimately save us for Christ's sake. Amen!

    The motion was agreed to, and thereupon .
    The SECRETARY OF STATE declared nominations of candidates for Speaker of the House were in
     order.
     Mr. GARDNER: I have the pleasure of placing in nomination for the office of Speaker of this
     House a gentleman who has large experience in Legislative bodies, whose experience as a
     Legislator has well qualified him for that position, and whose reputation throughout the State
     is a sufficient guarantee of his ability to discharge its duties. I nominate Hon. Warren Sayre,
     of Wabash county, 
    Mr. KELLISON: In obedience to the unanimous choice of the Democratic members of this body I
     have the pleasure of placing before this House as a candidate for Speaker the name of the
     recognized leader of his party on this floor, the able Speaker of the 54th General Assembly,
     Hon. Charles L. Jewett, of Floyd county.

    There being no other nominations, the roll was called by Deputy Secretary of State King.
     Pending the roll-call---
    Mr. BERTRAM, stated that he was paired with Mr. Barnard. 
    Mr. MACKEY appeared and was swore in before voting.

    
    
     The result of the ballot: For Mr. Sayre, 54 votes; for Mr. Jewett, 44 votes. 
    The SECRETARY OF STATE announced Mr. Sayre duly elected Speaker of the House, and appointed
     Messrs. Gardner and Jewett to conduct him to the chair.
     The SPEAKER said : Gentlemen of the House of Representatives--The fact of having been a
     member of this General Assembly will doubtless be cherished with pleasure by each of us. To
     have been chosen the Speaker of this House, for many reasons, will always be to me a source of
     gratification and pride: especially for the reason that we are dedicating a portion of this a
     magnificent structure to its final use and inaugurating it to the law-making power of the
     people of the State, which is a distinction that will forever be held in grateful remembrance
     by me, and for it I now return my sincere thanks. The session promises to be an interesting
     one; let us hope that it will be a profitable one as well. Let us endeavor to so perform the
     duties assigned us by the Constitution and laws and the voice of the people: that the
     expenditure of so much of the people's money in raising this temple may at least seem
     justified. It would be impertinent in we to now suggest legislation, but as questions auk
     numerous and interesting are now-a-days crowding upon us in such rapid succession, and subjects
     new but thought to be proper for legislation are daily presenting, themselves to us in varied
     form, seems I can fairly, in your name, promise the people of the State that their expression
     upon the subject shall be enacted into law. Again I thank you ,and ask your generous assistance
     in the discharge of the duties that by your favor I now assume. 
    If I can be informed of the order of, business I will now proceed. 
    Mr. Jewett stated that, it was customary to administer the oath of office to the Speaker
     before he assumes his duties: 
    The oath was then administered by Judge. James A. S. Mitchell, of the Supreme Court:.

      OPENING COURTESIES.
      Mr. THOMPSON offered a resolution directing the Principal Clerk, to notify the Senate that
      the House is organized and ready to proceed with legislative business. 
     Mr. FLEECE offered the following substitute: 
     
     
     
      
       

        Resolved, That a committee of three be appointed by the Speaker to inform the Senate that
         the House has organized by election of Warren G. Sayre, of Wabash, as Speaker; W. H. Smith
         as Principal Clerk: Frank W. Rawles, as Assistant Clerk and C. C. Schreeder as Doorkeeper,
         and are ready to proceed to legislative business. 
       
      
     
     This substitute was adopted. 
     A message was announced from the Senate by the Principal Secretary thereof, notifying the
      House that it was organized and ready for the transaction of business.
     The SPEAKER: I refuse to receive the announcement for the reason that it is not by any
      member of the Senate.
     On motion by Mr. FLEECE the Speaker meted Messrs. Jewett and Gardner a committee to announce
      to the Senate that the House is organized and ready for the transaction of business. 
     Mr. GORDON offered a resolution that rules heretofore governing the House of Representatives
      be in full force until roles are adopted, and that a committee of four, with the Speaker as
      chairman, be appointed by the Speaker to report a set of rules on Monday.
     The resolution was adopted. 
     Mr. PLEASANTS offered the following: 
     
     
      
       
        Resolved, That a committee of two upon the part of the House be appointed to with a
         similar committee upon the part of the Senate to wait on His Excellency the Governor to
         inform him of the organization of the two Houses, and learn of him at what time it will
         suit his convenience to whatever communication he may desire to make to the General
         Assembly.
       
      
     
     It was adopted, and thereupon-----
     The SPEAKER appointed Messrs. Pleasants and Kerchival said committee on the part of the
      House.
    
    
      RULES AGAIN.
     Mr. GREENE: I move that the resolution relating to the committee on rules, offered by the
      gentleman from Putnam [Mr. Gordon,] be reconsidered. 
     Mr. GORDON: I desire to make the inquiry if the gentleman from Rush [Mr. Greene] voted with
      the majority. 
     Mr. GREENE : I did.
     Mr. JEWETT: I rise to a point of order, that the rules of the former House, being then in
      force under the passage of Mr. Gordon's resolution, contained a provision that the ruled
      should not be changed except on notice of one day given. 
     The SPEAKER decided the point of order not well taken, inasmuch as it was not proposed, to
      change any rule, but that the motion was only to reconsider a motion made at the present
      session during the continuance of the sitting; also, that it was not clear that the rules were
      to be changed. 
     Mr. JEWETT: I wish to appeal. The motion will leave this House without any rules until new
      rules are framed and adopted.
     
      The motion to reconsider was agreed to by yeas 49, nays 42.
      Mr. GREENE offered a resolution that a committee of four members, including the Speaker, be
      appointed on rules, and report as speedily as possible.
      Mr. JEWETT: I desire to move as amendment. I want some rules to govern this House until
      this committee makes its report, and I move as an amendment that the rules of the last House
      govern until the committee report. 
     Mr. GARDINER opposed the amendment and stating the general parliamentary rules would be
      sufficient to work under temporarily, moved to lay Mr. Jewett's amendment on the table. 
     The yeas and nays were demanded. Mr. Gardiner, perceiving that his motion to lay the
      amendment on the table, if successful, would take the original motion there also, desired to
      withdraw his motion. 
     Mr. JEWETT made the point of order that the motion having been given to the House, and the
      yeas. and nays demanded, could not be taken away from it at the will of the mover. 
     The SPEAKER sustained his point of order.
      The motion to lay on the table was agreed to--yeas 52, nays 43. 
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.

     Mr. GREEN introduced a resolution that the Speaker appoint a committee of five, the Speaker
      to be chairman, to prepare rules for the government of the House and to report to-morrow
      morning, and demanded the previous question on its adoption. 
     Mr. JEWETT made a point of order that a resolution of identical effect having been this
      morning tabled; the present one was out of order. To allow it to be renewed once would decide
      that it might be renewed any number of times. 
     The SPEAKER: It is the opinion of the chair that the resolution that was laid on the table
      is not the, same, and that the point is not well taken. 
     
     
     The demand for the previous question was seconded by the House, by yeas 53, nays 43.
      Mr. GORDON raised the point of order that a two-thirds affirmative vote was necessary. 
     The SPEAKER: The opinion of the chair is that a majority vote is all that is required ;
      therefore the point of order is not well taken. The question is, shall the main question be
      now put?
     
     
     
     It was so ordered by yeas 52, nays 44. 
     Mr. GORDON renewed his point of order, that a two-thirds vote is necessary to second a
      demand for the previous question. 
     The SPEAKER: It is the opinion of the chair that the House as now organize must be governed
      by the will of the majority. 
     Mr. GORDON (and Mr. Jewett) appealed from the decision of the Chair. 
     Mr. GREEN: I move to lay the appeal the table.
      Mr. JEWETT: I make a point, of order that a motion to lay on the table is not a
      parliamentary method of disposing of an appeal. When an appeal is taken from the ruling of a
      gentleman woo presides. over a moody he should leave the chair while the appeal is being
      considered, though I believe these is no power to make him leave the b r,: There is but one
      body in the world I know of, and that is our National House of Representatives at Washington,
      where a emotion to lay on the table is taken to be a proper method of disposing of an appeal
      from the decision of the Chair, and that is finder a rule, and we have no rules on that
      subject. It is a matter of supreme moment to determine early in this House whether or not the
      rights a every, individual member are to be protected. This is no one-sided question, and it
      ought to be disposed of fairly, according to parliamentary precedent. 
     The SPEAKER: The point of order is not well taken. 
     
     
     The appeal was tabled--yeas 53, nays 43.
      The resolution was then adopted. 
    
    
     THE GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE.
      Mr. PLEASANTS, from the joint committee appointed to wait on the Governor, reported that
      the Governor would be ready to meet the House at 10 o'clock to-morrow.

      Ackman, Lee Reynolds and Wm. Dickey.

    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
     VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    
    IN SENATE.
    
      FRIDAY, January 7, 1887. 
    
    The Senate met at 10 o'clock, a. m., (Hon. A G. Smith, President, in the chair,) and was
     opened with prayer by Hon. W. J. Davis, a Senator from the county of Elkhart.
    The Secretary's minutes of yesterday's proceedings were read in part.
    Mr. CAMPBELL I move to strike out Journal the words "President pro tem.' after the,
     words "A.. G. Smith," and in lie thereof the words "the Senator from the
     counties of Jackson and Jennings," and also the words "President of the Senate"
     wherever they occur in the prior to the election of Hon. A. G. Smith as President pro. tem. I
     make this not as a political motion, but as a legal proposition, whether or not the Senate is
     to recognize the Senator from Jennings (Mr. Smith)as President pro. tem. before he was elected
     as such; whether or not he holds that office by virtue of an election held at us session, and
     which, if established as a precedent, may be considered as binding in the future . This is a
     question of some importance, and one-that might come home again some time to vex the other
     side--it might be that it would become a precedent that would embarrass others. It is a matter
     that makes but little difference to me, personally, but it is a serious on whether the Senate
     shall recognize an election held at a former session as binding at the opening of this. It is a
     thing unprecedented. 
    Mr. MCDONALD, of, Whitley, (interposing) Would there be harm in inserting
     this record a mattet of history?
     Mr. CAMPBELL:. If it be true that the of election of Hon. A. G. Smith as President pro tem.
     of the Senate two years ago made him President event pro tem. of this Senate, then the journal
     is correct; but if that be not true, then the journal is not correct. The President of the
     Senate knows I am not this question a personal matter. As far as I am concerned I make no
     objection to any Senator whom the majority of the Senate may select as presiding officer, but I
     do insist that an election of that. officer last session can not be binding on this; therefore
     I move to correct the journal in this respect.
     Mr. BAILEY: I move to lay that motion on the table, and on that I demand the previous
     question.
     The Senate seconded the demand. The question then being: ' Shall the main question be
     now put?" it was so ordered by yeas 31, nays 19. 
    Pending the roll-call-- 
    Mr. CAMPBELL, when his name was called, said : I want to explain my vote briefly. 
    The PRESIDENT: The Senator is out of order. It is not in order to explain a vote during a
     demand for the previous question. 
    Mr. WINTER: The main question is not demanded until this vote is taken and the result
     announced in the affirmative.
    The. PRESIDENT pro tem. : Call the roll. When the roll-call was completed the result was
     announced as above.
     The motion to lay the appeal on the table was then agreed to by, yeas 31, nays 19. 
    
     THE JOINT CONVENTION.
      Mr. BAILEY moved that the vote of yesterday by which the Senate agreed to join the House at
      this hour (10.30 o'clock) to hear the Governor's message be reconsidered, and on
      that motion he demanded the previous question.
      The demand for the previous question was seconded by a viva voce vote. 
     The main question was ordered to be put by yeas 31, nays 19, Mr. CAMPBELL desiring to
      explain his vote, but was ruled out of order by the Chair. 
      The motion to reconsider was agreed by yeas 31, nays 19.
      Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. WINTER, when his name was called, said: There having been no explanation  made of the object or necessity of this action I feel that a
      reconsideration of this motion would be an act of disrespect to the Governor of this State. 
     Mr. SHIVELY (interposing:) Under the operation of the previous question I understand debate
      is cut off. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: That point of order has been frequently decided. 
      Mr. WINTER (continuing:) The Governor of this State has notified us that he will meet us in
      joint convention at 10 o'clock to-day in the Hall of the House, and I presume he is there
      now waiting for this Senate, and it seems to me we ought not to be guilty of the great
      impropriety of reconsidering our agreement to go there, therefore I vote "no."
      The vote was announced as above. 
     Mr. BAILEY moved that the resolution to go into a joint convention to bear the
      Governor's message be laid on the table. 
     

     The motion was agreed to--yeas 30, nays 18.
     Pending the roll-call---- 
     Mr. DRAKE, in explanation of his vote, when his name was called, said: The Governor of this
      State has invited us to hear his message delivered in the Hall of the House, and as I am
      extremely anxious to hear it I vote 'no." 
     Mr. JOHNSON, when his name was called, said: If any good reason can be shown why we should
      no attend the joint convention called to hear the Governor's message read, I would
      cheerfully vote with the majority on this question, but inasmuch as I have none, and not
      wishing to show any discourtesy in not accepting the invitation, I vote "no." 
     When the roll-call was completed the result was announced as above recorded. 
    
    
     APPROVAL OF THE MINUTES.
     
     
      On Motion of Mr. SELLERS, the minutes of yesterday's proceedings were approved under
      the operation of the previous question by yeas 33, nays 17. The main question being ordered by
      yeas 30, nays 16. 
    
    
     THE GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE. 
     The PRESIDENT announced a message from the Governor, and reiterated, the announcement
      several times because a number of Senators desired recognition from the chair. He directed the
      Secretary to read it, and the Governor's biennial message to the General Assembly was
      read. 
     On motion by Mr. 
       WEIR
       WIER
      , 5,000 copies of the message were ordered printed.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     
     FEES AND SALARIES. 
     Mr. KENNEDY offered a resolution directing the Committee on Fees and Salaries to report a
      bill to reduce the fees and salaries of State and county officers. As a farmer, he was very
      much interested in the payment of taxes. "As a class, ' said he, "they pay
      two-thirds of the taxes directly anti the other one-third indirectly. At the rate we are going
      our taxes will be increased. Our State debts increasing at the rate of $37.20 a day.. At the
      close of the war, the Governor's salary was $3,000, and wheat sold at $2 a bushel and
      corn was $1 a bushel. Today, the Governor's salary is $8,000, and wheat is now 80 cents a
      bushel. His salary will buy more than four times as much as the salary of the Governor
      twenty-two years ago. It requires no more talent to fi11 that position now than it did then.
      It is time we were reducing these high salaries in general. The janitor of thee State Building
      over yonder gets $1,800 for sweeping. The people have the taxes to pay." 
     Mr. ZIMMERMAN moved to amend so that fees and salaries of county officers be paid according
      to duties and population, and Mr. Kennedy accepted the amendment. 
     Mr. FOWLER hoped the resolution would be passed unanimously. 
     
     
     It was adopted by yeas 38, nays 0.
    
    
      BILLS FOR ACTS WERE INTRODUCED BY 
     Mr. McDonald, of Whitley, [S.17:] To establish and maintain the Indiana Soldiers" and

     VOTE FOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR.
      A message was received from the House of Representatives inviting the Senate to the Hall of
      the House on Monday, next at 10 o'clock, a. m., to witness the opening and publishing of
      the votes cast for Lieutenant Governor at the last election. 
     Mr. BAILEY moved that the message from the House be laid on the table. 
     Mr. WINTER : There are Constitutional provisions to be carried out in connection, with the
      counting of the vote cast for Governor, and Lieutenant Governor. We took an oath that we would
      support the Constitution of the State of Indiana and the Constitution requires that the vote
      far Lieutenant Governor shall be opened and  published in
      the presence of both Houses of the General Assembly by the Speaker of the House of
      Representatives. 
      The PRESIDENT pro tempore : What Section of the Constitution is that? I think there is no
      such Section and no such provision in the Constitution.
     Mr. WINTER [resuming:] For the information of the Senator I will endeavor to find the
      Section. It is section 130 of the Revised Statutes. [Reads.] There is a plain, mandatory
      provision of the Constitution, which, under our oaths as Senators, we ought not to evade,
      requiring us to attend in the House of Representatives and witness the count and publication
      of the votes cast for Lieutenant Governor. The House of Representatives, preparatory thereto
      in a proper manner, has adopted a resolution, and transmitted that resolution to its proper
      officer, inviting the Senate to attend a joint convention for that purpose. It would be
      presumed by the people of the State of, Indiana ----
     Mr. FRENCH: [interrupting:] I rise to a point of order. I don't think a motion to the
      table is debatable. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The point of order is sustained. Call the roll.
     
     The motion to lay on the table was agreed yeas 30, nays 19.
      Mr. GRIFFITH offered the following resolution and on its adoption demanded the previous
      question.
     
     
     
      
       
        Resolved, That in the judgment of this no election of Lieutenant Governor State of
         Indiana can be legally held at the times prescribed in the Constitution of said State,
         namely: at the time and place of electing members of the General Assembly in the year 1852,
         and every four years thereafter, and that, therefore., there was no vacancy in the office
         of Lieutenant Governor,at or prior to the last November election which could have been
         filled by the election of a Lieutenant Governor at that election, and for that reason it
         respectfully declines to be present at or witness any count of any pretended vote for
         Lieutenant Governor of Indiana in the year 1886. 
       
      
     
     The PRESIDENT put the question and declared the motion carried by a viva voce vote, amid
      much confusion and noise, with for recognition by the Chair, and for "division."
     Mr. DEMOTTE and others demanded a division. 
     The PRESIDENT : I didn't hear you. 
     Mr. DEMOTTE:[His words were not heard by this Reporter because of the noise.] 
     Mr. PRESIDENT: The Senator will take his seat. Will the Senator take his seat? 
     Mr. DEMOTTE: Presently--yes.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.:The Doorkeeper will seat the Senator. Seat Senator DeMotte. Put him
      in his seat. 
     Mr. HUSTON: I am satisfied the Chair did not understand when the call for a division was
      made. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: I did not.
      Mr. HUSTON: We now ask for a division. We recognize the fact that we are in the minority
      here, but we sincerely trust that the majority will give us no what minorities have received
      in the past. We hope to receive that much: 
     Mr. FOWLER: I hope this division will be had. I asked for a division myself; and while there
      are important reasons for a division of, the question, it was for a division of the vote I
      asked, and I trust that will be accorded. 
     The PRESIDENT: I understood it was a division of the resolution that was called for. What
      you want is a division as to whether the Senate will second the demand for the previous
      question. Those who favor seconding the demand for the previous question, will stand up and
      remain standing until the chair counts them. 
     
     
     The demand was seconded--affirmative 29, negative 17. 
     
     The Main. question was ordered by yeas 31, nays 19, and under its operations the resolution
      was adopted by yeas 30, nays 19. 
     The Senate adjourned--yeas 29, nays 19--till Tuesday morning at 10 o'clock.
    

   
   
   
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
    
     FRIDAY, January 7, 1887.
    
    The House met at 10 o'clock, a. m., Speaker Sayre in the chair. 
    Prayers were offered by J. H. O. Smith, Indiana Christian Missionary Evangelist.
     Mr. BUCKLES offered the following:
    
    
    
     
      
        Resolved, That the following rules and the rules of the last House not in conflict
        therewith, be adopted for the government of this House until otherwise ordered:
       
         The Speaker shall appoint a Committee on Elections to be
         composed of nine members, and it shall be the duty of that committee to examine report upon
         the certificates and other credentials of the members returned, and to consider all
         petitions, documents, protests and evidence, relating to elections which may be referred to
         them by the House, and said committee shall have authority to send for persons and papers
         without the further order of the House, and shall have authority to sit during the sessions
         of the House, without further leave, and attend at any place in this State to take
         testimony, or authorize any portion of such committee so to do. 
       
       The Committee on Elections shall have the right to report at any time
        on the right of a member to his seat by presenting their, report to the House, and upon such
        report being offered it shall be out of order for a member speaking on any matter to
        continue, or for the call of the House to continue, or to do any other business whatever
        until such report is disposed of, and the report of such committee shall be hold to be a
        question of the highest privilege, and may be called up at any time by any member of the
        committee, and when called up the action of the House and all proceedings thereon shall be
        the same as if said report had been called up, as provided in Rule 2. 
       
         As soon as the journal of any day is disposed of the Speaker shall call the
          Committee on Elections, and shall immediately recognize the chairman or
         member of said Committee making report, who may report or call up for consideration any
         contest  which may have been reported by said
         Committee, or a majority thereof, and such contest shall be pending before the House, when
         so called up, and the member so calling up such report shall be entitled to hold the floor
         after calling up any contest and address the House thereon for one hour, unless the
         previous question shall be sooner ordered. The previous question being ordered shall bring
         the House to a vote upon a11 questions pending in such contest, and no motion to take a
         recess, to adjourn, or to fix a day to which the House shall adjourn shall be in order
         until such, contest shall have been determined by the House. In case any contest shall be
         determined under the operation of the previous question, no motion shall be made, except, a
         motion to reconsider any vote, so taken and the previous question shall at once attach to
         such motion to reconsider, and no motion shall be in order except to lay the motion to
         reconsider upon the table, which motion or motions shall be put to a vote without debate. 
         Any standing rule or order of the House may be rescinded, chanced or suspended
         without previous notice upon a majority vote of the House, and a motion for such purpose
         shall be in order at any time and have precedence aver all other business except a report
         or the e consideration of a report from the Committee on
         Elections.
         No person except members of the General Assembly and its officers, and members
         of the Executive and Judicial Departments of the State, shall be admitted upon the floor of
         the House without consent of the Speaker.
       
      
     
    
    Mr. BUCKLES asked the Clerk to insert a word, and then moved the previous question. 
    Mr. JEWETT: I move that when this House adjourn to-day it adjourn to meet on Monday at 2
     o'clock.
     The SPEAKER: The motion is out of order. 
    Mr. JEWETT: I rise to a point of order. A motion to adjourn takes precedence over other
     business. Any member may move that the House now adjourn, and that must be disposed of before
     the demand for the previous question.
     The SPEAKER: I feel constrained to call the gentleman to order. The gentleman did not rise
     to a question of order until after the motion for the previous question had been seconded. The
     question is: "shall the main question now, be put?"
    Mr. JEWETT: Does the Chair entertain the motion to fix the time to adjourn?
     The SPEAKER: The question is: "shall the main question be now put on the adoption of
     the resolution?" 
    Mr. JEWETT: I ask the Chair to state for my information what disposition he shall make of my
     motion?
    The SPEAKER: The chair has stated that the gentleman is not now in order, and felt
     constrained to call him to order. 
    Mr. JEWETT: From that decision I desire to a appeal. 
    The SPEAKER: The appeal is too late, the House having passed upon the main question. The
     question now is upon the adoption of the resolution. 
    Mr. KELLISON asked to have the resolution re-read,. which the Speaker refused to order unless
     demanded by the House. From this decision Mr. Kellison appealed. 
    Mr. JEWETT: The gentleman from Marshall has stated that he, did not understand, the full
     purport of the resolution.. The reading of the resolution for his information is a question of
     the highest moment. We are bound to presume that every member of this body acts in good faith.
     This is a presumption that I hope to entertain for some days yet. 
    The yeas and nays were demanded.
     Pending the call--
    Mr. GORDON said : I desire to explain my vote. The question as I understand is on an appeal
     from the decision of the: Chair, and the decision of the Chair as I understand it is that this
     House is not entitled to hear the reading of the resolution. There was a little while ago a
     paper read at this desk. The mover of that resolution admitted that it was not as he wanted it,
     and wanted the Reading Clerk to change it. By the fact that he asked the privilege of amending
     that resolution he admitted that he had not written it as be wanted it. Any member has the
     right to demand the reading of any resolution.
     The SPEAKER: I feel constrained to call the gentleman to order it he is going to debate the
     question instead of voting. If the gentleman wants to explain why he votes one way or the other
     he may do so.
     Mr. GORDON: I will try, to confine my self to the question. We do not know but what the
     gentleman has made another mistake and inserted a word where he did not intend it. I would like
     to have the resolution read. I vote "no." 
    Mr. HARRELL I desire to explain my vote. 
    Mr. LINCK: Explanations are only allowed by general consent.
     The SPEAKER : I am not quite certain myself what the rule may be. I would not feel like
     refusing a member the right to briefly explain his vote. I will state at the explanation must
     be brief. 
    Mr. HARRELL : The reason why I vote as 1 shall is, I do not understand, the resolution. All
     the gentleman from Marshall (Mr. Kellison) asked that the resolution be read for, was because
     he did not understand it. I doubt it there are two members of the House who can say that they
     understand it. Where a member does not fairly understand the matter before the House it should
     be read. I vote "no." 
    Mr. JEWETT: I desire to explain my vote. Were this an ordinary occasion I should vote to
     sustain the Chair. If this resolution had not been so complicated as to be difficult of
     understanding, and had not been so altered after it was read that I do not know what it
     contains, I should vote to sustain the Chair. But as it is I am constrained to vote, and do
     vote," no." 
    Mr. KELLISON: I desire to explain my vote. Because the request made in is case was made in
     the utmost good faith; because the adoption of the roles for the government of this body is a weighty matter and not to be treated
     lightly; because I have never yet heard the right of a member to have a resolution read for his
     information questioned. It was made in good faith, absolutely for the purpose of getting
     information and for the purpose of understanding its provisions. The authority which I hold in
     my hand (Roberts' Rules of Order) provides that where a member asks for the reading of a
     paper for his information and not for delay, the Chair should order it re-read, I vote
     a"no."
    Mr. PATTON: I would. sustain the Speaker in this matter if the Speaker had adopted
     interlining of the resolution, but I did not catch that, and as the member is a democrat and
     asks to have the resolution read for his Information I believe the leniency of the Speaker
     ought to go out and be extended to him. I vote "no." 
    
    
    The vote resulted, yeas 53, nays 43. So the decision of the Chair was sustained by the
     House.
    Mr. GORDON: I desires to make a motion.
    The SPEAKER: We are acting under a previous question.
     Mr. GORDON: I move to lay this resolution on the table. 
    The SPEAKER: That motion I understand to be in order.
    The yeas and nays were demanded and the calling of the roll began.
    Mr. GORDON : I make the motion and for the motion for this reason---
    The SPEAKER [interrupting:] It is improper for the gentleman to state the reason making the.
     motion.
    Mr. GORDON : I stand corrected, and to my reasons as briefly as possible. If I can't
     have the resolution re-read I vote it lay it on the table so everybody can read it. I vote
     "aye." 
    Mr. GOUGH: Because I do not believe methods of obstruction being adopted here this morning I
     vote "no." . 
    Mr. JEWETT: For the reason that I believe this matter should be understood by the entire
     membership of the House before it is voted upon, as we have no rules for the government of this
     House, and because I have the utmost confidence in the Committee of Rules of
     which the Chair is the an chairman I vote 'aye." 
    
    The vote resulted-yeas 42, nays 55. So the motion to lay on the table was rejected.
    The SPEAKER: The question is upon op on of the resolution. 
    Messrs. Gordon and Jewett demanded the and nays.
    Mr. KELLISON, when his name was called, said: I desire to explain my vote. Being a member of
     the Committee on Rules I was engaged until a late hour with the Speaker and
     three other members of this House in preparing rules for the government of this House, and
     there was little difference of opinion in this committee except upon one question, and that was
     not mentioned in this resolution. I believe these rules were concocted at the midnight hour
     last night. They are absolutely infamous and destructive of the rights of the minority. I vote
     "no." 
    Mr. WEYAND : Believing that the rights of the minority should not be abridged too much I vote
     "no. "
    
    
    The vote resulted--yeas 55, nays 43. So the resolution was adopted. 
    A motion to reconsider was tabled. 
    Mr. JEWETT: Inasmuch as this is now the decision of the House may we not have it read now so
     we may know its scope? 
    Mr. PATTON: I object to the reading of the resolution and call attention to the special
     order. 

    
     THE GOVERNORS' MESSAGE
     The SPEAKER:I wish now to lay before the House a message from the Governor, transmitting to
      the House his message for whatever disposition you, wish to makes of it. 
     Mr. KELLISON: I move that it be read by the clerk. 
     Mr. THOMPSON moved to amend by providing for the appointment of a committee of two to notify
      the Senate of the reception of the message, and that the Senate be invited to be present when
      the same should be read. 
     Mr. KELLISON: If this is offered as an amendment I accept the amendment. 
     Mr. REYNOLDS: I move to amend the amendment by laying the message on the table and having
      1,000 copies printed and laid on the desks of the members. 
     Mr. KELLISON : I have no particular objection to the printing of this message, but I think
      that the members of this House ought, to be informed at the earliest possible moment of the
      contents of this message. I think this amendment ought not to prevail. at this time. After the
      message has been read. to the Houser it can be printed. We ought to bear the message read at
      once, so I move to lay the amendment to the amendment on the table. 
     The motion was rejected. 
     Mr. JEWETT: The question I presume is upon the amendment by the gentleman from Wayne. (Mr.
      Reynolds.) It seems to me there can be but one opinion on this amendment and that is, that the
      amendment ought not to prevail. Its effect would be hurtful on the House of Representatives.
      The Governor has by his messenger placed his message before this House, and it seems to me
      that its consideration is a question of the highest importance. Who would wish it said of us,
      that when the Governor sends in to us recommendations in writing that we refused to hear them
      read? It has been suggested, Mr. Speaker, that the amendment does not contemplate its lying on
      the table until 1,000 copies be printed. 
     Mr. REYNOLDS : The intention of my motion was that we have 1,000 copies printed and laid
      upon the tables and pass it over without reacting. The reading seems to me unnecessary.
      Mr. DUNN : I would like to ask if this not an unusual way of. proceeding ? We were to meet
      here at 10.30 .o'clock to hear the Governor's message, but we understand that the
      Senate has reconsidered that agreement, and has concluded, not to meet us here. We are, ready
      to receive them with open arms.; and we are ready to receive the Governor here.I do not
      under-[stand]  [under]-stand that we are treating him or
      the Senate with disrespect. 
     Mr. GROSE: We do not know what the Senate is doing. We should not be drawn from our duty by
      anything that comes from across the hall. We should go along in the beaten path and bear the
      message. 
     Mr. THOMPSON : The skirmishing here this morning prevented us from taking up the matter at
      the right time. It has always been the practice for the two Houses to meet together and hear
      the message. 
     Mr. LINCK: I shall oppose the motion to lay the message on the table and have it printed.
      And at present I shall oppose the last amendment. 
     Mr. KELLISON : I move to indefinitely postpone the amendment to the amendment. 
     The SPEAKER : Allow me to suggest. Would not a vote upon the amendment directly reach the
      same result just as quick? 
     Mr. KELLISON: I have no objection.
      The amendment to the amendment was rejected.
      Mr. GRIFFITHS: I move to lay the amendment of the gentleman from Elkhart (Mr. Thomson) on
      the table. 
     The ayes and noes were demanded and the roll-call proceeded. 
     Mr. JEWETT : In explanation of my vote I desire to say : The Governor in this case has
      communicated with each House separately. The lnvitation of the House for Senate to come here
      and hear it read would be as fruitless as for them to come here and bear any of our bills
      read. I vote "aye." 
     Mr. PATTON : I desire to explain my vote. Believing that the Governor and Senate both should
      be here I vote "no." 
     Mr. SCHLEY : For the reason that the carrying of this motion to the table carries the whole
      subject matter, to the table, I vote "no." 
     The SPEAKER : That is not the rule since the rules of this morning Were adopted. 
     
     
     The vote resulted--yeas 42, nays 55. So the motion was rejected. 
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION. 
     The Speaker announced the Committee on Elections as follows Messrs.
      Kercheval,Linck, Gardiner, Griffiths, Dunn, Clark, Carrick, Cushman and Bertram. 
     Mr. GARDINER: I understand that on vested day a committee was appointed to wait, upon the
      Governor and inquire if he had any communication to make to this House, and that committee
      reported that the Governor had fixed the hour at 10.30 this morning for us to listen to his
      message to the General Assembly. I have never heard the reason why the Governor did not come
      here this morning to perform that office, but on the contrary he sends about that time
      messenger with what is assumed to he his regular message to the General Assembly. It seems to
      me that it would be contrary to the dignity of this House for us. to hear this message read by
      the Clerk. We have exhausted all questions of courtesy in this matter. We are, I think, to
      assume that when be answered our committee fixing the hour that he would attend in this Hall
      to deliver his message to the two Houses in joint, convention he sent a similar communication
      to the Senate. The amendment of the gentleman from Elkhart (Mr. Thompson) should be voted
      down. 
     Mr. JEWETT: I agree with the gentleman from Daviess (Mr. Gardiner) that there is no reason
      for the presence of the Senate because a copy (of course they ate just the same) has been
      transmitted to the Senate. Courtesy, I should think, would demand that the message be read,
      although the reading is not usually a matter of importance, because it is afterward printed
      and referred to a committee. I am informed that at times the Executive transmits his message
      by a messenger, and at other times he does us the honor to come and read the message himself.
      This House has now in its possession, on the Speaker's table, the biennial message of the
      Governor, transmitted by his Executive messenger. The President of the United States
      ,uniformly communicates to the National House in this manner. 
     Mr. GORDON: The arguments of the gentleman from Daviess (Mr. Gardiner) seems to be
      predicated on the ground that the precedents are the other way. It seems to me, under the
      surroundings and the occurrences of this day, that argument should have but little force. The
      time, and occasion for diverging from old precedents and methods has come. In this new State
      House we ought to have such rules and precedents as will be reasonable and according to common
      sense. I am of opinion that simple questions of courtesy ought not to stand in our way. This
      is much more in keeping with the spirit of the times than to adhere to the old method, that
      probably had its origin in the desire to give some Governor a chance to make a speech. 
     Mr. PATTON: I was in favor of inviting the Senate here, also of hearing this message read;
      but I care nothing about it. I suppose it is due to the Governor to say that he would have
      been here had be had a joint convention to read his message to: but I apprehend that he had
      been headed off by a cowardly Senate, that has not the manhood to appear here with its
      majority. I do not understand that it would be a compliment to Governor Gray to have his
      message read here to-day in the absence of the Senate, but I believe he would have considered
      it a privilege and an honor have come here and read, his message to a joint convention of both
      Houses.
      Mr. MAJOR: I do not mean to cast any reflection or show any disrespect to the Governor. I
      think that it the Senate had come over here to hear that message, that the Governor would have
      come here read it. I do not think it any respect to the Governor to read it here now.
      The amendment was rejected, as was also the original motion. 
     On motion of Mr. GARDINER, the Governor's message was laid on the table.
    
    
     LABOR AND LABOR STATISTICS.
      Mr. COX, of Miami, offered a resolution for the appointment of a standing committee of
      seven, to be known as the Committee  on
       Labor. The number was increased to nine and the resolution adopted.
    
    
     NEW PROPOSITIONS

        That the Doorkeeper of the House of Representatives be authorized to buy and appoint
         thirteen assistants in addition to those already provided by law. 
       
      
     
     Mr. KERCHEVAL moved the adoption of the resolution.
     Mr. JEWETT moved to postpone further consideration until Monday, at 2 p. m. 
     Mr. JEWETT withdrew, his motion and the resolution laid over under the rule.
    
    
      VOTES FOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. 
     The SPEAKER announced that he had received from the Secretary of State the returns of the
      late election for Lieutenant Governor, and that by virtue of the authority vested in him be
      would, on Monday at 10.30 open and proceed to count the votes, and would invite the Senate to
      be present at that time. 
     Mr. GARDINER introduced a resolution inviting the Senate to be present at the counting of
      this vote, as follows:
     
     
     
      
       

         Whereas, The Speaker of the House has received from the Secretary of State the official
         returns of the vote for Lieutenant Governor: therefore, be it 
        Resolved, That the Clerk of the House be directed to notify the Senate that a Joint
         Session for the canvass of said returns be held on Monday, January: 10, at half ten
         o'clock a. m,. and the Senate is invited to attend said Joint Session. 
       
      
     
     The resolution was adopted and the clerk was instructed to notify the Senate. 
    
    
     AN EXTRA CLERK.
     Mr. BUCKLES presented the following resolution: 
     
     
     
      
       
        Resolved, That the Committee on Elections be allowed to appoint a
         clerk for themselves for such a time as his services may be needed. 
       
      
     
     Mr. JEWETT made an ineffectual motion to postpone until 2 o'clock p.m. on Monday next. 
     Mr. FLEECE made an ineffectual motion to adjourn. 
     Mr. JEWETT made an ineffectual motion to lay the resolution on the table. 
     
     Mr. JEWETT made an ineffectual motion that the House do now adjourn.--Yeas 41, nays 56 
     Mr. KELLISON moved to refer the resolution to a committee of three, with instructions to
      report on Monday next at 10 o'clock a. m. 
     
     
     On motion by Mr. SCOTT--yeas 60, nays 37--this motion was laid on the table.
     Mr. GORDON made an ineffectual motion to indefinitely postpone the further conderation of
      the resolution.
      The resolution (for an extra clerk) was adopted. 
     The House adjourned until 10 o'clock Monday.
    
   
   
   
   
    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
    
    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    IN SENATE.
    
     Monday, January, 10, 1887.
    
    The Senate was not in session to-day.
   
   
   
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
    
     Monday, January, 10, 1887.
    
    The Speaker called the House to order at 10.30 o'clock.
    The session was opened with prayer by E.J. Gantz, pastor of the Central Christian Church of
     Indianapolis.
    The SPEAKER: The Senators are here. The hour for canvassing the vote for Lieutenant Governor,
     according to the Constitution, having arrived I will now, in the presence of the House and
     Senate, proceed to open and count the vote of Nov. 2, 1886.
    Mr. KELLISON: I desire to offer a resolution pertinent to the matter now before the
     House.
    The SPEAKER (interrupting:) The Clerk will take the vote as I announce it.
    Mr. HARRELL: I desire to protest.
    Mr. KELLISON: I rise to the point of order.
    The SPEAKER: The gentleman are out of order, and I shall require them to keep their
     seats.
    The SPEAKER called the vote of the counties, at the conclusion of which----
    The SPEAKER (interrupting:) The gentleman is out of order until the business before the House
     is concluded.
    Mr. JEWETT: I will sit down because the Speaker says so.
    Mr. GORDON: I desire to call the attention of the Speaker to one thing----
    The SPEAKER (interrupting:) The gentleman is out of order until the matter before the House
     is disposed of.
    Mr. GORDON: I simply want to remind the Speaker that the journal of the House had not been
     read, which is the first thing in order.

    Mr. PATTON: I suggest that three Democratic members be appointed to assist the Speaker. 
    The SPEAKER: The gentleman is out of order until we conclude the business before the
     convention. I will announce the result of the vote: Robert S. Robertson, 232,916: John C.
     Nelson, 229,593; Edward S. Pope 3,118; Jesse M. Gale, 8,105; N. P. Engle,1. Robert S. Robertson
     having received a majority of the votes cast. I now declare him duly elected Lieutenant
     Governor of the state of Indiana. The oath will be now administered by Judge Walker. 
    A The oath of office having been taken--
    The SPEAKER said: I have now the honor and pleasure of presenting to you the Lieutenant
     Governor, Robert S. Robertson
    [Mr. Robertson took the gavel and attempted to preserve order. 
    Mr. JEWETT: I rise to a point of order.
    The Lieutenant Governor-elect: The gentleman is out of order. 
    Mr. JEWETT: I know that this person, whether he is Lieutenant Governor or not has no
     authority to preside over the House of Representatives. It seems that we have two presiding
     officers. He (Robertson) has no authority to preside over this House. [Applause.] I do not care
     if he is Lieutenant Governor of all the States in the Union, he has no authority to preside
     over this House. 
    A member: I protest against it. [Applause. ] 
    A member : This is cowardly, and as a Representative I protest.
    Mr. GORDON: I want to say, Mr. Speaker,I want to say there is no quorum an this floor.
     (Applause and hisses.)
     Mr. MAJOR: I move that the gallery be cleared.
     The Lieutenant Governor-elect : The gentleman. will take his seat.
    
     Mr. Robertson than began reading as follows: 
    
    
    
     
      
        Senators and Representatives of the General Assembly:
       Having been elected by the people of this State to the office of Lieutenant Governor, and
        so declared by the tribunal and officer charged with that power and duty by the
        Constitution, I enter upon and assume the duties of the office with a keen appreciation of
        the responsibilities devolving upon me, but with the firm resolve to discharge those duties
        without fear or favor, so far as lies within my own weak powers so to do. It should be
        recognized that wise counsel, mature deliberation and cool judgment should govern us in all
        acts which pertain to the public welfare; that the upholding of the Constitution, the laws
        and the dignity of our great Commonwealth, and the rights of the people thereunder, should
        be the paramount aim of every officer of the three independent departments of our State
        government, and the ambition of no individual should be permitted to have precedence over
        the least of the rights of the people, in the choice of their officers, or the management of
        their affairs.
       Entertaining these views, my aim shall be to so discharge the duties of the office to
        which the people, in the exercise of their prerogative, have chosen me, that not only their
        verdict but my own conscience may approve my course.
       Seeking no controversy, I shall shun no responsibility in endeavoring th perform the
        duties of the office, within the rules of the Constitution and the laws of the State, ever
        looking for guidance to do the right, believing that "He is thrice armed Who has his
        quarrel just."
       To these ends I invoke your counsel and assistance, and your charity for faults and
        short-comings.
       I now declare this convention adjourned to meet in this hall at 12 o'clock p.m., on
        Wednesday, the 19th day of January inst., to discharge the duties devolving upon it by the
        act of Congress relating to and providing for the election of United States Senator.
      
     
    
    Pending the reading--
    Mr. JEWETT said: I want to say that this minority will never sacrifice its rights and allow a
     Lieutenant Governor to preside over the House of Representatives
    Mr. PATTON (the Lieutenant Governor-elect still reading): We have recognized no joint
     convention by roll-call. I say this House has never recognized, and they have a right
     to--[Applause, cheers, hisses. Cries of "Louder" and "Sit Down."] The
     minority will not recognize the gentleman. [Cheers and hisses.] It makes no difference to me
     whether this man is Lieutenant Governor or not, he has no right to preside over this House. If
     the Republican men of this body want to stop this disgraceful proceeding, let them stop that
     unconstitutional proceeding (pointing at Mr. Robertson.)

    Mr. JEWETT also interrupted the reading by saying: We will not listen to the reading of that
     communication or any remarks. 
    When the Lieutenant Governor elect fished his reading, and announced the convention
     adjourned--
    The SPEAKER called the House to order.
    Mr. GARDINER : I move that this House do now adjourn. 
    The yeas and nays were demanded. 
    Mr. GORDON : I protest. The Constitution gives every man the right to protest. Have I not the
     right to protest? 
    The SPEAKER: The motion is a motion to adjourn. 
    Mr. JEWETT : I rise to a point of order. The point I make is this--that a motion to adjourn
     cannot be in order until a call of the House has been had to show whether there is a quorum
     present or not. 
    Mr. GORDON: I rise to a point of order. 
    The SPEAKER: The roll-call is pending. 
    Mr. GORDON: I desire to make a point of order. 
    The SPEAKER: The gentleman is out of order, and the roll-call will proceed. The gentleman
     from Orange is and will be required to vote under the law and under the rules. The demand for
     the yeas and nays shows they were demanded by the, gentleman from Cass [Mr. Cox.] The Clerk
     will mark him present and not voting. The record will show the same for the gentleman. from
     Allen [Mr. Darroch.] 
    Mr. FOSTER: I desire to explain my vote. I can see--- 
    The SPEAKER(interrupting): The chair is of the opinion that an explanation of a vote on a
     motion to adjourn is not admissible. 
    Mr. FOSTER: I vote "no." 
    The SPEAKER: Is the gentleman from Putnam [Mr. Gordon] present? Having joined in the demand
     for the yeas and nays the record will show the gentleman present and not voting, and the same
     as to Mr. Jewett. 
    
    
    The vote resulted--yeas,59, nays 22. 
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     Mr. GARDINER: I have the credentials of the member from Porter county.
     The Representative [Mr. Barnard] was sworn in.
     Mr. HARRELL: I desire to enter a protest against the manner of counting the vote for
      Lieutenant Governor. I wish to protest against the proceedings this morning, and I ask time to
      reduce the same to writing.
     The SPEAKER: That will, as a utter of course, be granted. 
    
    
     PERSONAL EXPLANATION.
      Mr. JEWETT: I rise to a personal explanation. During the morning session of this House (if
      the proceedings are to be characterized or dignified by the term of a session) a scene
      occurred for which I trust no occasion will ever again arise, and as I myself, took some
      important part wish to state precisely the reason and to say that no disrespect was intended
      to the Speaker of this House. The Speaker will  remember
      that until the vote had been counted, and until the gentleman had been declared Lieutenant
      Governor had ascended the Speaker's stand and required the House to come to order. I
      remained silent, and was silent because I did not regard the canvass of the vote of any
      importance. Personally I have always believed that the gentleman who took the oath office, if
      there was a vacancy in that office to be filled at the last general election would, if there
      had been no canvass at all, have been as much entitled to the office.I merely desired when I
      rose at this lime to protest against the Speaker of canvassing the returns in the presence of
      the House alone, while the Senate was not present. When the gentleman who took the gavel from
      you attempted to preside over the House of Representatives, for the first time I attempted to
      interrupt his proceedings. 
    
    
     THE CLERK'S MINUTES.
      The SPEAKER: The journal of Friday not having been read at the morning session, it will be
      read now. 
     The reading was begun. 
     Mr. GARDINER: I move that the further, reading of the journal be dispensed with. 
     Mr. HARRELL: I object. I do not know and the members of this House do not know and cannot
      know whether the journal is correct as to their votes. 
     Mr. GORDON: At this preliminary stage we ought to know how this journal is made up. It is
      important that we know that this journal is correct in every particular. The journal has not
      once been read in the hearing of this House. I put implicit confidence in the honesty of the
      Clerk, but we would like, occasionally, to have the privilege of hearing it read. 
     Mr. GARDINER: There is no disposition on my part to prevent the reading of the journal,
      except this afternoon. I think it is customary to have the journal read in the morning. It is
      hard to tell whether it contains more than half of the proceedings that have taken place here,
      and I hope it does not contain more than one-half of what has taken place here this morning. 
     The motion was rejected and the reading of the journal continued until-- 
     On motion of Mr. PATTON, the further reading was dispensed with.
     Mr. VAN SLYKE introduced a bill [H. R. 13,] providing for the exemption of certain property
      from taxation. 

    

    
     VOTE FOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR.
      Mr. JEWETT introduced the following:
     
     
     
      
       
         Whereas, at the general election held Nov. 4, 1884, Mahlon D. Manson was elected
         Lieutenant Governor of this State, and afterward qualified and discharged the duties of
         such office, and, 
        Whereas, Prior to the last. general election, Nov. 2,1886., said Mahlon D. Manson had
         ceased to be Lieutenant Governor of this state ; and, 
        Whereas, At the general election Nov. 2, 1886, the electors of Indiana voted for
         candidates for the office of Lieutenant Governor , and Robert S. Robertson, a citizen of
         this State and eligib1e to said office,received the highest number of votes for said and
         has been declared alerted thereto by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and has
         taken the oath of office as Lieutenant Governor; and, 
        Whereas, The Senate of Indiana denies the right of said Robertson to act as Lieutenant
         Governor and to preside over the Senate, which refusal arises out of a claim by the Senate
         that at the last general election no vacancy existed in the office of Lieutenant Governor
         which could be filled at such election ; and, 
        Whereas, The question as to whether there was or was not a vacancy in the office of
         Lieutenant Governor that could be fi11ed at the last general election threatens to
         seriously endanger the welfare and of credit of the State and to hinder and prevent
         legislation at the prevent session of the General Assembly; therefore,
         Be it Resolved by the House of Representatives, the Senate concurring, That it is the
         sense of this General Assembly that such question is to the right of said Robert. S.
         Robertson to such office should be determined at the earliest day possible by the Supreme
         Court.2. That in order to secure a decision thereon a case should at ones made up which
         will fairly present such question, and that the same be forwarded with all possible
         despatch to a final decision. 3. That such case should limit the decision of the Supreme
         Court to the single question as to whether there was at the last General election any
         vacancy in the office of Lieutenant Governor which could be filled at such election; and
         that all questions as to the manner of canvassing the vote and declaring the result should
         be waived or admitted in favor of said Robertson.
       
      
     
      Mr. JEWETT: I do not desire to detain the House long on this matter. I call attention to
      the language of this resolution;--and I say to the members of the House and before God and my
      Country, that I have no object, purpose, or desire in its introduction except such as arise
      from what seems to me to be the highest dictates of patriotism and conscience. The power of
      the majority in this House is equal to anything, therefore in the preparation of this
      resolution I endeavored to state the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, I ask
      your attention to the. recital: At the general election held in 1884 Mahlon D. Manson was
      elected to Lieutenant Governor. Prior to the last general election Mahlon D. Manson had ceased
      to be Lieutenant Governor of Indiana, having accepted an office under the Federal Government.
      Robert S. Robertson, a citizen of this State and eligible to this office, received the highest
      number of votes cast last November for this office. Nobody disputes the eligibility of Mr.
      Robertson, or if there was a vacancy to be filled at that election,that he was elected. We
      know as a matter of common rumor that the Senate of this State has declared that it will not
      admit Mr. Robertson to preside over it. There are matters of doubt attached to this question
      of the election or  a Lieutenant Governor. It will not do
      to say that the Legislature will not settle it. Do you believe that the Senate will permit Mr.
      Robertson to preside over it ? Do you believe that nineteen Senators would think one way and
      all the thirty-one that are on other side would think the other way on a mere legal question?
      The Supreme Court is a proper tribunal to settle it: the Legislature cannot settle it. The
      journals of our own House will show, that the Senate was present and that a quorum of the
      House was present this morning. That the Legislature cannot settle it is evident from fact
      that to-day a joint convention was supposed to be held. At that time the Senate had adjourned
      and there were only nineteen Senators here. It was an open falsehood to say that the Senate
      was here. It is simply because there is no hope that will make any substantial progress while
      these things are undetermined, that they should be settled at once. The membership of the
      Senate is undetermined and membership of the House is undetermined. While these things are
      true nothing can be done for the strength and glory of the State. We have no means of knowing
      that Gov. Gray may die at any time within the next two years, and if this question is not
      settled what is there to prevent Auditor of State from convening the Senate to elect a
      Governor? In that case would have two men claiming the office of Lieutenant-Governor, and then
      we would have two men claiming to be Governor of Indiana, and out of that complications might
      arise which are appalling. The duty of every good citizen is to at once, if possible, find the
      truth of this matter. I am told there is a wide divergence of opinion among lawyers on this
      subject regardless of party. A consideration in favor of this resolution is that a decision
      would be reached the present week. When that question be reached within a week every
      consideration of decency demands that it be done.? How do I know that a decision could reached
      within a week ? Simply because I that when the matter was up, the lawyers and the Attorney
      General of the State argued the matter, and the Court is in possession of all the arguments
      that research and ingenuity could obtain. The Judges are as well prepared to decide it as were
      argued before them again for a month. The solitary question, is as to whether at the last
      election there was a vacancy that could be filled. If there was a vacancy you and I ought to
      know it, in order that, as good citizens, we way see that Mr. Robertson is inducted into the
      office. I said this much in support of this resolution because I believe that in this country
      we art too fast forgetting. that there higher duties than those of party, and because we are
      putting party above State and Country. I fear some gentleman on other side will be of the
      opinion that this resolution should not prevail. If there word in it that is not true I am
      willing to have it changed. If there is anything is not true let it be rejected. The passage
      of this resolution would take away the danger of a repetition of the disgraceful scenes that
      have passed, and prove to the world that the people of Indiana can govern themselves, and that
      law and the Constitution govern the people of Indiana.
      Mr. GARDINER: I would go as far as the gentleman in all that he bas been pleased to say
      about the demand for legislation.. I feel that this beautiful Hall should be, dedicated to the
      higher and nobler purposes of the interests of all the people of this State. While the
      gentleman was speaking with so much eloquence I could not help thinking that be was appealing
      to his partisan friends. I understood him to say that his resolution recited nothing but the
      fact,. and that it recited all the facts. As I remember the history of the last two months I
      think he is not arguing from all the facts. My recollection of the history of this matter is,
      that the Executive of this State required of the Attorney General his opinion as to whether,
      or not there was a vacancy in the office of Lieutenant Governor,--a vacancy that might be
      filled at that election---and that officer clothed with the duty of giving to the State of
      Indiana an opinion upon that subject, gave it as the law of the State that there was a
      vacancy. Soon after that the party in whose ranks the gentleman stands the high shining light,
      held its convention and proceeded to nominate a candidate. The Republicans also put in the
      field a candidate. In the mind of the majority of the people there was a vacancy to be filled.
      No question about there being no vacancy ever occurred, until after, the result had been
      telegraphed. If the question was ever raised before I never heard of it. It is true I live in
      a somewhat benighted portion of the state and do not get all the news, but I never heard this
      questioned. I never beard Democrat or Republican question it. This resolution is a little
      premature. We have no intelligence except as we get it by rumor that the Senate may not do its
      duty. We cannot presume but that they will do it. We must presume that they will act in
      accordance with the law as declared, by the Attorney General and the will and the wish of the
      people of this State as declared at the ballot box. I do not desire to prolong a discussion of
      this sort. 
     Mr. GOUGH: Let us go back to the motion for a few moments, and that is: Shall this House
      join with the Senate in passing this resolution to make up a case for the Supreme Court ? That
      is the question which we want to determine here to-day: and I think it is none of our
      business. What are the circumstances by which we are surrounded? We have seen a Lieutenant
      Governor sworn into his office. Is it not his duty under the law to preside over the Senate?
      It seems there is some doubt as to whether the Senate will admit him to preside. He is an
      executive officer of the government of the State and we are members of the legislative branch.
      The judicial branch is open and he may apply to the Supreme Court or any other court for his
      rights. We are sent here by the people to assist the other branch of the Legislature in the
      enactment of any laws we may think  just and proper. Al1
      we have to do is leave the Lieutenant Governor to get into his office just as other man gets
      into office. I confess that I would gladly do anything I could today to assist him except
      fight. I am not one of the fighting members. We have no assurance but that the Senate may
      admit him when he goes there to-morrow morning and induct him into office.
     Mr. FOSTER : The Attorney General is not Attorney General for the Democratic party but for
      the people of the state of Indiana, and I do not believe that there is any member, on this
      floor who would claim that he ever gave an opinion which was partisan in its nature. But he
      was liable to make a mistake upon that question the same as upon any other question. Let us
      pass this resolution and apply the remedy fixed by the Constitution. Whatever mistakes we make
      now will recoil upon us. 
     Mr. GRIFFITHS: I want to call attention, to the fact that the gentleman front Floyd (Mr.
      Jewett) is a prophet as well as a legislator: He-sets forth things that took place in this
      House to-day while his resolution was prepared yesterday evening.(Laughter.) If the things set
      forth are true they are true because of the obstructive policy of the Democratic party.
      Gentlemen on this side of the House cannot talk about the rights of the minority.; they are in
      no position to do anything of that kind. If rumor be true the rights of the minority in the
      other wing of this Capitol have been ignored and treated with disdain. I am opposed to this
      resolution, Mr. Speaker, for the reason that in accordance with the Constitutional injunction
      you announced that Mr. Robertson was elected Lieutenant Governor and the gavel was passed to
      him as Lieutenant Governor. Let him take that office, and then if any other man is entitled to
      that seat let him take the proper course. 
     Mr. PATTON: When the gentleman from Marion (Mr. Griffiths) got through I felt like saying
      "let us pray." [Laughter.] I do not feel like standing here to ask of the
      Republicans of this House any favors. I am not to favor of this resolution for the reason that
      I believe the Senate will be able to take care of itself. If you think that you can seat this
      Mr. Robertson I apprehend that you can do something that is an utter impossibility. I care
      nothing about, this question being submitted to the Courts. 
     Mr. SCOTT: The people of the State have rendered their verdict, and the appeal of the
      gentleman from Floyd (Mr. Jewett) will not avail. It has been rendered, and it will not be
      reversed. The Democratic party has gone back on its record time and time again, but never in
      such brief space of time as it has on this subject. The Attorney General of the State gave it
      as his opinion that a Lieutenant Governor was to be elected and then the Democratic party
      ought to, have made objection. The Republican party at that time seemed to be in the minority,
      but much to the surprise of the other party the Republican party was the victor.
      Mr. LINCK: This resolution comes with very bad grace from the other side of the House.
      Though his remarks are full of patriotism, the gentleman (Mr. Jewett) must expect to be looked
      upon with suspicion while his words and actions so strangely diverge. The party to which I
      belong, acted this morning with dignity, and decorum, but the gentleman saw in it most
      disgraceful scene. The party on the other side were ready for revolution which they had tried
      to start in the State, but they were foiled. The other side the House has declared there is no
      vacancy in the Lieutenant Governorship. When it will be for the benefit of his party the
      gentleman believes is placing all our interests in the keeping of the will of the people; but
      sir, when it is not for the advantage of his party, then the will of the people is to be
      trampled under foot. The paper which represents the party on the other side has advocated
      revolution, and has said the Democrats were willing to fight. We hope there will be no fight,
      but that this matter will be settled, and crimination and recrimination be stopped; but if
      fight we must, we will fight till we win. I am opposed to this resolution.
     Mr. GROSE: I am as anxious and willing to proceed with important legislation as any one. The
      other day when we informed the Executive of the State that we were ready for business, he told
      us he would be here the next day to deliver hie message to us, but when the time came be
      changed his mind and never came near. Then remember the howling that was set up here this
      morning while the Speaker of the House was discharging his duty that he had sworn he would
      perform under the Constitution as an officer of this House. The people see that Republicans
      love the Constitution and love to obey it. 
     Mr. GORDON: I know that the gentleman from Henry (Mr. Grose) does not intend to do th
      Executive of the State injustice, but I think it is substantive injustice to state that the
      Governor said he would be here and then changed his mind and did not come, for the Governor
      has not in any sense said he would be here to read his message. There is nothing unreasonable
      or unfair in the resolution before the House. There are many good Republican lawyers who think
      there was no vacancy to fill in the office of Lieutenant Governor. The Senate of the State of
      Indiana, was not this day in the hall of the House of Representatives, nor in the Senate
      chamber either.
     Mr. HARRELL : I submit to gentleman on the other side of the House the question whether or
      not to-day the law was not evaded when they, attempted to count and publish the vote for
      Lieutenant Governor; I think it, was in violation of law, and in violation of the
      Constitution.
     
     
      Mr. THOMPSON moved to lay, the resolution on the table, but withdrew it, and a vote was
      taken on, adopting the resolution, resulting--yeas 44, nays 54. 
     So the resolution was rejected, 
     Mr. FLEECE: I move we adjourn.
    
    
    
     CONTESTED ELECTION CASES.
      The SPEAKER: I would call the attention of the House to the fact that the Secretary of
      State, in pursuance to law, has in my hands the papers in three, contests, which, under the
      rules, will be refer to the Committee on Elections.
      [The contested election cases of Henry Englehart, contester vs. Robert L. Mackay,
      contestee: Decatur Downing., contestor, vs. John T. Beasley, contestee; Henry C. Dickerson,
      contestor, vs. Cornelius Meagher, contesstee.]
     Mr. GLOVER: I wish to introduce a resolution.
     Mr. JEWETT : I have a ball in my hand which I wish to introduce, but as it late and as this
      has been a hard session, and it has been mighty hard on this side of the House, I think we
      should adjourn.
      The SPEAKER : Read the resolution.
      The resolution (Mr. Glover's) provided for the reference to the Committee on
       Elections of the Beasley contest and giving authority to act in the matter,
      particularly in reference to the depositions in the hands of the justices of the peace.
      After some discussion of the rules the House adjourned till 10 o'c1ock to-morrow.

    The Senate met at 10 o'clock a.m. pursuant to as adjournment last Friday, President
     Smith,of Jennings, in the chair. 
    The session was opened with prayer by Rev. James McLeod, of the Second Presbyterian

     reading was dispensed with. 
    
     ELECTION OF UNITED STATES SENATOR.
     Mr. TRIPPETT offered the following resolution and demanded the previous question upon its
      adoption:
     
     
     
      
       
         Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the State of Indiana is hereby invited to
         convene with the Senate of the State of Indiana in Joint Assembly in the chamber of the
         Senate, on Wednesday, the nineteenth [19th] day of January, 1887, at twelve [12]
         o'clock meridian, for the purpose of reading the journal of each House of the number
         of votes cast for Senator in Congress upon the question for whom such House , voted for
         Senator in Congress, and if the same person has not received a majority of all the votes in
         each House then the Joint Assembly shall proceed to choose a Senator in Congress to succeed
         Benjamin Harrison, and that they convene with the Senate in the Senate chamber each
         succeeding day thereafter at 12 o'clock, meridian, during this session of the
         Legislature, for the purpose of voting as aforesaid, or until a Senator in Congress shall
         have been chosen, as provided by law. 
       
      
     
     Mr. WINTER : I rise to a point of order. The rules prescribe the daily order of business. 
     The PRESENT pro tem.: The point of order is not well-taken. The question is on seconding the
      demand for the previous question. It is ordered.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I demand a division. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: It comes too late. If you had demanded it at the proper time it
      would have been granted. 
     Mr. WINTER: It was made in time, but probably the Chair did not hear it because of the noise
      in the gallery. 
     Mr. WEIR: I think I can say it made in time, but because of the noise tho Chair did not hear
      it. 
     The PRESIDENT: It may be so. All in favor of seconding the demand for the previous question
      will stand up till counted. 
     
     The division resulted--affirmative 30: negative 19.
     
      The main question was ordered by yeas 30, nays 19. 
     
     The resolution was adopted by yeas 30, nays 19. 
    
    
     VOTE FOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. 
     Mr. DAVIS offered the following: 
     
     
     
      
       
        Whereas, On the 10th day of January, 1887, the Speaker, of the House of Representatives
         did, in the presence of the House and the Senators there assembled, open and publish the
         votes cast for Lieutenant Governor at the general election held November 2, 1886, as
         certified to him in due form of law by the Secretary of State of Indiana, which vote was as
         follows: 
        
         
          For John. C. Nelson
          ......
          229,593
         
         
          For Robert B. Robertson
          ...... 
          232, 916 
         
         
          For Edward S. Pope
          ...... 
          3,188
         
         
           For Jesse : N. Gall
          ......
          8, 105
         
         
          For N. P. Engle
          ......
          1 
         
        
        That thereupon the Speaker of the House announced that Robert S. Robertson had received
         the highest number of votes cast for Lieutenant Governor at said election, and thereupon
         the Speaker proclaimed Robert S. Robertson duly and legally elected to that office: 
        That thereupon Hon. Lewis C. Walker, Judge of the Supreme Court of Marion County,
         Indiana, duly administered to Robert Robertson the oath of office in manner and form
         following:
        
        
         
          
           " State of Indiana, Marion county
           " I, Robert S. Robertson, do solemnly swear that I will support the Constitution
            of the United States and the constitution of State of Indiana, and that I will
            faithfully discharge the duties of the office of Lieutenant Governor of the State of
            Indiana to which I have been elected.
           
            "ROBERT S. ROBERTSON."
           
          
         
        
        
         
          
           Subscribed and sworn to before me this 10th day of January, 1887, in the joint session
            of the Senators and Representatives.
           ",LEWIS C. WALKER, Judge Superior Court Marion
             co.,Indiana."
          
         
        
       
      
     
     Mr. DAVIS: I move that the above preamble and oath of office of Lieutenant Governor-elect
      Robertson be spread upon the journal of the Senate. 
     Mr. MCDONALD, of Whitley : I contend that every Democratic lawyer of
      note, and every Republican lawyer at the bar in Indiana, recognized the fact that there, was
      no election of Lieutenant Governor at the last election; they recognized the fact that there
      was no necessity for such election, and they recognized that for such election there was no
      warrant in the Constitution. Upon that ground we stand, and we are willing to have the Courts
      settle this matter. We do not propose that any man shall dose as a political martyr in this
      case. We want this question decided, that the people may know who is de jure or de facto
      Lieutenant Governor. It can be settled in five or six days and to the decision of the Court we
      will submit. 
     Mr. DAVIS: I call attention to Section 18, Article V, of the Constitution of the State of
      Indiana, [Reads] and I want to ask if the Senator does not know that a reputable and able
      Democratic lawyer, the Attorney General of the State of Indiana, did not construe this
      particular section of the Constitution as giving ample warrant, and authority for the election
      of a Lieutenant Governor to fill the place made vacant by the acceptance of a Federal
      appointment by Lieutenant Governor Manson; and does he not know that the Democratic Governor,
      himself an able lawyer, acting upon that advice, and the whole Democratic party of the State
      of Indiana, acting upon that exposition of the Constitution, did accept that construction as
      the law of the land and all other parties and peoples of the State of Indiana voted upon that
      expounding? 
     Mr. MCDONALD: In the first place I received more than fifty letters
      stating as the opinion of the writers that no election of Lieutenant Governor was necessary;
      and I had a conversation with the President of the Senate the day of the nomination of the
      Democratic candidate in which he took the same ground. The dictum of the Attorney General, is
      no more to me than that of the Honorable Senator from Elkhart (Mr. Davis) in this case, under
      the circumstances. But admitting all these things to be true, are you disposed to override the
      Constitution ?
     Mr. DAVIS : I answer the question as to whether the Republican members of this Senate
      propose to override the Constitution, a emphatically in the negative; for we propose to
      support and abide by that Constitution. To the other question suggested by the Senator from
      Whitley, as to whether we are willing to submit the claims of the Lieutenant Governor to the
      Supreme Court, I say this: The question has, by the party, in interest, been submitted to the
      Supreme Court and been passed upon; and I hold to this position, and that seems to be the
      accepted sentiment of the Republican party, that the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to pass
      upon the right of any one to hold this office, for the reason that it is a co-ordinate branch
      of the State Government. 
     Mr. MCDONALD: Do you say as a lawyer that the Supreme Court has decide
      this question?
     Mr. DAVIS : I did not say that. 
     Mr. MCDONALD : We ought to be fair about this matter. 
     Mr. DRAKE : On the part of the minority, we desire to uphold our rights ins an orderly and
      dignified manner. We concede that the majority on this floor have great power. We think they
      believed one things before the election last November and another thing after the election,
      and they have the power to override the will of the people and the decision of the people
      expressed at the ballot-box on the second day of November; but you also have a great
      responsibility to shoulder when you undertake to nullify the action of nearly five hundred
      thousand people not heard to-day and not represented in this chamber. When these two Houses
      were organized every member who appears to have been elected, notwithstanding any objection,
      was sworn in; and it has been agreed that the man who appears to have the votes of a majority
      of the people at his back, shall take his seat. As presiding over the Senate is one of the
      duties of the Lieutenant Governor, we insist that he is entitled to perform that duty. You
      talk about going into Court; what power has a Court to expel an usurper in this Senate? 
     Mr. NeDONALD (interrupting): I rise to a point of order. No Senator has the right to
      characterise any Senator as a usurper.
      Mr. DRAKE : I am assuming a case only to illustrate the law.
      The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The Senator will keep within the bounds of argument under the rules
      of the Senate. As far as I am personally concerned I shall not be very particular about what
      he says of use. 
     Mr. DRAKE: He is sustained by the majority here, whether right or wrong. A Senator on the
      other side says we are wasting time in discussing this question. Why, the question of the
      right of the people, to govern and control the State of Indiana, is a question of the very
      highest importance. You have just had an adjournment for three days and Senators went out on
      the streets drawing six dollars a day from the people's treasury. Senators of the
      majority, you are responsible. Some of us told you two years ago that you would be held
      responsible for your infamous gerrymander of the State, and the people have called you to
      account for that action. I submit that we ought to settle this question. 
     
     Mr. French here obtained recognition from the Chair. 
     Mr. WINTER raised the point of order that the Clerk of the House was in waiting with a
      message from the House of Representatives. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore': He will be kept waiting until we get through with this
      debate. 
     Mr. FRENCH: This Senate adjourned from last Friday until to-day, but we are informed by
      rumor and newspaper report that on yesterday, in response to some kind an invitation from a
      co-ordinate branch of this General Assembly, nineteen members, constituting a minority of this
      body, reported themselves as this Senate in the House of Representatives, and had themselves
      declared, as "the Senate of Indiana," though thirty-one members of this Senate were
      not there. They went in there and assumed the responsibility of constituting this Senate, and
      they come back and ask that these resolutions shall be spread upon the minutes. of the Senate.
      Certainly, they cannot be acting in good faith when they do anything of this kind. They
      certainly know they violated the record as made in this chamber last Friday. Those nineteen
      members were usurping rights when they said they were the Senate. The Constitution says the
      vote man for Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall be canvassed in the presence of the two
      Houses. The two Houses were not there, and the count could not be made unless the two Houses
      were present. The vote could not be properly canvassed on that occasion. The opinion of the
      Attorney General settled nothing. Whether the man who is now in the chair remains there, or
      whether the worthy gentleman who sits on my right [Mr. Robertson], is placed there, I desire
      the approving stamp of a legal decision. Laying aside political questions and considering the
      interests of the great mass of the people, there is a question affecting the financial
      interest of our State that can be met in no other way so well as with a legal decision. I know
      three or four able Republican lawyers who say there is no vacancy that could be filled by an
      election for Lieutenant Governor. We are acting in good faith and desire to have this matter
      decided. The case can be decided in a week. If the Court would say there is a vacancy and say
      that Mr. Robertson is entitled to the seat, the Honorable gentleman now in the chair will
      hasten down the step; and lead him up and put the gavel in his hand; but until that matter is
      settled we propose to stand on the ground we now stand on, if it takes all winter ---- and
      summer. 
     Mr. MARSHALL : Every member of the General Assembly when sworn into office took an oath to
      support the Constitution and feels that obligation, resting upon him. The Speaker of the House
      of Representatives also took an oath to perform, what the Constitution required of him as an
      officer of the House, and to show what a part of his duty is I refer to Article V Section 4 of
      the. Constitution [Reads.] The resolution under consideration provides that the proceedings
      had in pursuance of mandate in the Constitution shall be entered on our journals. 
      The PRESIDENT (interrupting): Gentleman in the lobby will maintain order. Who is knocking
      at the door? If a proper person admit him, if not putt him away. 
     Mr. MARSHALL (resuming): On last Saturday we received a notice from the House of
      Representatives that the presiding officer of that body would proceed to open and count the
      vote cast for Lieutenant Governor last November on the following Monday. This body, in order
      not to be, there, after we received the notice to be there, adjourned until the day beyond the
      one fixed for the count. Nineteen Senators who respected the will of the people, who had sworn
      to support the Constitution of the State and of the United States, and who had been invited by
      the proper authority to be there, were in their seats and heard the count and the publishing
      of the vote. They did their duty under the Constitution and the laws; and the question before
      us now is: Whether this Constitutional proceeding shall go upon the records or not, so we can
      show to the people of the State that at least a part of the General Assembly undertook to
      carry out their oaths? As far as the election of Lieutenant Governor is concerned, the
      question of vacancy was considered at the proper time, and Governor Gray submitted that
      question to the proper authority. That authority was the Attorney General of Indiana; and he
      pointed to the clause of the Constitution; read by the Senator from Elkhart(Mr. Davis.) Upon
      that opinion of the Attorney General, concurred in by the Governor of the State, endorsed by
      Democrats everywhere, acquiesced in by the Democratic State Central Committee, and by the
      Democratic press of the State, a Democratic State Convention was called which put nomination a
      for that office. Believing that the Attorney General acted in good faith and gave an honest
      opinion, and believing that Governor Gray and the Democratic party were acting in good faith,
      the Republican party called a like Convention, and in good faith placed at the head of its
      ticket a man that in to-day the Lieutenant Governor of Indiana. Democrats supposed they would
      succeed at that election, but the returns showed up differently,,and until that hour the
      people never knew but that there was a vacancy in the office. After five hundred thousand
      citizens had deposited their votes, and discharged that duty to the State, they were informed
      that there was no necessity for that inasmuch as a Republican had been elected! I say if Judge
      Nelson, the Democratic candidate, had obtained the plurality that Colonel Robertson has
      to-day, this controversy would never had been thought of. The Republicans of Indiana, true to
      their principles, would have said,"If Judge Nelson has three or four thousand majority,
      let him have his seat." And now the bone and sinew of this State, the men who plow and
      who work in the. shops, say : "Let Governor Robertson occupy the position to which the
      people of the State elected him." [Applause in the galleries.] 
     
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The gallery will keep in order.
     Mr. WEIR: If it occurs again sir, I shall enter a motion to have the galleries cleared.
     The PRESIDENT: The gallery will keep order. The Doorkeeper will exclude every person from it
      who acts disorderly, and use whatever force is necessary to do it with.
     Mr. WEIR: It seems to me those in the gallery should not necessitate force but statement to-
      the Chair should be sufficient. For the present I will not make that motion, but whether it be
      in approval is said upon the Democratic or Republican side I sha11 make that motion as I can
      get recognition from the Chair. 
     Mr. MARSHALL: (resuming): I have no receive desire to receive applause from the galleries. I
      speak the sentiments of my Republican friends here. We are willing to go as far as any in
      order that a proper settlement of this question may be brought about. [He made reference to
      needed legislation that would otherwise be retarded.) 
     Mr. CAMPBELL: If there is anything I dislike to do it is to talk to a number of persons who
      adjudge a case in advance. I know right well that nothing that nothing I can say will be
      favorably by the thirty-one of the majority on this floor. When I talk to a jury I want to
      know in advance that they are impartial and will give me an unprejudiced hearing, and will
      base their judgment upon the law and the facts in the case. Such is not the case now. We are
      asked to submit this question to the Court. To that proposition I answer that the Courts have
      no jurisdiction. This is a question for the Legislature to determine. It is a legal question
      in one sense and a political one in another. It is a legal question in that every member of
      the General ly should pass upon it from his own judgment of the law in the case, and it is a
      political question in that it shall be finally determined by the people. In 1886, the
      Lieutenant Governor did vacate his office. Then there was a vacancy in that office for the
      first time under the Constitution; and it occurred in the first half of the term. Here was an
      occurrence that had not taken place before, and the Governor submitted the question to the law
      officer of the State--the Attorney General, whose duty it is to give legal opinions to the
      Governor upon all questions affecting the people of the State. He gave that opinion. The
      people of the State through their political parties adopted that opinion . The Attorney
      General said: [Reads.] In that particular case his opinion was law. 
     Mr. WEIR: If Mr. Robertson was legally elected, for what length of time was he elected? 
     Mr. CAMPBELL: For the balance of the term. The Constitution expressly prescribes the
      beginning and the ending of the term. I have no hesitancy in saying the election was to fill a
      vacancy. Does the presiding officer of this Senate succeed to Lieutenant Governorship? If so,
      by what warrant? There is nothing in the statute book that warrants it. We either have a
      Lieutenant Governor or we have none. If our presiding officer is Lieutenant Governor what
      becomes of the Senator from Jennings ? Can a man be a Senator and at the same time be
      Lieutenant Governor ? I took the responsibility of going to witness the count and the
      publishing, of the vote cast for Lieutenant Governor under the requirements: of the
      Constitution.'
      Mr. WEIR: Does the Senator entertain the view that it there had been no count and Mr.
      Robertson had been legally elected it would make any difference? 
     Mr. CAMPBELL: Not a particle . If the people had the power to elect no form required by the
      statute that might be defeated by the opposite party could affect that election. If there is
      no provision in the Constitution binding our hands then the Legislature is sovereign. I have
      come to the conclusion that the Constitution no where forbids the filling of that vacancy by
      the people provided there is a law enacted for elections, and an act of the General Assembly
      says that at an election every two years all vacancies shall be filled. The people are
      sovereign; their voice should be heard; and that voice says Colonel Robertson is Lieutenant
      Governor. It is due to ourselves, to the people and to him that we should have the decency and
      propriety to put on the journals of the Senate the record the House of Representatives made in
      counting and publishing that vote. 
     Mr. JOHNSON : I congratulate members of the Senate, irrespective of party, on the fact that
      for the first time during the session the demand for, the previous question or a motion to lay
      on the table has no been sprung, and that every Senator on the Republican side of this chamber
      can feel that he has a right to be heard. I am sorry that at the commencement of this session
      Republican Senators have been unjustly deprived of their rights. But now I want to discuss
      briefly the question involved in the motion before us. And I want to call attention to the
      fact that this is a political question, sugar-coat it as you please. Let me ask attention to a
      little of the history in this case. In the summer of 1886 a Democrat, , who was Lieutenant
      Governor of the State, saw fit to accept an appointment to a Federal office and thereby
      vacated the office of Lieutenant Governor. This was brought about by the action of Democratic
      and not Republican officials. In my opinion if that old hero (General Manson) had been able to
      foresee the exigencies of the case he would have remained in that chair and rejected the more
      lucrative position. But a Democratic official called the attention of another Democratic
      official to the question involved, to the end that the question might be settled in advance
      upon, the legal and Constitutional points involved. A Democratic Attorney General, skilled in
      the law, gave his opinion on the Constitutional construction of the question, which was
      accepted by the Democratic party throughout the length and breadth the State. The Democratic
      Party acted upon it and nominated Judge Nelson for Lieutenant Governor. If the gentleman who
      presides over the deliberations of this Senate had objections to the opinion of the  Attorney General it would have been in excellent taste for him to
      have given such notice then to the convention of his party which made that nomination, but he
      sat silent. The Republican party took up the issue in good faith. Men of all political parties
      accepted the decision of the Democratic Attorney General and went into the canvass of 1886.
      Will you tell me that the Democratic party then honestly believed that the gentleman now
      presiding over the Senate is legally entitled to hold the office? I am bound to defend the
      Democratic party from any such subterfuge as that. It is my belief that if Judge Nelson, had
      been elected Lieutenant Governor the Democratic party would never have questioned the validity
      of his election. I appeal to the sense of fairness and manliness of Democratic Senators on
      this floor to break from the lash of party necessity and take a broader view than they do of
      the troublesome question now before this body for its determination. The voice of the people
      has been heard upon it, and from that voice no appeal can be had. After the election, for the
      first time, we heard Democrats claiming that the gentleman who presides over this body is
      entitled to hold this office. The Democratic party by its acts, expressed and implied,
      estopped itself from asserting that issue either, in the Courts or on the door of this Senate
      chamber. It is said at there are Republican lawyers here who concede that the right of
      succession throws the mantle of office upon him who presides over this Senate. I am not aware
      of any such lawyer. It is a little singular that I who have been with them in caucas and out
      have not heard of such an one. But suppose such an opinion has been expressed by lawyers,
      irrespective of party,, what does that indicate? Simply that it is a question of doubtful
      Constitutional construction. And if that be true I want to know what better solution of the
      question could be obtained than that which precedes rather than that which succeeds? I cannot
      go into the legal question in detail, but there are one or two points I will notice. [Reads
      and comments at length on Section 10, Article. V, of the Constitution; also same Article
      Section 11, and also same Article, Section 18.) This is a Government of the people, for the
      people and by the people. Another proposition that cannot be gainsayed is that the general
      sentiment of our Constitutional law requires offices to be filled by the, people at an
      election. There is a plain, madatory provision of the Constitution which provides that on the
      death or resignation of a State officer the Governor, who is a superior officer, shall appoint
      some one to fill the vacancy; but the design is to answer the exigencies of the moment until
      the people can meet and fill the vacancy by their ballots. The only way to properly induct the
      Lieutenant Governor into office is in the manner prescribed in the Constitution--to have the
      vote counted and published and have his oath taken, certified to and declared in the presence
      of both Houses and entered upon the journals of the two Houses. 
     Mr. WEIR: Will the Senator yield to a motion to adjourn?

     AFTERNOON SESSION
     Mr. JOHNSON, resuming, spoke but a minutes till he yielded the floor to a committee from the
      House of Representatives. 
     Mr. BAILEY: I understand the ruling the Chair to be that no message is in order until this
      question is disposed of finally. 
     The PRESIDENT : have so decided. .
     Mr. WINTER: As this matter now comes up again, I wish to submit reasons why I think the
      rulings of the Chair this morning was not correct. [Reads from Jefferson's Manual of
      Parliamentary Law.] 
     Mr. WEIR made suggestions in harmony with the remarks of Mr. Winter. When he concluded--- 
     Mr. CAMPBELL: I understood the Senator from Wayne (Mr. Johnson) yielded floor to a committee
      from the House.I move--- 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore : It is t necessary to make a motion. If there committee from the
      House it will be recognized. 
     Mr. DRESSER: The committee from the House have requested me to present their grievance: The
      Principal Clerk came in this morning and as he could not be heard returned to the House, and
      then came back when the Doorkeeper refused him admittance to the floor of the Senate. This is
      their statement briefly. I am informed by the Speaker of the last House a rule made by himself
      was that all communications from the Senate should be sent to the Speaker's desk simply
      for the purpose avoiding any interruption of the business of the House, and he would present
      the messages to the House. The present Speaker has adopted the same rule. 
     The PRESIDENT declared he did not know the Doorkeeper had done any such thing; but thought
      the debate would have been finished in a few minutes and then the message received. No
      discourtesy was intended. 
     Mr. DRESSER: The committee from the House say the explanation of the Chair is sufficient. 
     The PRESIDENT: I am very much obliged to the gentlemen from the House. 
     Mr. WINTER: I went to the Clerk of the House when he came here this morning and he said he
      had a message but the Doorkeeper would not announce it. 
     The PRESIDENT: The chair was informed by Senator Winter that the Clerk was here with a
      message. There was a debate pending and I said the Clerk would be heard when the debate was
      over. There is no objection on the part of the char to receiving messages, but if it be as
      contended that the Speaker of the House can make a rule that messages from the Senate shall be
      received in secret, the President of the Senate will make a rule that their messages shall be
      received in secret. 
     Mr. FOWLER: I make the point of order that the question is on the adoption of the resolution
      offered by the Senator from Elkhart (Mr. Davis.) 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The point of order is well taken. The Senator from Wayne (Mr.
      Johnson) will proceed.
     Mr. FOWLER: I rise to another point of order. It is proposed to put on the records of the
      Senate a resolution declaring that the Senate and the House were in joint convention on a day
      when our records show there was no Senate in session. Therefore I raise the point of order
      that the resolution is out or order.
      The PRESIDENT: For personal reasons the chair would prefer the Senator would withhold his
      point of order until the Senator from Wayne has completed his speech. 
     Mr. FOWLER: For the present I will withdraw the point of order with the privilege of
      renewing it next Saturday. 
     The PRESIDENT: You may renew it as soon as the Senator gets through. 
     Mr. JOHNSON: I have only presented this Constitutional question because, or the gravity of
      the situation. I have the profound satisfaction to know that I have endeavored by
      Constitutional methods to prevent any calamity to the State, I have endeavored in my feeble
      manner to demon-[strate]  [demo-]strate that the
      Constitution provides for filling vacancies in the office of Lieutenant Governor, and that the
      language of the Statutes, in aid of that provision of Constitution, still further carry out
      that theory. And I say in pursuance of that theory the vote for Lieutenant Governor having
      been transmitted from the Secretary of State to the Speaker of the House of Representatives,
      it became necessary under the plain provision of the Constitution that the vote should be
      counted and published in the presence of the two Houses by the Speaker of the House. The House
      notified the Senate by invitation to be present at the time when the Speaker would perform
      this plain Constitutional duty. In the face of this fair invitation by a co-ordinate branch of
      the Legislature the Senate saw fit to adjourn beyond the time set by the House. However, the
      vote was published in the absence of a part of the Senate but in the presence of a quorum of
      the House of Representatives and in the presence of such Republican Senators as had in mind
      their Constitutional, rights and prerogatives. The mere fact that a portion of one branch of
      the General Assembly saw fit not to attend could not prevent the Speaker of the House from
      going ahead with the mandatory Constitutional requirement. The Constitution requires the
      election of Lieutenant Governor shall be by a majority vote, which shall be counted and the
      result published in the presence of both Houses, and it either House should refuse to attend
      it, it cannot nullify the Constitution or prevent any branch of the Government from exercising
      its Constitutional functions. I regard the Constitution of the State higher than a resolution
      of the Senate and I went to witness that count with eighteen other of my colleagues. It is not
      so material that the Senate should attend as it is that the Speaker declare who is elected. We
      came here for the purpose of discharging our Constitutional duties. We found a code of rules
      adopted, to crush out the minority, representation on this floor-- 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Senator from Wayne will confine himself to the Constitutional
      question of law, and not discuss the rules of this body or any other body.
      Mr. JOHNSON: This comes up properly in the discussion. I have been following the line of
      those who preceded me in this unfortunate controversy I desire to say to those gentlemen who
      regard this as a question to be settled by the Courts : Let them go there, but what right has
      this Senate as a body, to indicate to the Lieutenant Governor whether he shall or shall not go
      into Court ? Being declared elected by a high Constitutional power he should not be required
      to throw away the rights and privileges acquired by a vote of the people. The Democratic party
      went before the people and their voice has been heard in thunder tones. Let those gentlemen
      who went before the people and were overwhelmingly defeated step down and out of the places
      they hold without warrant of law, and the machinery of the State Government will run smoothly.
      I cannot believe that Senators on this floor--independent, reflecting men, fair-minded men,
      will follow their party when it is wrong, and stand ups against an expression of popular will.
      I know there is regard for Constitutional rights hare, and among us those who say "vox
      populi, vox del." I will not believe that this presiding officer and a majority of this
      Assembly desire to throttle the public will. This Senate having failed to discharge its
      Constitutional duty in attending to the canvassing of the vote for Lieutenant Governor, is now
      asked to place on the records of the Senate a certified copy of the oath of the man the people
      elected Lieutenant Governor. I believe, honestly and conscientiously, that is proper. There is
      no higher authority in this country than the people. They have decided this question in
      advance and we should submit to their decision. They will decide in the future. After all the
      discussion it will come home to the people for their determination. I appeal to Senators, and
      counsel moderation and forbearance in this matter. I would like to see the courtesy of a
      removal from the Senate tactics of motions for the previous question and to lay on the table;
      and that followed by setting other good examples for the House.
      The PRESIDENT (pro tempore): Does the Senator from Wayne intimate that the House needs a
      good example?
     Mr. JOHNSON: I do, sir. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore We. will do it then. [Laughter.] 
     Mr. JOHNSON (resuming): Let us make our Constitutional methods peaceable methods. In the
      name of God let all doors be thrown open and let every Senator feel that he is in a free
      country, representing a sovereign people, and in a sovereign State; and that he is not to be
      placed under a system of espoinace. The nineteen Republican Senators on this floor do not
      design to do anything wrong. They may be voted down in thus conflict, but "Truth crushed
      to earth will rise again, The eternal years of God are her's." We may be defeated on
      this floor, but "Thrice armed is he whose cause is just. 
     Mr.TRIPPETT : I wish to say a few words on this subject. Gentlemen on the other side of this
      chamber seem solicitous, for the welfare of the Democratic party. They give us warning if we
      do our duty on this floor as we have registered an oath to do, that we are digging our
      political graves. They tell us we are not doing what our consciences dictate, but we are doing
      what we are at the dictate of party. Those two statements are inconsistent. I venture to say
      there is not a Democratic Senator upon this floor who takes a position upon this question but
      takes it according to the dictates of his conscience, and God have mercy upon a man who dares
      to violate his conscience upon a question so important as this. I have taken an oath to
      perform my duty and I am going to perform my duty here regardless of threats from the other
      side. It is important to the people that this question should be adjudicated. It is  important for several reasons. The Constitution of the State, in
      Section 2, Article V, says: [Reads--also Section 9.] I maintain there was no election last
      November at which the people had the right to vote for a Lieutenant Governor. If there was,
      and the gentleman who I understand will claim to be the President of this body, has been
      properly elected by the people, then question arises how long shall he hold his office ? Shall
      it be four years according to Section 128 of the Revised Statutes, or shall it be for some
      other time? It is important that this question: should be adjudicated by the Courts that we
      may know if this man is properly elected. If he is entitled to preside over this Senate we
      should it, and he should preside. It is believed, I think, by every Democratic Senator that we
      have the right to elect our presiding officer. We have done so, and any man, I care not by
      whom he may be sent, who tries to take the seat of the President of the Senate in violation of
      the expressed ssed will of a majority of this Senate, is an usurper, and if we should permit
      him to preside over the Senate we would violate the Constitution of the State of Indiana.
      [Applause.] General Manson having resigned, to let any man preside over the Senate who is not
      a member of the Senate would be a violation of the Constitution, because the Constitution says
      a Senator sha11 be the presiding officer in the absence the Lieutenant Governor, and by the
      grace of God and the back-bone of this Democratic Senate he shall preside. [Renewed applause.] 
     The PRESIDENT, pro tempore: The galleries must maintain order.
      Mr. WEIR: I should be glad to hear the Chair announce that if there is any further
      demonstration there will be a motion made to clear the galleries. We are not here to receive
      the plaudits of the galleries nor for any other purpose than to discuss question fairly. 
     The PRESIDENT : I will say to the Senator from Laporte and all other Senators, that the
      gallery is intended to be used in orderly and respectable way by persons who come to look upon
      the proceedings of this body, and if disorder is to take possession of the gallery I will now
      say that the Door-keeper will be ordered to look the doors to-morrow morning and no person
      permitted to enter there. If you desire to enjoy the privileges of the gallery you can do so
      by maintaining order, otherwise you will be looked out to-morrow morning.
     Mr. DeMOTTE: Those who are orderly should be permitted to remain. 
     The PRESIDENT: The Senator from Porter (Mr. DeMotte) is as much out of order as the
      galleries. [Laughter.] The Senator Dubois has the floor.
     Mr. TRIPPETT (resuming): The discussion of this question upon the opposite side of the
      chamber has not been confined entirely to the question before the Senate. They have referred
      to the apportionment made by the last Legislature, which they are inclined to call an infamous
      gerrymander. They tell us that Republican Senators resent a Democratic constituency. I want to
      say now, because I speak where of I know, that ere this General Assembly closes there will be
      found something more infamous than a gerrymander that returned some Republican Senators from a
      Democratic constituency. But that has nothing to do with this question. I maintain that we
      have elected a Democratic majority of two in this Assembly: that we have a majority in this
      Senate, and that we have a right to maintain it. Certain assertions and acts on the Republican
      side have gone so far as to show their intention to thwart our legal and rightfully elected
      majority, on joint ballot. One of their schemes is to seat a man as President of this Senate
      who in my humble opinion has no right to preside over the Senate. The presiding officer went
      to the Courts of the State and threw down the gauntlet and has done all he could do. The Court
      held it had no jurisdiction. Section 1131 of the Revised Statutes says: [Reads the first two
      clauses.] The claimant, if he has a right to preside over the Senate, should file information
      before a Court and make the President of the Senate respond and thereby, have a decision of
      the question. I understand the President of the Senate is willing to go into any Court and
      have the case submitted to the Supreme Court as quick as possible. It has been said that the
      presiding officer has been inconsistent in his course because he was present in the Democratic
      convention when a Lieutenant-Governor was nominated and did not enter Dig protest against it.
      In that Democratic convention I occupied a seat near when Mr. Smith sat, and I do know that
      when the announcement that nominations for Lieutenant Governor were in order he rose from his
      seat and said that in his humble opinion it was not necessary to elect a Lieutenant Governor
      and he would decline the nomination. He has been consistent from that day to this,and he is
      still consistent with the Constitution of the State. Republicans have said if Judge Nelson had
      been elected we would not have raised this question. I say I would. The Constitutions of the
      United States and of the State of Indiana are very similar. [He compared the two, referring,
      to the death of Vice President Hendricks in the early part of the term of office.] 
     Mr. McCLURE : It does strike me that the speeches made upon this plain and simple question
      are out of order. For what purpose, sir, did we elect you at the last session of the Senate as
      President pro tempore? It is plain to every one that the object was to make provision for a
      contingency, according to the requirement of the Constitution and the laws of the State. What
      position do we respectively occupy ? The Democratic side contend that there was no vacancy in
      the office of Lieutenant Governor, and that the election of Lieutenant Governor was illegal.
      The Republicans say there was a vacancy and that the election was legal. We have possession of
      the Presidency of this Senate, and we make the proposition that if the Republicans are not
      satisfied let Mr. Robertson and the President of the Senate make up a case and go before the
      Courts with a case that they  will take cognizance of. I
      heard the President say before the election than he contended that be would he the Lieutenant
      Governor--that is, by virtue of his pro tempore election--and let the Democratic candidate or
      the Republican candidate be elected, he would take the very position he has taken. Now what
      could be fairer than the proposition made by us to go to the Court? As it decides we are
      willing to abide. It strikes me, sir, that this question is so plain,it is unnecessary to
      multiply words upon this occasion. A simple statement of the facts is sufficient. ,
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Jasper : The object of this resolution is to place on our records what the
      Statute requires shall be entered there. Section 5521 of the Revised Statutes requires the
      oath of the Lieutenant Governor to be entered on the journals of both Houses. It is claimed
      that the Senate has the right to elect its President; that proposition I deny. I ask attention
      to Article IV, Section 10, of the Constitution. [Reads.] Article III, of the Constitution,
      provides: [Reads.] One of the functions of the Lieutenant Governor is to preside over the
      Senate, and the only section, of he Constitution which refers, to that subject is Section 11
      of Article V. [Reads.] I am extremely anxious to do my Constitutional duty. One of the things
      we are sworn to obey is the Constitution, and we would be doing that in adopting this
      resolution. If the Lieutenant Governor is not elected what harm will it do to place upon the
      records the fact that he took the oath? If he is elected, it is the Constitutional duty of
      every Senator to vote for this resolution. What I understand to be the Constitutional
      difference between the Lieutenant Governor and the President of the Senate is this: The words
      "President of the Senate" is confined in the strictest sense to the Lieutenant
      Governor and to no other person. The Lieutenant Governor is, by virtue of his office, elected
      by the people President of the Senate. The Senate has the right to elect all its officers, the
      President excepted, and in case the Lieutenant Governor is unable temporarily to perform his
      duties the Constitution expressly provides for that contingency. We have not elected in a
      Constitutional sense a President of the Senate. We have elected it gentleman to occupy the
      place until the occasion is passed. The Senate has no right for judge of the election,
      qualification or returns of any except members of its own body. There is no question but that
      Lieutenant Governor Robertson will retain the office till 1889, for he is simply a substitute.
      We ask this record not for the purpose of electing a Lieutenant Governor who shall bold his
      office for four years. Any resolution passed by the Senate that would interfere with a
      Constitutional prerogative would be of no more effect than if passed by a debating society. 
     Mr. BAILEY : Mr. President--- 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempere: I don't want to intrude upon this debate. I want the fullest
      debate, but this question perhaps ought to be, closed up to-night, and speeches are running
      lengthy. I only make the suggestion. 
     Mr. BAILEY: The Senator who has just taken his seat expatiates at some length upon the
      harmlessness of adopting this resolution. It seems to me a thing of that kind would be a
      foolish and idle thing. This Senate on Wednesday passed a resolution declaring that there had
      been no election of Lieutenant Governor and therefore it refused to attend any pretended
      count, and for us to admit a lie upon our records would be something more than harmless. It
      has been argued by gentlemen on the opposite side that we received an opinion from the
      Attorney General of the State on this question, and that was the law. It cannot be that the
      Senator from Hendricks (Mr. Campbell) would claim in any Court, that the opinion of an
      Attorney General would be binding, or, the law in any respect. The Attorney General's
      opinion should have no more effect than that of any other lawyer of equal ability. At that
      time that question bad been but slightly, argued, if at all, by the-people of the State. He
      was the first man to pass upon it, and did so hurriedly at the request of some official. I say
      of my own knowledge that, the President of the Senate at the Democratic nominating convention
      protested against the nomination of any man for the office of Lieutenant Governor, and in my
      presence and in the presence of other gentlemen well known, stated that it mattered not who
      might be nominated, or who elected, he should contest this question in the Courts, as he has
      attempted to do and as he is now willing to do. So far from President Smith being estopped on
      his own conduct, he is perfectly consistent. It bas been said the opinion regarding the vote
      for Lieutenant Governor last fall as a nullity, is confined to Democratic lawyers. I would be
      willing to venture my position that if you will poll the Republican side of this chamber you
      will find one or two lawyers who entertain that opinion, and you will find some of the
      foremost Republican lawyers of the State who believe that election was a nullity because it
      could not take place under the Constitution in 1886. [Reads Section 9, Article V, of the State
      Constitution.] I desire to call the attention of the Senate to the fact that in the
      Constitution of the State the offices of Governor and Lieutenant Governor are inseparably
      coupled and linked together in every section referring to these offices. [Reads Section 2.] If
      Mr. Robertson was elected in 1886 what is to prevent his holding on during a natural term? The
      next sections put the election of Governor and Lieutenant Governor together. [Reads several
      sections.] How can you canvass a vote for one when there has been no election of the other?
      What authority of law have you for it ? And how can you canvass such a vote, in the absence of
      one branch of the General Assembly ? Will you ask us to put on record that this Senate was
      present when that vote was canvassed? Will the opposition ask the Democratic Senators to
      stultify themselves on this question and say  that the
      Senate was present when such a farce was perpetrated? When and where shall this muddle end? I
      say this question should receive that consideration and determination that shall settle
      forever the question of who is or shall be Lieutenant Governor;. and the only tribunal in
      which this can be determined and determined satisfactorily is the Supreme Court of this State.
      And it could be done in the next five days if the Republican party were willing to have this
      matter settled and decided. But they are not now and never been willing. A body which has been
      sworn to do its duty can illy afford to put any obstacle in the way of a speedy judicial
      determination of this whole matter.
      Mr. WEIR : I rise to a question of order. For fear my motives might be misconstrued if I
      make a point of order upon a Senator from the other side I now make it my friend from Marion
      (Mr. Bailey), I have here the resolution adopted by the Senate on the seventh day of January,
      when this question was first introduced.[ Reads-see page 33 of this book.] Now the resolution
      under consideration, which not necessary to read, involves precisely the same subject-matter,
      therefore I make the point that it is not in order at this time, believing that a reasonable
      opportunity has been allowed for discussion. 
     The PRESIDENT: The Senate will give attention for one moment before the question of order is
      put. I desire to say to the Senate on this occasion before the question of order is decided,
      that two years ago, when I was elected President of the Senate, I understood that should
      General Manson by any means vacate the office of Lieutenant Governor I would become the acting
      Lieutenant Governor of the State. That was the construction that I then placed on the
      Constitution, and that was the construction that was placed upon it by myRepublican colleagues
      in the Senate. Senator Campbell, my opponent for the office, also placed that construction on
      it. At the time that General Manson vacated the office I still entertained the opinion that I
      succeeded to the duties and powers of the President of the Senate. At the time the Attorney
      General gave an opinion that a vacancy a existed in the office of Lieutant Governor, which
      could and ought filed by an election, I publicly protested against any such action, claiming
      then that the opinion of the Attorney General did not state the law. When the Democratic State
      convention met I publicly announced my intention, to both leading Democrats and Republicans,
      that, while I could not prevent a nomination for Lieutenant Governor, I did not care who was
      nominated or elected, but that the person elected would have to try his title to the office in
      the Courts. On the night before the Democratic convention met I employed the ablest lawyer in
      the State of Indiana to test the question as to whether the President of the Senate, and had
      the right to perform the duties of that office, with whoever might be elected Lieutenant
      Governor. I never, at any time before the election or since, conceded that under the law and
      the Constitution anybody could lawfully be elected to the office of Lieutenant Governor. As
      soon after the election as practicable I adopted the only remedy that I then had, and went
      into the Courts for the purpose of testing the question as to whether there was or could have
      been, a Lieutenant Governor elected at the November election in 1886. The only remedy I had
      was by way, of injunction against, the Secretary of State to prevent him from certifying the
      returns of the election to be canvassed by the 2 Houses for the, purpose of declaring who was
      elected to the office of Lieutenant Governor. In the Circuit Court Colonel Robertson was
      represented by the Attorney General and other persons, who, as one cause for demurrer to the
      complaint, objected than the Court had no jurisdiction in an injunction, proceeding to try the
      title to an office. That question was urged in the Circuit Court and I was defeated on that
      ground. I appealed to the Supreme Court, and the same question was urged there--that the Court
      had no jurisdiction to decide this question in an injunction proceeding. I was defeated there,
      but the question whether there was a Lieutenant Governor elected at the November election,
      1886, was not decided by the Supreme Court and remains undecided now. That being the case,
      under my oath as a Senator, I am left to judge what the Constitution is, and decide that
      question for myself. I hold that there was not and could not have been a legal, constitutional
      election for Lieutenant Governor in November, 1886, and that the votes cast for Lieutenant
      Governor at that election were void. The complications that I predicted when I brought my suit
      in the Circuit Court are now upon us, and the case remains undecided. I desire that there
      shall be a judicial determination of the matter, and in view of this I now make this
      proposition: That if Colonel Robertson will commence quo warranto proceedings re against me,,
      or any proceedings which will contest the question--- 
     Mr. HUSTON (interrupting): I rise to a question of order. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Your point of order is out of order. 
     Mr. HUSTON: [His words were not heard by this reporter.] 
     The PRESIDENT: Take your seat until I make this statement. I will waive my Senatorial
      privileges, enter an appearance to the action, and assist him to prosecute the case without
      delay to final judgment in the Supreme Court. But if he does not choose to commence such suit,
      if it can be done by me I will commence the suit; providing he will enter his appearance to
      the action, and without delay and without objection prosecute the suit to the Supreme Court,
      where the question may be decided as to whether in November,1886, a Lieutenant Governor could
      have been constitutionally elected. Until such a determination is had I am President of the
      Senate and intend to remain so. The Senator from Fayette (Mr. Huston) can now state his point
      of order. 
     
     Mr. HUSTON: I was rising to a point of order, claiming the Chair as out of order; he should
      call some one to the chair. 
     The PRESIDENT: I was mindful of that, but desired to say what I have said with kindest
      regards to everybody, and, I desired to take my own way to say it. I have said it in an
      official way. 
     Mr. WEIR: I now raise my point of order. 
     Mr.. WINTER: It is not fair to the minority upon this floor, or to other members who may
      desire to speak, in this indirect way to be cut off. 
     The PRESIDENT: The Senator from Laporte (Mr. Weir) has raised the point of order that the
      resolution, or whatever it is called, is out of order. I will decide that, if there is no
      further remarks. The resolution, as I understood it when being read, is an attempt on the part
      of the person who introduced into engraft upon the journals of the Senate a part of the
      journal of the House of Representatives and thereby contradict the terms of the records of
      this Senate. It is entirely improper for the House of Representatives to send its journal or
      any part of it here and ask us to place it on record in our journal; and if I understand the
      question that is just what this proposition means. It means to place on our journals a record
      which does not state the fact; a record which was made when the Senate was not in session; a
      record which does not state the truth, and engraft it upon the record of this Senate. Such a
      move cannot be tolerated. The motion and the reasons given in the motion are entirely out of
      order, and it would so have been decided long ago had it not seen desired that Republicans in
      this body should have the freest opportunity to discuss the matter. It is out order. 
     Mr. WINTER appealed from the decision of the Chair. 
     On motion by Mr. FOWLER the appeal was laid on the table. 
     The Senate adjourned till to-morrow at ten o'clock. 
    
   
   
   
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
    
      TUESDAY, January 11, 1887. 
    
    Prayer was offered by Rev. A. S. Gilbert.
     A message inviting the House to meet the Senate in joint convention in its chamber on
     Wednesday, January 19, at noon, to compare votes for United States Senator was announced.
     The SPEAKER: In accordance wit the plan pursued during the last General Assembly the message
     will the forwarded to the desk without being read. 
    Mr. JEWETT: I rise to a question of order. It has always been the custom to call the roll of
     members to ascertain whether a quorum was present. 
    The SPEAKER was of a different opinion, and the journal was partially read, when 
    Mr. HARRELL(interrupting) said: I desire to offer a motion in regard to the correction of the
     journal. 
    The SPEAKER: It is the opinion of the chair that the reading of the journal should proceed. 
    It was read. 
    Mr. GARDINER: I move that the Journal as read be approved, and on this question I demand the
     previous question.
     The previous question was seconded, and the yeas and nays demanded. 
    
    Mr. COX, of Miami, when his name was called, said : I wish to explain my vote I do not think,
     Mr. Speaker, that it is right for the majority of this House to falsify the record in order to
     gain a party advantage. The vote resulted--yeas 53, nays 45. So the main question was ordered. 
    Mr. HARRELL : I wish to offer an amendment. 
    The SPEAKER: The gentleman is out of order; we are operating under the previous question. 
    
    
    The vote resulted--yeas 54, nays 44. So the journal was approved. 
    The SPEAKER called upon the Committee on Elections for a report.
     It reported that it was necessary for the committee to have copies of the Statutes of 1881
     and of the Acts of 1883 and 1885, which report was concurred in. 
    
     THE BEASLEY CONTEST.
      The SPEAKER: The matter now under consideration is the resolution introduced by the
      gentleman from Vigo. (Mr. Glover.) [It authorizes the chairman of the Election committee to
      appoint a sub-committee of 3 to proceed to Terre Haute, demand depositions taken in the Downey
      vs. Beasley contested election case; examine witnesses, appoint a sergeant-at-arms and a
      stenographer: and report, on Friday, January 14,. 1887.] 
     The resolution was re-read. 
     Mr. GORDON: I desire to amend that resolution as follows: That all that part of the
      resolution which relates to demanding the evidence taken before the Justices of Vigo county be
      stricken out, and than the time for taking the testimony and the report thereon be extended to
      one week from next Friday instead of next Friday. 
     Mr. BEASLEY; I feel a little like the meek and lowly Nazarine. I a m most happy to think
      that I am permitted to speak in my own defense. I have no objection to a full, complete and
      fair investigation, and if, after a full and fair investigation by a committee of gentlemen
      from this House, it decides against me, then I am willing and shall deem it my duty to resign
      my seat; but I believe, as I believe the majority of the people acquainted with the facts
      believe, that I have been fairly elected. I wish to state for the information of the House
      that the contestor, through his attorneys, has been taking testimony in the city of Terre
      Haute for several weeks, and that the contestee has had no time to take any testimony
      whatever. The committee is to report on Friday. In common fairness I would simply ask of the
      gentlemen on the other side, knowing full well that they have the power to do with me as they
      see fit, that they give me an opportunity to get the evidence before them. And I know, and
      gentlemen on the other side know, that this cannot be done if this committee go down there and hear testimony on both sides and come
      back here and report on Friday. My understanding is that there was one illegal vote counted in
      Sullivan county. My information is that man voted twice. All that I wish for t get all the
      facts before this Committee on Elections. If they determine against then I
      want to say to you that no gentleman will hear a word of complaint from me or my political
      friends. 
     Mr. PATTON: I would like for the gentleman from Daviess (Mr. Gardiner) to simply make an
      amendment to report on Monday instead of Friday.
     Mr. JEWETT: I desire to say but word on: this question. It is the agreement of the minority
      to accept next Monday merely for the reason that it is the most we can hope from those who
      seem to deny the gentleman from Vigo (Mr. Beasley) his constitutional right. For nearly five
      weeks the contestor in this case has been taking testimony up to the very day the gentleman
      was ease compelled to come here and take his seat. I do not believe the House consistently
      limit that man's time to next Monday. He is required, during the next four days, to meet
      all the testimony, that been taken during five weeks. He is required to make that evidence in
      four days, and at the same time allow out of that four days his opponents what time they
      require demand. As an amendment to the amendment, I move that the committee, be directed to
      report, on the 24th day of January, two weeks from yesterday: 
     Mr. GORDON : I wish to explain that resolution, as, amended, was to take out that part of it
      that provides that this special committee must proceed to the Justice of the Peace that has
      been taking testimony and receive from him the testimony has been taken. Now, why I do this,
      is this: that the resolution proposes to do an unlawful thing. The resolution proposes to set
      aside the Statutes upon this question, and that thing I don't believe the House can do by
      a mere resolution. I understand that the Statutes cannot be set aside by either branch of the
      General Assembly. I hardly need repeat that a matter cannot become a statute unless it has
      been read three several times on three several days in each branch of this General Assembly,
      signed by the President, and some other steps, before it can become a law. Now, it ought to be
      as binding upon members of the General Assembly, and upon the members as a body. as upon any
      persons its the State. I want to appeal to the sentiments on the other side. I will that I
      have not deliberately, or purposely, opposed the Constitution or any statutes of the State. 
     Mr. COX, of Miami : It seems to me there must be some reason for this. A United States
      Senator is to be elected, and for that reason and that alone you are trying to put that man
      (Mrs Beasley) out of his seat and try him afterward, like those ruffians the Western wilds. An
      election of United States Senator is pending, and the majority on joint ballot is Democratic,
      and they want to change it. It is simply for the purpose of turning men out of their seats, no
      matter whether they are constitutionally elected or not. 
     Mr. LINCK: The last gentleman made just one point--that we were in a hurry about the
      election of a United States Senator. Mr. Beasley has made a very candid statement, and I hope
      that he may retain his seat; but if he is not entitled to that seat he is not entitled, to
      vote for a United States Senator. It seems that they are afraid that the testimony will show
      that the gentleman on the other side is not entitled to a seat. It is disgraceful to hear them
      claim that all the honesty is on their side. It has been a principle with me beforehand to
      think that men are trying, to do right, but these gentlemen are going contrary to every
      principle, of moral philosophy, trying to make believe that we are trying to steal everything
      and want the earth.
      Mr. PATTON (interposing): We in Sullivan county do not indorse the action of the Justices
      down there, and would be glad to have the testimony taken on both sides, 
      Mr. LINCK: That is the way I like to hear the gentleman talk. We want it fair, and we want
      to give the gentleman all the time we possibly can to get a fair investigation of this matter,
      and this amendment is simply obstructing the matter.
      Mr. GARDINER: I think the gentlemen from Tippecanoe and Montgomery ought to feel
      complimented. I am really pleased at the suggestion coming from the other side of the House,
      but it is never too late to repent. "While the lamp of life holds out to burn, the vilest
      sinner may return. " I am glad to see them coming in. We are here in the middle of the
      second week and during all this time the taking of testimony has been going on. I say he shall
      get his due proportion of the time of the committee. 
     Mr. HARRELL: His proposition is a very fair one--that is this: that he is willing to waive
      technicalities of law requiring that depositions shall be sealed up and transmitted to the
      Clerk, and by him to the Secretary of State, and by him to the Speaker of the House. He wants
      to waive all these and let the evidence come before the House., provided the House will give
      him sufficient time to get the evidence in his behalf. I do not make any charge against the
      gentlemen on the other side of the House. I shall abide by the evidence in this contested
      election case. 
     Mr. GROSE: I understand that a statute may be very positive and very directory, too. This
      statute that is referred to, nobody wants to set aside. This is a directory and positive
      statute. The Legislature stands paramount to this law. They have the right to make the rules
      to cover the matter. 
     It being reported that the Senate had refused the Clerk of the House access to the Senate, a
      committee of three was appointed to investigate the matter. The Speaker appointed Messrs.
      Gardiner, Grose and Jewett. 
     The SPEAKER: I have this day received by mail what purports to be a petition to  this House from one Decatur Downing upon the subject of contested
      election, which I now refer to the Committee on Elections. 
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
      The amendment [Mr. Jewett's] was withdrawn, and Mrs. Gordan's rejected. 
     Mr. KELLISON in offering an amendment providing that the time for taking testimony in the
      election cases be equally divided between the contestor and contestee, said: 
     During the morning session I listened as interested observer. It occurs to me from the
      expressions that have been made on the other side of the chamber that the situation is just
      this: My party associates on this side of the floor seem to feel an unutterable horror of what
      is to grow out of this investigation. The expressions from the gentlemen on the other side
      seem to be in the interest of a fair and free consideration of the contest case of Downing
      against Beasley. If I could believe my party associates on this side of the House, I should be
      compelled to believe that the majority members of the House were engaged night and day
      whetting their knives and tomahawks to scalp and flay the Democratic members of this House;
      and if I take the statement of our Republican friends I must believe that they had a single
      and no other object in view except to purge this House of members who are not entitled to a
      seat on this floor. If I could believe my party associates,Mr. Speaker, and I do not profess
      to disbelieve them they are troubled in their sleep, and they dream at night of political
      guillotines, racks, and dynamite, and more of horrible and awful, that e'en to name would
      be unlawful. Mr. Speaker, I do not share in this; I do not agree with some gentlemen on this
      side of the floor; on the contrary I believe that this action of the House, whatever may be
      its purpose ulteriorly, is taken within the form of the Constitution, and that it is the right
      and prerogative, whenever any member may call the attention of the body to the fact that any
      one holding a seat in this House is not entitled to it, that this House may proceed upon its
      own motion to determine it. It seems, Mr. Speaker,that a demand has been made, and that a
      contest has been inaugurated under a statute provided by the Legislature of this State for
      determining these questions. It seems that testimony bas been taken upon one side, and that no
      testimony has been taken on the other side. Now, it seem to me that for the purposes of this
      resolution we will have to consider that all that has been done in this case amounts to
      nothing. I know of no authority on the part of this House to interfere with the rights and
      prerogatives of the judiciary of the State; and justices of the peace are a part of the
      judiciary of the State. And we as one of the departments of the government have no right to
      take that out of their hands. I shall make no objection to this resolution passing if the
      amendment I have introduced, or one similar to it, shall be adopted. I think this as fair for
      the contested as for the contestor, provided we give an, equal portion of the time to each,
      because all the evidence that is already taken will go for naught. And why my party associates
      on this side should fear for a committee of this Legislature to make the investigation when an
      equal length of time is given each side for the purpose of taking testimony, I am unable to
      see. We upon this side of the chamber profess to believe; and do believe, that we have
      honestly and fairly elected forty-five members of this House. We believe and we know that
      forty-five members of this House have been honestly, elected and received a majority of the
      legal votes cast. We know that every one, of these forty-five members except possibly one of
      them was eligible at the time he received these votes, and further, Mr. Speaker, if the
      gentleman is not eligible and competent to occupy his seat, that there is a gentleman on the
      other side of the chamber whose ineligibility is so notorious that, it is not confined to the
      State of Indiana, it has leaped the boundary of the State and extends clear down into the
      state of Tennessee. I think that we ought to allow this committee to be appointed, and that we
      ought to make an equal division of the time. I know the majority on the other side will not
      allow us to fix the time later than Monday, and I doubt very much if this side was in the
      majority it would allow it to be done. It seems to me that we have no right to ask at the
      hands of the majority any courtesies that we would not be willing to offer to them if we were
      in the majority. It seems to me that it is asking too much of the majority on this floor if
      they believe that this member is not entitled to his seat, and we have no right to question
      the motives of the committee making this investigation. All that this resolution asks for is a
      committee of investigation. All that it asks for is to give this House eyes that it may see
      the truth in regard to this matter, and for my part I do not propose to express or to
      acknowledge any weakness by attempting to obstruct this majority, therefore I believe that
      this amendment ought to prevail. I shall not presume nor assume that they are asking anything
      that is not fair. I am not asking anything that is not fair on the part of both the contestee
      and the contestor. 
     Pending the roll-call under the prev. ques. 
     Mr. GOUGH, when his name was called said: For the reason that this proposition seems to be
      fair I vote "aye." (Applause.) 
     Mr. GRIFFITH: I desire to explain my vote. For the reason that this seems to be manifestly
      fair and just, that the time be evenly divided, I vote "aye." (Applause.) 
     Mr. LINCK: As I believe that the committee will be honest and fair, and as I do not believe
      that, they should be trammeled I vote "no." 
     Mr. MORSE: Seeing nothing unfair the proposition whatever I vote "aye."
      Mr.OSBORN: As to one can understand the circa stances under which this investigation may be
      made. and as one side might get through in an hour and the other take more time, I
      vote"no." 
     Mr. REYNOLDS: I am impressed the very great fairness of this amendment. I believe in fair
      play all around, therefore I vote "aye."
     
     Mr. SCOTT: Believing that it is impracticable to make a definite rule in this matter I vote
      " no."
      Mr. VAN SLYKE: I hardly think that committee needs a guardian. I think at they are of age;
      I think they are men of good judgment and will do the fair, honest,upright thing, and in view
      of that very fact I vote" no." 
     
     
     The vote was then announced:--yeas 54, nays 45. So the amendment was agreed to.
     The resolution as thus amended was adopted .
    
    
     COURTESIES BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES.
      Mr. GARDINER: The committee appointed to investigate the action of the Senate in refusing a
      House clerk access to Senate are ready to report. The President of the Senate announced that
      if it had been known that a clerk of the House was there he would have been admitted. The
      Doorkeeper had informed the committee at the time the clerk appeared at the door Senator
      Johnson was addressing the Senate, and the clerk did not desire to wait. The explanations were
      accepted. 
    
    
     PAY OF MINERS, &C. 
     Mr. JEWETT introduced a bill [H. R. 14] require
      persons engaged in running quarries, mines, etc., to pay their employes in lawful money at
      least once a week; regulating the sale of merchandize by employ to employs & c. He moved
      for a dispensation of the constitutional restriction (see Article IV, Section 18) in order
      that the bill may be pressed to the final vote and passed now. 
     Mr. JEWETT: All over this State there persons and corporations engaged in various
      manufacturing, mining and other kinds of business where the principal profit arises out of the
      selling of their goods to their employe in payment of wages at such prices as they see fit to
      charge. Those who labor and are paid in this way live in modified state of slavery, and very
      little modified at that. While I admit that legislation of this kind may be objected to in
      some respects, this bill is modelled upon idea obtained from an act passed by the Legislature
      of Pennsylvania. That law was declared unconstitutional. I took the trouble to send to
      Pennsylvania and get a copy of the bill, and I say to you that my opinion is that the
      constitutional objection raised in Pennsylvania will not obtain in this State. Again, the
      Pennsylvania law is very sweeping in its provisions while this bill is not. I do not speak for
      the great labor unions of New Albany because they have power, they have money, they have
      advocates, but I speak in the interests of a few here and a few men there. Here are men
      laboring all day in a cooper shop and making from ninety cents to one dollar and twenty cents
      a day, and are then compelled to accept payment in orders that are good out of such stock as
      their employers have on hand and at such prices as they see fit to charge and in such
      quantities as they are willing to give. I believe it is proper, and I think it is highly
      important that this bill be passed now.
     Mr. VAN SLYKE: The general features of the bill I can heartily endorse; but it seems to me
      that it ought to go into the hands of a committee. 
     Mr. SHAMBAUGH: I represent one of the leading cities of the State of Indiana. I remember
      very well that at the election last fall a pressure was brought to bear upon all of the
      candidates to secure the introduction here of a bill of this character, and I will say here
      that I have prepared a bill similar to this one and I heartily endorse this bill and hope it
      will pass. 
     Mr. THOMPSON: I have no objection to this bill, yet I oppose its passage before referring it
      to a committee. I represent a laboring class of people, but I want to see justice done both to
      the employer and to the employe. If this bill is right it will not lose anything in the hands
      of a committee. I am opposed to passing it under a suspension of the rules. 
     Mr. PATTON: There seems to be a struggle now between the Republican and Democratic parties
      as to which shall get nearest to the laboring man, and in that struggle we are apt to go too
      far. This bill imposes a hardship upon the poor people. You pass this law and it will take
      away one half of all those little industries that are operated by men of small means. You go
      to your county and see who are running the saw mills and making the brick. They have but
      little or no capital and must do the best they can to give their men employment. I say this
      bill ought not to be passed because it will not relieve the wants of those it is intended to
      relieve. I am in favor of this bill going to a committee, but I am opposed to this
      discrimination between men who have equal rights.
     Mr. MORSE: We know that a great many persons are desirous of legislation in the interests of
      the laboring people. I think this is one of the cases; but I think myself, that this bill
      ought to go to a committee and be thoroughly digested. 
     Mr. PLEAK : I indorse the principles of this bill, but I do not feel prepared to pass upon
      this bill now, and think that the laboring man will receive fair treatment if this bill is
      sent to a committee and some of its more stringent measures-stricken out. 
     Mr. SCOTT: From what I have heard of the bill I think I am in favor of it. I think a bill of
      some such character ought to be passed. This is a species of class legislation and we ought to
      be careful how our steps are taken. Bills of this kind ought to be carefully digested. I move
      that it lay upon the table and be referred to the committee when appointed. 
     Mr. STUBBLEFIELD: I am in favor of the bill. My neighbors are laboring men, and I know how
      they have been imposed upon by having to take orders in pay for their work. But I am in favor
      of this bill going to a committee because I believe it is more likely to pass. I am In favor
      of anything that alleviates the sufferings of the laboring men, and I am proud that this bill
      is introduced by a man who has probably never done a day's labor in his life. (Laughter.) 
     Mr. ROBINSON: I come from a county that is largely interested in the laboring man's
      welfare--a county that mines mores  coal than any other in
      the State of Indiana,and I think the features of this bill are very fair. I have a bill in my
      desk now on this subject. It is a fac simile of the one introduced two years ago and passed by
      this House aid a failed to get through the Senate. While I would not object to this bill going
      to the proper committee I fear a similar result. 
      Mr. JEWETT : I want the voice of every member of this House recorded in favor of this bill,
      that it may not be my bill nor your bill but the bill of this House. I do not pose as a
      laboring man, but before my young head had seen nineteen summers, as a common miner I earned
      the bread I ate, and I am not ashamed of it. I think no man is higher than the man who is
      laboring in the sphere where God placed him. I do not put this in for buncomb. It is to
      protect the laboring man, and to punish those who will not do the square thing by him, that I
      have introduced this bill. I disclaim any interest in this measure except the interest of
      common humanity, but I know that this crying evil exists. It is such legislation as I want
      because it is clammored for. It is a right step in the right direction. 
     The motion was agreed to by a two-thirds, yea and nay vote, so the rules were suspended and
      the bill finally passed the House of Representatives. 
     Mr. HARRELL sent up a protest again the journal being allowed to stand as read. 
     The SPEAKER said that if in proper language it would be entered on the journal.
    
    
     BILLS FOR ACTS WERE INTRODUCED BY 
     Mr. Harrell [H. R. 15]: To amend Section 3 of the law relating to free turnpikes.
     Mr. Conger [H. R. 16]: To prevent frauds in the registering and giving of the pedigrees of
      stock. .
     Mr. Ackman [H. R. 17]: To amend Section 5314 of the law relating to the sale of a
      intoxicating liquor. 
     Mr. Askren [H. R. 18]: To amend Section 64 of the act prescribing the duties of Justices in
      criminal cases. 
     Mr. Fleece [H. R. 19]: Appropriating $125,000 to
      defray the expenses of the present session of the General Assembly. The rules were dispensed
      with and the bill was passed the three readings. 
     Messrs. Fleece [H. R. 20] and Brown [H. R. 21]: To regulate the sale of intoxicating
      liquors. 
     Mr. Grose [H. R. 22]: To provide for the completion and furnishing of the three new
      Hospitals for the Insane. 
     The House then adjourned until ten o'clock, a. m. 
    

   

   
   
   
    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS. 
    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE. 
    
    IN SENATE.
    
      WEDNESDAY, January 12, 1887.
    
     The PRESIDENT pro tem stated that the News and Journal had published a notice that Senator
     Harrison had been denied admission to the Senate chamber. If that be true the chair regrets it
     very much. If the Senator had called my attention to the fact he would have been admitted with
     his friends. Senator Harrison is entitled to the freedom of the Senate floor, as far as the
     chair is concerned and as far as every Democratic Senator is concerned, and when he appears he
     shall be admitted--he and his friends.
    Mr. FOWLER, not being in accord with the views on State finances held by the majority, and
     not agreeing with the recommendations of the Governor in regard to providing means for carrying
     on the State Government, resigned the place assigned him as chairman of the Finance
      Committee.
    
    The President pro. tem. appointed Senator French to fill the vacancy. 
    
     THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR-ELECT.
     Mr. DRAKE offered the following:
     Whereas, Lieutenant Governor Robertson is now present in the Senate chamber to take the
      chair as President of the Senate; therefore, I move that a committee of two Senators be
      appointed to escort the Lieutenant Governor to this chair as presiding officer of the
      Senate.

     Mr. DRAKE: It is our duty to assert our position on this question. An election was held
      under the forms prescribed by law. The returns of the vote for Lieutenant Governor were
      transmitted to the House of Representatives, and the result published and declared by the
      Speaker of the House, and the Lieutenant Governor took the oath of office in the House of
      Representatives in open session. There are acts that are historical, and they give to the
      Lieutenant Governor a prima facia right, when he is present in this chamber, to take his seat
      now as President of this Senate. to take his seat now as President of this Senate. And we
      assert, Mr. President, that it is not within the power of this Senate, nor within the power of
      any member of this Senate, to exclude him; and that any such attempt would be rebellious and
      wrong; and we demand now that this committee be appointed, and that the Lieutenant Governor be
      seated in his chair. 
     Mr. MULLINIX: Yesterday there was a resolution offered by a Senator on the opposite side, to
      place upon our minutes an endorsement of an action that had not occurred. Yesterday we were
      called upon to place on our records a statement that we had taken part in counting ballots
      cast for a Lieutenant Governor, when in fact we had adjourned over until the day of those
      ballots were counted. Now, Mr. President, they come again this morning and ask that a
      committee be appointed to place in the chair a man we declared has no rights here whatever.
      Personally I have kindly feelings towards---- 
     Mr. FOWLER (interposing) : I rise to a point of order; that this matter has been disposed of
      by a resolution of the Senate which declared that no Lieutenant Governor was elected. I insist
      on my point of order, and that this resolution be declared out of order. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: Early in this session a resolution was offered reciting the law and
      the fact, that there was no Lieutenant Governor elected at the election in 1886. That
      resolution was adopted under the previous question, a motion to reconsider and a motion to lay
      that motion. on the table were adopted, and that action forever put that question at rest, so
      far as this Senate is concerned. Therefore, any attempt to take the matter up and consider it
      in any way is out of order. [See page 33.] 
     Messrs. DRAKE and DAVIS appealed from the decision. 
     
     
     On motion by Mr. BAILEY the appeal was laid on the table by yeas 31,nays 19.
     
      Mr. CAMPBELL presented the formal application of Lieutenant Governor-elect Robertson for
      the chair. 
     Mr. BAILEY moved the application, be rejected without reading. 
     Mr. CAMPBELL: It is in respectful terms and should be read. 
     Mr. BAILEY: This paper has been presented by the Senator from Hendricks as coming from a man
      pretending to occupy the position of Lieutenant Governor. He says in his communication that he
      is Lieutenant Governor,and I say this Senate can not afford to stultify itself by allowing it
      to go upon the journal. I believe the motion is in order, and, that Democratic Senators cannot
      afford to even hear this communication read. 
     Mr. MCDONALD, of Whitley : I believe I am acting as a juror here; I am
      under oath as a member of this body, and my vote will never be given to gag anything. I
      propose that our record shall be fair and square, and consequently democratic. I have no
      objection to this being read; it can't affect our record at all; and I am in favor of
      these things being done fairly, squarely and decently. As to the question of the
      constitutional right of Colonel Robertson to the office, when it comes up in a regular Way, it
      should have decent consideration. 
     Mr. FRENCH: Any communication coming to the Senate from Colonel Robertson should be decently
      treated. But the paper now offered is a message coming not from Robert S. Robertson but from
      Lieutenant Governor Robertson. Who is Lieutenant Governor Robertson? So far as this Senate is
      concerned ; so far as the Senate's journal is concerned; so far as action taken here is
      concerned, in which this minority took a part, there is no such person in existence in the
      State of Indiana as "Lieutenant Governor Robertson." I know no such a man, our
      record knows no such a man, and I am opposed, strenuously opposed, to have such a paper read
      here in the face of our record. 
     Mr. BARRETT: I do not know what this petition contains, but the right of petition is a
      privileged right. I know the petitioner, and I believe he is seeking to make a formal demand
      for a place that, will be denied him. I have the pleasure of recognizing Colonel Robertson as
      a friend and as a gentleman, who will take the steps necessary to assert his rights.
      Personally it would give me great pleasure to bow to him as presiding officer of this body
      were he legally and constitutionally elected; and I think Democrats on this side of the
      chamber cannot afford to refuse the application of the gentleman, in order that he may go into
      the courts and test his rights, as I trust will be done. I know Colonel Robertson so well that
      I believe when he is denied the privilege of presiding over the Senate he will manfully go
      into the courts and assert that right, and not consent to play the martyr before the people of
      this State for two years to come. I think this is but a formal demand, and when it is denied
      he will go into court and assert his rights, and that privilege, as far as my vote is
      concerned, he shall have at all times. 
     Mr. WINTER I do not propose to go into a discussion of this question--it would take too
      long. Lieutenant Governor Robertson is to-day de jure the rightful Lieutenant Governor of the
      State of Indiana, and any denial of his right to perform the duties of that office is a wrong.
      Upon the precise question now before the Senate I desire to say a word. You have been, told
      that Governor Robertson should be accorded by the Senate the privilege of haying a
      communication read in the Senate. I undertake to say that there is a higher law in the State
      of Indiana, and that higher law is the Constitution of the State or Indiana; and that Governor
      Robertson, cannot be put in the attitude of coming here sun being heard by the Senate of
      Indiana as a matter of favor and privilege; but he, in common with th humblest citizen, has a
      right to be hear, whenever he presents himself in proper form. Senators seem to forget the
      Constitution. In the Revised Statutes, Section 76 of the Constitution says: (Reads.) Not only
      Lieutenant Governor Robertson, but the two hundred and thirty thousand electors who cast their
      votes for him on the second day of last November say he has a grievance which he desires to
      present to this body. It is not a privilege to be awarded to them by this body,but it is a
      right which cannot be denied without revolutionary proceedings. He has a right to present that
      communication to this body, and we cannot deny him that right. I want a majority of this
      Senate, if they dare, to assume the responsibility to say that a man who received a majority
      of the votes of the electors, of this State at the last election--a man who has received three
      wounds on the battle-field defence of your rights, shall not be heard by this Senate when he
      comes before it in a respectful manner. 
     Mr. JOHNSON: I do not understand the Senator from Hendricks (Mr. Campbell) as appearing as
      an attorney for Colonel Robertson. I understand he is not here as a hired attorney for Colonel
      Robertson but as a representative of the people of the state of Indiana. He demands the right
      of Colonel Robertson to present a memorial. Every citizen has the right of petition. It is
      true the Democratic majority here has denied that there was any position to be filled by the
      election of Colonel Robertson to the office of Lieutenant Governor; but it is not true that
      the Republicans of this Senate have been permitted to place upon the journal of this Senate
      the position they take upon that question. They are now asking that a petition shall be placed
      before this Senate! Will the majority refuses this right which every citizen has under the
      Constitution and laws? 
     Mr. WEIR: I am ready to say as one of the members of this body, that I commend the courses
      pursued by Colonel Robertson, No one has any right to find fault with the people of the State
      or with the course they pursued in 1886 upon this question of the election of Lieutenant.
      Governor. As an opinion was given by the Attorney General of the State, that an election would
      be legal, the people held that election and, a  majority
      of votes cast were given Robert S. Robertson for Lieutenant Governor. I believe, and my course
      has been shaped from that belief,that there was no legally elected Lieutenant Governor in
      1886. But it matters not, although the people, may have held that election, if in
      contravention of the constitutional provision, it was simply void. That is the position taken
      by the majority of this body. We have all the time, and I think I may say Senators in the
      majority generally, having understood Colonel Robertson as making a formal demand to preside.
      I do not know a single thing the gentleman has done of which complaint reasonably be made. I
      know of no instance where he has pursued a course that not have been taken by myself or other
      Senator similarly situated. Now shall it be said that this Senate will not give him an
      opportunity to make his demand? It in no wise affects what has transpired heretofore. Let the
      demand be made, and it is then for the President of this Senate to decline it with such
      remarks as he desires to make. I will never vote to reject that communication which, under the
      circumstances, I believe is properly made. I think I may say I know the contents of this
      communication, therefore I move to lay the motion to reject upon the table. 
     Mr. BAILEY : I will withdraw the motion to reject, that it may be read for information.
     Mr. FOWLER : I wish to say a few words in defining my position in regard to this matter.
      Here is a communication presented by a Senator. I do not know what it contains. We have been
      told-probably the substance of it, but I want to hear it read. I would vote to have any
      communication coming from the most humble citizen read if presented by a Senator. That would
      compromise no one. The reading of this communication can in no way compromise the office now
      in controversy. After it is read if it is not a proper document to go upon the journals it
      ought to be rejected. I do not know how I shall vote on that proposition. 
      Mr. BAILEY : I will consent that this petition be read simply for information and then the
      motion to reject will be renewed.
      The PRESIDENT pro. tem.: The chair would have ordered the reading of it, unless the Senate
      voted otherwise, anyhow. 
     Mr. URMSTON : I understand it to be a function of the President of the Senate to examine all
      papers to be read, and if in his opinion it such matter as this Senate has no right to take
      into consideration, to refuse it to be allowed to be read. It has been decided by a resolution
      of the Senate that there has been no Lieutenant Governor elected. If the President would
      examine that paper he might find it signed "Lieutenant Governor" and addressed to
      this body. Now, if we are to be annoyed with that kind of petitions and motions there is no
      telling when it will end. As far as this matter of Lieutenant Governor is concerned it has
      been decided by this body for all time to come, unless it comes up in another way outside of
      this Senate. If this paper contains such matter as ought not to go upon our journals it ought
      not to be read. 
     Mr. KENNEDY : I have not said a word. on this question because I am a farmer and these
      gentlemen have put the question together in lawyer phrases. I have heard of a smelling
      committee to smell if there is any danger. I don't think it important that a presiding
      officer shall examine everything that is offered. It seems to me this whole subject has been
      exhausted in a speaking point of view. Two hundred and twenty-nine thousand Democrats have
      decided that there was a vacancy to be filled in the office of Lieutenant Governor, and about
      eight thousand Prohibitionists, and three thousand Greenbackers and two hundred and
      thirty-three thousand Republicans have also decided that there was a vacancy to be filled. I
      don't know lawyer's phrases, but I know that sometimes in tho country when a man
      buys a horse and gets cheated and finds he can get out of it by saying he is not twenty-one
      years old he does so, and it is called playing the baby act. I don't know what lawyers
      call it, but this looks to me like playing the baby act. I say this Senate can't bring
      this matter before the courts. That is a matter which belongs to Lieutenant Governor
      Robertson. We can't take away his rights. He is in every sense Lieutenant Governor and
      should preside over this Senate. This is plain farmer talk about it. And that is common sense.
      When I meet Colonel Robertson I say "Good morning, Governor." (Laughter.) 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The opposition to the paper, or whatever it is coming from Robert S.
      Robertson, has been withdrawn as I understand it. 
     Mr. BAILEY : The motion is modified so as to permit the reading of it. The motion to reject
      has not been withdrawn. 
     Mr. SELLERS: If this is a motion to reject it cannot be modified. The Senator may consent
      that for the information of the Senate the paper may be read. 
     Mr. BAILEY: The motion was to reject without reading; and it is modified thus far: omit that
      part "without reading''--now the motion is simply to reject. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The motion is to reject; pending that the paper will be. read
      for' information. 
     
     
     
      
       

        It was read by the Clerk, as follows : INDIANAPOLIS, January, 12,1887.
        
         To the Indiana Senate : 
        
        Gentlemen--I have the honor to inform you that, having taken the oath of office which is
         hereto attached, I am in possession of the office or Lieutenant Governor of the State of
         Indiana; am able to attend your sessions and ready to enter upon the constitutional
         functions prescribed in Section 2 of Article 5 of the State Constitution, to-wit: To be
         President of the Senate, with all the rights' and duties in said section provided. 
        That you have, in my judgment, wrongfully excluded and prevented me from exercising that
         function and duty of my office. 
        
         Against this, your action, I do hereby most earnestly protest and remonstrate, and
         respectfully demand my rights.
        
          R. S. Robertson, Lieutenant Governor.
        
       
      
     
      [To this was attached the jurat of Judge Lewes C. Walker regarding the administering of the
      oath of office, as printed at the top of page 45 in this book.) 
     Mr. BAILEY Now I renew my motion to reject it. I make the motion to reject this
      communication for the reason that it is in contravention of the action of this Senate taken
      last Thursday and Friday.
      Mr. WINTER I rise to a point, of order. I understand a motion to reject is not debatable. 
     Mr. SELLERS: I was up to make the same point of order. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: I suppose the point of order is well taken. 
     Mr. SELLERS : The reason there can be no discussion is because it is an improper paper for
      the records of the Senate.
      The yeas and nays were demanded by two Senators, and while being taken the following
      explanation of votes were given by Senators as their names were called : 
     Mr. BARRETT Believing the person claiming the office is not Lieutenant Governor, and not
      entitled to preside over this body; and believing that the petition presented should therefore
      be rejected, I vote " aye." 
     Mr. DeMOTTE: Knowing what is in that paper, and knowing that Robert S. Robertson is duly
      elected Lieutenant Governor of this State and entitled by virtue of his office to preside over
      this Senate, I vote " no. "
     Mr. MARSHALL : Believing that when General Manson entered upon the discharge of the duties
      of the Federal office which he accepted he thereby vacated the office of Lieutenant Governor
      of Indiana, thereby creating a vacancy in said office; and believing that a majority of the
      Democrats of this State acted in good faith when they went to the election last November and
      voted for Judge Nelson; and believing that the Republicans acted in good faith when they voted
      for Colonel Robertson; and believing that the Prohibitionists and Greenbackers also acted in
      good faith when voting at that election for their candidate for Lieutenant Governor, I vote
      "no." 
     Mr. MCDONALD, of Whitley : Believing there was no vacancy; and believing
      there could be no ,Lieutenant Governor elected last November, and that such election was
      unconstitutional and void; and for the further reasons given by my colleague, Mr. Barrett, I
      vote "aye."
     Mr. MULLINIX: Believing the election of Lieutenant Governor last fall was unconstitutional,
      I vote "aye." 
     Mr. SELLERS : Believing this is not a political question, but a square question of law, and
      that the law is against Colonel Robertson, I vote "aye." 
     Mr. SMITH, of Wells : Believing as I do that this is a question that ought to be settled by
      the courts of this State;. and believing there was no vacancy in them office of Lieutenant
      Governor that could be filled in 1886; and therefore that Colonel Robertson has no right to
      preside over this Senate, I vote "aye." 
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Jasper: Believing as I do that the Lieutenant Governor cannot be a member
      of this Senate; and believing that Lieutenant Governor Manson by accepting a better office
      lost his place here; and knowing no Constitution or law providing for a successor by election,
      but this question having been settled by the highest authority under the Constitution--by the
      people of the State-I vote "no."
     Mr. WEIR : Believing that no legal election for Lieutenant Governor could occur in 1886 I
      vote "no."
     
     

      The PRESIDENT pro tem.: I didn't vote. The vote resulted--yeas 30, nays 19. So the
      communication was rejected. 
     Mr. WINTER: I desire to formally protest against the action of the Senate in denying
      Governor Robertson the right to preside. At the proper time I shall submit it in writing. The
      present occupant of the chair is a usurper. 
     The PRESIDENT pro: tem.: If the Senator from Marion (Mr. Winter) thinks the conduct of the
      President of the Senate is usurpation, I invite him and his friend, Mr. Robertson, into the
      courts, and I will go to-day at noon or at any other time and settle the question there with
      him. [Applause.] 
     Mr. GRIFFITH : There are several contests pending in this body, among them Branaman vs.
      McDonald, Passage v. Harness, Puntenny vs. Kennedy, Surface vs. Schroyer, Douglas vs. McClure,
      Patton vs. Thompson and Murdock vs. Dresser. I desire to move that the papers on these
      contested election cases be referred to the Committee on Elections at once. 
     Thee PRESIDENT pro tem.: If there is no objection the reference will be made.
    
    
     DOORS OF THE SENATE.
     Mr. DeMOTTE: The doors of this chain been have been looked against Senators. Senators have
      pounded on the doors and have been kept back and enquired as to what business they have in the
      Senate. 
     Mr. BAILEY (interrupting,): I want to inquire if the Senator has been refused admittance? 
     Mr. DEMOTTE: Yes sir, I have; repeatly, on two days. Yesterday morning I presented myself at
      the proper door and found it locked, when I made an alarm--a very considerable alarm. [See top
      of second column, page 46.] I then discovered a doorkeeper standing in one corner of the
      corridor and I asked him to be admitted. He said I could not get in at that door, but took me
      to a door of the lobby, unlocked it from the outside and with dignity escorted me to my seat.
      The other day he allowed me to enter and locked the door behind me. I found armed men there
      who looked at me as though I was ready to explode, 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: I will direct the Doorkeeper that on all occasions the Senator from
      Porter (Mr. DeMotte) shall have free access to this chamber, and shall not be denied to come
      and go as he will.
     
     Mr. DeMOTTE (resuming): I tried yesterday morning to pass out of that door. The doorkeeper
      sat there and rose to open it. I was so violently jostled that my spectacles were pushed from
      my head. I opened the. door, and I doubt if it has been so wide open once since this session
      began. Is it necessary to sustain the back bone, of which we heard so much yesterday, by
      locking the doors of this hall? I appeal to you, gentlemen -----
     Mr. BAILEY (interrupting) : This is certainly not a question of privilege; it is criticising
      an officer of this body; and there a rule of this Senate which excludes all except Senators
      from this chamber. 
     Mr. DEMOTT: That rule means to keep out everybody but members, and would keep out Republican
      Senators if it dared.
     Mr. BAILEY: The Senator should take the proper method to modify or change the rule. The time
      he was excluded was during an adjournment, at a time when the Senate chamber is in the hands
      of the Doorkeeper and his officers. He was informed he could get admission at another door,
      and he went there and obtained admission. His argument is out of order. 
     Mr. DeMOTTE: I have a right to come and go free and unmolested. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem. (interposing): I am inclined to let him speak to his heart's
      content. I don't understand and would not sanction that you have been denied the right to
      come in when you so desire, and the Doorkeeper can keep all the doors open. I thought you
      would be satisfied to enter the cloak room or anti-chamber and find your way in, but if you
      desire the Doorkeeper shall open the main entrance the order will be given. He shall throw the
      doors wide open and you shall enter therein. 
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I will submit a motion. In order that Senators may have access to their desks
      and the people of the State have opportunities to examine the building in construction of
      which their money has been expended, that the Doorkeeper be instructed to open the doors at
      eight o'clock, a.m., and keep them open until nine o'clock p, m., during every
      week-day, and admit Senators at all times, and all orderly citizens when the Senate is not in
      actual session. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The resolution is referred to the Committee on
       Rules. 
     Mr. DeMOTTE (continuing) There never has been a Senate chamber so closed, to my knowledge.
      The people desire to view s monument of their own building. I suppose the doorkeepers are
      acting in obedience to the action of a Democratic cancus. In excluding people from viewing
      this building they are acting unworthily. I move the adoption of my resolution. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The resolution had been referred to the Committee on
       Rules. 
     Mr. DEMOTTE: The Chair had no right to make that reference. I appeal from that act of the
      Chair. It is a motion. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The motion referred to the Committee on Rules. 
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I appeal from the decision of the Chair. 
     Mr. BAILEY: I move to lay the appeal on the table. 
     Mr. TRIPPETT: I rise to a point of order. The Chair has a right to refer the resolution to
      the Committee on Rules.
     
     The PRESIDENT pro tern.: The point of order is sustained. 
     Mr. SELLERS: I only desire to refer the Senator from Porter (Mr. DeMotte) to Rule 61.[See
      bottom of page 24, this book.]
    
    
     PROPOSED JOINT CONVENTION.
     
     
     
      
       
        Mr. GRIFFITH offered a resolution directing the Doorkeeper to place in the Senate chamber
         on Wednesday, the 19th inst., one hundred chairs for the occupancy of members of the House
         of Representatives, invited by Senate resolution to meet in joint convention at noon to
         publish and compare the vote of the day previous taken in each house for United States
         Senator.
       
      
     
     
      Under the operation of the previous question the resolution was adopted by yeas 31, nays
      18. 
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
      PROTEST OF REPUBLICAN SENATORS.
     
     
     
      
       
        Mr. WINTER presented the following :
         Be it Remembered, That on Thursday, the sixth day of January, 1887, the members of the
         Senate holding over and newly elected of the fifty-fifth General Assembly of the State of
         Indiana assembled in the Senate chamber in the Capitol in the city of Indianapolis, and
         being so assembled when the hour of ten o'clock, a. m., arrived, the Honorable Alonzo
         G. Smith,a holding Senator from the from the Senatorial District composed of the counties
         of Jennings and Jackson of his own motion in the absence of the Lieutenant Governor took
         the President's chair and gavel and announced that the time for the organization of
         the Senate of the fifty-fifth General Assembly having arrived the Senate would now come to
         order, and the Senators and the senators-elect should take their seats. Thereupon, the
         Senator, from Marion holding over [Mr. Winter] arose in his place, and addressing the
         occupant of the chair as "Mr. Chairman" demanded the organization of the Senate
         should be had in accordance with the provisions of law relating thereto, and that the
         Auditor of State (Honorable James H. Rice) who was then present in the Senate chamber,
         should preside in such organization. Said Smith declared the Senator from Marion to be out
         of order and required him to take his seat. Whereupon, the Senator from Marion announced
         that he appealed from such decision to the Senate, and the Senator elect from Wayne
         seconded the appeal; but the said Smith refused to entertain the appeal, declared that
         nothing was in order except the organization of the Senate, and required the Senators from
         Marion and Wayne to take their seats, whereupon the Senator from Marion protested, the
         Senator from Wayne giving notice at the time that he joined therein against the action of
         said Smith as being a violation of law and a violation of law and a violation of the rights
         and privileges of the Senate, and  members thereof, and
         announced that such protest would be reduced to writing and signed by himself and other:
         Senators who desired to join therein, and demanded that it should at the proper time be
         entered. on the journal. During such protest said Smith, occupying the President's
         desk, rapped continually with the gavel and frequently ordered and demanded that the
         Senators from Marion and Wayne should take their seats, said Smith maintaining his position
         in the President's desk, and further asserting his right to organize the Senate
         directed the Auditor of State to call the roll of holding over Senators, which was done ;
         and then directed said Auditor to call the roll of Senators-elect, which was likewise done.
         Said Smith then directed that the Senators-elect by relays of thirteen at a time, should
         present themselves at the bar of the Senate and take the oath of office, which was done.
         Thereupon, the Senator from Marion [Mr. Winter] arose in his place and addressed the
         occupant of the chair as "Mr. Chairman" stated that he desired to state a point
         of order going to the organization of the Senate, the point being that the Senators-elect
         having taken the oath of office and the Lieutenant Governor not being present the first
         thing in order was the election of a President pro tempore so that the Senate should have
         under its control all further proceedings in its organization, in which demand the Senator
         from Wayne [Mr. Johnson] joined. But said Smith declared the Senator from Marion and the
         senator from Wayne to be out of order because they did not address the occupant of the
         chair as "Mr. President," and because further, nothing was in order except the
         organization of the Senate, and required the Senators to take their seats. Whereupon, the
         Senator from Marion stated that he appealed from the decision to the Senate, and the
         Senator from Wayne [Mr. Johnson] joined in the appeal; but said Smith refused to entertain
         the appeal, Whereupon, the Senator from Marion protested in behalf of himself and
         colleagues against such proceedings of said Smith and announced that the protest would be
         reduced to writing at the proper time. Said Smith then announced that the organization of
         the Senate should proceed by the election of a Principal Secretary, Assistant Secretary and
         Doorkeeper; and the election of such officers was then had, said Smith occupying the
         President's desk, calling for the nomination of such officers, putting the questions
         on such elections, directing the Auditor of State to call the roll of members; the roll
         thereupon being called by such Auditor of State in obedience to such directions, and
         announcing the result of such elections. 
        And be it Remembered, That said Smith in all such proceedings did not have or claim to
         have any other or different authority therefor except. under and by virtue of an election
         to the office of President pro tempore of the Senate of the fifty-fourth General Assembly,
         had on the thirteenth day of April, 1885. 
        Be it further Remembered, That upon the election of such officers above named the Senator
         from Gibson and Posey (Mr. French) offered a preamble and resolution reciting that the
         office of Lieutenant Governor was vacant, that said Smith had been elected President of the
         Senate for the occasion by the Senate of the fifty-fourth General Assembly, at the time,
         herein before stated, and therefore resolving that said Smith was recognized and elected as
         the President of the Senate of Indiana, and demanded the previous question on the adoption
         of such preamble and resolution. Said Smith thereupon called the Senator from White and
         Pulaski (Mr. Sellers) to the chair, and the Senator from Marion [Mr. Winter] arose in his
         place and demanded a division of the question so that the vote should be taken upon
         preamble and resolution separately, but the chairman decided that such demand was out of
         order. Whereupon, the Senator from Marion appealed to the Senate from such decision, but
         the chair refused to entertain the appeal and such resolution was thereupon adopted as
         shown in the journal. 
        Be it further Remembered, That the Senator from Marion (Mr. Bailey) introduced a
         resolution accompanied by certain rules resolving that such rules be adopted for th
         government of the Senate, and demanded the previous question upon the adoption of such
         resolution, and such demand having been seconded by the Senate, the Senator from Hendricks
         and Putnam (Mr. Campbell) demanded A division of the question so that the vote might be
         taken separately upon such rules, but the chair (Mr. Smith) decided that it was too late to
         have a division of the question after the previous question had been seconded, and that it
         was out of order. The Senator from Marion [Mr. Winter] appealed from such decision to the
         Senate, but the chair refused to entertain the appeal stating that an appeal could not be
         taken after the demand for the previous question had been seconded. Thereupon the Senate
         ordered, the main question to be now put, and upon such question being stated, being the
         adoption of the rules, the Senator from Marion [Mr. Winter] stated the point of order that
         the third, tenth and other of such rules,, which provide that from the decision of the
         President of the Senate as to which of two Senators should be recognized and that an appeal
         might be taken, upon the failure of the President of the Senate to put such appeal or any
         other question to the Senate any two Senators might call upon the Secretary of the Senate
         to put such appeal or question, and such appeal or. question, should thereupon be put by
         such Secretary and the result stand as the judgment or the Senate, was an infringement of
         the constitutional functions of the President of the Senate. But the chair ruled that the,
         point of order was not well taken, and refused to permit the Senator from Marion to appeal
         from such decision to the Senate, and the Senator from Marion thereupon. protested against
         such ruling and he re-[fusal] [re]-fusal to allow the
         question to be divided. The Senator from Wayne (Mr. Johnson) also protested against the
         character of the rules proposed to be adopted. Such rules were thereupon adopted as they
         appear upon the journal of the Senate.
        Now, therefore, we the undersigned, members of the Senate of the Fifty-fifth General
         Assembly of the State of Indiana, in order that the proceedings herein before set out may
         not be taken as and for a precedent, having protested and do now protest against each and
         all such proceedings for the following reasons: 
        
        
          We do protest against all actions of the said Alonzo G. Smith as herein
          before recited and set out, up to the passage of the resolution before referred to by
          which he was elected President of the Senate, for the reason that the said Smith was not
          properly and legally elected President pro tempore of the Fifty-fifth General Assembly as
          claimed by him, because at the time of said election the Lieutenant Governor of the State
          of Indiana was neither acting as Governor nor absent from the Senate, but was then present
          in the Senate presiding thereover as shown by the journal of that body; and for the
          further reason that even if said Smith was properly and legally elected President pro
          tempore by the Senate of the Fifty-fourth General Assembly, said election could give him
          no right to organize or preside over the Senate of the Fifty-fifth General Assembly ,
          because the Senate of the State of Indiana is not a continuing body, one half of its
          entire membership going out of office on the day succeeding the day of the election at
          which their successors were elected, leaving no quorum of the Senate in existence at the
          time, and putting an end to the term of office of all officers elected by such
          Senate.
          Because the Lieutenant Governor not being present when the time arrived
          for the organization of the Senate, it was the duty of the Auditor of State (Honorable
          James H. Rice) to preside in the organization of the Senate of the Fifty-fifth General
          Assembly until a President pro tempore had been elected.
         Because said acts and proceedings of said Smith were unlawful and a breach
          of the rights and privileges of the Senate, and the members thereof and in violation of
          parliamentary law and usage.
          As to the proceedings upon the adoption of the preamble and resolution
          offered by the Senator from Posey and Gibson, by which said Smith was recognized as the
          President of the Senate of the State of Indiana, because, first, such proceedings as to
          the refusal to permit the question upon the adoption of the preamble and resolution, was a
          violation of parliamentary law; second, because as to the recognition contained in said
          resolution of the facts stated in the preamble thereof that said Smith had been elected
          President pro tempore of the Senate of the Fifty-fourth General Assembly, it was not true
          in law, as said Smith as herein before state was not legally elected President of said
          Senate, and moreover, even if he had been legally so elected, such election could give him
          no right or color of right to act as President pro tempore of the Senate of the
          Fifty-fifth General Assembly, and therefore no recognition of such right should have been
          made.
          As to the proceedings herein before set out upon the adoption of the rules
          for the government of the Senate, because, first, the refusal to allow a division of the
          question so that a vote might be taken upon each rule separately, and denying the right of
          appeal from such refusal, was in violation of parliamentary law and usage; and second,
          such of said rules as provide an appeal may be taken from the decision of the President as
          to which of two Senators is entitled to the floor, and that upon the refusal of the
          President of the Senate to put such appeal or any other question to the Senate, any two
          Senators may require the Secretary to put such question or appeal to the Senate, thereupon
          that the Secretary shall put such question of appeal, are an infringement of the
          constitutional functions of the President of the Senate; third, because the rule by which
          a less number of Senators than twenty-one with the President, or twenty-two in his absence
          are attempted to be deprived of the power to meet, adjourn from day to day and compel the
          attendance of absent Senators, is in violation of the Constitution, and as applied to the
          present Senate would deprive the political minority of any power to compel the attendance
          of the political majority, who in themselves are less than a quorum, and thus put it in
          the power of such majority to dissolve the Senate at their pleasure by simply absenting
          themselves therefrom: fourth, that the effect of such rules as a whole is to crush and
          destroy the minority, and prevent it from operating as a check or restraint on the actions
          of the majority.
        
        And we respectfully ask that this our protest be entered upon the journal of the
         Senate.

     Mr. BAILEY: The record of the proceedings of this Senate I apprehend is cared for by the
      proper officers of this body, including the Assistant Secretary, and his corps of clerks. This
      document seeks to make a record for this body such as the parties subscribing thereto desire
      shall be made. I believe nothing could be more clearly out of order, therefore I move that
      this document be rejected.
     
     Mr. WINTER: IT is perfectly well known to every member of this body that the
      Secretary's journal does not show the matter in this protest, and it is simply because it
      does not appear there that the protest is offered. 
     Mr. BAILEY: Would you expect the journal of this Senate to contain matters ruled out of
      order? 
     Mr. WINTER: Certainly not, and that is why they cannot appear on the journal only by way of
      protest. 
     Mr. SELLERS: I think can settle this question in half a minute. I raise the point of order
      that a motion to reject will not lie, because the Constitution allows the right of protest and
      the reasons therefor stated on the journal. Whether this protest states the truth or not,
      their constitutional right is to have it entered on the journal. 
     Mr. WINTER : We have presented our protest in a parliamentary and respectable manner, and if
      our attention is called to anything otherwise we wills strike it out. 

     Mr. SELLERS: My recollection is that at the time they resolution of the Senator from Posey
      (Mr. French) was pending you asked for a division on the vote, after the Chair announced the
      Senate had seconded the demand for the previous question.
     Mr. WINTER: The fact is stated that the Chair ruled it out of order because the previous
      question had been seconded.

     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The demand for a division came too late, as I understood it.
     Mr. SELLERS (to Mr. WINTER): I think there is an error in that you have a division demanded
      in the wrong place.
     Mr. LOGSDON: I think this protest should be closely read and closely scrutinized. I move
      that it be referred to a select committee of five to inquire whether it states the facts
      correctly.
     MR. WEIR: I think there can be no doubt about the right to have a protest entered upon a
      journal if in proper language. It hardly seems necessary to have a committee of five to go
      over this matter.
     Mr. LOGSDON: That is true if it states the facts as they occurred, and if that matter can be
      settled without referring it to a committee I have no objection. But it is important it should
      state the facts as they occur red. Any member has the right to enter a protest against any
      proceedings, but I don't apprehend there should appear in that protest things that did
      not occur. 
     Mr. JOHNSON: This protest has been read in a clear and distinct manner by the reading clerk.
      I don't believe any of these facts are set out in the record, and unless there be at
      least a fair proportion of Senators who will state that the fact are not set forth in it ,it
      seems to me there is no occasion for delay in referring this protest to a committee, and
      therefore I think it should go on file at once. By superior numbers the majority here have
      been able to shape this matter to suit themselves, and I don't believe they will impair
      the only remaining right the minority have--the constitutional right to protest. I assisted in
      drawing that protest, and we endeavored only to state the facts and avoid any unparliamentary
      language as to what we conceived to be wrong action of the Senate. 
     Mr. WINTER : I am willing that time should be afforded for an examination of the protest.
      The minority are responsible for the statement of the facts. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: If you should place on file something not true;--I don't mean
      to say you state what is not true--but like most everybody you might be guilty of
      exaggeration, and if Senators in the majority remain silent they might he deemed as confessing
      the facts stated in the protest. It is only fair that the facts be stated right, and when
      right it can be placed upon record in the nature of a dissenting opinion. 
     Mr. TRIPPETT : I wish to add an amendment that the committee report to-morrow morning.
      Mr. WINTER : I think it proper for the majority, if they conclude the facts are not
      correctly stated, to make a statement on record. I would be  glad to consult with the Senator from White(Mr. Sellers) on the subject and see if we can
      agree. From an examination of the reports published in the papers the next day we are correct
      every respect. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: I would suggest to the Senator that if there was time given to
      consult with the majority--himself, Mr. Campbell and others--something may be agreed upon. 
     Mr. CAMPBELL: The right of protest amounts to nothing if the protest be referred to a
      committee controlled by the majority. We submit that statement as a statement of what
      occurred. We submit that we have a right to enter upon the journal our protest and I for one
      believe the Senate has no right or power to refer it to a committee, or submit it to revision
      or alteration. We have a right that the journal shall show our statement, and hope no effort
      will be made to refer it. 
     Mr. SELLERS: I agree that this matter ought not to be referred to a committee. If it does
      not state the facts it is the province of every Senator to contradict it. As far as the
      statement therein with reference to a demand for a division having been made before the motion
      for the previous question was seconded by the Senate, I say that did not occur. I am satisfied
      of that because I put that motion at once on taking the chair. I at once put the question
      because the motion had been made upon my assuming the chair or before it. Therefore I think
      the protest does not state the facts as they occurred. With this statement, that that part is
      in my opinion untrue, I desire to add that the responsibility of stating things that did not
      occur must rest with them,and no committee has the right to change it or prevent it being
      spread on record.
     Mr. WINTER: I desire the Senator from White (Mr. Sellers) shall be satisfied there is no
      mistake about what occurred, and I think he may satisfy himself by examining the reports made
      of the proceedings in the papers the next day. There was a great deal of noise in the chamber
      at the time. I am satisfied the Senator did not make that statement intentional. 
     Mr. SELLERS: My dissent to that statement I desire shall go into the records. They must
      assume the responsibility of the misstatement of facts. 
     Mr. WINTER: I desire to inquire whether the protest goes upon the journal ? 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: I suppose it takes no motion; but there is a mistake in it about a
      demand for a division of the question when the Senator from White (Mr. Sellers) was in the
      chair.

    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
    
      WEDNESDAY, January 12, 1887.
    
     The session was opened with prayer by E. J. Lantz, of the Central Christian Church. 
    Mr. HARRELL objected to his protest of Tuesday not being spread on the journal. 
    The SPEAKER said it had only been noted on the journal and not set out at length, as he was
     uncertain as to the proper practice and wished to bring the matter before the House.
    
     THE BEASLEY CONTEST.
      The Committee on Elections reported that. the Chairman of this committee
      has appointed Messrs. Linck, Carrick and Bertram as a sub-committee, with Mr. Linck as
      Chairman, to proceed to Vigo and Sullivan counties to take testimony in the contested election
      case of Downing vs. Beasley, and William 0. Patterson was appointed sergeant-at-arms for said
      sub committee, and Eugene Heins as stenographer for said sub-committee. . 
     The report was concurred in. 
    
    
     EXTA DOORKEEPERS. 
     Mr. GARDINER moved that a committee of three be appointed to whom shall be referred the
      request of the Doorkeeper for additional assistants. 
     Mr. JEWETT moved to amend the motion instructing the committee,in case they should recommend
      an additional force of employes, that they be required to explain their report the particular
      necessity for such increase. 
     Mr. GARDINER accepted the amendment. 
     The motion as amended was agreed to. 
     The Speaker announced Messrs. Gardiner, Dunn and Whitworth as the committee.
    
    
     A PROTEST--THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNORSHIP.
      Mr. HARRELL moved that the protest presented yesterday by Democratic members be now placed
      upon the journal of the House. 
     The protest was read, and the Speaker announced that unless objections were made it would be
      spread upon the journal. 
     It was so ordered.
      The protest is as follows: 
     
     
     
      
       
        Whereas, The Constitution upon the subject of opening and publishing the vote for
         Governor and Lieutenant Governors provides that such vote shall be opened and published in
         the presence of both Houses of the General Assembly; and, 
        Whereas, The Speaker of this House did, on the 10th day of January, 1887, in the absence
         of the Senate and contrary to the provisions of the Constitution, open and publish the vote
         cast at the last general election for Lieutenant Governor. 
        Now, therefore, the undersigned Representatives, being the minority of this House,
         protest against such proceedings, which we are powerless to prevent, as illegal and in
         violation of the Constitution and the Speaker's obligation to support the same, and as
         unwarranted, mischievious  and a dangerous precedent;
         and we further protest against the journal of this House showing that the Senate was
         present, when in truth and in fact it was not; and we request that this protest be entered
         on the journal of the House.

         the time during which they rendered such services, or were under orders of the Governor
         during the rebellion. 
       
      
     
    
    
     THE DATE PENALTY. 
     Mr. NIBLACK offered the following:
     
     
     
      
       
         Resolved, That the Committee on the Judiciary be instructed to
         inquire into the propriety and expediency of providing some more humane and less repulsive
         method of executing the death a penalty than hanging, and to report by bill or otherwise.
        
       
      
     
     Mr. PATTON made an ineffectual motion to amend by abolishing the death penalty. 
     The resolution was adopted. 
    
    
     EXTRADITION TREATY.
      Mr. CAVEN offered the following concurrent resolution, which was referred to the
       Committee on the Judiciary: 
     
     
     
      
       
        Whereas, Many persons guilty of the crimea of embezzlement in this State, have fled to
         the Dominion of Canada, where they are safe from pursuit and punishment because of the
         absence in the treaty between the United States and Great Britain of any provision
         respecting that crime, therefore 
        Resolved, By the House of Representatives of Indiana, the Senate concurring, that our
         Senators in Congress be and are hereby instructed to initiate such action as will lead to
         an amendment of the treaty above referred to, providing that a fugitive from justice from
         this country to Canada, and also reciprocal from the crime of embezzlement, shall be
         subject to extradition, as at present for other high crimes, and if possible that the same
         be retroactive for a period of ten years. 
       
      
     
     The House adjourned till to-morrow.
    
   
   
   
   
    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS. 
    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    IN SENATE. 
    
      THURSDAY, January 13, 1887.
    
     The session was opened with prayer by Rev. Mr. Bradley, of. Christ Church, Indianapolis.
    
     EXTRA CLERK. 
     A resolution was adopted authorizing the appointment of a clerk for the Committee
       on Elections and Labor Statistics.
     
    
    
     CONTESTED ELECTION CASES 
     Mr. TRIPPETT offered a resolution authorizing the Committee on Elections
      to appoint a sub-committee of three to take testimony in the pending contested election cases,
      which was adopted. 
    
    
     EXTRA DOORKEEPERS.
      Mr. BAILEY offered a resolution authorizing the Doorkeeper to appoint fifteen assistants in
      addition to those allowed by law, two of whom shall be colored men. 
     Mr. WINTER moved to amend by inserting in proper place, "all of whom shall be honorably
      discharged Union soldiers of the late war." 
     Mr. CAMPBELL desired that some reason should be given for the employment of this
      extraordinary number of doorkeepers. 
     Mr. BAILEY accepted the amendment. 
     Pending the yea and nay call--
     Mr. CAMPBELL explained his negative vote: Because no Senator has given any reason why we
      should have an additional force of fifteen men at per diem of five dollars each. 
     Mr. JOHNSON: If it can be shown there is any necessity for the appointment of an additional
      number of assistants by the doorkeeper I would gladly favor the resolution. But I have no
      satisfactory evidence that there is any need of them. In my humble opinion we have too many
      doorkeepers now. I see no necessity for incurring this additional expense. 
     Mr. MCDONALD, of Whitley : The reason is that there is a great deal more
      service to be performed here than in the old house. Another reason is that on the other side
      of the rotunda the House, I under stand, has fourteen extra ones. And I decidedly favor the
      amendment that these places shall go to the boys who went out to battle and left the rest at
      home. Therefore I vote "aye." 
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Jasper : I see no reason for additional assistant doorkeepers, therefore I
      vote "no." 
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion: I felt opposed to the resolution when first introduced but my
      associate from Marion (Mr. Winter) has relieved it from many objections. I was afraid we  would take these men from the light infantry. I vote
      "aye." 
     Mr. WINTER: My disposition was to mitigate the resolution as much as possible, but I am
      compelled to vote against it for the reason that no explanation has been given of the need of
      any more doorkeepers. And this seems to be in violation of law, for section four thousand nine
      hundred and seven of the Revised Statutes says (reads.) If there was an absolute necessity I
      could see some excuse for a violation of the statute, but as I do not I vote "no." 
     Mr. WEIR: I intend to be governed by what I believe to be a reasonable necessity. It will be
      remembered by Senators that heretofore we have had committee rooms at hotels and there was not
      reason for doorkeeper to take charge of them. Then in the Court House, two years ago, we had
      nearly this number. There are more doors to take care of in this building than in any court
      house. Then the committee rooms for thirty-one committees have to be taken care of. I think
      there is a reasonable necessity for twenty-two. (He enumerated their places.) Seven are
      allowed by statue, and this resolution provides fifteen more; seven and fifteen are
      twenty-two. Therefore I vote "aye."
     Mr. DUNCAN, of Hamilton: I have listened to the explanations, but there has not been a
      sufficient reason given for this increase, therefore I vote "no." 
     Mr. FOWLER: I did not vote at the time my name was called, for I was not satisfied that this
      resolution should pass. It is not a political question but a question of finance. Without an
      explanation of the need of this additional expense I should have voted no, but the Senator
      from Laporte (Mr. Weir) somewhat relieved my mind. I carefully noted the employes needed as he
      gave them, and it seems they will be needed here. Feeling that way about it I vote
      "aye."
     
     
      The vote was then announced--yeas 33, nays 15.
      So the resolution was adopted. 
     
     
     
      
       
        Mr. DAVIS presented the following protest: 
        Mr. President: I hereby protest against the action f this senate in authorizing the
         employment of fifteen assistant doorkeepers of this body for the following reasons: First,
         That such employment of assistant doorkeepers is for a greater number than is provided by
         section 4970 of the Revised Statutes of Indiana. Second, Such employment of assistant
         doorkeepers necessitates an unauthorized and useless expenditure of the public money. 
        I desire my protest spread upon the journal of the Senate.
        We join in the above protest.
        
         L. M. CAMPBELL, 
         A. M. KENNEDY,
         SIMEON P. THOMPSON, 
         NICHOLAS ENSLEY,
         J. N. HUSTON,
         C. C. DUNCAN,
         B. F. HARNESS,
        
       
      
     
    
    
      WIDOW OF JOHN A. LOGAN. 
     Mr. DRESER offered a joint resolution requesting Representatives and instructing our
      Senators in Congress to favor a pension for the widow of John S. Logan. 
     Mr. WINTER said there was no soldier in the late war who rendered more distinguished
      service, and he trusted the Senate would not hesitate to vote unanimously for the resolution. 
     MR. FOWLER concurred in the sentiment of the resolution, but objected to two or three words,
      viz: " and in peace."
     The resolution was adopted.
      A message from the House was laid before the Senate announcing the passage of several bills
      by the House, including one appropriating one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars for the
      expenses of this General Assembly, which was read the first time and referred to the
       Committee on Finance. 
    
    
     BILLS FOR ACTS WERE INTRODUCED BY
      Mr. Bailey [S. 67]: To fix the salaries of certain county officers. 
     Mr. Barrett [S. 68]: To maintain political purity.

      the bill read twice by title, the third time by sections, and passed the Senate by yeas 45.
      nays 0.)

     Mr. Fowler [S. 82]: To prevent exorbitant freight charges by railroads 
     Mr. Griffith [S. 83]: To amend section 4,369 of R. S. of 1881.

     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     On motion of Mr. BAILEY, a special committee of five was authorized on the city of
      Indianapolis, to be appointed by the President. The Chair appointed Messrs. Thompson, Bailey,
      Barrett, Winter and Rahm. 
    
    
     STATE NORMAL SCHOOL.
      Mr. FOWLER offered a resolution requiring the Superintendent of Public Instruction to
      furnish information as to how much of the common school revenue had been appropriated to the
      use of the normal school at Terre Haute, or if said revenue has been diverted to any other
      purpose than for the use of the common schools. He said: "An act was passed allowing that
      Institution twenty thousand dollars a year and they came two years ago and asked that the
      statute be amended so as to allow them an appropriation of twenty-five thousand instead of
      twenty thousand dollars, which would soon absorb the common school fund. This body ought to
      know how much of the common school fund, which has been provided for the education of the
      children of the State, has been diverted from that purpose and appropriated in violation of
      law. I hope the resolution will pass in order that we may obtain the information sought for,
      because I have a notion that the money ought to be covered back into the school fund.
      "
     Mr. DAVIS : I know no reason why the resolution should not pass. 
     Mr. SCHLOSS: The Senator from Owen (Mr. Fowler) is mistaken, and the information sought for
      will show that. The resolution was adopted.
    
    
     BILLS FOR ACTS WERE INTRODUCED BY
     Mr. Bailey [S.85]: Concerning improvement of streets and alleys.
     Mr. Thompson of Jasper,[S. 86]: To amend sections 312 and 313 of the R.S. of 1881.
     Mr. Zimmerman [S. 87]: For the prevention of fraud in the listing of personal property for
      taxation. 
    
    
     EXPENSES OF THIS SESSION.
      Mr. FRENCH, from the Committee on Finance, returned the bill [H. R. 19]
      to appropriate one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars for the expenses of this General
      Assembly, with a recommendation that is pass with an amendment appropriately inserting words
      authorizing the payment of outstanding and unpaid warrants issued to officers of the last
      Senate. 
     Mr. WINTER: I would like to have an explanation with regard to the outstanding and unpaid
      warrants referred to
      Mr. FRENCH: The Brevier Reporter who publishes the Brevier Legislative Reports was allowed
      by the last Senate pay for his work of that session. He was late in getting his work completed
      and did not get it out in time to have his warrants cashed because the money appropriated for
      expenses of that session had reverted and gone back into the general fund. He has been for the
      past twenty-nine years reporting the debates of our Legislatures and is again this winter for
      this General Assembly. The committee ask that the bill be amended so as to include these
      unpaid warrants of the last Senate. 
     Mr. FOWLER: What is the amount? 
     Mr. FRENCH: About seven thousand dollars. I am satisfied the amounts are proper and right
      and should be paid. It is a question whether or not it should go into this bill. The committee
      by unanimous  consent allowed it to go in, and we have so
      recommended. 
     Mr. WINTER : This is a thing that has come before the Legislature of Indiana every session.
      My memory does not go far enough back to tell when it did not. Mr. Drapier came on the floor
      of the Legislature last session as he did at the beginning of this session without any
      invitation whatever. Early in the session a claim was introduced by him for a large sum of
      money, running up into thousands of dollars; and at the close of the session the following
      resolution was passed. (Reads from the Senate journal of 1885, page 981.) Similar resolutions
      I apprehend have been gotten through in the previous sessions; but what authority has a
      resolution passed by one house to appropriate money out of the State treasury? Yet here is a
      resolution fixing no amount at all, but recognizing Mr. Drapier as an official stenographer as
      he has been since 1857. I have said before, and I say now, it is proper for the Legislature of
      the State of Indiana to have reports of its proceedings published, and if reliable it should
      pay for them; but I take it no member is going to vote away seven, or eight, or ten thousand
      dollars to pay for such reports as we have now--a mere abstract of the remarks of members, a
      sketch only of what they say. 
     Mr. JOHNSON: I agree with the Senator from Marion (Mr. Winter) that it is for the credit of
      the State to have a full and accurate report of the proceedings of the Legislature published,
      but I am informed that the Brevier Reports of the last two sessions of the General Assembly
      are not full and are not correct. Now, then, it strikes me the question before us is an
      important one, for the amount of money sought to be voted is a large sum, and under the
      statement made by the Senator from Marion (Mr. Winter) I am opposed to engrafting it into this
      bill.
     Mr. FOWLER : For years this has been a vexed question in this body, coming up every session;
      but now it comes up in a little different form. I remember when a member in 1877 this very
      question was before us then, and it has been before this body every session since that time.
      Now if the State of Indiana is owing Mr. Drapier anything I am in favor of paying every
      dollar, but certainly some action ought to be taken by this General Assembly to determine this
      question whether or not there is anything due and whether or not the State is under
      obligations to pay for service rendered by Mr. Drapier every session of the General Assembly.
      For years and years Mr. Drapier has been in the habit of reporting the proceeding, but I never
      understood that this o was under obligations to pay him for the reports he made, and I have
      uniformly voted against his claim. But if the State is under obligations to pay it and it is a
      claim against the State, it ought not to be engrafted upon this bill which is to make an
      appropriation to pay the expenses of this session of the General Assembly. If it is a claim
      against the State let it go to the Committee on Claims and let it be
      engrafted in the specific appropriation bill. I am opposed to putting it in any place other
      than the place provided for it--in the specific appropriation bill. Let it come up at the end
      of the session. 
     On motion by Mr. SELLERS the report of the committee was amended by striking out the
      recommendation. 
     On motion by Mr. WINTER the bill was amended by providing that no allowance or payment out
      of the appropriation hereby made shall be made by resolution passed during the last three days
      of the session. 
     On motion by Mr. SELLERS, the amendment was considered engrossed, the bill read the third
      time under a suspension of the constitutional rules and passed the Senate.
      The Senate adjourned till ten o'clock to-morrow.

     ELECTION OF UNITED STATES SENATOR. 
     Mr. KELLISON, as question of privilege, offered the following :
     
     
      
       
         Whereas, This House, on the 18th day of January, 1887, will be called upon, under the
         Constitution and law provided for the government of its action in that respect, to take
         action upon the matter of the election of an United States Senator, and members of this
         House holding their seats at that time will be entitled to cast a vote for the election of
         such officer; and,
        Whereas, There are now pending before this House contests against certain members now
         holding seats therein, as follows: Henry C. Dickerson vs. Cornelius Meagher, Decatur
         Downing vs. John T. Beasley, William A. Dailey and I. N. Miller vs. William H. Stull and
         Edmund A. Metzger, Henry Englehart vs. Robert L. Mackay; and,

        Whereas, The above named contestees, namely, Cornelius Meagher, John T. Beasley, William
         H. Stull and Edmund A. Metzher are Democrats, and members of the minority, and that Robert
         L. Mackay, the above named contestee, is a Republican, and a member of the majority; and, 
         Whereas, By the previous action of this House and the declared intention of the members
         of the majority, it is evident that the contests against Democratic members of this House
         are to be pushed to a final determination on or before the time fixed by law for taking
         action upon the election of a United States Senator as aforesaid: and, 
        Whereas, There has as yet been no disposition manifested upon the part of this House to
         take action upon the contest of the seat of said Robert L. Mackey before the time so fixed
         for voting upon the question of the election of a United States Senator; and, 
        Whereas, It would be unjust and utterly destructive of the rights of the minority of this
         House should final action be taken upon contests against Democratic members of this House,
         and should any one of said contestees be unseated, and to delay or refuse action in the
         matter of the contest against Robert L. Mackey before said date; and,
         Whereas, The ground of contest against said Robert L. Mackey goes only to the
         eligibility of said contestee, and is a question that ought to be and can be speedily
         determined by this House; therefore, 
        Resolved, That the Committee of Elections is hereby instructed to make
         its final report to this body upon the question of the right of said Robert L. Mackay to
         the seat he now holds n this House on or before Monday, January 17, 1887.
       
      
     
      The SPEAKER ruled that the resolution was out of order at this time.
      Mr KELLISON and Mr. FOLEY appealed from the decision of the Chair, as follows :
     
     
     
      
       

         Mr. Speaker: From the ruling of the Speaker deciding that the resolution of Mr. Kellison
         in relation to the contests now pending in this House is not a question of privilege and
         does not take precedence over the pending business, we most respectfully appeal to the
         House. 
        
         CHAS. KELLISON. 
         DANIEL FOLEY.
        
       
      
     
      The appeal was seconded by Messrs. Jewett and Gordon. 
     
     On motion by Mr. SCOTT the appeal was laid on the table by yeas 51, nays 39. 
     
     Mr. KELLISON made an ineffectual motion--yeas 43, nays 47--to suspend the rule, that a vote
      be taken on the adoption of the resolution. 
    
    
     EXTRA PAGES. 
     The SPEAKER announced that, in pursuance of the action of the House this morning, he had
      appointed the following named additional pages: Masters Forest Branch, William McCormick and
      Willie Reed. 
    
    
     PRINTED RULES.
     300 copies of the rules were ordered. 
    
    
    
     CONTESTED ELECTIONS.
      The SPEAKER announced that papers had been placed in his hands in the contested election
      cases of William H. Shields, Representative from Jackson county: Levi Mock, Representative
      from Wells county, and Willis L. Barnes, Representative from Clark county, which would be
      referred to the Committee on Elections.
    

   
   
   
   
    BREVER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.

    The Senate met at ten 'clock a. m., and was opened with prayer by Rev. Mr. Gilbert, of
     the Meridian street M. E. Church. 
    
     EXTRA EMPLOYES 
     Mr. BAILEY reported that the Committee on Labor had appointed Miss Emma

       Committee, which was adopted.
      Mr. WINTER presented a remonstrance from the Executive Committee of one hundred citizens of
      Marion county against the retention of a doorkeeper of the Senate--Mr. John Counselman--a
      defendant in a suit pending for alleged forgeries in the late election; accompanied with a
      resolution for the dismissal of said Counselman. On his motion, it was made the special order
      for two o'clock in compliance with an understanding with his colleague, Senator Bailey.
     
    
    
     A RIPLEY COUNTY ROAD.
      The Senate bill to, legalize a certain action in relation to the Versailles free gravel
      road had by Commissioners of Ripley county was read the second time, with a committee report
      recommending its passage. 
     Mr. URMSTON moved that the report of the committee be concurred in, that the bill be
      considered engrossed, the constitutional rule be set aside in order that the bill may be
      finally passed by the Senate. 
     Mr. WINTER objected to this bill being hurried through under a suspension of the
      constitutional rule.
     Mr. URMSTON desired every member should understand the bill throughly, and to that end
      withdrew his motion that the bill might be printed and laid on the desk of every member. 
     Mr. SMITH, of Jennings, (Mr. Sellers in the chair,) explained the circumstances surrounding
      this case. 
     The report was concurred in, and under the rules the bill was ordered printed.

     AFTERNOON SESSION.
      The PRESIDENT pro tem. referred the papers in the contested election case against Senator
      Kennedy to the Committee on Elections. He also laid before the Senate a
      communication from the Governor naming Mr. Pierre Gray as Executive Messenger. 
    
    
     A SENATE EMPLOYE AGAIN. 
     Mr. WINTER called up the special order for this hour, being the remonstrance he presented
      this morning from members of the executive committee of one hundred, formed for the purpose of
      punishing the perpetrators of the tally-sheet forgeries in this city a the last election,
      praying for the removal from the position of assistant doorkeeper John H. Counselman, because
      he is a defendant in a suit for participating in said forgeries. 
     Mr. WINTER moved to adopt the resolution accompanying the memorial or remonstrance, and
      said: I only desire to say a few words. I want to call the attention of the Senate to the
      facts as I understand them. I don't wish this understood as a political matter. The
      remonstrance is signed by a majority of Democrats. Most members of the Senate are probably
      familiar with what took place immediately after the election in this city on the second day of
      November last; but in order that the matter may be fresh in mind I will recall the facts as
      they have been general published. As a result of the election the entire Democratic ticket was
      elected except two on the county ticket. Mr. Ayers, a Democratic candidate for Criminal Judge,
      was opposed by Mr. Irvin, a Republican, whose majority was forty-two votes. For Coroner on the
      Democratic side Mr. Morrison was the candidate, and Dr. Wagner was the Republican candidate
      whose majority was thirty-two. When the Board of Canvassers met on the Thursday following the
      election during the progress of the count it was discovered that the tally-sheets and poll
      books from five different precincts had been altered, which had effected Irvin and Wagner, by
      transposing votes in the one case to Ayers and in the other case to Morrison. The result of
      these changes was that Ayers was declared elected by a majority of seventy-one--the changes in
      his case were made in five different cases and overcome the majority which Irvin had of
      forty-two. In one precinct they changed twenty-seven from Wagner and credited those
      twenty-seven to Morrison, the result being that Morrison was declared elected. 
     Mr. BAILEY (interposing):I would like to ask the Senator if he is not an attorney
      representing one of these applicants--Dr. Wagner? 
     Mr. WINTER : I was his attorney--I am not now. 
     Mr. BAILEY : I rise to a point of order : That the Senator's argument has nothing
      whatever to do with this remonstrance. There is nothing in this argument that seems to connect
      Counselman with it: 
     Mr. WINTER: I was coming to that in a moment. 
     The PREIDENT pro tem.: As long as the Senator proceeds in a parliamentary way he has the
      right to go on. 
     Mr. WINTER: I propose to state what I understand to be the facts in the case. There was a
      change made, as far as Wagner and Morrison are concerned in but a single transaction, and the
      result was that Morrison was declared elected when in fact Wagner had a majority of thirty-two
      votes. The changes were made upon these tally-sheets during the proceedings of the Board of
      Canvassers, and when the tally-sheets were presented the evidence that they were changed is so
      apparent--they were made in a bungling manner--made by acids which burned holes in the paper,
      and the erasures and changes were so perfectly apparent, there could be no controversy about
      it. One of these precincts was the second in the fourth ward. The change made in that pre  cinct, consisted of subtracting from Irvin's vote,
      which was 231, twenty-one (21) votes, reducing him to 210, and by adding those twenty-one
      votes to the vote of Ayers, which was one hundred and sixty-one, increasing Ayers' vote
      to one hundred and eighty-two. Mr. Counselman--John H. Counselman--the person mentioned in
      this petition, was the inspector of that precinct. Evidence has been taken in reference to
      that transaction before a United States Commissioner, and that evidence showed just this state
      of facts. Every member of that Election Board,, with the exception of Counselman, denied under
      oath--as well Republicans--that they had anything to do with the change. It was shown
      conclusively that those tally-sheets in their original condition were delivered into the hands
      of Counselman, and laid in his hands from; that time until presented to the Board of
      Canvassers. Counselman did not go on the witness-stand to purge himself. He has remained
      silent, and has given no explanation how this forgery was perpetrated upon the tally-sheets
      which remained in his hands as a sworn officer of the law, which he was required under oath to
      preserve inviolate. Mr. Counselman, and other persons have been arrested, and they are now
      under bail. The prosecution has been suspended temporarily, awaiting a habeas corpus decision
      from Judge Gresham, of the United States Court. It is liable to resumed at any time. It is not
      a proper thing that a man charged with this offense, who has not availed himself of the
      opportunity to purge himself, should remain here as an officer of the Senate. This is one of
      the most important of the public bodies in the State of Indiana, and should not stand upon the
      side of crime. This resolution probably goes too far--it should say that while he is under
      this criminal charge he should not act.
     Mr. BAILEY: My colleague (Mr. WINTER), in presenting this remonstrance and in making the
      argument he has made has manifested that perfect intolerance for which he is well noted at the
      bar in this city. He has pretended to take up facts and present them to the Senate, of which
      he knows absolutely nothing. He brings in a remonstrance, signed by ten men, no one of whom
      can be acknowledged in any sense as a Democrat. He brings in a petition representing the
      Executive Committee of one hundred men who are organized for the purpose of casting reflection
      upon the Democratic party of this county. It is known as a Committee of
       Safety, and, God help the safety and the rights of this community if the are to be
      placed in the hands of such men. He proposes to cast reflection, to cast doubt, to color with
      blackness the character of John H. Counselman, a better man, I undertake to say, than any one
      of the men who subscribe to this remonstrance--a man who has been in this community all his
      life--a man who has stood up to the time of this malignant charge, as well in this community
      or far better than some of the men whose names are attached to this paper. I wish to ask my
      colleague if this paper has been presented to this Senate in any truthful sense? or its
      presentation requested in any rightful sense by this Executive Committee ? There are men of
      honor other than these, whose names are not attached thereto. 
     Mr. WINTER: The remonstrance was delivered to me by Mr William Henderson, claiming to be
      acting for the committee,. It was signed by every member except. Since it was put in my hands
      two of the signers have stricken their names from it. 
     Mr. BAILEY: Mr. John H. Holliday is one of the members of this committee, and editor of the
      Evening News ; a man whose idea of justice and equity is too high to impugn such motives as
      are cast against this man without first having some shadow of proof. Another one is Nathan
      Morris, a Democrat who stands high above reproach in his profession at the bar. One of these
      men informs me that this is simply a matter of persecution upon the part of one man, to whose
      character I desire, before  taking my seat, to make some
      brief reference.
      Mr. FOWLER (interposing): Is there any question of the fact that the tally-sheets were
      changed ?
     Mr. BAILEY: I apprehend not. 
     Mr. F0WLER: Then is there any question but that Counselman failed to purge himself? 
     Mr. BAILEY: There is ample explanation as to that charge and I will make it. The Executive
      Committee has in no sense requested the presentation of this remonstrance. It is simply a
      matter of persecution on the part of one man. This sleuth-hound has been going from one man to
      another demanding and asking, upon one ground and another, that they should for his sake sign
      this petition. That man is William Henderson--and who is William Henderson? The grandest, old
      fossilized monument of mental, moral and financial dilapidation that lives in the State of
      Indiana-- a man whose character in this community is a matter of just reproach; a man who has
      taken thousands of dollars in a failing savings bank from the pockets of poor depositors; a
      man who is now riding in his carriage, living in a magnificent mansion, and who is judgment
      and execution proof--the only man in our party who is willing to be a co-conspirator in this
      prosecution of men against whom a Grand Jury of the Federal court has refused to return an
      indictment. I have said there is, perhaps, no doubt as to the alterations charged as alleged,
      but there is great doubt as to who made these mutilations. While I agree fully with my
      colleague (Mr. Winter) as to the infamy of the crime of mutilating tally-sheets, if the truth
      can be ascertained, I will be as severe in condemnation of the perpetrators, of these wrongs
      as any man in this county; but it will be far better for society that all these criminals go
      unindicted and unpunished, whosoever they may be, than to cast reflection and doubt on the
      character of a good man. But what are the facts in this case? A Grand Jury, nearly two- thirds
      of which--certainly ten to seven, were Republicans--investigated all these frauds. They had
      these tally-sheets before them; they had witnesses before them; they had the formulated
      questions of this Republican Citizens' Committee of One Hundred before them. These
      questions were submitted as they were formed, by Captain Eli Ritter, a paid attorney of such
      men as E. B. Martindale, John Coburn, also leaders in the Republican party. The United States
      District Attorney (Judge Turpie) brought nearly sixty witnesses before that Grand Jury; they
      saw the mutilations, but they saw no evidence that would fix with any degree of certainty the
      guilt upon any man; and they made a return without finding an indictment against any of these
      men. The client of my colleague (Mr. Winter) made an affidavit longer than the Declaration of
      Independence, charging everything in the category known; and upon that affidavit there was
      found a gentleman by the name of Van Buren, who issued a warrant for the arrest of four men
      among whom is Mr. Counselman, against whom this infamous remonstrance, signed by some men
      still more infamous, is made. They were brought before they creature of that Republican
      committee; they offered bond for their appearance before the next Grand Jury. But this
      conspiracy for the hunting of down prominent Democrats and for the persecution of men
      prominent in the active management of a victorious campaign, must go on; this opportunity to
      blacken the character of good men because they were Democrats, must not be lost. So they filed
      before this Republican United States Commissioner this affidavit, which under my oath I
      believe to be false and they arrested just such men of prominence as they desired to hold up
      in shame. One of these men is Mr. Counselman; another is Mr. Spaan, a man who has no equal at
      the bar of Indianapolis for his age--who stands head and shoulders in intellect, morality and
      integrity above any man know for his age in this community; he was arrest because he appeared
      before the Canvassing Board as legal counsel. Mr. Bernhamer, a promi-  nent attorney, and a German, is another. Mr. Coy, chairman of our
      County Committee, a much better, purer, more intellectual man, a man who will do more for the
      poor; a man who has a better heart ten thousand times, than old Bill Henderson ever had, he,
      too, is brought before Van Buren. The lawyers for the defendants did what any man would do,
      knowing the partizan character of the court, and knowing these charges had just been
      investigated by a Grand Jury, they said--Mr. Van Buren, we stand upon on our legal rights and
      file any bond you may name, and appear. Mr. Van Buren said: not much; we know the
      determination will be the same. Not much, says Van Buren ; not much you won't. Mr.
      Ritter, counsel for the Republican Committee of One Hundred, has consulted me before I was
      appointed try this case. We have agreed upon every thing and made our arrangements, and we
      propose to blacken every Democrat in this county as far as possible, and fill the columns of
      the partizan papers in this State as much as we can. That has been their scheme; that was
      their game. I wish to call attention to another thing: It is agreed upon all hands that the
      vote for no Federal officer is affected in any way, and the only ones who may possibly be
      affected are the Coroner and Criminal Judge for this county ; and I submit to any lawyer who
      knows the Constitution and the statutes of State whether the Federal Court has
      jurisdiction.
     Mr.WINTER (interposing): Would expect to go with such a case or Mr. Ayers, in whose interest
      these charges were made?
      Mr. BAILEY: Certainly not. The Senator from Marion (Mr. Winter) knows very well that Judge
      Ayers, the Deputy Attorney General of Mr. Woolen, is a man of clean and high character, and in
      a case of that sort he would not for one moment contemplate sitting upon it. And if he did, it
      would not give jurisdiction to the Federal Court. 
     Mr. MCDONALD, of Whitley: I would ask whether there has been an
      indictment returned from any court?
      Mr. BAILEY: None whatever, and I hope never will be. There has not been one scintilla of
      testimony before little Van, the Commissioner sitting in this outrageous proceeding, that has
      reflected upon any gone of the defendants. I am willing to leave it to most any fair minded
      man or jury. 
     Mr. WEIR (interposing): I would ask if in the opinion of the Senator it would not be better
      for this gentleman to be preparing for his defence rather than be serving this Senate in the
      capacity he is? 
     Mr. BAILEY : That is a matter entirely personal to himself. He has as able counsel as there
      is in this county who are defending him an appearing for the defence, but it is not necessary
      to make a defence. The proceeding has not gone sufficiently far for a defence. Simply the case
      for the Government is before the Commissioner; they are not through; they have other
      witnesses. But when the defence comes, if the defendants are foolish enough to attempt any
      defence before such a court, most certainly, Messrs. Counselman, Spaan, Bernhamer and Coy,
      will go upon the witness-stand and purge themselves of these charges. The charge of my
      colleague (Mr. Winter) that the tally-sheet of the fourth ward was in Mr. Counselman's
      hands from the time of the close of the polls until presented to the Canvassing Board, is
      untrue. In pronouncing the word of my colleague untrue the facts in the case did not indicate
      that, but directly to the contrary: that the poll-book was taken; that the sealed bag was
      taken, and I think the tally-sheet, by direction of General Carnahan, the chairman . of their
      committee. There was a conspiracy formed, published in a pamphlet, secretly circulated and
      given to Republican Judges that at the close of the polls at each precinct, they were to seize
      the tally-sheet and get away as soon as possible the purpose being to take advantage of the
      law which says, in the absence of Inspectors the Judge shall be present and vote to make up
      the Canvassing Board. That was done in eight  or ten
      precincts where they succeeded in snatching the tally-sheet and getting away with it, thereby
      intending to get a majority of the Canvassing Board organized, as they have for twenty years
      in this county. The fourth ward, I think, was of these cases. I know the testimony shows that
      Counselman did not have possession of that tally-sheet till next day about ten or eleven
      o'clock. I know that Mr. Clinton, a candidate, for a position on the Republican ticket,
      with two or three other Republicans, who appeared as witnesses before this committee of one
      hundred, took that book and tally-sheet, opened it, examined it, and God knows what they did
      with it. All that was done, and I think my colleague has made no reference thereto. I
      undertake to say that the Senate of Indiana has little to do with going into this subject. I
      requested my colleague to withhold this remonstrance believing it was simply casting a slur
      upon the character of a good man. A man is always, I take it, believed to be innocent until
      proven to be guilty. There has been nothing that should cause you to darken the character of
      this man whom I have known for years, whose family I know, who is in business running a
      grocery, who is a man of good reputation, who I would trust ten thousand times before I would
      trust that old fossil who is hunting him down, and who has pretended for twenty years to have
      a remote relationship to Hon. Thomas A. Hendricks. Because this defendant was opposed to his
      appointment as Postmaster in this city, he is now trying to east this reflection upon him. 
     Mr. JOHNSON:: Is there any evidence of a personal difficulty between Messrs. Henderson and
      Counselman ? 
     Mr. BAILEY : Since the death of that man I know he has debased his memory. But he is a
      Democrat! He has taken it upon himself, as I have been informed by one of the members of that
      committee, to present this; the committee is not asking the presentation of this remonstrance.
      I ask the Senator from Marion (Mr. Winter) if it has not been this man Henderson alone
      insisting upon it? These defendants,two or more, had bitterly opposed his appointment as
      Postmaster and he, like a bloodhound, seeks to get even. Now I undertake to gray that the
      Doorkeeper of this Senate is responsible to the Senate, responsible to his own conscience and
      responsible to his people as to the manner in which he conducts the affairs of this chamber;
      he has control and management of it; under the statute he has the appointment of his
      subordinates, and I undertake to say until some good and sufficient reason be presented here
      he will not, without reason, and simply to satisfy the revenge of a man who has no right to
      come here, dismiss this man from his force. And this Senate has no right to remove his
      employes. 
     Mr. FOWLER: Suppose the Door-keeper were to appoint a convict from the State prison? 
     Mr. BAILEY: That is not a fair parallel. I should say not. I move to refer the remonstrance
      to the Committee on Elections.
     
     Mr. JOHNSON: It does seem to me this question has taken a wide range. The line of argument
      was very suggestive of the criminal lawyer in endeavoring to brow-beat the prosecution. The
      question whether or not the United States Court has jurisdiction in punishing these men who
      are charged with a forging tally-sheets, or a United States Commissioner in taking testimony
      in such a case, is foreign to the question before us. I am acquainted with William Henderson
      by reputation, but I fail to recognize the description of him given by the Senator from Marion
      (Mr. Bailey.) I am not disposed to convict any man before proven guilty. We are not to try
      this question by any such rule as is laid down by the Senator from Marion; we formulate our
      conduct upon a more liberal plane. I am satisfied the Doorkeeper has made a mistake. A
      sufficient respect for the people of the State, regardless of party affiliation, would have
      prevented him from making that appointment. I don't care to ushered into the Senate
      chamber by  a person who rests under the charge against
      Mr. Counselman, but rather by a gentleman above reproach. Considering the serious character of
      the charges made against this man, I sincerely hope the Senate, without regard to politics,
      will not hesitate to pass this resolution. If there is any class of men on earth who ought to
      take an advanced position on this subject in every way, manner, shape and form,it is members
      of a legislative body, and as an individual and as a Senator I am unwilling to give position
      to any man under such charges. 
     Mr. WEIR: I move to amend the motion made by the Senator from Marion (Mr. Bailey) so as to
      refer this resolution to a select committee of five with instructions to report by next
      Wednesday morning, and that I be not a member of that committee. 
     Mr. WINTER: I was requested by my constituents to present this petition. Reflection has been
      made upon character of some of the signers. his petition. They are as much my constituents as
      they were Republicans. Mr. Wm. Henderson----
     Mr. FRENCH (interposing): The motion is not debatable. 
     Mr. SELLERS : I think perhaps the old members of the Senate know me well enough to know that
      I would not by word or act protect for one moment a man who has been guilty of crime, but this
      resolution is out of order. The statute provides that the Doorkeeper shall appoint his
      assistants; and, as I understand it, Mr. Counselman, is one of those appointed by the
      Doorkeeper under the statute. If that be true the Senate cannot by resolution remove him.
      While the resolution may be out of order the remonstrance is entitled to recognition. I think
      in this case the resolution should be held to be out of order and the remonstrance referred to
      this committee to recommend to the Senate what steps would be advisable. We can only reach
      this matter through Doorkeeper. 
      The PRESIDENT pro tem.: On the point of order raised by the Senator from White (Mr.
      Sellers) the resolution is out of order for the reason he stated. The petition can be referred
      to any committee this Senate desires to select; it is such a matter any citizen has a right to
      present if he desires. The resolution is another thing. In the first place, in the general
      fitness of things every man stands before the public with a presumption of innocence resting
      upon him until the contrary is made to appear before the proper tribunal. It is hardly proper
      that this Senate shall render a verdict of guilt against Mr. Counselman in view of the fact
      that his case is in hearing by a United States Commissioner. I understand there is no
      indictment against him, but that it is a political persecution. I apprehend nobody will deny
      that if it is a political persecution it would be inappropriate for this Senate to take any
      action with reference to his guilt or innocence. If we expel him it would cast a reflection of
      guilt upon him, and there is no Democrat or Republican, would want to do that. The resolution
      is clearly out of order. The Doorkeeper is the creature of this Senate and every employe under
      him is the creature the Doorkeeper. You selected a man in whose integrity you have confidence
      ; he has employed assistants; Mr. Counselman is one of them; and it is the opinion of chair
      you cannot take from the Door keeper his employes. If they are bad men the Senate has the
      right to recommend the removal of such a person, and if the Doorkeeper does not remove him on
      the recommendation of the Senate it is perhaps the duty of the Senate to remove the
      Doorkeeper, for he is responsible for the efficiency of his employes. The resolution seeks to
      take from him his power. 
     The motion (Mr. Weir's) to refer the remonstrance to a select committee was agreed to. 
     A SENATOR: I understand the Committee on Elections has been sitting most
      of the day, and I am a member of that committee but have not heard of it 
     Mr. BAILEY : The Committee on Elections is not in session. Whenev-[er]
        er it has a meeting or session the committee will be so
      informed.
     Mr. WINTER: Do you mean to say a majority of the committee has not been together to-day? 
     Mr. BAILEY: I don't mean to say anything of the kind.

     VIGO CO. CONTESTED ELECTION.
      The SPEAKER: The first thing in order is "Reports from the Committee on
       Elections."
     Mr. GRIFFITHS, for a majority of said committee, submitted a lengthy report on the contested
      election case of Henry Clay Dickerson vs. Cornelius Meagher, from Vigo county. It concludes
      that Meagher had no title to his seat as Representative, for, at the election under which he
      claims it, he was a judicial officer, and he could not constitutionally hold two offices at
      the same time. Rulings of courts had been in contests of this character that the seat should
      given to the contestor on the ground that, as the candidate receiving the highest number was
      not legally entitled to the office, the votes for him, had been thrown away. [See pages
      95-98.] 
     Mr. CLARKE, in behalf of the minority of the same committee, presented a report about half
      as long as that of the majority, concluding that, although Meagher had qualified for the
      office, the order of the County Commissioners annulled this record. Meagher never did any
      business as justice of the peace, and never intended to after the number of justices had been
      reduced, for the reason there was but one whom he could succeed, whose term did not expire
      until the eighth of November, 1886, six days after the election of Meagher as Representative.
      By his election as Representative he was disqualified from fulfilling the duties of justice of
      the peace. [See pages 98, 99.] 
     Mr. GRIFFITHS moved that the consideration of the majority and minority reports be made the
      special order for two o'clock p.m., that the time of discussion be divided equally and
      that a vote be taken not later than five o'clock.
      This motion was agreed to. 
    
    
     ELECTION OF UNITED STATES SENATOR. 
     Mr. KELLISON called up his resolution (see page 78 of these Reports) requiring the
       Committee on Elections to report on the Mackey contested election case not
      later than Monday next. 
     Mr. GARDINER moved to indefinitely postpone the resolution, and on that demanded the
      previous question. 
     The demand for the previous question was seconded.
      Mr. KELLISON: I believe I have a right to be heard on this questions even under the
      operation of the previous question, having introduced the resolution. 
     The SPEAKER: It is the opinion of the chair that the rule applies to bills and not to
      resolutions. 
     
     
     The motion to postpone was agreed to by yeas 52, nays 40. 
     Pending the roll-call--- 
     Mr. BEASLEY said: I desire to explain my vote. On the day of the session when discussing a
      contest case in which I was personally interested I said that I believed the majority were
      willing to treat the minority fairly, and I will maintain that position until they take some
      step to the contrary. They have not thus far taken any step that has caused me to change that
      opinion, therefore, believing that the majority will treat the Democratic minority fairly I
      vote "aye."
      Mr. COX, of Miami : I desire to explain my votes I cannot see any reason why this
      resolution should be postponed. It seems to me that it was true, as stated the other day by
       gentleman of the majority, that they were anxious to have
      all these contests decided so that the House might be purged and purified from the presence of
      improper members. If that statement of the gentleman is true then they certainly cannot
      consistently and fairly ask to postpone a resolution like this. It is certain that his case
      should be heard, and determined as soon as the case of Mr. Beasley and Mr. Meagher, and I
      therefore vote "no." 
     Mr. FOSTER: I cannot see why majority on this floor will not agree to the resolution as
      offered by the gentleman from Marshall (Mr. Kellison.) It seems to me to be fair. They have
      said that they will give all fair chance. Unlike the gentleman Sullivan (Mr. Beasley) I do not
      believe that the majority mean to treat us fairly, I vote "no." 
     Mr. HARRELL: For the reason that the indications are, that the majority of this House are
      trying to push forward all the contested cases against the Democrats before the election of
      the United States Senator, and that they are trying to prevent the minority of this House from
      bringing up the cases against the Republicans before the election of United States Senator, I
      vote "no."
     Mr. KELLISON : I desire to explain my vote. Because I believe that the recital of facts in
      this resolution, in the language of a distinguished Republican, expressed the truth about the
      whole matter; and because I desire to give the majority on the other side an opportunity to
      display that magnanimity and fairness of which they boast; and because the gentleman from
      Daviess (Mr. Gardiner,) their acknowledged leader, is so extremely partizan that he cannot
      frame a resolution of that character; I therefore vote "no. "
     The result was announced as above. So the resolutions were indefinitely postponed. 
    
    
     AN EXTRA CLERK.
      Mr. CONGER, chairman of the Committee on Fees and Salaries, reported a
      resolution "that the Committee on Benevolent and Scientific
       Institutions be allowed a clerk." 
      After some discussion---
     Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Owen, made an ineffectual motion to lay the resolution on the table. 
     
     
     The resolution was adopted by yeas 48, nays 38.

     AFTERNOON SESSION.
      THE VIGO COUNTY CONTESTED CASE. 
     The special order, for this hour coming up---[See pages 95-99.] 
      Mr. GORDON said: I submit as the first and only question to be determined in this case this
      proposition: Was the contestee, Cornelius Meagher, on the third day of November, 1886, a
      justice of the peace? I do not say on the second day of November but on the third day of
      November, for the reason that if he was eligible to be voted for, if he was elected at all his
      term began on the third, because the Constitution provides that the terms of the members of
      the General Assembly shall begin the day succeeding the election. So that the question is: did
      he hold the office of justice of the peace at the time his term would have begun or did begin?
      I think, Mr. Speaker, that there will be no dispute upon that legal proposition. Then I shall
      devote myself first to the question whether Cornelius Meagher was on the third day of
      November, 1886; a justice of the peace. I state most emphatically as a legal proposition that
      he was not. We think there is no dispute as to the facts in this case, it is wholly and purely
      a legal proposition. I shall  hold and maintain that if
      Cornelius Meagher had not been elected to this Legislature he could not have taken the office
      of justice of the peace; that there was no vacancy at that time that could be filled, but on
      the contrary that his term of office would not have begun if he had not been elected a member
      of this General Assembly until the eighth day of November, 1886. Upon that point I wish to
      explain. Notwithstanding the fact that the commission shows that the term of office should
      begin on the twenty-second day of October it was impossible for it so to begin. I shall
      maintain that although this commission showed that the term of office was to begin on the
      twenty-second day of October, that it was an impossibility for it to begin on that day,
      because the term of office of the man whom he succeeded did not expire until after that time.
      Mind you, these are agreed facts between the contestee and the contester. The Board of
      Commissioners of Vigo county on the twenty-second day of September, 1886, passed an order
      reducing the number of justices of the peace from five to three. Now, mind you, it will be
      argued from the other side that this order did not apply to Mr. Meagher, but I contend that
      this order did apply to Mr. Meagher. The passage of this order would prevent, or did prevent
      him from taking it. It may be contended, but I do not think it will, that from the time Mr.
      Meagher was elected a justice of the peace in April, 1886, he was ineligible. I shall contend
      that this ineligibility does not apply until the beginning of his term of office. His election
      does not render him ineligible;--it is the taking of the office. I will say that the contestor
      is not entitled to the seat for the reason that Mr. Meagher was not in the office at all, and
      the electors had no notice of a disqualification. To entitle Mr. Dickerson to the office Mr.
      Meagher must have been in the office. Should a person be elected to a county office whose term
      was to begin January first, and the office should be abolished on December first, would the
      issuance of a certificate by the Secretary of State on January first constitute an occupancy
      of the office by the officer elected ?--Would the gentlemen on the other side tell what office
      Meagher could fill on October twenty-second, 1886? 
     Mr. GRIFFITHS : It is a serious matter to deprive a man of a seat in the Legislative body
      which he holds, and claims he has a right to hold, but it is a more serious matter to withhold
      from a person that which rightfully belongs to him. Fortunately, we have not been compelled to
      resort to the uncertainty of oral testimony. All the controlling facts in the case are matters
      of record. The certainty as to the facts and as to the law should take this case into a clear
      judicial atmosphere. There are two questions, I take it, involved in this case. First, is the
      cotestee eligible under the constitutional provisions ? Second, if not so eligible, is the
      contester entitled to the seat now occupied by the contestee? We will now consider the first
      of these two questions. It is conceded that on the fifth day of April, 1886, the contestee was
      elected justice of the peace. That on the seventh day of April, 1886, the Clerk of the Circuit
      Court of Vigo county certified the fact of that election to the Secretary of State. That on
      the fifteenth day of April, 1886, the Governor of the State issued a commission to Cornelius
      Meagher as justice of the peace for four years. On the fifth day of May the contestee took the
      oath of office and filed his bond, at the same time as justice of the peace, which bond was
      provided by the clerk. On the second day of November the contestee and contests for were
      candidates for the office of Representative of this General Assembly. The contestee received
      from the electors five thousand three, hundred and fifty-three votes and the contester five
      thousand three hundred and forty-two. These are, I say, all the conceded facts in the ease. It
      is stated that the only question involved is this, was Cornelius Meagher a justice of the
      peace on the third of November, 1886? I am willing to meet him on that proposition, and I
      think  I will be able to convince this body that an that
      day he was a justice of the peace. The majority in their report claim, and we claim, that on
      the fifth day of May, 1886, when Cornelius Meagher took the oath of office as justice of the
      peace and filed his bond, he was vested with the office of justice of the peace. It was
      inamaterial whether he was to perform the duties of that office upon the twenty-fifth day or
      the twenty-ninth day of October. The fact that he did not enter upon the duties can have no
      effect in the case, and there was no power on earth which could have taken that office away
      from him after he had performed these acts as required by law. Cornelius Meagher accepted the
      office in every way provided by law. It is said that Cornelius Meagher said he did not intend
      to accept the office of justice of the peace. Why, if that was the case, did he get men to go
      on his bond, and file his bond? His nomination, his qualification, his consultation with men
      elected at the same time, establish the fact, that he did take the office of justice of the
      peace. and was invested with it. The gentleman from Putnam (Mr. Gordon) contends the term did
      not commence till the second day of October. By the term of commission of Justice Steinmehl
      his office would have expired on the twenty-ninth day of October, 1886. A man, simply by
      declining to enter upon the duties of his office, cannot prolong the term. His term expired on
      the twenty-ninth day of October, 1886, and there was a vacancy in his office when the general
      election took place. The proposition is simply this: that a man is nominated for an office and
      he qualifies, and he takes the path, and he makes all the arrangements outs when he shall
      enter upon the discharge of that office. It is a constitutional office and no power of the
      County Commissioners can say " we abolish the office and you cannot fill it. " It
      seems to me that, without citing cases, it is very clear that he was a justice of the peace at
      the time of the general election. I will read the Constitution: "No person elected to any
      Judicial office shall, during the term for which he shall have been elected, be eligible to
      any office of trust or profit under the State other than a Judicial one." The language is
      broad, and is not qualified or restricted. The language is universal and applies to everybody
      who holds a Judicial office. There is now but one other proposition in this case, and that is
      this: If Cornelius Meagher was not eligible under that provision of the Constitution is Henry
      Clay Dickerson eligible to the seat? Had not the voters of Vigo noticed that they had voted
      for Cornelius Meagher in the preceding election? Would not the records of the county disclose
      the fact that he had taken the oath of office and filed an official bond? Notice, does not
      mean, that somebody must go through the county and notify each individual that Cornelius
      Meagher has been elected justice of the peace. What if the majority should persist in voting
      for a man wholly ineligible for holding the office ? what would be the result? If the majority
      vote for one wholly incapable of holding an office, then the minority should choose one
      eligible. We have a legislative precedent in the General Assembly of the State of Indiana,
      which shows that, under these circumstances, Cornelius Meagher is not entitled to a seat in
      this House. If the majority report is such a verdict, it should be supported by the members of
      this body; if it is not such a report, it should be rejected. After thorough examination of
      the evidence--after thorough examination of the law--every moment devoted to the
      investigation, has strengthened my belief in the ineligibility of Cornelius Meagher. 
     Mr. CLARKS : As a member of the committee I desire to say a few words, but as there are a
      number on our side of the House who desire to speak, I do not think, in view of this fact,
      that I will attempt anything more than to answer one question propounded by the gentleman from
      Marion (Mr. Griffiths.) The question was asked by him, what is required to constitute an
      office? There is one  thing that is required, and that is
      to have a vacancy in the office which the candidate is to take. If there was a vacancy in the
      office to which Mr. Meagher aspired he could have been inducted into it. He asks, what is
      required to invest a man with an office? About the same thing it takes to invest a man with a
      coat;--we must have an empty coat. The office of justice of the peace was filled at that time
      by Mr. Steinmehl. He was in the office, and it is just as impossible for two persons to occupy
      the same space at the same time. There must have been a vacancy before Mr. Meagher could have
      held an office at all.
      Mr. KELLISON I shall not detain you long with what I have to say on this question. I shall
      not cite you a multitude of authorities having no bearing upon the question at issue or those
      that are doubtful in that respect. It is quite possible that I shall not cite any authority at
      all, except to show where the conclusions drawn by the other side are defective. I am willing
      to concede that a number of authorities have been cited here that, at first sight, seem to
      have a bearing, and, seem to be applicable to this case, but I am forced, after having
      examined these authorities somewhat myself, to the belief that they do not have the
      application contended for by the gentlemen on the other side. Take the case in 90th Indiana. I
      say, in my opinion that authority does not cover this case at all, either to the advantage of
      the one side or of the other. The facts of this case do not bring it under the authority of
      that case. The question here is whether or not upon the acts conceded in this case Cornelius
      Meagher was a justice of the peace on the second day of November, 1886, because if he was a
      justice of the peace in the sense that the Constitution intended when it provided that he
      should be ineligible, then it seems to me that there can be, no question about his
      ineligibility. I want to call the. attention of gentlemen, and especially of the gentleman who
      last addressed this House on the other side,- to the language of the Constitution again.
      (Reads.) So I say that the vital point involved in this case, the decisive point in this case
      and the one upon which it must turn eventually, as a proposition of law, is whether the term
      of office of Cornelius Meagher had commenced, If it had commenced he was ineligible. The
      Constitution fixes the length of the term of a justice of the peace. There is no statute that
      fixes the time when that term shall commence. I lay that down as a proposition of law and
      challenge the other side to prove that I am incorrect. That being the fact I maintain that the
      general and usual mode of determining when a term of office shall commence is by usage and
      custom. I say that the constitutional prohibition here does not apply to the facts conceded
      and proven in this case. And upon the proposition laid down by the gentleman from Marion? (Mr.
      Griffiths) that the term ought commence from the issuing of the commission I refer the
      gentleman to the law regulating and governing the issuing of commissions. See R.S., 1881,
      section 5553,20th Indiana 1, 21st Indiana 516, 33rd Indiana 390, showing that the issuing of a
      commission is not absolutely necessary to the performance of the functions of a justice of the
      peace. And the gentleman makes another proposition which it seems to me is an astounding one.
      He claims that Mr. Meagher, was a justice of the peace from the time he took the official oath
      and filed his official bond. Was it the intention of the framers of the Constitution to render
      a man ineligible for more than four years? That seems to be the view that the gentleman from
      Marion (Mr. Griffiths) puts upon it. That argument will not do. There must be a time when this
      ineligibility commences and a time when it ends, and that must not be more than four years. 
     Mr. SCOTT : This discussion is getting narrowed down to a single issue. The majority here
      could have put the gag law on this question, but the Republican party wanted this discuss to
      go out before the world, before the people of Indiana, because they are not afraid of the
      evidence. The evidence will be on record; the discussion will be taken, and the people of the
      State; can make up their verdict just as we are doing. The gentleman from Marshall (Mr.
      Kellison) has declared that we must fix a time when Mr. Meagher took his place as justice of
      the peace. There is a matter that I do not think has come out before, and that is, that Mr.
      Steinmehi received his commission from the Governor of the State on twenty-ninth day of
      October. There  fore, if Cornelius Meagher had a right to
      take that office, and if Cornelius Meagher did not step into the office when the commission of
      Mr. Steinmehl expired, it was because of negligence on his part. That does not change the
      legal status of this case in the least. Mr. Steinmehl's term expired on the thirtieth day
      of October and Mr. Cornelius Meagher could have succeeded him on that day. We know, further,
      that Mr. Cornelius Meagher did receive his commission on the twenty-second day of October. The
      Constitution of Indiana says that no person elected to any judicial office shall, during the
      terns for which he shall have been elected, be eligible to any office of trust or profit under
      the State other than a judicial office. After he was once in office--after he had filed his
      bond and taken his oath, he had no other way of getting out of that office except by
      resigning. Under the statutes of the State he could have resigned his office, but nothings of
      the kind was done. He did not decline it; he did not resign it, but now stands back and says
      he did not try any cases. The County Commissioners have power to diminish and increase the
      number of justices of the peace. It is the statute law of the State. Gentlemen on the other
      side claim that he was not an incumbent at that time, therefore this action of the
      commissioners could not apply to him. Mr. Meagher was in his office before the order of the
      commissioners was made reducing the number of the justices of the peace. The statutes of the
      State say that the commissioners cannot reduce the number of justices of the peace to affect
      the present incumbents, and the commissioners had no right to remove him under the statutes of
      the State. 
     Mr. GOUGH: As I understand the discussion of this case it is narrowed down to the simple
      question, when the time of the office of Mr. Cornelius Meagher began. It is provided that the
      a clerk shall notify the township trustees thirty days before the election in April of any
      vacancy in the office of justice of the peace in his town. Where must the clerk get this
      knowledge? Does the clerk to every justice of the peace and ask him: Does your term expire on
      on a certain day? The clerk simply turns to his record and there he finds when the time of the
      terms begin. When a justice has qualified and the Governor issues his commission, (and in this
      case the commission stated that the terms of his office began on the twenty-ninth day of
      October,) then what does he do? He goes to his county clerk, his bond is filed there and a
      record is made, and the term begins on a certain day;--in this case on the twenty-ninth day of
      October, 1886. We proved that there was to be a vacancy on the twenty-ninth day of October,
      1886. What did the clerk do? He notified the township trustees that there would be such a
      vacancy. That notice was given and the gentleman from Vigo (Mr. Meagher) was elected for a
      term of four years beginning on the twenty-ninth day of October, 1886, and so I think the law
      provides when the term of a justice of the peace shall begin. There is no way to determine
      when a term ends except by the records in the clerks' office. Mr. Meagher was elected: he
      takes every step that the law requires of him; he receives his commission he complies with
      every requirement of the law; he seeks out his bondmen; he goes to the clerk's office and
      his bond is recorded; he takes the oath of office. Now the proof in this case shows that after
      his term of office began, which was the day stated in his commission--after that term began he
      was elected to an office which the Constitution says he was not entitled to hold, and for that
      reason, when it comes to voting, I shall vote that the minority report shall be substituted
      for the majority report. This law will bear another construction. It is simply this: No person
      elected to any judicial office shall, during the term for which he was elected, be eligible to
      any other office but a judicial one. Has not this part of the Constitution disqualified Mr.
      Meagher from holding an office for the term for which he was elected? The Constitution
      provides that for four years, beginning with the eighth day of November, he was ineligible to
      any office. We find him here as a member of this body during the term for which he was
      elected. I say that he is ineligible to hold any office for four years, and for these reasons
      I shall feel myself justified in voting to have Mr. Dickerson fill the seat on this floor of a
      Representative from Vigo county. 
     Mr. JEWETT: The time of this discussion is necessary limited and the questions presented are
      double. I propose to approach this as did the gentleman from Marion (Mr. Griffinths,) to  whose able and candid, but as I believe, fallacious
      argument, couched as it was, in terms of respect, I listened with pleasure. The question
      herein, as stated, is: Was Cornelius Meagher on the third day of November, 1886, the day after
      the election, a justice of the peace? The sole and solitary question is, whether, at the time
      Cornelius Meagher was voted for, there existed a term to which he was elected a justice of the
      peace. The inhibition is upon the term. If a justice of the peace is elected and dies the term
      is not gone. The man may be lost sight of but the term is for four years. This position is
      purely technical. The object of the framers of the Constitution probably was to obtain a
      judiciary free from bias. But be that as it may no sufficient reason can be suggested wherein
      it was ever intended to apply it to a case like that of Cornelius Meagher. The justice of the
      peace whose office Cornelius Meagher was elected to fill held his office until the eighth day
      of November 1886. It is stated that this man had a commission dated on the twenty-ninth day of
      October. The Governor of this State cannot abridge the term of a justice of the peace by
      giving a commission which states that he shall occupy it for a period of four years from a
      time within the term of office of the man he is to succeed. It would follow that the Governor
      of this State could create another justice of the peace and for five days Steinmehl and
      Meagher would have been justices of the peace. It is conceded that the term did not begin--in
      other words, that Steinmehl's term did not expire until they eighth day of November.
      1886. The gentleman from, Marion (Mr. Griffiths) says that Meagher became a justice of the
      peace at the time he took the oath and filed his bond. I ask him, if that be true what became
      of Stienmehl? I ask the gentleman from Marion (Mr. Griffiths) if, after the gentleman from
      Vigo, (Mr. Meagher) had executed this bond and taken the oath, he had made an arrest as a
      peace officer he could have justified himself? His term never did commence and never could
      commence, because the County Commissioners of Vigo county reduced the number of justices of
      the peace to three. The gentleman from Marion (Mr. Griffiths) says that this is a
      constitutional office and could not be abridged, but I apprehend that even if it be a
      constitutional office it may be made to take effect upon the title of all those who bad not
      taken their offices. I call the attention of the House to the case decided in the Senate in
      1875. In 1870 Judge LaRue was elected a Judge of the Common Pleas Court, and entered upon the
      discharge of the duties of the office. In March, 1873, before the expiration of his term of
      offices he was elected to the Senate. His seat was contested. How strong was this case? It was
      this strong: that he had been elected to a judicial office and that during the term for which
      he was elected he was elected to the State Senate. It may be said that the Common Pleas Court
      was not a constitutional office,in so far as it exists by the authority given the Legislature
      to establish courts of inferior jurisdiction. The Supreme Court held that the office of Mayor
      of Jeffersonville was a judicial office. The office of mayor is not mentioned in the
      Constitution. I understand that the principal argument in favor of the late election of a
      Lieutenant Governor of the State is that it is the will of the people. Yet, when the people of
      Vigo count send here their Representative, a plain, blunt man who understands the needs of the
      people be represents, they want to unseat him because he has been a judicial officer; because
      he is a justice of the peace. Cornelius Meagher was eligible to be elected a member of this
      body on the second days of November unless he was then a justice of the peace; that is, unless
      that was during the term for which he was elected. Does any gentleman claim the second day of
      November was during the term for which could not, by any possibility, commence until the
      eighth day of November? If the election was not held during his term of office he was
      eligible. The very next day after the election the Constitution says that Senators and members
      of the House of Representatives shall be in office. After he was voted for and received the
      highest number of votes, on the following day he became a Representative of the people of Vigo
      county and never could enter upon the duties of the office of justice of the peace. The
      election not having occured during the term, he vacated the office because he accepted the
      office of Representative from Vigo county five days before it was possible for him to enter
      upon his term as a justice of the peace. The number of justices of the peace is not fixed by
      the Constitution. In pursuance of law, on the twenty-second day of Sep  tember, 1886, the Board of County Commissioners of Vigo county
      reduced the number of justices of the Peace to three with a qualification: "This
      reduction shall not have the effect to remove anybody from office." At that time this
      justice, Steinmehl, was in office. His term would not empire until the eighth day of November,
      yet on the twenty-second day of September that office was abolished. In the case before the
      Senate, of LaRue, it decided without a roll-call that he was eligible. Cornelius
      Meagher's term as justice would not have commenced if he had never been a candidate for
      the Legislature, until after this election; therefore it was not during his term that he was
      elected; to the Legislature; therefore the votes cast for Mr. Dickerson would not give him a
      right to the office. The minority on this floor simply desire to meet this question as it
      should be met, in the spirit of the Constitution, and preserve to the people of Indiana their
      representation on this floor. There is but one threat that can be held over the heads of the
      majority on this floor; there is but one threat that I allow any man to hold over my head. I
      hold over your heads the will of an outraged people,--the new born, king of politics. That is
      powerful enough to sweep that majority out if it saw fit. 
     Mr. GARDINER : If there is anything in the world that I like it is the spirit of calmness,
      and as I love than principle I have no little cause of complaint against the eloquent
      gentleman from Floyd (Mr. Jewett.) We were willing, on this side of the House, to open the
      discussion of this subject at ten o'clock this morning and consider it through the whole
      day. Yet, although the gentleman himself suggested that the arguments be postponed until two o
      clock this afternoon, he comes now to say that it is as outrage on the people of Vigo county
      to allow them but forty minutes to present their cause. There is no attempt on this side of
      the House to limit the discussion. The floor was open and it is open still, and if the
      gentleman desires another day I will vote to give them all of to-morrow the discussion of the
      subject. The gentleman from Floyd referred to a case which I wish to refer to at this moment.
      Although the office of a Common Pleas Judge is permitted by the Constitution it is not
      required by the Constitution. There is no time fixed by the Constitution for which a Common
      Pleas Judge shall hold his office. It is not a parallel of this case. I wish your attention
      especially to the language of this section of the Constitution which shows the distinction
      between holding an office and being elected to one: "No person elected to any judicial
      office shall, during the term for which he shall have been elected, be eligible to any office
      of trust or profit under the State other than a judicial one." The Supreme Court has
      decided that this clause--"be eligible to any office of trust or profit"-- means,
      incapable of holding ANY office of trust or rout Mr. Meagher qualified for
      the office of justice of the peace. If that be true can he hold an office in this General
      Assembly during the time beginning on the seventh day of November, 1886, and for four years
      succeeding that day? The argument seems to be unanswerable,--Mr. Meagher will not be entitled
      to hold the office. of Legislator if the office begins on the seventh day of November,1886. If
      we conclude that Mr. Meagher, cannot hold his office the only question will be, can Mr.
      Dickerson hold the office? Steinmehl was elected and commissioned in 1878. His office, by the
      terms of his commission, was to begin on the twenty-ninth of October 1878. There was no reason
      shown why he did not at once qualify as justice of the peace. I hold, Mr. Speaker, that if he
      had waited for two months or six months, or any definite length of time, and had not taken the
      oath of office he cannot extend the term for which he had been elected, for when he took the
      oath of office and filed his bond his office would have dated back to the twenty-ninth day of
      October and he held the office for four years from that time. Now it is proven that Mr.
      Meagher was to  succeed Mr. Steinmehl, so far the duties
      of the office were concerned. There was nothing in the way to prevent him claiming its
      functions on the twenty-ninth day of October, 1886. He had the power, and has the power
      to-day, and sits in this Assembly clothed with the powers and official dignity of a judicial
      officer. Upon the sixth day of this month we stood before the Speaker of this House, and swore
      before high Heaven to support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of
      Indiana, and to perform the duties of Legislator according to the best of our abilities, and
      shall we now, allow a man to come into this House not entitled to hold his seat? Do they ask
      us to abandon the right of a man who stands knocking for admission to this floor, and give to
      him with no constitutional or legal right a seat on this floor because twenty-one more people
      in the county of Vigo have said that Cornelius Meagher should have it? Mr. Meagher was elected
      to a judicial office; goes before an officer clothed with the power to administer oaths, and
      swears to perform the duties of justice of the peace for four years. He has declined to clothe
      himself with the powers of the office. There is no power to compel him to do that, but he goes
      to the clerk and swears to perform the duties of justice of the peace; he files his bond; he
      goes about looking for a book which he thinks will give him instruction in the duties of
      justice of the peace. He is put up as a candidate for the office of Representative. When he
      filed his official bond and took the oath of office, that was sufficient notice to the
      citizens. of Vigo county that he held an office which incapacitated him to hold an office on
      this floor. In the convention two of his friends,it is said, informed it that he was a
      judicial officer. The case is presented to your intelligence, and to your consciences. Will
      you trample this Constitution under your feet? Will you trample the statutes of Indiana under
      your feet to keep in place a man who no right to a place on this floor for a single moment? 
     Mr. MEAGHER : Mr. Speaker--I only want to say a word before vote is taken. I am no
      speech-maker; but as I was sent hereto represent the men who earn their living by their daily
      labor, I think I owe it to them to protest against this proposed outrage on one of their
      Representatives. As I am not a lawyer I can't be expected to split hairs in discussing my
      right to a seat on this floor. While it is true that I am but a poor laboring man with a wife
      and children to take care of with the money earned at a puddling-furnace, there are a few
      things that I know as well, may be, as the lawyers do. I know than I never held an office in
      my life until I took my seat on this floor. I know that I never got a dollar from the public
      treasury, and never performed any official duty until I was elected to represent the laboring
      people of Vigo county and the State of Indiana. I know that my constituents elected me by a
      fair and honest majority, and no man has ever dared to deny it; and I know that I would rather
      be expelled from this House a hundred times than to take an office once when the people said
      they didn't want me to have it. If I am to be turned out for the purpose of electing a
      man to the United States Senate who doesn't know a laboring man when he meets him, I will
      be very much surprised. When every man is compelled to admit that I got an honest majority of
      the votes cast in my county for Representative, I have a right to appeal, to every honest man
      on this floor to see that the rights of that majority are protected. Especially do I appeal to
      the members who are here as the representatives of labor to stand by in this fight, because
      this attempt to steal a seat from me is but one of the many outrages perpetrated by our
      enemies to defraud the laboring people of their just dues. If you can afford to turn me out of
      this House upon what scheming politicians call a technicality of the law, I can go back to the
      furnace to earn my daily bread, knowing that I am but a another of the many victims, of
      monopoly and the al- mighty dollar. I thank you for the
      attention you have given me.
     The House refused to substitute the minority for the majority report by yeas 40, nays
      50.
     Mr. GORDON demanded a division of the question on the adoption of the majority report.
     The vote being first taken on that part of the report which declares "Cornelius Meagher
      has no legal right to a seat in this House, " resulted: yeas, 51, nays 40--as follows: 
     
     
     
      
       
        Yeas: Ackman, Barnard, Briant, Brown, Buckles, Cates, Catey, Caven, Commons, Conder,
         Conger, Covert, Davis, Dunn, Fleece, Friend, Gardiner, Glover, Gough, Green, Griffiths,
         Grose, Groves, Harley, Hobson, Howard, Kelley (of Boone), Kelly (of Lagrange), Kercheval,
         Leighty, Little, Loop, McCallum, McCray, McMath, Mackey, Miller, Morse, Montgomery (of
         Gibson), Nolin, Osborn, Oursler, Pleak, Reynolds, Scott, Sinclair, Stubblefield, Thompson,
         Troutt, Van Slyke, Mr. Speaker.
        Nays: Askren, Barnes, Beasley, Blinks, Buskirk, Clarke, Connely, Cox (of Cass), Cox (of
         Miami), Cruson, Custer, Darroch, Foley, Foster, Galbraith, Garrison, Gordon, Harrell,
         Ibach, Jewett, Kellison, Major, Metzger, Mock, Niblack, Montgomery (of Owen), Parker,
         Patton, Pierce, Pleasants, Roberts, Robinson, Schley, Selvey, Shambaugh, Shields, Stull,
         Sunman, Weyand, White.
        Paired: Mr. Alexander with Mr. Harrell; Mr. Cushman with Mr. Linck; Mr. Whitworth with
         Mr. Klein.
       
      
     
     And so it was declared " that Cornelius Meagher has no legal right to a seat in this
      House."
    
    
     THE MAJORITY REPORT: 
     Mr. GRIFFITHS: In behalf of the Committee on Elections, submitted the
      following : [see page 86.] 
     MR. SPEAKER: Your Committee on Elections to whom was referred the
      contested election case of Henry Clay Dickerson versus Cornelius Meagher, from Vigo County,
      have had the same under consideration, and the committee find that the said contestee,
      Cornelius Meagher, was on the 5th day of April, 1886, duly elected a Justice of the Peace of
      Harrison Township, in said county of Vigo, State of Indiana, for the term of four (4) years
      from the 22d day of October, 1886, receiving at said election 2,346 votes; that on the 7th day
      of April, 1886, the clerk of the Circuit Court of Vigo County, State of Indiana, duly
      certified, under the seal of his court, to the Secretary of State of the State of Indiana,
      that the contestee, Cornelius Meagher, among others, was one of the number who had received
      the highest number of votes for the office of Justice of the Peace of Harrison Township, Vigo
      County, Indiana, at said April election, 1886; that on the 15th day, of April, 1886, the
      Governor of the State of Indiana, duly issued to said contestee, Cornelius Meagher, a
      commission as Justice of the Peace of said Harrison Township, Vigo County, State of Indiana,
      for the said term of four (4) years from the 22d day of October, 1886; that on the 5th day of
      May, 1886, said contestee, Cornelius Meagher, duly qualified as such Justice of the Peace by
      taking his official oath as such Justice of the Peace, and filing the same, together with his
      official bond as such Justice of the Peace, in the office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court of
      Vigo County, State of Indiana. 
     That on the 2d day of November, 1886, the same contestee, Cornelius Meagher, was a candidate
      for the office of Representative to the Fifty-fifth General Assembly of the State of Indiana
      for said county of Vigo, and received 5,363 votes,that at said election, the contestor, Henry
      Clay Dickerson, was also a candidate for the same office in said county, and received as such
      candidate for said office 5,342 votes being the next in number to those cast for said
      contestee, Cornelius Meagher, at said election. 
     Your committee further respectfully report that the said contestee claims the facts
      hereinafter stated are evidence that he never accepted the office or justice of the Peace,
      within and for Harrison Township, Vigo County, State of Indiana, which facts we find as
      follows: That at a called session of the Board of Commissioners of Vigo County, held on the
      15th day, of April, 1885, the said Board of Commissioners increased the number of offices of
      Justice of Peace, within and for said township, county and State to the number of five (5) and
      that at the regular session of said Board, held September 22d, 1886 they made an order
      reducing the number of offices of Justices of the Peace to the number of three (3) for said
      township, specify-  ing in said order that it was not
      intended to apply to officers now elected who may qualify, and that in fact the said Cornelius
      Meagher has never performed any of the of official duties of a Justice of the Peace, but which
      facts your committee conclude have no bearing whatever upon the question of the legal right of
      the said Cornelius Meagher to be voted for as a candidate for Representative to the General
      Assembly of this State on the 2d day of November, 1886, and that the case involving such right
      rests wholly upon the facts hereinbefore stated.
      The contestor, Henry Clay Dickerson, placing his contest against the said Cornelius Meagher
      for the office of Representative in the Legislature of this State from the said county of Vigo
      upon the ground that the said Cornelius Meagher was not eligible to be voted for as such
      Representative at said general election, held on the 2d day of November, 1886, the term for
      which the said Cornelius Meagher had been elected and qualified as Justice of the Peace not
      having expired, and that the same would not expire until the 22d day of October, 1890, your
      committee have, so far as they have been able to do so, examined the questions of the law
      involved in the case, and find: 
     That Section 16, of Article VII, of the Constitution of the State of Indiana. provides that
      "No person elected to any judicial office shall, during the term for which he has been
      elected, be eligible to any office of trust, or profit under the State other than a judicial
      office." And that Section 14, of Article VII, of the Constitution of the State of
      Indiana, provides that "A competent number of justices of the peace shall be elected by
      the voters in each township in the several counties. They shall continue in office four years,
      and their powers and duties shall be prescribed by law." 
     That Section 1418 of the Revised statutes of 1881 provides as follows: 
     "The number of justices of the peace in each township shall be regulated by the Board
      of County Commissioners of the county by proper orders of record, but the number shall not
      exceed three for each township, and one in addition thereto for each incorporated town
      therein, and two in addition thereto for each incorporated city therein, and authenticated
      copies of such orders shall be furnished by the Auditor to the Clerk of the Circuit
      Court," 
     That Section 1419 of the Revised Statutes of 1881 provides as follows:
      "The reduction of such number shall not operate to remove any Justice of the Peace
      from office,"
      Touching the question of the power of the Board of Commissioners by their order made at
      their special session in April, 1885 to increase the number of Justices of the Peace for the
      township of Harrison to five, we call the attention of the House to the case of Oliver vs.
      Keightley, Auditor of Putnam County, and others, 24 Ind. 514--520, in which the Supreme Court
      used the following language: 
     "The statute provides that the Board [Board of Commissioners] shall be summoned for any
      object in which the county is interested, but it does not in terms limit their action to that
      object, nor does it require the Auditor to state in any official form the purpose for which
      they are convened. Were we then to hold that the action of the Board must be limited to those
      matters which, in the opinion of the Auditor, the interests of the county, demand they should
      consider, while the statute permits him to lock within his own breast all knowledge of the
      motives that prompt his act, we would simply make the validity of every order of the Board, at
      their special sessions, to depend upon the uncertain memory of the officer empowered to summon
      their together. We do not think the Legislature intended to rest the validity of such action
      on such a basis. It seems more reasonable to suppose that when the Board have been summoned
      together, as the law has not provided that the special object of their meeting should be
      stated, that they are to be trusted rather than the Auditor with the power to determine the
      subjects which the interests of the county demand they should consider." 
     In the same connection we also cite from the case of the City of Vincennes vs. Windman, 72
      Ind. 219.
     "Under the present statute there is no doubt as to the power of the Auditor to call the
      Board [Board of Commissioners] together in special session, nor is there any doubt of the
      power of the Board to transact at such special session ordinary county business. The doctrine
      is indeed carried much further in the cases of Oliver vs. Keightley, 24 Ind. 514, and the
      Board, etc., vs. Brown, 28 Ind. 161, but not far enough to include cases where notice of
      pendency of special statutory proceedings must be given, or where there may be adversary
      proceedings.
     Under these decisions we are of the opinion that the action of the Board of Commissioners of
      Vigo County at their special session in April, 1885, increasing the number of offices of
      Justice of the Peace of Harrison Township in said county to five, said number not exceeding
      the limit provided for in [Section.] 1418 of the Revised Statutes of 1881, was in all
      respects, proper, valid and binding. The call of the Auditor of Vigo County for said special
      session, and the service of the same on the same of the Commissioners, is a part of the record
      evidence in the case. As to the action of the Board of County Commissioners of Vigo county in
      September, 1886, reducing the number of the offices of Justice of the Peace in and for said
      Harrison Township to three, we have to say that said order specially provided that it was not
      intended to apply to officers now elected who may qualify. 
     We have to say, further, that the office of Justice of the Peace is a constitutional office,
      the term of which is provided for in that instrument. 
      The Legislature could not, much less the Board of County Commissioners, by any action on
      their part, deprive a person who had been elected to and invested with said  office by qualifying and filing bonds as such Justice of the Peace,
      of the right of exercising the same. 
     That Section 1419 of the Revised Statutes of 1881; already referred to in this re-port,
      expressly enacts: "That no reduction of the number of the offices of Justice of the
      Peace, shall operate to remove any Justice of the Peace from Office."
     We conclude, therefore, from the constitutional provisions on the subject, the statutory
      enactment in aid thereof, and the language of the order itself, that said order of September
      22, 1886, by the Board of County Commissioners of Vigo County, reducing the number of officers
      of Justice of the Peace in and for said Harrison Township, Vigo County, Indiana, to three, can
      in nowise affect the question of the eligibility of the said contestee, Cornelius Meagher, to
      a seat in this House.
      Without encumbering this report with the citation of a large number of authorities, we call
      attention to the latest expression of opinion by our Supreme Court as to the fact that the
      office of Justice of the Peace is a judicial office.
      In the case of Gottlieb Vogel vs. State of Indiana ex. rel. William A. Land. Prosecuting
      Attorney, etc., decided September 14, 1886, the court says: 
     "It is well settled under our Constitution and statutes, that the office of Justice of
      the Peace is a judicial office."
      And touching the question of the eligibility of a person having been elected to a judicial
      office to be elected to any office of trust or profit under the State other than a judicial
      office, during the term for which was elected to such judicial office, the court in the same
      case holds as follows: 
     "By the section of the Constitution under consideration (being section 16, article 7),
      a person elected to a judicial office is ineligible to an office other than judicial the term
      of which begins before the expiration of the term of the judicial office. Such is the effect
      of the ruling in the case of Smith vs. Moore, 90th Indiana, 294, and the cases their cited;
      and such is the reasonable construction of the constitutional provision. It results,
      therefore, that, as Mark's term as Justice of the Peace had not expired on the 6th day of
      April, 1886, at which time the term of Township Trustee, he was ineligible to that
      office."
     This case, so closely and completely covering the propositions the office of Justice of the
      Peace is a judicial one, and that a person having been elected to such office is ineligible to
      be elected to any office of trust or profit under this State, other than a judicial office,
      during the period for which he as affected to such office, your committee deem it unnecessary
      to cite farther from the long line of uninterrupted authorities in this State sustaining the
      Court upon the propositions.
      A case very similar to the pending one came before the Lower House of the General Assembly
      of this State in the regular session of 1869. 
     It was the contested election case of Samuel Beatty vs. James A. Peelle. The contestee ,
      James A., Peelle, was voted for for the office of Representative to the General Assembly of
      the State of Indiana during the term for which be had been elected as Justice of the Peace. He
      qualified as such Justice. The majority report of the Committee on
       Elections found that he was ineligible to the office of Representatives for that
      reason, and that the person who received the newt highest number of votes was entitled to the
      seat. The minority report, signed by, A. Zollars (now one of the judges of our Supreme Court)
      and by Wm. Neff, while differing from the majority report on some points, also expressly held
      that the sitting member, Peelle, was ineligible because of the constitutional prohibition
      contained in section 16, article 7, of our State Constitution. 
     This seems to dispose of the question as to the right of the said contestee, Cornelius
      Meagher, to be elected to the office of Representative of Vigo County to the General Assembly
      of the State of Indiana, at the last general election, and to be conclusive of the fact that
      he was ineligible to be so elected to said office, and that he is not entitled to a seat on
      the floor of this House as a member of the House of Representatives of the Fifty-fifth General
      Assembly of this State, and your committee so find. 
     We now proceed to consider whether the contestor, Henry Clay Dickerson, his opponent at said
      election, ie entitled to take the seat now held by the contestee, Cornelius Meagher, and upon
      this subject we refer to the case of Gulick vs. New, 14th Indiana, 93, in which the Court
      says, "that whilst it is true that the votes of, the majority shall rule, the tenable
      ground appears to be that if the majority should vote for one wholly incapable of taking the
      office, having notice of such incapacity, or should perversely refuse or negligently fail to
      express their choice, those, although in the minority, who should legitimately choose one
      eligible to the position, should be heeded. True, by the Constitution and laws of this State,
      the voice of the majority controls our elections, but that voice must be constitutionally and
      legally expressed. Even a majority should not nullify a provision Of the Constitution or be
      permitted at will to disregard the law. In this is the strength sacs beauty of our
      institutions."
      In the same opinion it is held that "Courts will be compelled to take notice of who
      was the incumbent of the office of Mayor during the time he discharged judicial functions
      under the laws of the State, and we are unable to see any good reason leading to the
      conclusion that citizens within the jurisdiction of a judicial office are not also chargeable
      with notice of who is the incumbent of that office." 
     The court further held that because Wallace , who was elected Mayor of the city of
      Indianapolis, was given by law the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace throughout the
      county, therefore all the voters of the county were chargeable with notice of his
      ineligibility. 
     And, now, in the case of Gottlieb Vogel vs. State of Indiana, ex. rel. Wm. A. Land,
      prosecuting, etc., supra, the Supreme Court after holding the appellee to have been in  eligible to the office of Township Trustee, under Section
      16, Article VII, of our State Constitution, states the law to be that " Votes cast for
      him can not be counted against appellant, who was eligible. As appellant received the next
      highest number of votes he was properly elected, and was and is entitled to the
      office."
     Your Committee, therefore conclude from the facts herein stated and the precedents cites,
      that the said contestor, Henry Clay Dickerson, is entitled to the seat in this House of
      Representatives now held by Cornelius Meagher, the contestee, and said Henry Clay Dickerson,
      having been eligible to be voted for, for said office of Representative at the time of the
      general election, November 2, 1886, and being now eligible to hold said office.
     And your Committee therefore recommend the adoption by this House of the following
      resolution:
     
     
     
      
       
        Resolved, That Henry Clay Dickerson, having been duly elected a Representative for the
         county of Vigo, in the 55th General Assembly of the State of Indiana, he having been
         eligible to be voted for, for said office, at the general election, November 2, 1886, and
         being now eligible to hold said office, of right ought to be, and is, hereby declared to be
         elected and his hereby admitted to his seat in this House of Representatives, as
         Representative for the county aforesaid, and that Cornelius Meagher has no legal right to a
         seat in this House of Representatives as the Representative for the county aforesaid, he
         not being eligible for that office at the time of the general election, held on the 2d day
         of November, 1886, and not being eligible now to hold that office. 
        The following members of your Committee concur in the forgoing report:

     THE MINORITY REPORT:
     Mr. CLARK, from the Committee on Elections, submitted the following
      minority report:
     In the matter of the contest proceedings of Henry C. Dickerson vs. Cornelius Meagher: 
     To the Speaker of the House of the General Assembly of Indiana:
     The undersigned, members of your Committee on Elections, beg leave to
      submit the following report:
     It is charged by the contestor that Cornelius Meagher, who now sits as a member of this
      body, was ineligible to election as such member, for the reason, as was alleged, that when so
      elected a member he was an incumbent of a judicial office.
     The facts as shown by the record, and disclosed in the evidence before the committee, are in
      substance as follows: 
     A township convention was held by the Democratic votes of Harrison Township, Vigo County,
      Indiana (in which township the city of Terra Haute is located), in the spring of 1886, and
      divers persons were nominated for the offices to be filled at the ensuing April election.
     The contestee, Mr. Meagher, was a candidate before that Convention for the office of
      Township Trustee, but having been unsuccessful, he was, without his consent and against his
      wish nominated by the convention as one of five Justices of the Peace, who were to be chosen
      at the April election. The result of that election was such that he was chosen, together with
      for other candidates, all of whom received a higher number of votes than himself. Several
      weeks thereafter, on May, 5, 1886, he took the oath of office, and filed his bond. But he in
      no way, at any time, endeavored to discharge the duties of a Justice of the Peace; nor did he
      make any arrangements whatever to do so. He testified that it never was his intention to
      discharge the duties of the office, and it was conceded that be never received the dockets of
      a predecessor, or in any way held himself out Justice of the Peace. 
     That Mr. Meagher could not have acted as a justice of the peace, even had he wished to do
      so, is shown by the following facts: When the election was held in April there were five
      vacancies or anticipated vacancies to be filled. The then incumbents of the offices of justice
      of the peace were David Goldman, Samuel C. Lockman, James F. Murphy, Caleb Gartrell and Jacob
      Steinmehl. The persons chosen at such election were William M. Slaughter, Abraham Felsenthal,
      Alexander Thomas, Joseph Wildy, and the contestee, Cornelius Meagher. It was conceded in the
      record of this case by the written stipulations of the contestor and contestee that the
      several justices of the peace who held their offices at the time of the April election were
      respectively succeeded in their offices as follows: Slaughter succeeded Goldman in May, and
      Felsenthal succeeded Lockman in April; Thomas succeeded Murphy in October, and Wildy succeeded
      Gartrell November 17, 1886; and that each of the newly elected justices received the dockets
      of predecessor. The line of succession thus shown left but one of the old justices in office,
      to-wit, Justice Steinmehl, whose term expired November 7, 1886, Mr. Meagher could, by any
      possibility, have succeeded. In point of fact, Mr. Meagher did not, however, succeed Mr.
      Steinmehl, but the latter continued in office until the expiration of his term, to-wit, the
      8th day of November, 1886, and then deposited his dockets, as required by law, with the
      nearest justice. It is conceded in the record of that Justice Steinmehl was first elected as
      such justice in the spring of 1878; that he succeeded one B. F. Clark, whose term of office
      expired on the 7th day of November, 1878,; and on that day, assumed the duties there of and
      that in the spring of 1882 Steinmehl was elected his own successor, and continued in office
      thereafter until the 7th. day of November, 1886, being the two full constitutional terms of
      four years each.
      It is further conceded in the record that Mr. Meagher was elected as a member of the lower
      house of the General Assembly  on November 2, 1886 and,
      therefore, became, by virtue of the Constitution, a member of that body on the following day,
      November 3, five days before he could by any possibility have become a Justice of the Peace,
      or have filled any vacancy in the office of the Justice.
     It is further conceded that the Board of Commissioners of Vigo County, on September 22,
      1886, passed an order reducing the number of Justices of the Peace in Harrison Township from
      five to three, but that this order, by its terms, was not intended to apply to person already
      elected, but who might thereafter qualify. This order abolished the office to which Mr.
      Meagher had been declared elected in April, 1886, and he never availed himself of the
      exception contained in the order by qualifying after the passage of the order.
     The foragoing are, in substance, the facts disclosed by the record and the evidence in the
      case. And the undersigned, members of the Committee, feel confident that they wholly fail to
      establish the ineligibility charged against Mr. Meagher. That this conclusion is correct will
      appear from the following considerations.
     
      First. It is shown that there was no vacancy which could have been filled by Mr.
       Meagher after his election in April, 1886, until November 8, 1886, and five days prior to the
       expiration of the term of the office of his predecessor he had become a member of the lower
       house of this body. The Constitution of the State prohibits the holding of more than one
       lucrative office at the same time. Article ii, section 9 (R. S., sec. 90). The Constitution
       also provides that Representatives shall be elected "for the term of two years, from the
       day next after their general election." Article iv, section 3 (R. S. 1881, section 99).
      
     
     Mr. Meagher having become a member of their body on November 3, by virtue of the general
      election held on the 2d, was prohibited by this provision of the Constitution from holding the
      office of Justice of the Peace, to which otherwise he might have succeeded if a vacancy
      existed on November 8.
     
      Second. It is shown that the Board of Commissioners reduced the number of Justices
       for Harrison Township from five to three, and that these positions had been succeeded to by
       other of the newly elected justices prior to the general election in November. The office,
       therefore, to which Meagher had been elected in April 1886, was not longer in existence, and
       could not have been filled by him.
      Third. The constitutional objection urged by the contestor does not apply to the
       contestee, Mr. Meagher, for the reason that, as shown by the record, he never in any way
       assumed the duties of the office of Justice of the Peace, never attempted to do so, never
       received the dockets of any predecessor, or any dockets whatever, and did no act of any kind
       indicating to the public of Harrison township that he assumed or pretended to be a Justice of
       the Peace. He was not, therefore, within the meaning of the Constitution and the law, a
       Judicial officer at the time of his election as a member of this body. That he was not each
       an officer in the opinion of a majority of the voters is conclusively shown by the fact, that
       they called him to serve in a different capacity. We submit that this evidence of the
       understanding of his neighbors and fellow-citizens should receive the greatest consideration
       in the settlement of the disputed question. The whole facts bearing upon the question were
       before them, and their decision, as evidenced in the election of Mr. Meagher as a member of
       this body, should be deemed, if not of conclusive character, certainly entitled to the
       greatest respect. 
      Fourth. It was distinctly decided by the Supreme Court of Indiana, in the case of
       Smith vs. Moore, 90 Indiana, page 294, in construing the section of the Constitution under
       which it is claimed Mr. Meagher was ineligible, that such provision, "without doubt, was
       meant to apply to Judges in office, and not to persons who may be chosen simply, but never
       qualified or 'entered upon the discharge of official duties.' " 
     
     The undersigned members of the committee, therefore, submit and fled that the contestee.
      Cornelius Meager was not ineligible to election as a member of thin body on November 2d, 1886;
      and that he is lawfully and of right a member of this body, and is entitled to retain his seat
      therein. And they also submit and find that the contestor, Henry C. Dickerson, is not entitled
      to a seat in this House. 
     They therefore respectfully show that their report herein as above set out should be
      received and adopted as the sense of this body. Respectfully submitted. THOS, M. CLARKE, JOHN
      R. CUSHMAN. SYLVESTER BERTRAM, Per John R. Cushman.

     ELECTION of UNITED STATES SENATOR.
     Mr. GARDINER called up the Senate resolution inviting the House to meet in the Senate
      chamber to elect a United States Senator [see page 44 of these Reports] and moved to
      substitute therefore and following:
     
     
     
      
       
        Whereas, It is the unbroken precedent in the General Assembly of this State for the

        Whereas, The convenience and comfort of members will be better subserved by meeting in
         said Hall, because of its greater capacity and convenience for the holding of joint
         conventions than in the Senate Chamber; and, 
        Whereas, In the belief that the long line of unbroken and uninterrupted precedents would
         not, and should not, be departed from in this instance, there being no necessity, apparent
         or real, therefor, preparation has been made for the accommodation and comfort of the
         Senators in this House at any and all such joint conventions that may be held; therefore,
         be it 
        Resolved, That the Senate be and is hereby invited to meet the House of Representatives
         in the Hall of the House of Representatives at twelve o'clock, meridian, of Wednesday,
         the ninteenth instant, to proceed in the election of a Senator from this State to the
         Congress of the United States, and then to proceed therein from day to day as the law
         directs.

      session [see page 74 of these Reports] in reference to the amounts that had been set apart
      from the semi-annual school revenue for the State Normal School at Terre Haute. This special
      distribution was first made in 1869. The semi-annual appropriations for the school in question
      have been continued ever since. Until 1873 the annual amount was ten thousand dollars per
      year, and for ten years thereafter fifteen thousand dollars annually, and since 1883 twenty

     JOINT STANDING COMMITTEES. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem. submitted his appointment of joint standing committees on the part of
      the Senate, to-wit: 
     On Enrolled Bills: Fowler, Zimmerman and Davis.

     On State Library: Hale, Triplett, Duncan of Tipton. 
     On Claims: McDonald of Whitley, Weir and Macy. 
     On Woman's Claims: Thompson of Marion, Howard of Decatur,and
      Schroyer. 
    
    
     EXTRA DOORKEEPERS.
      Mr. DAVIS: On Thursday of last week I sent up to the clerk's desk and had read a
      protest [see page 73 of these Reports] signed by myself, and asked that it be spread upon the
      journals of the Senate. Afterward several other Senators united with me in that protest. In
      examining the journal of the Senate I find out this morning that through some inadvertance-- I
      don't charge it as done intentionally--a line of my copy was omitted, and the way it is
      recorded it does not make sense. Both the Secretary and his assistant have searched for the
      original but it cannot be found. I want to have that corrected, and for that purpose I send up
      a substitute protest in language as nearly word for word as I can remember that was in the
      original one. If the original can be found I am willing it shall be recorded as written. I ask
      that the protest be corrected, and to have this put upon record. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The. chair don't know why there was any mistake, if there was
      any. Mr. Carter, what has become of the original protest? 
     The ASSISTANT SECRETARY [Mr. Carter]: I really don't know, Mr. President. That is in
      charge of the Principal Secretary.
      The PRESIDENT pro tem.: It goes upon the journal, does it not? 
     The ASSISTANT SECRETARY: Yes, sir. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: Is it upon your journal as originally sent up? 
     The ASSISTANT SECRETARY: I think so. 
     Mr. DAVIS: I think a line was left out in copying. There were two reasons given upon which
      the protest  was based and the first one is left out. I
      enclosed in brackets in the one I sent up, the words left out.
      Mr. RAHM: I move that the substitute be read as well as the original. 
     Mr. DAVIS: It is a protest against the employment of fifteen extra doorkeepers., The first
      ground of the protest is that such employment is for a greater number than authorized by
      section 4970 of the Revised Statutes; and second, that such employment necessitates a useless
      expenditure of the public monies. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: Let Senator Davis look after it himself and see that the omitted
      part is placed in.
    
    
     EXTRA CLERK.
      On motion by Mr. FOWLER, the, Committee on Enrolled Bills were
      authorized to employ, a clerk. 
     After a recess of fifteen or more minutes--At about four o'clock--- 
    
    
     THE BRANAMAN AND M'D0NALD CONTEST.
      Mr. BAILEY, chairman of the Committee on Elections, submitted the
      following majority report: 
     MR. PRESIDENT: Your Committee on elections, having under consideration
      the matter of the contested election case of Frank Branaman, contester, against Wm. N.
      McDonald, contestee, for the office of State Senator from the counties of Jackson and
      Lawrence, respectfully report that they have carefully examined the depositions and all other
      papers referred to them, and taken oral testimony of such witnesses: as have come before them
      regarding the matter in controversy.
      And your committee finds that on the 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th days of December, 1886, at
      the Clerk's office of Jackson County, Indiana, at Brownstown, pursuant to commissions
      issued to them as Justice of the Peace, Mills S. Reeves and James W. Allen took the testimony
      in writing of a large number of witnesses touching the matters stated in the complaint herein,
      a copy of which is filed herewith, marked "Exhibit A," and made a part thereof. That
      at the taking of said testimony before said Justices of the Peace the contestor and contestee
      were present in person and by their attorneys.
      Your committee also took the testimony of witnesses brought before it by the contestor and
      contestee in the presence of said contestor and contestee. 
     It was made to appear to your committee that during the taking of the testimony before said
      Justices of the Peace, that the contestee desired to introduce witnesses to prove that the
      contester was guilty of bribery, which was refused by said Justices of the Peace because it
      was incompotent and irrelevant, it being an attempt to prove the guilt of the contestor, there
      being no charge or accusation filed against him but that afterward, to-wit: On the 23d, 24th,
      27th and 28th days of December 1886, the contestee took the depositions of a large number of
      witnesses before 0. H. a Montgomery, a notary public, at Seymour, Indiana, by which he
      attempted to prove bribery upon the part of the contester. 
     That your committee has carefully examined and considered all said deposition and finds that
      no such charge has been made by anyone against said concestor nor has such fact been proved
      against him
     Upon the whole case your committee finds:
     
       First. That the contestee, William N McDonald, did, while he was a candidate for
       the office of State Senator from the senatorial district composed of the counties of Jackson
       and Lawrence, Indiana, give to the voters of said senatorial district, and offer to give
       them, bribes of large sums of money to secure his election at the November election, 1886, to
       the office of State Senator aforesaid from the district aforesaid, which will particularly
       appear by reference to the testimony of W. M. McClellen, Wm. Champion, Richard Madden, John
       B, Able, Alfred Guthrie and George Tidd, which is hereto attached and made a part hereof;
       which statements were wholly undenied by said McDonald, and that the said William N. McDonald
       thereby has disqualified himself for holding the office of Senator aforesaid during the term
       for which he was elected.
       Second. That at the time of said election and for at least tea days or two weeks
       previous thereto, it was a matter of common rumor and generally and publicly known by the
       voters of said senatorial district that the said William N. McDonald was corruptly using
       money, and intended to use money in th manner aforesaid for the purpose of securing his
       election to the office of Senator aforesaid, as will be seen by reference to the testimony of
       Herman Brunning and Frank Branaman filed herewith and because of these facts, and the further
       fact that the contestor, Frank Branaman, received the next highest number of votes cast at
       said election for Senator aforesaid, that the said Frank Branaman was duly elected to said
       office of Senator, and is now entitled to the same. 
     
     Wherefore your committee recommends the adoption of the following resolutions.
     
     
     
      
       
        Resolved, That it is the judgment of the Senate of the State of Indiana, that Wm.
         McDonald, who is now holding a seat in the Senate as Senator from the counties of Jackson
         and Lawrence, Indiana, has disqualified himself for holding the said office of Senator
         during the term for which he was elected by giving and offering to give bribes of large
         sums of money to secure him election to said office of Senator, and that Frank Branaman,
         contestor, was, at said election, duly elected to said office of Senator; and is now
         entitled to the same, and, that he now be sworn into said office as Senator from the counties of Jackson and Lawrence aforesaid.
        Resolved, That this report be spread at full length upon the Journal of the Senate.
        Respectfully submitted, LEON O. BAILEY,
          Chairman, Committee on Elections., F.M. HOWARD,
          F. M. GRIFFITH.
        
       
      
     
     Mr. BAILEY: I desire to say but a few words. As life is short and time is fleeting, I desire
      to move the adoption of the report and upon that I move the previous question.
     Mr. DRESSER: I desire to say that we wish to make a minority report. The evidence was closed
      only about 15 minutes before the reading of this report. It is but right and fair that the
      minority should be heard before a vote is taken.
     Mr. BAILEY: It was understood by the committee that this report should be submitted now and
      that the minority report, which was not prepared, should be submitted in the morning. The
      Senate knows now, as well as it will then, that the minority report will be adverse to the
      maj. report. I see no reason that there should be any delay, there is other and very important
      business pressing the Committee on Elections; there are a large number of
      important witnesses from a distance to be examined, and the committee is compelled to work
      night and day.
     Mr. JOHNSON: Senators on this floor have not heard a word of testimony except as presented
      in the maj. report, and how can any Senator discharge the duties imposed upon him by the
      obligation of his oath, unless he hears the testimony on both sides?
     Mr. DRESSER: I understood that while the majority desired to make a report now, that no
      action would be taken until the minority should report. This Senate cannot intelligently act
      until the entire proceedings before that committee are before it, and they cannot be before it
      until the minority make a report; therefore I think it but just that the matters should remain
      open until the minority report shall be submitted to the Senate.
     Mr. BAILEY: I take it that this argument is somewhat out of order; and will add that the
      report submitted sets forth almost verbatim the testimony that pertains to the case. There is
      other testimony referring to the contestor, but the committee finds after full consideration,
      that there is nothing at all conclusive, or by which the committee could infer guilt upon his
      part. I desire the question shall now be put.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The question is: Will the Senate 2nd the demand for the previous
      question?
     Mr. WINTER: I desire to ask a question. Is it a fact that before this committee there was
      oral testimon introduced proving that some witnesses testified that they had received
      money--that a majority were men whose character for truth and veracity was notoriously bad,
      --that these very men were themselves engaged in buying votes for Mr. Branaman?
     Mr. BAILEY: In answer to that question which embraces several propositions I would say: no.
      I have heard no testimony from which any such inference could be drawn. Then testimony of four
      stands undenied, even by McDonald himself, although given an opportunity on three different
      occasions. He has refused and still refuses to deny these charges. He says money was given but
      not to buy votes.
     Mr. WINTER: What did the chairman of the Election Committee [Mr. Bailey]
      mean when he promised the minority should have a chance to report? Did he suppose the minority
      would report after this was disposed of?
     Mr. BAILEY: The stenographer had prepared the testimony as far she was able, and the report
      was prepared and ready for submission after the hearing of the testimony. The minority of the
      committee said they desired to submit a report, and the majority decided to submit their
      report now. The minority said they would submit their report in the morning. There was nothing
      said as to the time when this action should be made, and I take it if the majority is more
      zealous and industrious there is no reason why we should wait for the minority--they may be a
      week in preparing their report.

     
      Mr. WINTER: Another question---
     The PRESIDENT pro tempere (interposing): The question is: will the Senate second the demand
      for the previous question?
      Mr. JOHNSOON, addressed the chair. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore : The chair will decide further debate out of order until the
      sense of the Senate is taken. 
     Mr. JOHNSON continues speaking while
      The PRESIDENT pro tempore put the question. The Senate has seconded the demand for the
      previous question. The Senator [Mr. Johnson] will take his seat. [Rapping with the gavil.] I
      don't want the Senator to stand on the floor again when the chair is putting a question. 
     Mr. CAMPBELL This is not a report from a majority of the committee, it is signed by but
      three. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: It is a majority report, The chair so decides. Two members of the
      committee being paired on that question, three is a majority of the committee. The question
      is: shall the main question be now put? 
     
     
     It was so ordered by yeas 24, nays 21. 
     Pending the roll call---
     Mr. BARRETT said: Believing that there should be a reasonable time given for the minority to
      be heard, I vote "no." 
     Mr. JOHNSON: For the reason that I desire to act intelligently and hear all the evidence,
      and that I cannot do without having a report from the minority of the committee, I vote
      "no."
     Mr. LOGSDON: I think the minority should be as industrious as the majority. I vote
      "aye." 
     Mr. MCDONALD, of Whitley: After reading the report and the statements
      made on this floor about it, I think the minority have had an equal opportunity with the
      majority to prepare a report. I would like to agree with my colleague [Mr. Barrett], but I am
      compelled to vote "aye." 
     Mr. URMSTON: Believing as I do that there would, be nothing lost by waiting for the
      minority, although the minority has not been industrious in bringing in their report; and
      believing they should have an opportunity to bring in their report, therefore I vote
      "no."
     The result was announced as above. 
     Mr. CAMPBELL: I move that the tote be taken on the propositions separately--that we have a
      division of the question. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The question is first upon that part of the resolution which
      relates to the explusion of the Senator from Jackson and Lawrence--Senator McDonald.

     Which was agreed to by yeas 29, nays 16, as follows: 
     
     
     
      
       
        YEAS. Andrew,Bailey, Barret, Berry, Cox, Day, Duncan (of Brown), Fowler, Griffith, Hale,
         Howard(of Decatur), Howard (of St. Joseph), Logsdon, McClure, McDonald (of Whitley),
         Mullinix, Peterson,Rahm, Schloss, Sellers, Shively, Smith (of Wells), Thompson (of Marion),
         Tharp, Trippet, Urmston, Zimmerman, Mr. President 
        NAYS. Campbell, Davis, DeMotte, Drake, Duncan (of Tipton), Ensley, Harness, Huston,
         Johnson, Kennedy, Macy, Marshall, Moon, Schroyer, Thompson (of Jasper), and Winter.
        PAIRED: Mr. Dresser with Mr. 
          Weir
          Wier
         , Mr. Sears with Mr. French. 
       
      
     
     Pending the roll call: 
     Mr. BARRETT (when his name was called, said): I voted "no" upon putting the
      previous question, because I thought perhaps the Senator might be heard in his own behalf, but
      inasmuch as that is passed, and I have heard no word from himself or colleagues that he
      desires to be heart to refuse the charges against him, I vote "aye." 
     Mr. FOWLER: Knowing nothing about this matter at all only as I gather it from the report of
      the committee which has been read, and relying upon that report, I vote "aye.' 
     Mr. HOWARD of St. Joseph's explanation was not heard.
     Mr. HUSTON: Believing as I do that Senator McDonald is entitled to be heard, and that the
      other side of  the case should be presented ; and
      believing further that the understanding was on the part of the minority that they should be
      allowed to make a minority report; and believing that the majority of this body are taking
      upon themselves unwarranted authority tasting a stigma upon Senator McDonald without his being
      allowed a hearing, I vote "no." 
     Mr. JOHNSON: It is conceded that we have only a majority report here which does not give all
      the testimony. A minority of the committee will make a report containing other testimony and
      material testimony not in the majority report; and because I am unwilling, it being not
      according to the genius of our American institution to brand any man as a briber and send him
      out without a fair trial, I vote "no." 
     Mr. KENNEDY: I wish to be excused from voting. [Several Senators---"No,"
      "No."] If the Senate won't excuse me, for the reason that I believe this report
      was made up before the evidence was taken, I vote "no." 
     Mr. MARSHALL: Believing that every citizen and every man, whether he holds office in this
      great State or no, has the right to a fair trial and a fair show, although he may be charged
      with murder; and as a Senator upon this floor I say and believe that the sitting member ought
      to have a fair showing in this case, and that this stigma should not be placed upon him
      without a hearing; and believing there are many Senators on the other side who hold their
      seats upon the same conditions, I vote "no." 
     Mr. SHIVELY: Believing as I do that the testimony taken by the Committee on
       Elections and reported to this Senate is true, which shows that money was used to
      procure votes to aid Mr. McDonald in his election, I therefore vote "aye."
      Mr. MCDONALD, of Jackson: This evidence has all been manufactured me. I
      don't desire to vote but I think I should have a fair hearing;--I think I should have a
      fair deal.
      The vote was then announced as ,r; hove 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem,: The next question is on that part of the resolution which provides
      for the seating of Frank Branaman. 
     
     
     Which was also adopted by yeas 29 nays 16. 
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. DAVIS said: I wish to say one word. I understand it is one of the cardinal principles of
      American jurisprudence that every man is entitled to be heard on any charge that might be
      brought to trial before any court. I understand that we, as sworn members of this branch of
      the General Assembly of Indiana, stand in this case in the relation of jurors, and as jurors
      we ought to hear the evidence both for and against the question on which we are called upon to
      vote. As the only question is as to the right of the contestee to his seat, and as evidence of
      his right was ruled out by the justice of the peace before whom it was taken, and as I do not
      know the rights of these parties, I cannot therefore vote intelligently.
      Mr. BAILEY : You state that evidence was ruled out. There is no evidence of that. This is
      true: that the defence proposed to introduce witnesses upon the single point of proving the
      same thing against Branaman that was charged against McDonald, and the testimony that went to
      the contradiction of the testimony was admitted. It is a clear case that such evidence as that
      cannot but be herd as immaterial to the issue.
     The PRESIDENT pro. tem.: I don't intend to cut off Senator Davis, for the explaining of
      votes has been indulged by the chair; but unless explanations are brief the chair will have to
      hold that, operating under the previous question, an explanation is out of order. 
     Mr. DAVIS : Believing as I do that the testimony ruled out goes directly to the competency
      and the right of the contestee to his seat; and as we were not permitted to hear that
      evidence, therefore I do not know whether this contestee has a right to the seat, I vote
      "no." 
     Mr. HUSTON : Believing as I do that even though Senator McDonald  has been expelled hastily and indecently, notwithstanding that, his
      opponent is not entitled to his seat; and knowing that the consideration that it merits has
      not been given to this question; consequently I vote "no." 
     Mr. JOHNSON:, I understand that evidence, is excluded, and I under stand when the contestee
      comes to show that fact, that is rejected by the committee. 
     The PRESIDENT pro, term.: The Senator, from Wayne (Mr. Johnson) may explain his vote
      briefly. 
     Mr. JOHNSON: Efforts were made to prove that Branaman himself was bribing voters, but that
      was ruled out; and believing that the Constitution and the laws * * * I vote
      "no."
      Mr. SELLERS : As I understand the law of Indiana it is something like this as it relates to
      this question: If a candidate for office has disqualified himself by a corrupt use of money,
      and that fact is established ,the one receiving the next highest number of votes is rightfully
      entitled to the office. As there is evidence showing that fact I vote "aye." 
     Mr. HUSTON: Will the Senator allow a question? 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The chair will rule a question out of order. It will not be
      permitted by the chair, operating under the previous question. 
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Jasper: The evidence is insufficient to. convict a man of crime. There
      seems to be no pertinent testimony reported by the majority of the committee. I vote
      "no" 
     Mr. URMSTON: Believing as I do, as a legal and legislative proposition, that there ought to
      have been some charges preferred before evidence was introduced as to what he might have done,
      I vote "aye." 
     Mr. WINTER: Mere rumor has never yet been held by any respectable court as sufficient to
      convict. Much testimony introduced in this case has been irrelavent, and there has been a
      large mass of testimony taken on behalf of Senator McDonald which has been carefully
      suppressed by the majority in this report, which shows that Branaman was as guilty and ever
      more guilty than is claimed by McDonald. I vote "no."
      The result was then announced as above. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Frank Branaman will present himself before the bar of the Senate.
      Hold up your hand. [Administers the oath.] 
     Mr. BAILEY: I desire now--- 
     Mr. WINTER [interposing]: By permission of my colleague (Mr. Bailey) I desire to protest
      against the unseating of Senator McDonald and the seating of Mr. Branaman. 
     Mr. BAILEY: I desire to mover that the vote upon the adoption of this report as a whole be
      reconsidered, and that the motion be laid on the table. 
     
     
     The latter motion, was agreed to by yeas 29, nays 15,
    
    
      THE UNSEATING OF LEGISLATORS.
      Mr. HOWARD, of Shelby, offered the following:
     
     
     
      
       
         Whereas, It appears that the interests the people of Indiana are seriously endangered by
         the commotion and political strife now existing in this General Assembly and arising from
         the matter and manner of determining the qualification of its members; and,
         Whereas. This Senate without questioning or criticising the prerogative of the House
         views with alarm the precedent aforesaid, by the unseating of Meagher, of Vigo county;
         and,
         Whereas, The persistent endeavor to alter representative complexion in either House by
         the extravagant and a extraordinary exercise of prerogative is always be regarded as an
         element of great public danger; and,
         Whereas, The Senate, on account of the great need of legislation to promote the interest
         of the benevolent and other institutions of the State, is adverse to entering into a
         strained and technical examination of the membership of either House; therefore, be it 
        Resolved, That a Conference Committee be appointed to consist of five
         members from the House and an equal number from the Senate whose duty it shall be to confer
         together, and if possible agree upon and report back to each branch of this General
         Assembly some method of procedure by which to assure careful and proper consideration for
         the matters recited in the foregoing preamble and such determination as the demands thereof
         may seem to require. 
       
      
     
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The question is on the adoption of the resolution. 
     
     Mr. WINTER: I rise to a point of order. The Constitution says: Each House shall be the judge
      of the qualification of its own members.
     Mr. BAILEY: This resolution is for the purpose merely of getting a conference committee and
      does not violate the Constitution. It is simply to bring members of the House together with
      members of the Senate to confer as to the best manner of settling this disturbance. I think it
      proper. I am for it.
     Mr. DRESSER: Believing as I do that the interests of the people demand something shall be
      done by this Legislature; and that we shall not spend our time in unseating and seating
      members; and believing justice and right should maintain, I shall vote heartily to support any
      such resolution.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The chair holds that the resolution as introduced is not in
      contravention of the Constitution.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: I am against the resolution. It is assuming that members of these bodies may
      do something in violation of their oaths. 
     Mr. MCDONALD: This resolution can certainly do no harm. We have this
      afternoon, restoted the voice of the people, for the voice of the people gave a certain
      majority to this Legislature. I most heartily endorse and shall vote for the resolution.
     Mr. JOHNSON: I desire to say that the only voice of the people of Indiana I have heard is
      that expression in the ballot-box where they gave four thousand mojority to Lieutenant
      Governor Robinson. I never heard that vote--
     The PRESIDENT pro tem. [interruptiong]: You heard from it in the Circuit Court to-day,
      didn't you?
     Mr. FOWLER: I believe every Senator understands the resolution. I don't like to move
      the previous question, but if this debate is continued I will do it. 
     
     
     The resolution was adopted by yeas 30, nays 16.
     Pending the roll-call---
     Mr. DAVIS said: I don't understand that the institutions of our country are in danger
      of overthrow, and that everything is going to anarchy and ruin. I have been told in a book we
      all have respect for that in a multitude of counsel there is safety; and believing that
      counsel upon a matter which concerns the interest of the State, conduces to harmony, and that
      no harm at least can come from an interchange of views, I vote " aye ".
     Mr. DRESSER: As I do not know how Senator Weir would vote on this question, and as I am
      paired with him, I ask to be excused from voting. My sentiments are in favor of the resolution
      because I believe no harm can come from it.
     Mr. JOHNSON: There never has been one moment from the commencement of this unfortunant
      controversy that I would not be glad to wipe it out. I am willing to vote "aye" to
      the end that an amicable adjustment shall be brought about.
     Mr. KENNEDY: I understand my case comes up next before the Committee on
       Elections. This resolution might save me my seat, but I would not give fifteen
      cents for it. I know I have the right to this seat, and I believe if this Senate turns me out
      and turns in a man that has no right here, that man's vote will not be counted in
      Washington and mine will. I am in favor of getting at legislation and stopping all these
      things if possible, but not to save my seat, for it will go to a higher court if I lose it. I
      vote "aye."
     Mr. SMITH, of Wells: I am heartily in favor of brethren dwelling together in unity, and wish
      this had been done in the beginning of the sessions. I vote "aye."
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Jasper: I think the resolution is in the nature of a reprimand of the House
      of Representatives. [Reads the resolution.] I vote "no"
     Mr. DAVIS: I want to change my vote. I didn't understand that there is in the
      resolution an unjust reflection upon a co-ordinate branch of the General Assembly. I vote
      "no." 
     Mr. JOHNSON: I didn't understand the reading of that resolution  when I cast my vote. I will not cast reflection on the House of
      Representatives. I regard Meagher justly unseated. I vote, " no."
      Mr. KENNEDY: I change my vote to "no." 
     Mr. DRESSER: In making the remarks I did, I supposed both Houses were included in the
      reflection, but it seems to cast reflection upon the House only. If it could be so amended as
      to leave out the reflection upon the House I could vote for it. I am in favor of compromise. I
      vote "no." 
     Mr. MCDONALD : I think we could afford to strike that portion out; and
      that it would harmonize matters. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: Has the Senator voted? 
     Mr. MCDONALD: Yes, sir.
      The PRESIDENT pro tem.: I think the Senator is out of order.
      The vote was then announced above. 
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Jasper I have a list of witnesses I desire to have subpoenaed in my case. 
     Mr. BAILEY : I cannot state when the Senator's case will be taken up; probably
      immediately after Senator Kennedy's, which we hope to proceed with this evening. I
      apprehend there is no law on the time when notice snail be given. I stated to Senator Thompson
      that the affidavit filed against him was in our possession, I think Friday of last week, and
      Mr. Thompson came to the committee while in session Saturday, and we told him we would
      consider his case. 
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Jasper: You said you were going to get the want to make a new charge.
      Mr. BAILEY : When Senator Thompson, called Saturday I showed him an affidavit alledging
      certain illegal acts. The signature of the elector bringing the contest had been erased, with
      an explanation of the circumstances under which the erasure was made. I don't see how I
      could have said a new case would be filed. To-day an affidavit was made stating the
      circumstances under which that affidavit was made, and stating he was still of the opinion
      that the charge was true. 
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Jasper: Will you issue subpoenas for my witnesses? 
     Mr. BAILEY: I will issue subpoenas for any number of witnesses. 
     Mr. JOHNSON: What is the haste? It is now six o'clock. 
     Mr. BAILEY : I think proper haste should be observed, because if any man is occupying a seat
      here without color of title, he ought to be expelled. 
     Mr. JOHNSON: Is the report of your committee ousting Mr. Kennedy already prepared? It is a
      mere farce---
      Mr. BAILEY [interrupting]: Mr President----
     Mr. SELLERS: I raise a point o order against both of these gentlemen. The question pending
      is on the adoption of the resolution. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The adoption of the resolution has already been declared by the
      chair. If there are bad precedents in this matter the Senator from Jasper will have to go to
      the other end of the capitol to find out why we are acting as we are. 
     Mr. FOWLER: I voted for this resolution cheerfully, hoping some good will grow out of it. I
      thought the purport of it was good, but I think there is one clause that ought to come out,
      and that is this: [Reads the 2nd whereas. ] This clause reflects, upon the action of the
      House. Whether the action was justified or not I will not discuss. It is a matter with that
      branch. I believe some good would come from this resolution if that clause were out. It can do
      no good to be left in. I move to reconsider the vote by which the resolution was adopted. 
     The motion was agreed to. 
     
     
     On his further motion, the 2nd preamble was stricken out and the resolution as amended
      adopted by yeas 29, nays 15. 
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. BAILEY said: I was heartily in favor of the resolution before. I think it is somewhat
      weakened by striking out the 2nd clause, but I am for it still. It is better than nothing. I
      vote "aye" 
     Mr. CAMPBELL, when his name was called, said : Believing that the  subject contemplated is not one suited for a joint conference; and
      believing each branch is its own judge of the qualifications of its members; and believing the
      act of the majority of this Senate in unseating Mr. McDonald was for political purposes, I
      vote "no." 
     Mr. DRAKE: As I am opposed to compromising a wrong or compounding a felony, I vote "
      no."
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: I desire the Senator to explain what he means by compounding a
      felony? 
     Mr. DRAKE: I explained my vote.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: You must explain your language. 
     Mr. DRAKE You have no right to demand that.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The Secretary will write his exact language down.
     Mr. SELLERS: Will you dictate the words? 
     Mr. CAMPBELL: I think he said was opposed to compounding a felony. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: That may be all and may not be all of it. 
     Mr. RAHM: I take it for granted that his remarks is an insult to every man on this floor--at
      least every one belonging to the Democratic party. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem. The chair has decided that the language will be taken down and acted
      upon by this Senate hereafter. 
     Mr. DRAKE : I would like to hear the language read, which I am charged as using. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: It will be taken down. 
     The SECRETARY I have the words Senator Drake: "As I am not in favor of compromising a
      wrong or compounding a felony, I vote "no." " 
     The result of the vote was then announced as above recorded. 
     Mr. DAVIS : I understood that the communication from the House would be laid before the
      Senate sometime today. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: If you desire it the chair will submit the question. 
     Mr. SELLERS: It does seem to me if there is any matter coming from the House to the Senate
      it might be considered as well to-morrow; and as there are many Senators older than I nearly
      worn out, and as I am tired myself, I move the Senate adjourn. 
     The motion was agreed to. 
    

   
   
   
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. 
    
     MONDAY, January 17,1887.
    
     The session was opened with prayer by Rev. Henry Day, of the Baptist Church. 
    
     PENSION FOR JOHN A. LOGAN'S WIDOW. 
     On motion by Mr. GARDINER. the House took up the join resolution [S. 1] reciting by way of
      preamble that General John A. Logan was one of the most distinguished volunteer soldiers in
      the late war for the preservation of the Union, and had rendered signal service to the
      Republic both in war and peace, and therefore resolving that Senators in Congress from Indiana
      be instructed and her Representatives requested to support the bill now pending for the
      pensioning of his widow. 
     Mr. JEWETT favored this resolution and thought his side, of the how does, because it may be
      said of General Logan, what unhappily cannot be said of many public men, that he lived and
      died a faithful and honest public servant. He was a man distinguished in war, and a man whose
      political views were always pronounced, fixed and earnest. He was a man of sense and courage.
      When he was defeated, for Vice-President in 1884 his conduct was as noble and self-possessed
      as any example that has ever been given to the American people. He did not complain or seek to
      throw blame upon any other man. He was a bitter partisan, but he arose above party when his
      conscience told him that the demands were too severe: 
     Mr. REYNOLDS understood that the bill before the Congress of the United States is to give
      the widow of John A. Logan two thousand five hundred dollars a year, and insisted that the pay
      he received for his services was sufficient to make his family comfortable for the balance of
      their lives,  and saw no reason why they should come
      before the people at this time to make a distinction their favor. If Congress is able to pay
      Mrs. Logan two thousand five hundred dollars a year it is able to pay the widow of every
      soldier a like pension. The House should be careful how it voted for these things. 
     Mr. ROBERTS made an ineffectual demand for the previous question. 
     Mr. LINOK marched over as hard and stood as hard service as any soldier on this floor or in
      this State, and believed that he spoke the sentiments of nine-tenths of the people of this
      Republic when he said that this resolution should pass. The pension of Mrs. Logan should not
      be two thousand five hundred dollars, but equal to that of the widow of any soldier in the
      Republic. 
     Mr. KELLISON said that these resolutions were all for buncombe and that no attention on
      would be paid to them. He agreed with Mr. Reynolds in the views expressed by him., He thought
      this resolution unnecessary, too, because there was nothing to show that Mrs. Logan was in
      need. 
     Mr. VAN SLYKE said that he was not a soldier, but he could not see how the passing of the
      resolution would injure those who received smaller pensions. 
     Mr. ROBINSON opposed the resolution for the same reasons as those stated by the gentleman
      from Wayne (Mr. Reynolds.) He thought that after men left the army they should receive
      pensions based entirely on their disability, and regardless of their rank; that, if any
      difference it should be in favor of the inferior man, who with the same disability, had less
      ability to provide for his wants. 
     Mr. PIERCE took a like line of argument. 
     Mr. FOSTER thought that in the great struggle, as in all such struggles, skill, cunning and
      power are worth something, and that pensions should be provided according to the services
      rendered. 
     Mr. GARDINER was not a soldier, but wished he had been, as he would rather leave as an
      inheritance to his children an honorable discharge than anything it is in his power to give.
      General Logan was the greatest volunteer soldier in the war. He was a great statesman. He was
      surprised that there should be one voice here in opposition to this resolution. 
     Mr. GROSE said perhaps he knew as much of General Logan as anybody on this floor, and would
      be glad to see Congress give to Mrs. Logan an amount equal to that given Mrs. Hancock. 
     Mr. BUSKIRK fought and bled in the army, and knew General Logan. He intended to vote for the
      resolution.
     Mr. NIBLACK thought, as the precedent has been established, it is too late to draw the line
      on Mrs. Logan. He was surprised that any gentleman wand to draw the line on this lady. 
     Mr. KELLY, of Boone, was willing for General Logan's widow to have a just pension. He
      has always been and always will be in favor of pensions for soldiers.
      On motion by Mr. GORDON, the resolution was amended by changing it from a joint to a
      concurrent resolution.
     
     
      It was adopted by yeas 87, nays 10.

      Mr. Cox, of Miami, [H. R. 141]: Relating to terms of court in the Twenty-seventh and
      Fiftieth circuits. Also, [H. R. 142]: To regulate the employment of women and children in
      factories, etc. 
     Mr. Conder [H. R. 143]: Legalizing the organization,
      etc., of the town of Orleans. which, by suspension of the rules, was passed. 
     Pending the introduction of bills
    
    
      THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNORSHIP. 
     
     
     Mr. JEWETT asked but failed to obtain consent to introduce a concurrent resolution
      "That it is the sense of this General Assembly that the proceedings brought by Honorable
      A. G. Smith against Honorable R. S. Robertson, to test the question of the right of said
      Robertson to the office of Lieutenant Governor of Indiana, in which the Marion Circuit Court
      has this day rendered a decision restraining said Robertson from acting as Lieutenant
      Governor, should be at once forwarded to final decision by the Supreme Court, and that such
      decision should, if possible, be obtained before noon of Wednesday, January 19, 1887." He
      then made an ineffectual motion--yeas 42, pays 53--that the order of business be suspended to
      consider the resolution. 
     Mr. REYNOLDS voted "aye" for the reason, as he stated, that he thought the matter
      should be passed upon by the Supreme Court as speedily as possible.
    
    
      AMERICAN LABOR.
      Mr. MACKEY offered the following resolution, which was referred to the Committee
       on Federal Relations:
     
      
       
         Resolved, That our Senators and members in Congress be and are hereby instructed to use
         their influence and vote for an act providing that none but American labor (citizens of the
         United States) shall be employed in the construction of the new vessels now being built, or
         that shall hereafter be built, for the use of the United States Government. 
       
      
     
    
    
     UNITED STATES SENATORS--ELECTION.

      Mr. BLINKS offered the following, which was referred to the Committee on Federal
       Relations:
     
      
       
         Resolved by the House of Representatives, of the state of Indiana, the Senate
         concurring, That our Senators in Congress be instructed and our Representatives be
         requested to take such steps as may be necessary to provide for the amendment 6U the
         Constitution of the United States; in order that the Senators in the Congress of  the United States may be chosen directly by the people
         of the several States in place of said Senators being chosen by the Legislatures of said
         States.

    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
     VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
     INDIANA LEGISLATIVE.
    
    IN SENATE.
    
      TUESDAY, January 18, 1887. 
    
    Prayer by Rev. Mr. Whitworth, of the Seventh Presbyterian Church.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore announced the committee authorized by the conference resolution
     (Mr. Howard's, of Decatur,) adopted yesterday afternoon, viz.: Messrs. Howard of Decatur,
     French, Cox, Dresser and Macy.
    
      ELECTION OF UNITED STATES SENATOR.
      Mr. FOWLER offered the following:
     
     
     
      
       
        Resolved, That at the hour of two o'clock p. m. to-day this body will, in pursuance
         of an act of the Congress of the United States, entitled "An act to regulate the time
         and manner of holding elections for Senators in Congress," approved July 25,1866,
         proceed to vote for Senator in the Congress of the United States for the term of ix years
         from the 4th day of March, 1887, to succeed the Hon. Benjamin Harrison, the present
         incumbent.
       
      
     
     It was adopted. 
     Mr. DAVIS: I desire to again remind the Chair of a communication from the House of
      Representatives that was in the hands of the Chair yesterday morning. 
     The PRESIDENT pro. tem.: The chair will present it now, a message from the House:
     The Reading Clerk read it. [See e 101 of this book. ]
      Mr. TRIPPETT: I move that the Me be referred to a select committee of three to be appointed
      by the the President. 
     Mr. HUSTON: I can see no good reason for that being referred. 
     Mr. TRIPPETT : We have invited the House to meet with us in this chamber. 
     Mr. HUSTON : I move to amend by requiring the committee to report by twelve o'clock
      to-day. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore put the question and there was an affirmative response.
      The yeas and nays were demanded. 
     Mr. TRIPPETT : I rise to a point of order. You can't amend a motion after it has been
      put to the House and voted upon--at least by the ayes. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: I think the point of order well taken. 
     Mr. CAMPBELL: I understand a motion was made by the Senator from Dubois (Mr. Trippett) to
      refer. Now the motion is to refer with instructions; it seems to me that is not out of order.
      A. motion to refer is subject to a motion to amend with instructions. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: That is true if the amendment had been offered before a vote is
      taken. 
     Mr. HUSTON: I addressed the Chair just as soon as the question was stated to the Senate. I
      could not have been any quicker.
     
     The PRESIEENT pro tempore: I take it the Senator from Fayette (Mr. Huston) is acting in good
      faith. The chair will entertain the amendment. The question is on the amendment that the
      committee report at twelve o'clock. 
     A message from the House of Representatives announcing the passage. of, bills [H. R. 132 and
      143] was read by its Principal Clerk. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: Will the Clerk of the House give attention? The chair desires to
      state that he regards the rule of parliamentary law gives the floor to the Clerk of the House
      when he has a message to deliver from that body and that courtesy should be extended to him;
      and the chair did not refuse that courtesy only after the Speaker of the House of
      Representatives refused the same courtesy to the Secretary of the Senate. After this, now, the
      Clerk of the House will present himself in the rear of the Senate chamber at any time he has a
      message from the House and announce it. 
     The CLERK OF THE HOUSE: The joint rules adopted yesterday requires that--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore : I don't know about that. I was only intending to give a
      return for what I regard as a rebuke to the Secretary of the Senate. The roll will be
      called.
     
     
      The amendment was rejected by yeas 18, nays 27.
    
    
      THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNORSHIP.
      Mr. WINTER: I move to adopt the following:
     
     
     
      
       
         Whereas, The Senate on the 6th day of January, 1887, declared that the Hon. Alonzo G.
         Smith, Senator from the counties of Jennings, Clark and Scott, was "recognized and
         elected as President of the Senate of Indiana," to succeed to the vacancy in such
         office caused by the acceptance by Lieutenant Governor Manson of the office of Collector of
         Internal Revenue under the Government of the United States; and, whereas, The Senate has
         further declared that the election by the people on the 2nd. day of November, 1886, of
         Robert S. Robertson, to fill the vacancy in the office of Lieutenant Governor, created by
         such acceptance of a Federal office by said Manson, was invalid, and therefore that said
         Robertson would not be recognized as Lieutenant Governor nor permitted to exercise the
         constitutional functions of such office of presiding over the Senate as its President;
         and,
         Whereas, Said Alonzo G. Smith has ever since continued to act and is now acting
         President of the Senate, which is a function attached by the Constitution to the
         Constitution to the office of Lieutenant Governor; and, 
        Whereas, The Constitution expressly provides that no person charged with official duties
         under one department of the Government shall exercise any of the functions of another,
         except as therein especially provided, and especially provides that the President of the
         Senate shall only vote in committee of the whole or in case of a tie; therefore, 
        Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that said Hon. Alonzo G. Smith, while acting
         as President of the Senate, is not M entitled to vote as a Senator, but only in committee
         of the whole and in cases of a tie; and, therefore, that the Secretary be directed to omit
         his name in calling the roll of Senators, and only to call it in case of a tie of the
         Senate. 
       
      
     
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The resolution is referred to the Committee on
       Elections without debate. 
     Mr. FOWLER: Ought not the Judiciary Committee to have it? 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The resolution goes to the Committee on Elections
      without debate. 
     Mr. WINTER: I rise to a point of order. The question would be on my motion to adopt the
      resolution. That has precedence of any other action; and that can only be superseded by some
      member moving to amend my motion. It is not competent for the President to dispose of a motion
      made by a Senator by referring it to a committee; I therefore protest against the action of
      the Chair in superseding my motion, as out of order. The question is on my motion to adopt the
      resolution. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The chair will state what the Senator from Marion (Mr. Winter),
      knows as well as any other Senator, and perhaps as any other lawyer, that the Court has
      already passed upon this question; not upon a part of it, but upon the whole question;--the
      Circuit Court of Marion county, has decided that the election of Lieutenant Governor in 1886
      was unconstitutional and void; that the present occupant of the chair is both de novo and de
      jure President of the Senate; that his position President of the Senate is held by  virtue of his election to that office as a Senator, being called to
      preside by the Senate over this body; which in no event, under no circumstances, under no
      constitutional provision, disqualifies the Senator from Jennings from voting as a Senator ; he
      is simply called as the presiding officer in the absence of the Lieutenant Governor; and
      therefore he has the right to exercise the powers and duties of Lieutenant Governor. If the
      point of order is raised that the resolution is out of order the chair will sustain it.
      Mr. TRIPPETT: I raise the point of order that as this resolution comes, it is not a proper
      thing for this Senate vote upon. 
     Mr. WINTER: I would like to be heard for a moment. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The Senator can speak to the point of order. 
     Mr. WINTER: This resolution is not addressed to the Chair,; it is addressed to the Senate;
      and I submit any Senator has the right to have the Senate pass upon the question, and have a
      record made upon that subject; and it is not in order to dispose of a question of that kind
      summarily. The Chair, and I have no doubt a majority of the Senate, differ with us, but that
      difference must be expressed in a manner according to parliamentary law, if brought before
      them in a parliamentary manner. Is it out of order to ask the Senate to decide question simply
      because a certain member says there is no question about it? Of course if it is to be
      understood whenever a proposition is presented that is distasteful to the majority that it is
      to be ruled out of order, there is no more proper time to know that than right now. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The Senator doesn't mean to say that every thing is ruled out
      of order coming rom him or his friends? 
     Mr. WINTER : The point of order has been sustained in many instances in which I think it was
      not well sustained. I don't assume to be the best parliamentarian on the floor, but I
      think the majority having the power to dispose of a question by vote as it chooses, in many
      cases the Chair has ruled out questions on points of order that should be disposed of by the
      Senate. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The chair alone has the right to decide points of order, and in the
      cases you refer to the chair has decided them as he understood his duty to be. The chair has
      given to the Senator from Marion and every other Republican Senator all the liberties and
      opportunities offered under parliamentary law; except you think you should have the right to
      override us with political questions which you force upon us yourselves. 
     Mr. WINTER: With the eighteen left us how can we override thirty-two on political questions?
      When we present resolutions in good faith we think we ought to have our resolutions received
      and the questions put to the Senate and the sense of the Senate had on them. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: If a bad precedent was necessary to sustain the chair in anything he
      has done, he would not have to go further than the House of Representatives to get it. 
     Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair. 
     Mr. TRIPPETT: I wish to withdraw the point of order and move that the resolution be referred
      to the Committee on the Judiciary, and upon that I demand the previous
      question. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The Senator from Hendricks (Mr. Campbell) has the floor. The call
      for the previous question will be withheld. 
     Mr. CAMPBELL : The right of the President of the Senate to vote is a serious question. I
      have no knowledge of any person sitting in judgment upon his own rights. I supposed the
      President of the Senate would call some other person to the chair, who would put the questions
      to the Senate, especially if he did not want to pass judgment on his own right to vote. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The President of the Senate did not seek to sit in judgment upon the
      resolu-  tion, and for that reason referred it to the
       Committee on Elections without debate. The question is not an open
      question--it is already settled by the Court, and the roll has been called the last time upon
      it unless you get the Supreme Court to rule upon it. If the Senator from Hendricks is right,
      every time this body is without a Lieutenant Governor and a Senator is called to preside, he
      is deprived of his vote. The object of the resolution is to make a pretended case to present
      to the United States Senate and that is all there is about it. 
     Mr. WINTER : This question has been presented to us. We are acting in good faith. On the
      first day of the session when the Senate was organized, the record says the Senate was
      organized by "Senator A. G, Smith, President pro tempore of the Senate," but ever
      since, in the journal of every day's proceedings, the occupant of the chair has been
      described as "President of the Senate," and bills are signed by him as President of
      the Senate. The Constitution makes a clear and well marked distinction between the office of
      President pro tempore and the office of President of the Senate. The President pro tempore we
      concede has a. perfect right to vote----
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: Are the words "pro tempore" used in the Constitution ?
      Mr. WINTER: I think they are. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tern.: You can't show it; it is not in the Constitution.
      Mr. WINTER: Section 137 Revised Statutes of the Constitution is as follows: [Reads]. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: It is in the head line. 
     Mr. WINTER: I submit to any person the words "for the occasion" is a translation
      of the latin words "pro tempore." 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: It is a very poor translation. 
     Mr., WINTER : I will not engage with the President in a controversy about that. This is a
      copy of a corresponding section in the Constitution of the United States where the words
      "pro tempore" is used. We understand the occupant of the chair claims that he has
      succeeded to the office of Lieutenant Governor. This is a grave question, and one on which we
      are entitled to have the judgment of the Senate. And it is for that purpose, and not for the
      purpose of raising any frivolous question, that we have introduced this resolution. It seems
      to me a resolution of this kind, involving the right of the occupant of the chair to vote,
      should not be referred by his action to a committee. When we come in good faith and ask it, it
      seems to me we ought to be ac corded the judgment of the Senate, on the question. 
     
     
     The demand for the previous question was seconded and the main question ordered by yeas 26,
      nays 14, and the motion to refer the resolution to the Judiciary Committee
      was agreed to by the same vote.
      Mr. JOHNSON, under Rule 13 of the Senate, regarded the statements made by the Chair, that
      the whole purpose of this resolution was to make a case in the United States Senate, as a
      statement impugning the motives of Senators. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The chair will answer the Senator from Wayne (Mr. Johnson.) The
      Senator is respectful in the presentation of the matter and the chair desires to treat him
      with like respect. I believe he is desirous of being fair. The chair intended no reflection
      upon the Senator from Marion (Mr. Winter,) or any of his colleagues, when he said the object
      of this resolution was to make a case for the United States Senate. The chair said a
      "pretended" case, and the chair thinks he has a right to state what he understands
      to be the object of the resolution. The Senator from Wayne has the assurance of the chair that
      nothing was intended to reflect upon him officially, or upon any of his colleagues.
    
    
     EXTRA PAGES. 
     Mr. COX, from a special committee, recommended the appointment of two additional pages.
    
    
    
     THE SENATOR FROM ALLEN & WHITLEY.
     
     
     
      
       
        Mr. CAMPBELL: I offer the following resolution and move its adoption: 
        . Whereas, It is provided by the Constitution and laws of the State of Indiana that the
         Senate of the State shall consist of fifty members, one-half of whom are to be elected at
         the regular, biennial election; and, 
         Whereas, Eli W. Brown was duly elected as one of the twenty-five Senators in November,
         1884, for, a term of four years to represent the district composed of the counties of Allen
         and Whitley, and accepted said office and served during the regular and special sessions of
         the General Assembly of 1885; and,
         Whereas, Said Eli W. Brown still resides in said senatorial district, and has never
         resigned his office, nor has he been commissioned to hold any other office; and,
         Whereas, Because of the fact that said Brown has been nominated by the President as
         postmaster to fill an office which he could accept only upon confirmation of the nomination
         by the United States Senate, which nomination has not been confirmed. A part of the voters
         of said Senatorial district elected Hon. I. B. McDonald as Senator from said district, who
         now occupies the seat of said Eli W. Brown; and,
         Whereas, By said pretended election of said McDonald twenty-six Senators were elected at
         the November election in 1886, which is in violation of the letter and spirit of the
         Constitution; therefore, 
        Be it Resolved, That Eli W. Brown is the duly elected and qualified Senator from the
         district composed of the counties of Allen and Whitley, and that the name of said I. B.
         McDonald shall be stricken from the roll of members of this Senate. 
       
      
     
     Mr. FOWLER: I think that is a matter proper for reference, and I move it be referred to the
       Judiciary Committee.
      Mr. CAMPBELL: The Senate might just as well pass its judgment on this question now as
      hereafter. If you can elect a State Senator to represent the Lieutenant Governor---
      Mr. FRENCH [interrupting]: I rise to a point of order. A motion to refer is not debatable. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: That is the law. The chair has always been inclined to indulge the
      Senator from Hendricks (Mr. Campbell,) but if the point of order is insisted upon will be
      sustained. 
     
     
     The motion to refer was agreed to by yeas 23, nays 15.
      Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. JOHNSON: I am, sorry to say I am opposed to the reference of this resolution to the
      Judiciary Committee, the members of which are recognised as good lawyers. I think the
      Lieutenant Governor has a good title to his office. I vote "no."
     Mr. MCDONALD, when his name was called, said: I hope the Senate will
      excuse me from voting.
     Mr. TRIPPETT: WE have a committee of the Senate composed of good lawyers. This is a question
      I never hear raised but I think I would like to have it investigated by good lawyers,
      therefore I vote "aye."
     Mr. WINTER: This is a question as to whether a Senator's right to his seat is valid.
      The Senate felt itself competent to decide that the election of Lieutenant Governor was
      invalid. I think this is an analogous case, and I think the Senate just as competent to decide
      one as the other, therefore I vote "no."
     The vote was announced as above recorded, so the resolution was referred to the
       Judiciary Committee.
    
    
     EXTRA PAGES.
     Mr. COX called up his report from a special committee submitted a few minutes ago in favor
      "of employing two extra pages for the Senate" and moved that it be adopted.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The reference of this matter was made upon a statement of the chair
      that the committee must agree upon who is to be appointed. The chair does not desire to be
      embarrassed in this matter. If you will state in the resolution what pages you want appointed
      the chair will appoint them. Or, name the two boys and take the sense of the Senate upon
      it.
     Mr. DRAKE moved that John Hoffman and Richard Brown be appointed pages.
     The motion was agreed to.
     
     
     Mr. JOHNSON [at ll.22 o'clock] made an ineffectual motion to adjourn--yeas 12, nays
      23.
     Mr. WINTER, explaining: I don't know what we are waiting for except for the
       Committee on Elections to make a report.

    
    
     THE SENATOR FROM ALLEN & WHITNEY.
     Mr. MCDONALD: I rise to a question of privilege. I shall decline to  vote further in this Senate until the Judiciary
       Committeereport on the resolution introduced by the Senator from Hendricks (Mr.
      Campbell.) I am conscientiously opposed to voting where there is any cloud of title. I want to
      feel in the position I did twenty-five years ago when a brass band took my regiment down to
      the Union Depot. I want 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [interrupting]: The Senator's title does not seem to be very
      much impaired.
      Mr. MCDONALD : I want that committee to report at once. I am a little
      peculiar about this matter. 
     Mr. Fowler introduced a bill [S. 123]: To amend Section 3261 of the R. S. of 1881.
     
     
      Mr. JOHNSON [at 11.45 o'clock] made n ineffectual motion to adjourn--yeas 17, nays
      20.
      Mr. HUSTON, explaining his, affirmative vote, said: Seeing no other reason for continuing
      the session except to give time to the Committee on Electons to report on other cases; and
      believing the purpose of continuing this session is in order that insufficient time be given
      to the minority to define their position, I vote "aye." 
    
    
     THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNORSHIP.
      A message was received from tie House of Representatives announcing the passage of a
      resolution by the House declaring that Robert S. Robertson is elected Lieutenant Governor, and
      that the House will recognize him as such at all times and in all matters. [See page 124.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
      The Senate was not called to order till 2.45 o'clock. 
    
    
     THE SENATOR FROM ALLEN & WHITLEY.
      Mr. SELLERS, from a majority of the Committee on the Judiciary,
      submitted a report recommending the indefinite postpostponement of the resolution offered this
      forenoon questioning the right of Senator McDonald, of Allen and Whitley, to a seat on this
      floor. 
     On his further motion, the report of the committee was adopted. 
    
    
     BILLS FOR ACTS WERE INTRODUCED
      Mr. Sellers [S. 124]: To amend Section 293 of the R. S. of 1881, concerning proceedings in
      civil cases;

      Indiana.
      Mr. Day [S. 126]: To amend Section 1 of the Metropolitan Police Commissioners' bill.
     
    
    
     A RECESS.
      Mr. FOWLER : I think all our trouble will be amicably arranged in a manner satisfactory to
      both branches. I move the Senate take a recess till 3.30 o'clock, 
     The motion was agreed to. 
     At 3.35 o'clock--- 
    
    
     A PEACE CONFERENCE. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem. said
     The purpose of the intermission was that a conference might be had between Senators and
      members of the House of Representatives, or such as we selected for that purpose. That
      conference has been held, and the chair is requested to state that the controvesies growing
      out of the seating and unseating members in the Senate and House will remain in status quo
      until to-morrow morning; and that arrangements are being perfected looking to a settlement of
      all such differences. The probability is that there will be a settlement so nothing further
      will be done at present looking in the direction named. The Senate now is ready for such
      business as may come before ' it. 
     Mr. CAMPBELL demanded a call of the Senate, which being ordered and taken discovered fifty
      Senators present and answering to their names.
      The PRESIDENT pro tem.: Then special order of the day is now in order. 
    
    
      VOTE FOR UNITED STATES SENATOR.
      Mr. RAHM: I move that nominations for United States Senator be now made. 
     The motion was agreed to; whereupon---
      Mr. SELLERS said [reading from. mss.]: Mr. President--I desire to nominate as the candidate
      of the majority of this Senate for the office of United States Senator for the State of
      Indiana a man of the people. The  son of a carpenter, he
      early in life formed habits of industry and study (that were the foundation on which he built
      the monument of a successful life. He, in his early years, so applied himself that when he
      entered upon the duties of his chosen profession was able then to outstrip his competitors in
      the race for recognition as an able lawyer and eminent jurist, and, unlike many of the same
      profession, he did not consider his legal and literary education finished when admitted to the
      bar, but has kept up through his whole career those habits of industrious research for
      knowledge that characterized his early life, until now he stands in the foremost rank of those
      who lead in the law and among those who are the most learned of this, the advanced age of
      literature and science. Thirty-five years since he was elected by the people a member of the
      General Assembly of this State, and he has ever since taken an active part in the affairs of
      State, going wherever, duty called him, always an earnest advocate of justice and right, ever
      a champion of the people's liberties, opposing at all times any encroachments upon those
      sacred privileges of citizenship guaranteed by the Constitution to every man, woman and child
      owing and acknowledging allegiance to this the Government of a great and free people. Not only
      has he been a steadfast friend of the people, but also a tried friend and servant of his
      chosen party, being of, those who believe that "he serves his party best who serves the
      people best," and to him, and such men as he, do we owe the established fact that the
      Democratic party is and has always been the safeguard of the people's liberties. Having
      spent more than half a life-time in the faithful service of his party, he never kept account
      with her, never demanded that recognition that was his just due, always giving his time, his
      ability and his almost invaluable services and counsels from a sense of his duty as a citizen,
      and without hope of compensation, other than the hope that when his life-work was finished the
      people he served so well would grant him the eulogy of well done, thou good and faithful
      public servant. Even this nomination, the highest honor that can be given by the people of a
      State to one of its citizens, came to him unsought, as a simple recognition of his ability and
      his unswerving and unassailable integrity, and I desire to say that it is highly complimentary
      to the Democratic party of Indiana that each, man voted for at the Democratic caucus held for
      the purpose of selecting a candidate for Senatorial honors was a man of great ability,
      unswerving integrity, and an able advocate of the rights and privileges of his
      fellow-citizens, proved and established by every page in the history of his public career, and
      it is remarkably complimentary to the man I nominate that among those whose names were before
      than caucus there is not a heartburning nor a single feeling of bitterness engendered by his
      success. Sprung from the laboring class, the bone and sinew of our people, he has always,
      maintained the cause of the laborer, the wage-worker. Every resolution advocating the
      interests of labor adopted by Democratic State conventions in Indiana for many years has been
      the product of his brain and pen, and his voice has always been heard in defence of its cause.
      Believing, from his past life, that we can make no mistake in intrusting to his care the
      public interests and the rights and privileges of the citizens of this great State, I have the
      honor to nominate for Senator in Congress from the State of Indiana Hon. David Turpie. 
     Mr. MCDONALD: Coming from the part of the State further north in which
      Judge Turpie resided for many years, it gives me more than ordinary pleasure to second the
      nomination of our candidate for the United States Senate. It gives me pleasure for several
      reasons, and the first is: The character and force of David Turpie is a verification of the
      fact that from the plow, the bench and the anvil men, imbued with real patriotism, can rise to
      the highest places in the gift of a free people. No young man  in this country who started out with a purpose, for advancement,
      has made better progess than David Turpie, once the poor carpenter-boy. Therefore upon this
      floor, I say to you, Mr. President and fellow Senators, it gives me pleasure to vote for this
      Wan, who is pre-eminently a self-made man, an honest man, a true man, and a true man to his
      fellows. That he is a Democrat is true ; that he always stood by the principles of his party,
      is true; hewing to the line and being true to all the interests of the common people in the
      great commonwealth of the State of Indiana. I therefore, as I said before, most cheerfully
      second the nomination of David Turpie. 
     Mr. HUSTON : Knowing, as we in the minority do, that the vote this afternoon will result in
      ba little--simply an expression on the part of the Senate--I shall indulge in no extended
      remarks in presenting the name of our candidate. I rise,Mr. President, for the purpose of
      making a nomination in behalf of the Republicans of this Senate of a man as our candidate for
      the United States Senate for the term commencing from the fourth of next March and for the
      ensuing six years. The man who I shall name is well known to all of you; a man who has lived
      in this State during his entire life; a man who all the people know; a man who, though called
      to many high and responsible positions, has never proved untrue to the trust reposed in him; a
      man of merit; a man of wealth; a man of attainments; a man against whose name and integrity
      nothing truthful can be said; a man who is recognized by the Republicans of Indiana as the
      leader, and the one in, whom the party can place confidence as a man who has ever been ready
      to fight. its battles, and who has never disappointed the expectation of his friends. I might,
      as has been done in the nomination of Hon. David Turpie, refer to his early life. He, too,
      started in the battle of life as a poor, man, and relying upon his own resources carved out
      his own fortune. I might, too, refer to his professional career. His standing in his
      profession as a lawyer is envied by every lawyer in the State; his reputation is not confined
      to the limits of the State of Indiana; he has a reputation that is as great as the Nation
      itself. He has a record not only as a civilian, but he, has a record, as a soldier. It is said
      to his glory that during the dark hours of the war it never was said that Benjamin Harrison
      was in sympathy with those opposed to his Government. [Applause.] When the hour came that it
      was necessary for men to place their lives, upon the altar of their Country, Benjamin
      Harrison, leaving his little home sped to the front and bared his breast to the southern
      bullet, and was ready to do his utmost to maintain the Union of the States. [Renewed
      applause.]-- Senator Harrison as a member of the United States Senate has been ever willing
      and ready to take up the cause of the oppressed, and look after the interests of the people of
      his State; he has ever been at his post; and feel warranted in saying to his utmost ability
      has ever done his whole duty. In presenting the name of Senator Harrison I not only present it
      in behalf of the Republican members of this Senate, but I present his name in behalf of two
      hundred and fifty thousand Republicans of Indiana. [Cheers.] During the recent campaign it is
      well known that he was the central figure; it was his leadership that brought us to the
      victory obtained in November last. Not only that, but in mentioning the name of Senator
      Harrison for this high position, I mention it fully satisfied that it meets with the hearty
      and cordial endorsement of the soldiers of Indiana; they know who their friend is he has ever
      been their champion; has ever proved himself to be their friend, and his election would meet
      with their hearty and cordial support. Therefore, Mr. President, I place in nomination, as the
      Republican candidate for United States Senator, the Hon. Benjamin Harrison.
      Mr. DeMOTTE I rise for the purpose of seconding the nomination of General Harrison as. a
      candidate to represent this great State in the Sen-  ate
      of the United States for six years from the fourth of March next. I do it in behalf of the
      Republicans of this great State. He has become the leader of the Republican party of Indiana,
      and as was appropriately said, it was to him, more than almost any-other cause, we owe the
      reduction of a Democratic majority in the last General Assembly from forty-five on joint
      ballot to nothing. He stands not only in the front in Indiana, but also in the United States
      Senate. A man during one term in the United States Senate seldom takes an advanced position
      such as our Senator has. Senator Harrison stands shoulder to shoulder with the oldest and best
      of the statesmen in the United States Senate, and whenever his name is mentioned it is spoken
      with honor by men of all parties and in all parts of the United States. We can point with
      pride to his career, and we can also say he has served his Country in her time of peril. I
      second the nomination of Benjamin Harrison. 
     Mr. KENNEDY I am personally well acquainted with Benjamin Harrison and take pleasure in
      seconding is nomination. I have been with him day after day since his boyhood and I never
      heard a word fall from that man's lips that might not be uttered anywhere. There is not a
      stain on his private character or his public character as a statesman, as a citizen er as a
      soldier; and in behalf, of the farmers of my district and of the State Of Indiana, who love
      the grand-son of the old hero of the campaign of 1840, knowing him to be a representative of
      the laboring men as well as the soldiers, I therefore second the nomination of Gen. Benjaman
      Harrison for the United States Senate. 
     Mr. ZIMMERMAN said [reading from Mss.]: Mr. President--Were I to remain silent on this
      important occasion and not mingle my humble voice with others on this floor in the approval of
      our distinguished Senatorial nominee, my constituency would over after, and justly, too,
      charge me with unpardonable negligence in the discharge of a sacred duty. The counties of
      Marshall, and Fulton, which I have the honor to represent here, constituted once a part of the
      old Ninth Congressional District, where the name and fame of the Hon. David Turpie will live
      perpetual in every household. More than twenty years ago, at the October election in the year
      of 1868, I was permitted for the first time to, participate in the exercise of the prerogative
      of American citizenship. I had then the pleasure of casting my first vote for Mr. Turpie for
      Congress. Two years thereafter, in the year 1868, I did, with increased pleasure, deposit my
      ballot with the name of Turpie for Congress thereon. This was during the exciting days of the
      reconstruction period, when popular sentiment was blind to reason, and when to be a Democrat
      and on the forum in northern Indiana, required nerve and unflinching devotion to principle.
      Subjugated and disfranchised, and governed by negro Legislatures, led by usurping pretenders
      from the North and supported by Federal bayonets, the southern people lay prostrate and
      helpless at our feet, appealing to the conservative element of the North for mercy. Turpie,
      young, brave and honest, was the man of the hour. It was then, when in his memorable joint
      debate with the late Schuyler Colfax, he attracted the breathless attention of the entire
      country when he raised his noble voice, earnest and fearless in behalf of an abused and
      down-trodden people, pleading not for mercy, but as only a statesman would--pleading for
      justice and the restoration of the inherent constitutional rights of a people. Alexander the
      Great, when asked to whom he wished to leave his vast empire, answered "To the most
      worthy." The Democracy of Indiana, in choosing Mr. Turpie as, its candidate for United
      States Senator, has, in my opinion, conferred the high honor upon "the most worthy."
      Yes, the most worthy as jurist and statesman, and the most worthy as patriot and citizen. And
      when the glad tidings of Mr. Turpie's nomination by his party's caucus swept with
      lightning speed over the silent prairies and forests of northern Indiana there  was unbounded and universal rejoicing among the Democracy of that
      section of the State. And when he shall be triumphantly elected, as certainly he will be, the
      trumpets will be sounded, drums be beaten, and cannon will boom and hallelujahs be sung, and
      the roaring waves of Lake Michigan, dashing with mighty force against the shores of the proud
      old Hoosier State, will swell the great chorus in honor of the glorious event. I hearty second
      the nomination.
      There being no other nominations, the roll of the Senate was called and the ballot resulted
      as follows: 
     David Turpie received 32 votes.
      Benjamin Harrison received 18 votes. 
     
     
     
      
       
        Those voting for the Hon. David Turpie were--
         Andrew, Bailey, Barrett, Berry, Bramaman, Bryant, Cox, Day, Duncan (of Brown), Fowler,
         French, Griffith, Hale, Howard (of Decatur), Howard (of St. Joseph), Logsdon, McClure,
         McDonald (of Whitley), Mullinix, Peterson, Rahm, Schloss, Sellers, Shively, Smith (of
         Wells,), Thompson (of Marion,) Tharp, Tripper, Urmston, Weir, Zimmerman, Mr. President.
        Those voting for the Hon. Benjamin Harrison were--
        Campbell, Davis, DeMotte, Drake, Dresser, Duncan (of Tipton,), Ensley, Harness, Huston,

    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. 
    
     TUESDAY, January 18, 1887. 
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Rev., A. H. McDowell. 

    
     THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNORSHIP.
      Mr. GARDINER, by consent, offered the following :
     
     
     
      
       
         Resolved, That it is the opinion of this Home that, prior to the general election held
         in this State in November last, there was a vacancy in the office of Lieutenant Governor of
         thin State that could be filled by election; and, 
        Resolved, That there having been several candidates for said office at said election, and
         Robert S. Robertson having received a plurality of all the votes cast in this State for the
         various Candidates for said office at said election, and the Speaker of this House having
         opened and published said votes ac. cording to law, and having declared s& Robert S.
         Robertson duly elected to; said office; and he, having taken the oath of said office as
         required by law; and he, thereby and by virtue of all said proceedings, having become
         invested with said office, thin House will, at all tunes, and in all matter y wherein the
         General Assembly may, be brought into relations with said office of Lieutenant Governor,.
         recognizing him, axed only him, as the incumbent of said office. 
       
      
     
     Mr. GARDINER said : The law officer of the State of Indiana, the Attorney General, having,
      in response to the request of the Governor of this, State, given it as his opinion that there
      was a vacancy in the office that might be filled by election, and the representatives of the
      various political parties of this State having passed upon the question by the nomination of
      candidates for the office of Lieutenant Governor ; and more, that a half million, people at
      the polls having passed upon the question and declared it as their opinion, by their acts,
      that there was a vacancy, and that Robert S. Robertson should be and was selected to fill the
      vacancy; and the clerks in all the counties of Indiana, recognizing the opinion of the law
      officer, have certified that vote to the Speaker of this House,, who, in pursuance of his
      duty, and in strict accordance with law, except as disturbed by the minority of this House,
      which belongs to a political the has as one plank in its platform the unwritten proposition
      rule or ruin, opened and published that vote; and the Speaker having declared Mr. Robertson
      duly elected to the office and he having, in conformity with law, taken the oath as such
      officer, it would be stultifying ourselves and trampling under our feet the will of the people
      to refuse to recognize him. And, believing that the matters set forth in this resolution have
      been fully discussed by this House, I now demand the previous question. 
     
     
     The demand for the previous question was seconded by the House, and under its operations the
      resolution w p adopted by yeas 55, nays 44. 
     Pending the roll call--
     Mr. COX, of Miami, when his name was called, said : I believe in bowing to, the will of the
      people. But I un- understand the question is, was there a
      vacancy in the office of Lieutenant Governor? Whether there was or was not, is a matter to be
      determined by the courts. It is now in the courts. It is being argued at this hour before the
      Supreme Court of the State of Indiana. Believing that the Supreme Court of the State, the
      highest judicial tribunal, should be allowed to determine this matter, and that no
      revolutionary measure should be introduced here and adopted, I vote against this
      resolution.
     Mr. FOSTER, when his name was called, said: I acknowledge with the gentleman from Daviess
      (Mr. Gardiner) that the people of this State voted on this question, but a majority of the
      votes, unless cast in a constitutional manner, cannot make an election. For this reason I vote
      "nay.".
     Mr. HARRELL, in explanation,said: I believe the opinion of the gentleman from Daviess (Mr.
      Gardiner,) as a lawyer, is, that there was no vacancy. That resolution recites that the vote
      which was counted here in this House was in accordance with law. I aw it was not; it was not
      counted in the presence of the Senate, and the record in that account is not correct; and
      because this question is now being discussed before the Supreme Court of the State, I vote
      "nay."
     Mr. IBACH, when his name was called, said: If this resolution would include all the persons
      that have been voted for, and thus give fair expression to the will of the people, I would
      vote for the resolution, but being satisfied that it is not intended to cover certain facts I
      am obliged to vote "nay."
     Mr. NIBLACK, when his name was called,said: As this question has already been determined;
      and inasmuch as I do believe there was no vacancy to be filled by election of Lieutenant
      Governor, I cannot do otherwise then vote "nay."
     Mr. PARKER, in explanation, said I do not believe that that vote for Lieutenant Governor was
      canvassed in the presence of both Houses of the General Assembly. I vote "nay." 
     Mr. PATTON: I denounce this as unreasonable and indecent. I chracterize this as one of the
      greatest attempts to bulldoze, and I want to place this thing on record as being one of the
      most indecent, outrageous and damnable acts that has ever been perpetrated in the General
      Assembly of the State of Indiana. 
     The vote was announced as above.
    
    
     BILLS FOR ACTS WERE INTRODUCED B'Y
      Mr. Montgomery, of Owen, [H. R. 144]: In relation to turnpike roads--to amend section 5094
      R. S. 
     Mr. Hobson [H. R. 145]: In relation to constructing and changing highways.
      Mr. Gordon [H. R. 146]: To provide for the repair of free turnpike roads. 
     Mr. Catey [H. R. 147]: Providing for the assessment of a poll tax on every male citizen over
      twenty-one years of age, except certain specified classes. 
     Mr McCallum [H. R. 148]: Requiring peddlers of merchandise to obtain license. 
     Mr. Sunman [H. R. 149]: An act to legalize certain acts of the County Commissioners of
      Ripley county. 
     Mr. Green [H. R. 150]: Requiring those who practice medicine and surgery to obtain
      certificates. 
    
    
     A NEW STANDING COMMITTEE.
      On motion by Mr. GREEN, the Speaker was authorized to appoint a standing Committee
       on State Medicine, to consist of five members. 
    
    
     CONTESTED SEATS:-CONFERENCE.
      The SPEAKER announced a concurrent resolution from the Senate providing for the appointment
      of a committee of five from the Senate with a like number from the House, to meet in
      conference to adopt some definite plan of procedure in regard to the contested seats of
      members in each branch of the General Assembly. [See page 108 of this book.] 
     Mr. JEWETT moved its adoption. He said : The consideration of the contests and unseating
      members were operating to the public disadvantage by taking up time which should be  employed in the consideration of much-needed legislation.
      An opportunity of a fair and honorable settle went was offered, and to overlook it would be a
      disgraceful robbery of the public.
      On motion by Mr. GOUGH, the resolution was laid on the table.
    

    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
      VOTE FOR UNITED STATES SENATOR.
      The SPEAKER called the House to order shortly after two o'clock, and announced
      nominations for United States Senator as in order.
     Mr. GARDINER : Mr. Speaker-- I rise to present the name of a candidate for the high office
      of Senator in the Congress of the United States for the State of Indiana. I have in my mind a
      man born upon a farm just across the Indiana line in the State of Ohio, near the mouth of the
      Miami river, where he passed the years of his boyhood and his youth, performing these duties
      incident to a farmer's life, and where, at the fireside of a farmer's home, he drank
      deep the inspiration of patriotism. His ambition led him into other pursuits in life, and he
      chose for his chief vocation that of a lawyer. And in the ranks of that profession he rapidly
      grew, and within a very short time he stood at the head of the great column of bright and
      profound lawyers in the State of Indiana. At a very early age in his life the people of this
      State elected him to the office of Reporter of the Supreme Court of the State, and while
      fulfilling the duties of that office, when the war broke out, when the roll of the cannon was
      heard from the Charleston harbor, reverberating this aide of the Alleghenies, imbued, as I
      say, with the patriotism that he had drunk at his father's knee, laying down the duties
      of his office, putting aside the comforts of life and its peaceful pursuits, laying aside for
      the time the ambition to rise in civic honor, he took his life in his hand and went to battle
      for the old flag. Fighting through the war, he came back and resumed his position modestly in
      private life. For the last six years he has represented, in part, the great State of Indiana
      in the Senate of the Congress of the United States. And there, sir, he has made his mark.
      There has been no proposition looking to the amelioration of the people's necessities,
      looking to the alleviation of the down-todden, looking to the enactment of such laws as should
      rest with equal weight upon the shoulders of all the people of this great Nation, that he has
      not favored. He has left his mark on every page of the Nation' legislative history from
      the time he entered her halls until this hour. Without stopping to speak in commendation of
      this man who signally enjoys the affection of the people of this State, I have the pleasure to
      name as candidate in my mind the Hon. Benjamin Harrison. 
     Mr. GROSE: It has been my good pleasure to have the acquaintance of this gentleman for over
      a third of a century. I have had every opportunity of knowing and learning the true merits of
      my friend. In the vicissitude of politics, in civil life and society I have met him
      frequently. Unpretentious in his manner and style, I have never observed any error in his
      moral life, and I have never heard from any reputable source of a blot of stain on his
      reputation. When the great trouble of this Nation came he was in circumstances of pleasure and
      comfort, with a nice family, making his way nicely in the world, but when the bugle sounded
      that the Nation was in peril, as has been said, he started for the front. He stood well up
      during the time of his service. He has stood by the widow and orphan, pressing their claims
      strongly and fearlessly. This is Benjamin Harrison, of Indiana. 
     Mr. KELLISON: Mr. Speaker--It is with pleasure that I rise to discharge the duty of my
      political associates on this floor have so generously imposed on me, that of nominating a
      candidate to the Senate of the United States. The office of United States Senator, Mr.
      Speaker, is a dignity and trust of such transcendent importance that some of the greatest and
      best man of the nation have not  bought it improper for
      them to indulge in a laudable ambition and desire to obtain that honorable distinction. To be
      elevated to an elective peerage, Mr. Speaker, in a body that for wisdom, learning and
      statesmanship has no equal on the face of the globe, by honest methods, is a prouder
      distinction and honor than to inherit the royal diadem of an Emperor or a ding. Especially is
      this true, Mr. Speaker, when the nomination of a great party to that high office comes
      unsolicited and unsought. Such is the proud position of the gentleman whose name I am about to
      present for the suffrages of this House. He is a gentleman, Mr. Speaker, who needs no
      introduction to the people of the State of Indiana. For more than a third of a century he has
      borne unswerving allegiance to the principles of free government and the principles of the
      National Democratic party. He is a man whose voice hays ever been heard battling for the
      liberties of the people and the principles of human equality before the law. He is a man,
      who,if elected, will bring to the discharge of the duties of that high office a wealth of
      knowledge and a profoundity of thought that have never been excelled by any man who has
      occupied that seat. Without further remark, Mr. Speaker, I nominate as a candidate for United
      States Senator a man with clean hands and a pure heart--a man who was once known as the old
      Democratic war-horse of Northern Indiana, but who is now the accepted leader of his party in
      this State, Hon. David Turpie.
     Mr. JEWETT : Mr. Speaker--The office of senator from Indiana has in recent years been marked
      as one of exalted qualifications with regard to the talents of the recipients of that honor.
      With the growth of wealth a semi-aristocracy has sprung up in the N1 ;United States, and the
      Senate has been encroached, on by men whose chief recommendation has been that of wealth and
      social power. But Indiana has steadily maintained a high standard. The names of Hendricks,
      Morton, Pratt, McDonald, Voorhees and Harrison are honorable names. They have been fragrant
      with good deeds and patriotic endeavor. Indiana now demands as Senator a man of sterling
      character and ability, who will be a fit associate for those names of high distinction which
      have hitherto held her aloft. Such a man is David Turpie, and I have great pleasure in
      seconding his nomination. 
     Mr. ROBINSON: In behalf of what is probably a minority in this Assembly, but in response to
      a demand from the people now becoming unmistakably audible, I am impelled to present to this
      House the name of a third candidate, who does not come here, probably, with the glory of such
      high rank as some others, but who has a record as an old soldier not excelled by any other one
      who did not wait when the tocsin of war sounded for a commission, but at once went to the
      front. It is true he did not enjoy the ease of high rank. It is true he was promoted to the
      rank of Captain fcc distinguished gallantry, but his services were in the ranks of the common
      soldiers. I represent a constituency who are eagerly watching our actions to-day; a
      constituency who toil in mines, in factories, and at the plow--and all the varied industries
      of life. It is a constituency of honorable toilers, banded together for the protection of
      their rights. As such a representative I stand for principles which have not been added to by
      the gentlemen whose names have been presented. We have a vote. Unorganized labor is rapidly
      organizing and demanding recognition. In the language of an old veteran, we propose to fight
      it out on this line if it takes a life-time. We, as Greenbackers and Knights of Labor, in the
      interest of the class, and a large class, we represent, have decided to present one who was
      not raised in the lap of luxury, but came from the people. He has tasted of the bitter cup
      himself and drank it. The gentleman whom I have the pleasure to present is Jason H. Allen, of
      Terre Haute. 
     Mr. GLOVER seconded the nomination of Jason H. Allen, in a very few words.  There being no other nominations the roll of the House was, called
      and a ballot resulted as follows:

    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
     IN SENATE.
    
      WEDNESDAY January 19,1887. 
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Rev. Reuben Jeffrey, of the Baptist Church.
    
     THE SECRETARY'S JOURNAL.
      The PRESIDENT prop tempore directed the reading of that part of the Secretary's
      journal of yesterday's proceedings relating to the vote of United States Senator.
     Mr. FOWLER: It seems to me the way the journal is disposed of is a very careless way of
      doing business. It is a matter of the greatest importance that it should be correct. If the
      journal is disposed of without reading, as its the custom here, there ought to be a committee
      to examine it. I don't want to cast reflection on any one, but I do know that mistakes
      have been made in the journal.
     Mr. HALE: I have, as the chairman of the Committee on Revision of the
       Journal. The Senate journal's here in my desk, and I intend to examine
      them.
     Mr. FOWLER: Then my speech may be expunged from the record.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: For the purpose of this occasion the chair will appoint Senators
      Hale, Fowler and Davis to examine that part of the record relating to the vote for United
      States Senator yesterday, and the chair will request them to do that at once, and see that
      every name is recorded.
     Mr. DAVIS : It is entirely competent and proper, for the reading of the journal to be
      dispensed with, but the statutes requires a committee, whose duty it is to examine the
      journal, shall make a report and shall sign it, and that report shall be put on record. [Reads
      a part of section 4931, R. S.] I was on the Committee for the Supervision and
       Inspection of the Journal two years ago, and to my personal knowledge that
      committee never was called together. It is not within the range of probabilities, however
      careful the journal clerk may be, but that mistakes may creep in, and I think more care and
      attention ought to be given than we are in the habit of giving to the journal. The chairman of
      the committee should make a report once a day that the committee has examined the journal and
      that it is correct, or, if incorrect, suggest a correction of whatever errors there are. 
      Mr. HALE : As chairman of the Committee on Revision of the Journal I
      have not learned who the balance of that committee are as yet, therefore I have not called the
      committee together, and in making my  reports. I have
      followed steps that have heretofore governed in this Senate. I believe, according to the
      Senate journal of last session, the committee reported about twice a week. I have carefully
      examined the journals, and have now in my possession the journal of Tuesday. Hereafter I
      desire to make a report each day.
    
    
     JOINT CONVENTION POLICE.
      Mr. FRENCH : I offer the following resolution and move its adoption:
     
     
     
      
       
         Resolved by the Senate, That in the Joint Convention of the two Houses for the purpose
         of electing a United States Senator, the officers of the Senate shall have joint control
         with the officers of the House of the chamber in which said Joint Convention may be held.
        
       
      
     
     Mr. WINTER asked that the vote be withheld till he could speak with the Chair.
     On motion by Mr. JOHNSON, at 10.30 o'clock, the Senate agreed to a recess for twenty
      minutes, but it was half past eleven before the President pro tempore commanded order. 
     Mr. HALE addressed the Chair. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: There his a matter pending of more importance than perhaps what you
      will introduce. If the Senator will wait a while he will be heard. The resolution (Mr.
      French's) was adopted. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore directed a call of the Senate, which being taken, discovered fifty
      Senators present and answering to their names.
      The PRESIDENT pro tem.: Senators will remain in the chamber. Perhaps it will be proper for
      some Senator to move an acceptance of the invitation of the House to meet the Senate in joint
      convention. 
     Mr. SELLERS I suggest that it not be done until Senator Winter returns.
      The PRESIDENT pro tem.: Very well.
      Mr. TRIPPETT, from the special committee to which was referred the invitation of the, House
      to convene with the Senate in joint, convention to vote for United States Senator, re- ,ported
      that said invitation ought to, be accepted.,
     Mr. SELLERS: I move that its consideration be delayed till Senator Winter's return.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: It will be held in abeyance.
     Subsequently the report was concurred in.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore designated Messrs. Fowler and Campbell as a committee to notify
      the House that the Senate is ready to proceed to the hall of the House for the purpose of
      balloting for United States Senator; and promptly at 12 o'clock, meridian, ordered
      members of the Senate with its principal officers to repair to the hall of the House. 
     Senators returned to their chamber at eighteen minutes after 2 o'clock.
     On motion by Mr. SELLERS, the Senate adjourned till 10 o'clock to-morrow.
    
   
   
   
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
    The SPEAKER called the House to order at five minutes before 12 o'clock.
    Senator Campbell, of the Senate Committee to notify the House that the Senate had accepted
     its invitation to meet in joint convention at noon to-day to ballot for United States Senator,
     [see page 101 of this book] made that announcement to the House.
    Mr. JEWETT moved that the Chair notify the Senate that the House is ready to receive the
     Senate in joint convention.
    The SPEAKER: The Senate will be notified.
    The session was opened with prayer by Rev. W. W. Raymond.
    Promptly at twelve o'clock, at the close of the prayer, Senators took the chairs
     provided for them on the right of the Speaker's dias and the President pro tempore of the
     Senate taking a place on the Speaker's right hand.
    The SPEAKER: Further business in the House of Representatives will now be suspended until the
     holding of a joint convention of the Senate and House in relation to the election of a United
     States Senator.
    
     JOINT CONVENTION.
     THE PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: The joint convention for the purpose of election a United States Senator in Congress will
      come to order. Senators will take their seats. Will the Doorkeeper see that Senators have
      places upon this floor if not already provided for?

     Representative JEWETT: Fifty chairs have been provided.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: Senators are not in their places but in the lobby.
      Senators will take their seats. Persons in their lobby will keep order. The Doorkeeper will
      see that loud talking at that door is stopped. Visitors in the lobby will keep back from the
      seats of members. The Doorkeeper will enforce this rule. Make a pass-way between the seats of
      members and the lobby. Some Senators have not seats.
     Senator DRESSER: There are some occupying seats who do not belong there.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: They will vacate their seats and give them to
      Senators.
     Senator WEIR: I see no one in these chairs except Senators.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: The Doorkeeper will move this crowd back from
      Senators' seats. Persons in the aisle will move out of the way of Senators here. Mr.
      Pritchett, will you see that order is enforced?
     The SENATE DOORKEEPERS (Mr. Pritchett): Yes, sir.
     THE PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: The Speaker of the House requests me to ask the
      Doorkeeper of the House whether he has provided fifty chairs for Senators? It is evident he
      has not and he will do it at once.

     Senator WEIR: Here are some seats intended for Senators. If vacated there will be
      enough.

     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: Captain Pritchett, move this crowd out of here;
      move them all out. I don't want to ask the Doorkeeper to enforce this order but once now.
      I want this crowd moved out of here. For the purpose of determining whether there is a quorum
      present the Secretary of the Senate will call the roll of Senators.
     The call discovered every Senator present and answering to his name.
     The SPEAKER of the House : The Clerk of the House will call the roll of members of the House
      of Representatives.
      The call discovered every member present and answering to his name. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: The Secretary of the Senate will read what was
      proposed by the committee of the Republican caucus to the Democratic members.
      The Secretary reads as follows
     
     
     
      
       
         Proposed by the committee of the Republican caucas to the Democratic members of the
         Fifty-fifth General Assembly, that by way of an orderly and amicable settlement of the
         difficulties relating to the joint convention, the President of the Senate, the Hon. A. G.
         Smith, shall call the joint convention to order, and then declare that the Speaker of the
         House shall conduct the subsequent proceedings, no legal right of the said Smith to be
         thereby waived or affected; that thereupon the Speaker of the House shall preside over the
         deliberations of the joint convention; that the roll of each House is to stand and be
         called as it existed on Tuesday, January 18, 1887, and each member thereon shall be called
         and shall actually vote and have his vote recorded; that any member of the convention is to
         have the right to object to the name of any person upon the roll of either. House being
         called, or against his being permitted to cast a vote, or against and further proceedings
         therein, and to protest against any vote being received and counted, or against any other
         act, and to have his protest and objection therefor entered upon the journals of both
         houses, the Senate to attend the joint convention, attended by its principal Doorkeeper and
         its Secretary and Assistant Secretary only, without show of menace or force, and that the
         result of the balloting by said joint convention shall be announced by the said Smith, and
         the Speaker shall thereupon adjourn the joint convention. Colonel Robertson, in deference
         to the injunction of Judge Ayers, is to take no part in the holding of said joint
         convention, or in anywise to attempt to participate therein. The President of the Senate

      entering in-to this agreement, that he waives no 
      privilege and no, legal right; he simply agrees to it in the interest of law and order.

      met in joint convention for the purpose of proceeding in the selection of a United States
      Senator. What is the pleasure of the Convention in that regard? 
     Senator RAHM: I move that nominations for United States Senator be now in order.

     NOMINATION OF DAVID TURPIE.
      Representative NIBLACK [reading from mss. ] Mr. President--To me has been assigned the
      pleasant duty of placing in nomination before this General Assembly a distinguished citizen of
      the State of Indiana to be voted for as a candidate for the United States Senate. The
      gentleman in whose behalf I speak needs no eulogy from me. As to the principal incidents of
      his career, others can and, I trust will, speak more in detail than I am able to do. I only
      know him as the scholar, the orator, the jurist and the statesman, second in ability and
      acquirements to none of the other distinguished men of our State, and a gentleman in all
      respects; well qualified to perform the duties which devolve upon a Senator of the United
      States, with which duties he has already had a brief but considerable experience. He is, too,
      sir, a man of pronounced views upon all the current events of the day, and one who has the
      courage of his convictions when, the occasion demands that he shall speak. I, in common with
      others who have known him longer, have every reason to believe that, as a representative, in
      the Senate of the United States, he would, in all that goes to make up the true Senator, prove
      to be the peer of any other member of that august body. The gentleman to whom I refer is Hon.
      David Turpie, of the county of Marion, and , I now have the honor of formally placing him in
      nomination as a candidate for the United States Senate before this joint convention. 
     Representative PARKER [reading from Mss. ]: Mr. Speaker--With a full realization of the fact
      that the Senate of the United States is the greatest legislative body on earth, knowing as I
      do that he who seeks a position in that body asks for the highest legislative honor that can
      be conferred by any power upon any man, and believing, Mr. Speaker, that he by whom that honor
      is sought should be the possessor of those qualities of head and heart that would reflect
      luster upon their possessor, and be commensurate with the duties of that exalted station: and
      believing, further, Mr. Speaker, that David Turpie is pre-eminently endowed with those
      qualities, to which I have alluded, it is with great pleasure that, on behalf of my political
      associates upon  the floor of this House, I second his
      nomination to the office of Senator in the Congress of the United States ; and I desire to say
      now and here, Mr. Baker, that this privilege accorded me by my political associates affords me
      an opportunity of performing a labor of love, and of discharging a duty that is a source of
      great gratification to me. Thirty-four years ago, representing in the General Assembly of this
      state the county that I now have the honor of representing upon the floor of this House, my
      father was a member and co-laborer with the eminent gentleman whose name has dust been
      mentioned in connection with the distinction that awaits him, and from the earliest period of
      my recollection down to the moment when he was "summoned to join the innnumerable caravan
      that moves tc that mysterious realm where each shall take his chamber in the silent halls of
      death" that father never failed to inculcate, into my mind respect, a love and a
      veneration for the genius, the scholarly attainments and the statesmanship of David Turpie,
      and I have never departed from the letter or the spirit of those instructions. That General
      Assembly to which I have just referred, contain such men as Turpie, Niblack and others, whose
      names have since become household words throughout the length and breadth of this
      commonwealth, witnessed, as I understand it, the beginning of the public career of Mr. Turpie.
      Since that time positions of honor and distinction ,have been showered thick and fast upon
      him. Never sought by him, every position, every distinction that has been conferred upon him
      by his fellow-citizens, has been accepted with that modesty and discharged with that fidelity
      that are characteristic of the man. Rapidly has he risen in the esteem and confidence of party
      associates, and in the councils of the great Democratic party, to whose principles he has ever
      yielded an unfaltering allegiance. It has been said of him by one who is revered by all lovers
      of that which is good and pure in the politico of our country, and at the mention of whose
      name the blood of every Democrat leaps with an added impetus through its channels, the late
      Vice President Thomas A. Hendricks, "that Judge Turpie was the best equipped roan
      intellectually in the whole circle of his acquaintance." It has been further said of him
      that one who after the fourth of next March will be his colleague in the Senate of the Unite
      States, Hon. Daniel W. Voorhees, when asked by the Chief Executive of this Nation who Mr.
      Turpie was, replied: "He is a citizen of my State: to whom I feel like apologizing every
      time r'meet him." When asked by Mr. Cleveland why, Mr. Voorhees exclaimed:
      "Because I am in the Senate of the United States and he is not." With an intellect
      as clear as a sunbeam, as strong as a thunderbolt and as penetrating. as a lightning flash;

     NOMINATION OF BENJAMIN HARRISON. 
     Senator HUSTON [reading from Mss.] : Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Joint Convention-We
      are assembled at this hour in fulfillment off a duty that is fraught with great
      responsibility. As representatives of the people, we are entrusted with no more important
      'duty and privilege than that of electing our representative in, the Senate of the United
      States. Indiana has taken and occu-1, pies an exalted position in the sister hood of States.
      It is proper and quite essential that so great interests should be intrusted to only such are
      fitted to properly guard and pro  tect them. The position
      should command the best talent the State affords--a man of experience, of broad, comprehensive
      mind, and fully in accord with the spirit of our free institutions, who is qualified to rank
      among the leaders and who will reflect honor upon the State. I am authorized on the part of
      the Republicans to present, as candidate for the United States Senator, the name of one who is
      in every sense fitted for the position, an able lawyer, of large legislative experience, a
      Christian gentleman who has always been found ready to respond to the call of duty; one
      thoroughly known by the people and in sympathy with the masses. A man who is eminently
      qualified to comprehend the great and momentous questions embraced in the official duty of a
      United States Senators.A man who is proud of the great State of Indiana, and who will do his
      utmost to advance her interests, and who earnestly desires the advancement and prosperity of
      her people. A man in sympathy with the soldiers of the late war, and who will ever be read to
      advocate measures of relief for them, believing, as he does, that the National owes its
      defenders a debt of gratitude it can never repay. A man who has ever been ready to aid the
      unfortunate, and who is in sympathy with the toiling millions and recognizes that they have
      rights that demand protection. It is my pleasure, in behalf of the Republicans of this General
      Assembly, to present the name of their candidate for the high, honorable and exalted position
      of representative in the United States Senate for the term commencing on March 4, 1887, and
      for the ensuing six years thereafter. He whom I shall name is one of Indiana's most
      distinguished citizens, pre-eminent as a citizen and as a soldier, well known and needing no
      encomium at my hands. During his career as a soldier many instances might be cited as his
      valor. When the call to arms resound through this hitherto peaceful country he was among the
      first to respond. He was in the Atlanta campaign of one hundred days, in the battles of Resaca
      and Peach Tree creek, in the second battle acting as the commander of a brigade. After the
      smoke of battle had cleared away, and after victory had been achieved by our forces that grand
      old leader Joe Hookor came riding down the line, and seeing Colonel Harrison at one side, went
      up, and shaking his hand, said: "Colonel Harrison, you have done nobly, and for your
      services to-day, by God, I will make you a brigadier-general" When that grand old patriot
      needed the support of his most steadfast friend during those dark hours no one responded more
      promptly than General Harrison, and the support given made it possible that the civilized
      world should become familiar with the name of that patriot and states man, the great war
      Governor, O. P. Morton. General Harrison started in life as a poor boy, and by his inherent w
      e worth and ability has risen to a rank among the great men of this Nation, He entered his
      profession as a poor man. He had no family influence to push him forward, but with his own
      right arm has he fought his battle, till we know what he has attained, a place in this State
      and in this Nation as, one of the foremost in his Nation. His services in the United States
      Senate for the past six years has met with the hearty indorsement, of all; and for his
      services in the late campaign, as leader of the Republican hosts, when they overcame,the
      infamous gerrymander of the last Legislature, he was made the choice by over fifteen thousand
      legislative majority is the State for the place of United States Senator to succeed himself.
      No indorsement stronger than that can be brought forward for any man. And he is presented as
      the unanimous choice of both branches of the Legislature. The soldiers of Indiana know him,
      and knowing him they look upon him as their friend. They are willing to trust their interests
      in his keeping, and in behalf of the soldiery of Indiana, also, to whom, we owe a debt we, can
      never repay, we place in nomination Genera Benjamin Harrison.
     
     Representative GRIFFITHS [reading from Mss.]: Benjamin Harrison has show himself altogether
      worthy of the confidence and trust reposed in him. He has swerved neither to the right nor to
      the left in his public career, but with unfaltering step has trodden the rugged path of
      rectitude and duty. "He has hewn to the line, let the chips flay as they might." His
      official acts have been characterized by singleness of purpose, fealty to principle and
      devotion to the general good. All that he has done has been marked by simplicity, earnestness,
      thoroughness and absence of ostentation. He has shown a grasp of affairs, a comprehension of
      the public needs and a realization of how the same should be met, which entitles him to a
      place in the foremost rank of living statesman. He has employed no meretricious aids to secure
      preferment, but by sheer force of industry and ability has won distinction and renown. He has
      discharged the duties incident to the responsible position of United States Senator with such
      fidelity to the public interests, such intelligent patriotism, such profound sagacity, and
      with such a breadth of statesmanship, that his fame has spread far beyond the limits of
      Indiana, and he is as well known and as favorably regarded in the Empire State and at the
      Golden Gate as in the Hoosier capital. He represents the purest aspirations, the loftiest
      hopes, the highest ideals and the worthiest deeds of that party which came into power when
      States were seceding, and traitors were multiplying, and the flag of the Union was being
      trailed in the dust by those who should have loved its every stripe and revered each
      individual star; of that party which remained in power for twenty-five eventful years--years
      of empire-building, of the construction of railroads, the planting of cities, the development
      of manifold industries, the diffusion of the useful arts and sciences, the spread of
      education, and the growth, in short, of all that goes to make a people prosperous and happy;
      of that party which went out of power with a record for efficiency and honesty unequalled in
      the history of any political party in this country since the adoption of the Constitution. His
      public services, however, have not been confined to legislative halls. Long before he was
      called from the walks of private life, to make laws for the people, he had gained the undying
      gratitude of all lovers of liberty and country, by the valor and heroism which he displayed on
      many a bloody battle-field in the war of the Rebellion. He freely surrendered the pleasures of
      home, and the profits of business, to do his part in preserving the unity of the Nation, whose
      institutions he valued above life or property, or ease, or comfort, or anything material. His
      conduct confirmed anew the truth of the old adage, that "Tis still observed, those most
      valiant are Who are most modest ere they come to war." The man who identifies himself
      with a worthy cause, and for the sake of that cause leaves home and kindred, and patiently
      endures fatigue and all manner of hardship, and, if need be, death, deserves to have his name
      inscribed high upon the honor-roll of the centuries, and there the name of every Union soldier
      has been written "Weave for them your richest chaplets, crown them with the highest
      honors, for they were the bravest of the brave and the truest of the true." What would we
      give in exchange for Resaca, and Gettyburg, and Donelson, and Missionary Ridge? If all the
      effects of this Nation were put up at auction, what price would you place on the precious
      memories which those names awaken? To part with them would be to lose the rarest gem in our
      national diadem. They tell of valorous deeds which will survive all the vicissitudes of earth,
      or golden deeds which "Shall speed far, widening down the track of time, And stir the
      soul of ages yet to come, With echo of their glory; and will make All hearts play pilgrim with
      their gratitude."
     And could Indiana's dead heroes break the long silence of death their voices would join
      with those of the  living in praise of the
      soldier-statesman who was their friend and comrade. Benjamin Harrison has earned the
      nomination at the hands of his party by his superb leadership in the last Campaign if for no
      other reason. He changed despair into hope and snatched victory out of defeat. With all the
      odds apparently against the success of the Republican party, his confidence remained unabated
      that the people would rebuke at the polls the outrage that had been perpetrated on the right
      of suffrage by the reapportionment of the State. He believed that when it could be clearly
      shown to the masses that a great wrong had been done that partisanship would be sunk in
      patriotism, and the work of the scheming politicians go for naught. His confidence was not
      misplaced. The victory of November 2 vindicated his judgment. To his efforts, more than those
      of any single individual, was the triumph and the glory of the triumph due. Believing, then,
      that Indiana should be represented in the national Senate by a man of unimpeachable integrity;
      by a man of convictions and with the courage of them; by a man with clean hands, and a pure
      heart; by a man who, has never resorted to the arts of the demagogue to secure place or favor;
      by a man who has dignified every position which he has been called upon to fill;by a man whose
      ability is unquestioned and commanding, and whose capacity for affairs has been fully
      demonstrated, and knowing of no one within our, borders who possesses these qualifications in
      so eminent a degree as Benjamin Harrison, I most heartily indorse his nomination.
    
    
      NOMINATION OF JASON H. ALLEN.
      Representative GLOVER nominated Jason H. Allen, of Vigo county, as a labor candidate for
      the exalted position of United States Senator;--a man well known in his district; as in
      sympathy with the present dis tresses of labor, and a laborer himself. The speaker also
      referred to the war record of his candidate. 
     Representative ROBINSON : I rise to second the nomination of Mr. Jason H. Allen. While we
      have had eulogies pronounced, upon the gentlemen who have been placed in nomination I shall
      not enter in that role. But as a soldier and a citizen in public and private walk of life the
      Hon. Jason Allen has a place beside any man. His patriotism in time of war for the defense of
      his country was limited only by his ability to perform. The gentleman from Vigo (Mr. Glover)
      in the interest of the toiling millions has seen proper to present the name of Mr. Allen, who
      came from the rank of labor and is himself a son of toil. It is not the vast amount of wealth
      that makes our people, happy and prosperous, as much as the equitable distribution of that
      wealth. Is the laborer that created it in equitable possession of that wealth? I confess there
      is a cause for all this inequality. We believe there are systems in operation in this country
      that have brought about this state of affairs. This government in the last ten or twenty years
      has given to corporations more than a hundred and ninety millions of acres of our lands. No
      wonder we have millionaires. We believe the people are capable of self-governmen, and that
      commerce should, not be regulated by any other power than through the representatives of the
      people. I second the nomination of the gentleman we have presented as our candidate for United
      States Senator. 
    
    
     BALLOT FOR UNITED STATES SENATOR.
      Senator SELLERS: In order that voting may be facilitated; and to avoid mistakes, I move
      that whenever a member or Senator's name shall be called, he shall rise at his seat and
      distinctly announce the name of the person for which he votes. 
     SEVERAL MEMBERS "Consent.""Consent." 
     The SPEAKER of the House: If there are no other, nominations the Convention will proceed to
      vote for United States Senator.
      The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate : Members will maintain order, while the roll is
      being called. The Secretary of the Senate will call the roll of the Senate and as the  names of Senators and members are called they will rise in
      their places and announce the name of the candidate for which they wish to vote for.
      [Laughter.] Call the roll. 
     The SPEAKER of the House : We must have perfect order in order that there may be no mistakes
      and no delay.
      The Secretary of the Senate proceeded to call the roll of Senators. 
     When Senator Branaman's name was called--- 
     Senator JOHNSON said : I desire in respectful, and parliamentary language, and not upon
      personal ground, but to the end that all questions in this joint convention shad be saved and
      observed, I enter my objection and protest to calling the name of Mr. Branaman. I do this upon
      the ground and for the reason that he is not under the Constitution or laws of this State
      either a member of the Senate of this General Assembly or, of this joint convention. I make
      this objection and protest not only for myself, but also in behalf of my Republican colleagues
      of the, Senate, and in behalf of the members of the Republican party on the floor of this
      joint convention , and I now give notice that at the proper time I shall reduce this my
      protest and objection to writing, together with the reasons in support thereof, and
      respectfully ask behalf of myself and colleagues that this protest may be spread upon the
      journals of each House. 
     The SPEAKER of the House: The protest of the gentleman from Wayne (Mr. Johnson) will be
      reduced to writing and will be spread upon the journal of each House of this General Assembly. 
     When Senator McDonald's name was, called--
     Senator JOHNSON said I desire also respectfully to challenge the vote of this gentleman
      whose name has just been called, and to object and to protest against his name being called or
      his vote being received or recorded, for the reason and upon the ground that under the
      Constitution and laws of this State he is not a member of the Senate nor of this joint
      convention and has no right to vote. I also give notice that at the proper time I will in
      behalf of myself and my colleagues present a written protest with the reasons therefor, and
      respectfully ask that it may be spread upon the journals of each House of this General
      Assembly. 
      When the name of Senator Smith, of Jennings, was called---
     Senator JOHNSON said: I again ask the indulgences of the joint convention while I
      respectfully enter my objection and protest against calling the name of the presiding officer,
      Mr. Smith, a Senator from Jennings, for the reason and upon the ground that under the
      Constitution and laws of this State he is not entitled to cast a vote upon this occasion. I
      protest against his name being called or his vote being recorded. And in behalf of my
      colleagues I give notice that I will prepare a protest in respectful terms at the proper time,
      and do now ask leave to have it spread upon the journals of this joint convention. And I
      desire to announce that Senator McDonald, the Senator from Jackson and Lawrence, is on this
      floor and desires his name be called, and he will vote if his name is called for Benjamin
      Harrison. 
     The SPEAKER of the House: The journals of the two Houses will show that he offered to
      vote.
     When the Senate roll-call was completed---
     Representative Jewett said: I desire to respectfully protest against the vote of the Senator
      from Hancock and Rush, Mr. Kennedy, as a member of this joint convention for the reason that
      he is not entitled to a seat in this joint convention and not elected as a Senator in the
      Fifty-fifth General Assembly of Indiana. The reasons for this protest I will see are reduced
      to writing and now ask that they shall be spread on the records.
     
     
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: Call the votes for verification. [This being done
      by the Secretary of the Senate.] Hear the vote: Hon. David Turpie has received 32 votes; for
      Hon. Benjamin Harrison, 18 votes.
     
      The SPEAKER of the House: The Clerk of the House will call they roll of the House of
      Representatives, and the names of members are called they will rise in their places and
      announce the name of the person for whom they desire to vote for United states Senator. 
     The Clerk proceeded with the roll-call.
      When the name of Representative Beasley was called--
      Representative GARDINER said : desire to enter a protest against calling the gentleman
      whose name was last called and to his casting a vote, for the reason that he is not duly
      entitled to a seat in the House of Representatives; which reasons I will proceed at once to
      reduce to writing and hand to the Clerk that they may be spread upon the records of the House. 
     The SPEAKER of the House It rill: be spread on the journals. It is as follows:
     
     
     
      
       
         Mr. CHAIRMAN--I, the undersigned, Republican Representative from the county of Daviess,
         in the General Assembly of the State of Indiana, and a member of this Joint Convention, on
         behalf of myself and Republican associates in this Joint Convention, respectfully object to
         and protest against the calling of the name of John T. Beasley as a member of this Joint
         Convention and his right to vote for United states Senator, and to the receiving and
         counting of his vote for such officer, for the reason that he was not duly elected as a
         Representative from the district composed of the counties of Vermillion, Vigo and Sullivan,
         o the Fifty-fifth General Assembly of this state, he not having received a majority or
         plurality of the legal votes cast in said district for Representative, and therefore is not
         entitled to bold a seat in the House of Representatives of this State nor in this Joint
         Convention; and one Decatur Downing, having received a majority and plurality of the legal
         votes cast in said district at the last November election for said office of Representative
         in the General Assembly of this State, is entitled to the seat held by said Beasley in the
         House of Representatives and in this Joint Convention; and the salt Decatur Downing, being
         now present, offers to vote, and if allowed to vote would cast his vote in this convention
         for the Hon. Benjamin Harrison, and I respectfully ask that this objection and protest be
         spread upon the journals of the Senate and House of Representatives of this date.

     When Representative Dickerson's name was called--
     Representative JEWETT said : I protest against the vote of Henry C. Dickerson being received
      or counted as a member of this joint convention for the reason that under the Constitution and
      laws of this State he is not a member of this body; and for the reason that at the last
      general election for representatives to this General Assembly Henry C. Dickerson was not one
      of the two persons receiving the highest number of votes cast for Representative from the
      County of Vigo, but that Wesley Glover and Cornelius Meagher were the two persons and the only
      persons entitled to represent the county of Vigo in this body. I have reduced my protest to
      writing, and will send it up to the Clerk to be spread upon the journals of this Convention. 
     It is as follows: 
     
     
     
      
       
         Mr. SPEAKER--I also respectfully protest against the vote of Henry C. Dickerson being
         recognized, received or counted as a member of this convention as a Representative from the
         county of Vigo, for the reason that said Henry C. Dickerson was not at the last general
         election elected to the office of Representative from said county of Vigo, but, on the
         contrary, Wesley Glover and Cornelius Meagher were eligible to such office and received the
         highest number of votes for the office of Representative from the county of Vigo in the
         Fifty-fifth General Assembly, and are now the only persons who are entitled to vote in this
         convention as Representatives from the county of Vigo.

     When Representative Harrell's name was called--

      Samuel S. Harrell, who claims to be a member-elect of the House of Representatives of the

      who was elected according to law to represent said county of Franklin, in said House of

      Gentlemen on this side of the House desire to protest against the vote of Willis L. Barnes as
      one not entitled to a seat as a member of the House of Representatives nor to a vote in this
      joint convention. The contestor if present would vote for Benjamin Harrison. 
     The SPEAKER of the House: Time will be given. 
     Senator BAILEY : I desire to enter protests in the cases of J. M. Dresser, Benj. F. Harness,
      A. R., Schroyer, Simeon P. Thompson--I think the protest against A. M. Kennedy has been
      already entered,--and to have the journals also show that in the case of J. M. Dresser, Mr.
      Murdock is present and offers to vote; and in the case of A. R. Schroyer, Mr. Surface is
      present and offers to vote, and would vote for David Turpie; and in the case of B. F. Harness,
      Mr. Passage is present, and offers to vote for David Turpie. In the case of A. M. Kennedy, Mr.
      Puntenney is present and offers to vote and would vote for David Turpie. In the case of S. P.
      Thompson, Mr. Patton is present and offers to vote and would vote for David Turpie. I desire
      further to enter protests against the names of L. M. Campbell, W. J. Davis, Mark L. DeMotte,
      J. S. Drake, C. C. Duncain, Nicholas Ensley, J. M., Huston, Henry U. Johnson, J. W. Macy,
      Andrew Marshall, Geo. Moon, F. Winter and R. B. Sears, and at the proper time will reduce my
      protests to writing [Cheers and hisses. ] 
     The SPEAKER of the House: Time will be given to reduce the protests to writing and the
      journals of the two Houses will show the protests, and that the contestors would vote for
      David Turpie. The roll of the House of Representatives will be called for verification. 
     Representative FOSTER: I offer a protest against the vote of the gentleman from Jefferson
      county, Mr. Linck, on the ground that his election is claimed by the use of bribery and, that
      if his opponent, Mr. James Hill, were here he would vote for David Turpie. And I ask time to
      reduce to writing my protest. 
     The SPEAKER of the House : Time will be given.
     s It is as follows.


     
     

     
      
       
        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, January 19, 1887.
         Mr. SPEAKER--I, the undersigned, member of the House of Representatives, Fifty- fifth
         General Assembly of the State of Indiana, object and protest against the voting of John W.
         Linck, member of said House; from the county of Jefferson, for United States Senator, for
         the reason, as I am informed and believe, said Linck, at the election held in said
         Jefferson county,and through which he claims title to his seat, on November 2, 1886, used
         and procured to be used, in a corrupt and unlawful manner, money for the purpose of
         procuring the election of himself and others. The undersigned farther represents, that the
         opponent of said Linch for a seat in this body, viz: James Hill, who received the next
         highest number of votes at said election, if allowed to take his seat in said House, and
         vote, would vote for David Turpie, candidate for United States Senator. 
        
         Respectfully,
          F RANK F. FOSTER
        
       
      
     
     Senator DeMOTTE: I desire enter my protest against the vote casts by Senator Bailey, of
      Marion,--on  general principles, [Laughter] and time to
      put my protest in writing.
      Representative GORDON: I protest against the vote of the gentleman from Hancock, Mr.
      Ackman, and desire time to prepare my protest. And further, to show that David S. Gooding, if
      present, would vote for David Turpie. [Hisses.]
     The SPEAKER of the House. Time will be given for the gentleman from Putnam (Mr. Gordon) to
      put his protest in writing. 
     Representative JEWETT: I think those who hissed should be put off the floor. No man should
      be allowed on this floor who hisses at the action of any member. It is not proper to hiss at
      any member of the General of Assembly in the General Assembly. It is a bad return for our
      generosity in allowing these people on the floor of the House. 
     
     
     
      
       
        The SPEAKER of the House: The Clerk will call the roll of members for verification. We
         must have order in the lobby. The Doorkeeper will to it that order is observed. [After the

     Senator WINTER: I move that the Joint Convention adjourn till to-morrow at noon, in
      accordance with a provision in the law of Congress. 
     SEVERAL MEMBERS: "Yeas and naps.: "Yeas .and nays." 
     The SPEAKER of the House: In the opinion of the. chair the yeas and nays are not admissable.
      As many as favor the motion of the Senator from Marion (Mr. Winter) will say "aye."
      The "ayes" seem to have it.
      MANY MEMBERS: "Division. "Division." 
     
     The SPEAKER of the Honse: Those who favor the motion will rise. The Doorkeeper will see that
      a space between members and visitors is cleared. 
     Representative JEWETT: I ask for tellers. 
      The SPEAKER of the House: The chair finds it impossible to make this count, and knows of no
      better way to determine the question but by a call of the yeas and nays. I stated a few
      moments ago that I know of no rule authorizing it, but by common consent the yeas and nays may
      be called on this motion. 
     SEVERAL MEMBERS: "Consent." "Consent." 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: Call the roll of the Senate on the motion to
      adjourn. 
     
     
     The vote of the Senate resulted--yeas 18, nays 82. 
     The SPEAKER of the House: The Clerk of the House will call the roll of the House of
      Representatives. 
     
     
     The vote of the House resulted--yeas 56, nays 44. 
     
     
     The SPEAKER of the House : The total vote is yeas 74, nays 76; so the motion is lost.
    
    
      SECOND BALLOT.
      Senator FRENCH: I move that we proceed immediately to take another ballot for United States
      Senator. 
     The motion was agreed to. 
     The SPEAKER of the House: Before doing so I would like to suggest to the Convention in the
      matter of protests, it might possibly be agreed that on each roll-call the protests entered on
      the first ballot may appear in the journal. 
     SEVERAL MEMBERS: "Consent. " "Consent." 
     Representative KELLISON: I move that the Secretary and Clerk observe that rule.
      The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: The Secretary of the Senate will call the roll of
      the Senate.
     The SPEAKER of the House: The Doorkeeper will see that persons step back in the lobby or be
      removed from it.
      When the Senate roll-call was concluded [resulting as on page 141,]-----
     
     
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: Hear the result of the Senate vote on the second
      ballot: David Turpie 32; Benjamin Harrison 18; Jason. H. Allen 0. 
     The SPEAKER of the House: The Clerk will call the roll of the House for the second
      ballot.

    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS. 
    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
     INDIANA LEGISLATURE. 
    IN SENATE.
    
      THURSDAY, January 20,1887.
    
     The session wa opened with prayer Rev. A. W Lamport, of th Central Avenue M. E . 4) 
    The PRESIDENT pro tempoe directed the reading of that part of the journal relating to the
     joint convention of yesterday. 
    On motion by Mr. SELLERS, the journal was corrected so as to set out therein the names of the
     Representatives who voted in joint convention for United States Senator yesterday.
    
     MEXICAN VETERANS.
     Mr. SELLERS offered a resolution, which was adopted, inviting the Mexican Veteran
      Association to visit the Senate at 11 o'clock to-day, or as soon thereafter as may suit
      its convenience.
    
    
     EXTRA CLERK.
     Mr. HALE offered a resolution, which was adopted, authorizing the chairman of the
       Committee on Phraseology to appoint a clerk (Mr. Wm. S. Smith.)
    
    
     SENATE WITNESSES' FEES.
     Mr. FOWLER, from the Committee on Fees and Salaries, reported favorably
      on claims of witnesses in the contested cases of Patton vs. Thompson, of Jasper.
     Mr. HUSTON: No one is more willing to pay expenses legitimately incurred than I, but I have
      noticed for several days past bills have been presented for expenses of witnesses coming here
      to testify in contested cases brought against members of the, minority on this floor. Some of
      these. witnesses summoned by sitting members, reached here at the earliest possible moment,
      but were not allowed to testify when they came. I believe it right to allow that bill, but I
      believe the principle of allowing bills of that character is wrong. I don't believe the
      people--the tax-payers--those who must bear it, are willing to bear this burden unless it is
      inevitable. I dare to say that political expediency alone has demanded the examination of many
      of these cases by the election committee. In the future I am opposed to the allowance of bills
      of that character. 
     Mr. FOWLER: The Committee on Fees and Salaries could not know anything
      about these claims only as it received them from the Elections Committee. I
      apprehend the Senator from Fayette (Mr. Huston) only guesses at it. 
     Mr. HUSTON: The contestee in this case informed me that these witnesses were sent for by
      himself in defense of himself and his right to his seat, and it was promised him that  these witnesses ,should be heard, but when these witnesses
      reached here they were refused to be heard. 
     Mr. FOWLER: You don't claim there is anything wrong in the witnesses coming here? 
     Mr. HUSTON: I claim it is right to call witnesses here in defense of right, let him be of
      what party he may, but it seems to me where political emergency demands that there shall be
      trumped-up cases against members, I say that is wrong. 
     Mr. FOWLER: Conceding it is all wrong: that the Elections Committee
      brought these witnesses here and never examined them; and conceding it was a political
      emergency that brought them here, that does not change the principle. I believe if a witness
      is brought here in obedience to a summons coming from the proper authority, no matter what the
      exigency is that brought him here, he ought to be paid. 
     Mr. HUSTON: I said I was perfectly willing to allow this bill.
      Mr. THOMPSON, of Jasper: I stated to the committee that I should telegraph for these
      witnesses. They came in good faith, but too late to testify before the committee.
      Mr. HUSTON [in answer to a question by Mr. McDonald]: These witnesses were brought here,
      and after being brought here were not examined. 
     Mr. MCDONALD: I understood the Senator to say the committee refused to
      examine them. 
     Mr. HUSTON: I did not say that. 
     Mr. DeMOTTE: I understand that the contestor made no claim to the seat, but, on the
      contrary, came here, and said to many members that he had no intention to contest the seat,
      and intimated that under no circumstances would he occupy it. But these witnesses should be
      paid, I want it understood---
      Mr. SELLERS [interrupting]: The only question is as to whether these witnesses are entitled
      to pay; and I think all this discussion as to whether contests were, good faith or bad faith
      is out of order. 
     Mr. HOWARD, of Decatur: The statement of Senator DeMotte that the contester alluded to
      appeared before the committee and made the statement that he would not occupy the seat if
      accorded to him, is not true. He made no such statement to the committee in my hearing, and I
      was there the most of the time; and I heard no member of the committee say any such statement
      was made. 
     The report was concurred in. 
    
    
     EXTRA EMPLOYE.
      Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion, offered a resolution authorizing the Doorkeeper to appoint a
      messenger for committees. 
     Mr. WEIR: I am opposed to this resolution. There are already over fifty employes in
      connection with, the body.
      On motion by Mr. FOWLER, it was laid on the table. 
    
    
     CONTESTED ELECTION CASES.

      Mr. JOHNSON offered the following: 
     
     
     
      
       
        Whereas, The depriving of any member of this Senate of his seat herein is as act fraught
         with grave consequences, not only, to the member himself, but also to the people at large;
         and, 
        Whereas, It is highly important that each Senator upon this floor shall enjoy every
         reasonable facility for information upon such matters before being called upon to vote
         thereon; and, 
        Whereas, The practice of voting upon the right of a member to his seat immediately
         following the report of the Committee on Elections, without opportunity for reflection or
         mutual interchange of views and opinions is not always conducive to intelligent action;
         therefore, be it
        Resolved, That in all contested election cases hereafter reported to this body by the
          Committee on Elections a fair and reasonable opportunity should be
         afforded to the members of this Senate to express their views and discuss the questions
         involved in such reports before final action is had thereon. 
       
      
     
     The PRESIDENT pro tem. thought the resolution conflicted with a Senate rule. 
     Mr. JOHNSON thought not, and referred to Jefferson's Manual and the rules of the
      National House of Representatives. There is no more important subject than the determination
      of the right of a member to his seat. It is not only important to the member whose seat is
      contested,  but also a matter of the highest importance
      to the people. 
     Mr. FOWLER I rise to a point of order. This resolution is a proposed amendment to the rules
      which have been adopted; and all such resolutions are to be referred to the Committee
       on Rules without debate. 
     Mr. JOHNSON: Rule 10 provides [Reads--see page 22 of this book--] here certain extraordinary
      provisions are conferred on the Committee on Elections. This resolution
      does not undertake to change the rule on that subject; it simply proposes to get the sense of
      this body as to the propriety of enforcing that rule.
      Mr. FOWLER: Are you not seeking to add another rule? 
     Mr. JOHNSON: I am not. 
     Mr. FOWLER: Would not that be new rule? 
     Mr. JOHNSON : It would not. I am simply seeking to take the sense of this deliberative body.
      as to whether the rule, as passed, is one that should be properly enforced. I have no desire
      to act from a party standpoint, but from a desire to do right. How important it is that every
      Senator upon this floor, acting under the obligation of his oath, should have every facility
      to determine what his action ought to be upon such a grave question. No member of this body
      can understand all the facts relating to a contest when a report is brought in, for it does
      not purport to recite all the testimony. Take the case of Senator McDonald (of Jackson) where
      the minority were not permitted to make a report. Senators had no opportunity to get all the
      testimony, but were absolutely compelled, under the obligation of an oath and responsibility
      to their consciences, to vote without having all the facts before them upon which to base an
      intelligent judgment. There are inside of party organizations hot-headed men, who are willing,
      regardless of the future, to lead their party into revolutionary measures; and every Senator
      ought to have information before him on which to justify his acts and fix the course he should
      pursue. I respectfully urge that the point of order is not well taken.
      Mr. SELLERS addressed the chair. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The chair desires to pass upon the point of order. 
     Mr. SELLERS: I think I have a motion that will be acceptable. I think this is a matter which
      ought to receive serious consideration: but probably there will not arise a necessity for its
      further consideration until after the election of a United States Senator. Therefore I move to
      refer this resolution to the Committee on Rules with instructions to report immediately of
      after the election of United States Senator. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The chair was proceeding to decide the point of order, and in doing
      it the chair expresses the sincere hope and desire that this Senate will never need use the
       Election Committee's privileges during this session. I believe it
      will not, and I believe that is the sense of every Senator upon this floor; that things from
      this time on will proceed in regular order and in a decent way. As to the resolution the chair
      holds it as an attempt to amend the rules of the Senate, and for that reason it will be
      referred without further debate to the Committee on Rules.
      Mr. JOHNSON; I respectfully appeal from the decision of the Chair. [Mr. Winter joining.]
     
    
    
     MEXICAN WAR SOLDIERS' RECEPTION. 
     Mr. FOWLER : I understand Gen. Manson and other Mexican veterans are in waiting. I move for
      a recess to receive them. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: What is the pleasure of the Senate with reference to the reception
      of the soldiers of the Mexican war?
      Mr. WEIR I move that the Senate take a recess of ten minutes. 
     Mr. SELLERS: My recollection is they were invited to visit the Senate. We would have no
      Senate to receive them by reason of taking a recess.
      Mr. CAMPBELL: I move that Senators McDonald, of Whitley, and Weir, be appointed a committee
      to escort them into the chamber.
     
     Mr. MCDONALD I move that the Senator from Hendricks (Mr. Campbell) be
      also appointed. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The chair will appoint Senators Campbell, McDonald and Weir a
      committee to escort the veterans into the Senate chamber. 
     [This service being performed--the veterans filling the six aisles between Senators'
      seats, the area in front of the forum, and the inner lobbies--Senators standing.] 
     Mr. MCDONALD said: I have great pleasure in introducing to this Senate
      the old veterans of the war of 1846--the Mexican war. [Applause.] 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: On behalf of the Senate, of No General Assembly and the people of
      Indiana at large, the President of the Senate welcomes the veterans of the Mexican war to the
      floor of the Senate, and now announces that they have the freedom of the Senate chamber.
      [Applause.] 
     General MANSON : Mr. President--On behalf of the soldiers of the Mexican war I wish to
      return to you and through you to the Senate of Indiana our most sincere thanks for the
      compliment you have paid us in inviting us to visit your body. We feel under great obligations
      to the Legislature of Indiana for the vast number of resolutions they have passed asking the
      Congress of the United States to pension these men who followed the flag of their country into
      a foreign land more than forty years ago. Through the influence of Indiana, her distinguished
      Senators and her Representatives in Congress, with those from other States, I have the glad
      tidings to announce to you this day that on last Monday the National House, under a suspension
      of the rules, by nearly a unanimous vote, passed the Senate bill to pension soldiers of the
      Mexican war. [Applause.] We will not detain the Senate, knowing that in a short time you will
      be called into a joint convention. Again thanking you, gentlemen, we will now make our bow to
      you and retire. 
    
    
     CONTESTED ELECTION CATS.
      Mr. JOHNSON submitted his, appeal from the decision of the Char signed by himself and Mr.
      Winter. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: Then chair will state that a point of order has been raised that
      the. resolution of the Senator from Wayne (Mr. Johnson) is out of order for the reason that it
      is an attempt to amend the rules of the Senate. The chair held that the resolution was such an
      attempt and referred into the Committee on Rules for that reason. I will
      state an additional reason that the chair did not state before, that it seeks to cut off the
      right of the operation of the previous question, and applies to the election cases which the
      rules of thin Senate cover, 
     Mr. SELLERS: In my opinion the point of order that this resolution is not in order was not
      well taken. A resolution of this kind, seeking that an amendment be made to a rule, or looking
      to an amendment or change, is to be referred to the Committee on Rules
      without debate.
      The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The chair so decided. 
     Mr. SELLERS: I hope the Senator will withdraw his point of order. This is a matter that
      ought to be considered early. I am clearly of opinion it is seeking to have an amendment
      adopted under rule number 61 [See page 24 of these Reports.] Under rules 9 and 10 [see page
      22] any member has the right to demand the previous question and cannot be curtailed--it is a
      personal right belonging to every Senator. But the question is: should not our rules be so
      changed as to give a fair and impartial hearing to each contested election case? I am in favor
      of it, and in favor of arriving at it in the manner prescribed by the rules. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem. The chair is not deciding the resolution out of order. The chair has
      decided that it must be referred without debate. I don't accent the criticism of the
      Senator from White (Mr. Sellers) that I made a mistake. I say the point of order was not well
      taken, if it was the resolution could not be
      considered.
     Mr. SELLERS: That is the position I took.
     Mr. JOHNSON: If this resolution changed a rule of the Senate the ruling of the Chair would
      be correct; but there is a distinction between taking the sense of a legislative body as to
      whether a rule ought to be enforced, and changing the rule itself. The resolution is not
      binding on the Senate.
     Mr. SELLERS: If your position is right would not the effect of the resolution be that some
      of the rules should be enforced and some not?
     Mr. JOHNSON: Not at all. It is simply an expression of the sentiment of a legislative body
      as to that question.
     Mr. FOWLER: To avoid all trouble and throw oil on troubled waters, I withdraw the point of
      order.
     Mr. SELLERS: I move to refer the resolution to the Committee on Rules.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: If the Senator from Wayne (Mr. Johnson) will consent his resolution
      shall be made a special order for two o'clock. The Secretary will call the roll of the
      Senate [Calls.] All the Senators are present. The chair would suggest whether it is necessary
      to appoint a committee to notify the House that the Senate is ready to appear in the hall of
      the House of Representatives. If there is no obligation to such a course the chair will
      appoint the Senator from Owen (Mr. Fowler) and the Senator from Hendricks (Mr. Campbell) and
      suggest the committee return and report.
     In a very few minutes----
     Mr. CAMPBELL, of this committee, reported the House is waiting, and thereupon----
     Senators repaired to the hall of the House at 12 o'clock, returning in thirty
      minutes----
     The Senate took a recess till two o'clock.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The resolution of the Senator from Wayne, (Mr. Johnson) is the
      special order for this hour, the question being on a motion to lay an appeal from the chair on
      the table.
     Mr. BAILEY: The Senator from Wayne has expressed his disavowal of any political significance
      in his resolution, and also that it will not affect any rule of the Senate. If that be true it
      would be an easy matter to engraft that fact in his resolution. I feel that it would be a
      stultification of the majority of this Senate to pass it. I cannot see why there should be
      opposition to making this resolution a concurrent one, and if a common expression is the
      proper thing to arrive at here, the same thing could be had in getting an expression from the
      House. Unless it so amended I feel that this resolution ought to be referred to the
       Committee on Rules. In my judgment it is in direct conflict with the rules
      of the Senate and a blow at the action of this Senate in unseating the Senator from Jackson
      and Lawrence (Mr. McDonald.) As chairman of that committee I am opposed to action at this time
      on that subject. I don't believe this resolution is for any other purpose than to place
      on the records of the Senate a stultification of the majority.I feel that the majority ought
      to seriously consider the effect of the resolution. 
     Mr. DeMOTTE: I am not informed that the House has denied any contestee the right to be
      heard. There has been one case in each of the Houses. In this House we denied to the minority
      the right to report before the vote, but in the other House there was a show of fairness, at
      least. It seems tome it would be useless to pass this as a concurrent resolution, as the House
      has show no disposition to act as the Senate has. 
     Mr. BAILEY: Would it not be a censure upon this body to pass it?
     Mr. JOHNSON: I say there is not a solitary thing in the wording of that resolution that can
      be construed as a stultification of this Senate. I respectfully suggest to the Senate that the
      principle of this resolution is to lift this body upon a higher and more catholic plane. It
      cannot be said but  that our friends in the House
      accorded a full and fair hearing to the gentleman who was unseated; they did not apply the
      restraints that were put upon us in this House; they did not turn him out with a stigma upon
      his character without according a full and fair opportunity to be heard in his own
      defence.
      Mr. WEIR withdrew his substitute. 
     Mr. JOHNSON: I am willing to insert the words: "it is the sense of the Senate." 
     Mr. SELLERS: If that is done I will withdraw my motion to commit. 
     Mr. BAILEY: I believe that resolution censures our conduct in cutting off debate in the
      contested case Senator McDonald (of Jackson.) In that case the Senator from Jackson and
      Lawrence had his opportunity for defence; his colleagues said all they to say; and in no
      particular were they able to controvert the facts charged against him. I shall never vote to
      censure a majority of this body or to cast any reflection upon their action, which is now a
      part of the record of this Senate. I am opposed to that resolution. There has been an
      insertion of a few words, which is a distinction without a difference, namely:" that it
      is the sense of this body," and so this resolution if it be passed would be an absolute
      and complete abrogation of what we have done. I renew the motion that this resolution be
      referred to the Committee on Rules. 
     Mr, FOWLER: I ask the Senator if he is opposed to a free and fair discussion of reports from
      the Committee on Elections ? 
     Mr. BAILEY: Most decidedly not, but there were circumstances around the case which arose in
      this Senate when a long debate was not necessary. There was no defence desired or intended to
      be made. It is simply to make cheap capital about this matter. 
     Mr. JOHHNSON: I rise to a point of order. The Senator is impugning the motives of Senators
      in stating that this resolution was introduced for buncombe.
      Mr. BAILEY: The Senator said he introduced the resolution not for buncombe. If that be true
      the same inference may be held as to any action this body has taken. This Senate would not do
      a dishonorable thing, and why take the sense of the Senate asking it whether it would do an
      honorable thing or not? 
     Mr. DeMOTTE : The Senator from Marion (Mr. Bailey) said there was no intention to make a
      defence, by the friends of Senator McDonald (of Jackson and Lawrence.)
      Mr. SHIVELY : I do not believe any good can result to this Senate or to the people of
      Indiana by the passage of this resolution, therefore I move that it lie upon the table. 
     Mr. HUSTON: I understood the Senator from Marion (Mr. Bailey) to say that there was no
      defence desired to be made in behalf of Mr. McDonald (of Jackson and Lawrence,) and that ample
      opportunity was given to him and his colleagues for his defence. I want to ask the Senator it
      was not understood between himself and a majority of the Committee on
       Elections that the minority of the committee should be allowed on the next morning
      to make a minority report; and further, if it was not understood that the majority report
      simply should be read and no actions taken upon it then? 
     Mr. BAILEY: When the committee closed its deliberations, and had heard arguments on both
      sides, and made its decision as to the character of the majority report, it was stated they
      would be ready to submit that report on the same: evening. The Senator from Tippecanoe (Mr.
      Dresser) said the minority desired to submit a report, and it was then agreed that the
      minority report should be submitted whenever it was ready. I don't know whether it is
      ready yet or not. And I will say in further answer to the question that there was no agreement
      either direct or by inferenee that any action on our report should be delayed until that
      minority report was submitted.
      Mr. JOHNSON: Will the Senator yield a moment? 
     
      Mr. SELLERS: I rise to a question of order. Is the McDonald case now on trial?
      The PRESIDENT pro tem.:The Senator can answer as well as the chair.
      Mr. DRESSER: I rise to a personal explanation. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The Senator has the floor for a personal explanation; and only for
      that. 
     Mr. DRESSER: I don't say there was a positive agreement that no action should be taken
      on that majority report in the Senate that day; but in the committee room it was stated that
      the minority desired to submit a report and would not be ready until the testimony was
      prepared by the stenographer and clerk of the committee. The clerk said the evidence could not
      be ready till the next morning, and I asked time till the next morning to attach to it the
      remainder of the evidence; and it was my understanding that while the majority would report,
      there would be no action taken till the next morning. That was the understanding when I left
      the room. 
     Mr. WINTER: Part of the evidence taken before the committee was placed in my hands for
      examination; and I was prepared with my authorities to discuss the question; but that
      privilege was denied me by the interposition of the previous question. 
     
     
     
      
       
        The motion to lay the resolution on the, table was rejected by yeas 17, nays 33, as
         follows:

        YEAS: Andrew, Bailey, Branaman, Bryant, Hale, Howard (of Decatur), Logsdon, McClure,
         Schloss, Shively, Smith (of Wells,) Thompson (of Marion,) Tharp, Trippet, Zimmerman. 15

         NAYS: Barrett, Berry, Campbell, Cox, Davis, Day, DeMotte, Drake, Dresser, Duncan (of
         Tipton,)Duncan (of Brown,) Ensley, Fowler, French, Griffiths, Harness, Howard (of St.
         Joseph,) Huston, Johnson, Kennedy, Macy, Marshall, McDonald, Moon, Peterson, Rahm,
         Schroyer, Sears, Sellers, Thompson (of Jasper,) Urmston, Winter, Weir. 33. 
       
      
     
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. FOWLER, in explanation of his vote, said: I have carefully read it and can't find a
      single expression in that resolution. I don't endorse. I don't even think it would
      be a reflection on the Committee on Elections. I am a member of the Senate
      and will take my part of the reflection if it does. I vote "no." 
     Mr. MCDONALD, when his name was called, said : I could not think of
      casting any reflection on the Senate or the Committee on Elections. All
      parties ought to be heard. I vote "no." 
     Mr. SELLERS, in explanation, said: If this resolution in my opinion in any way reflected
      upon the Elections Committee I would not vote for it, but I do not believe
      it does; I take the Senator's word that it is not intended in that spirit. With that
      statement and with the construction I am forced to place upon it, I cannot vote to lay the
      resolution on the table, therefore I vote "no." 
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion: This resolution had its birth in a caucus of the Republican party
      of this Senate which declared that the Senate was guilty of a most outrageous act when it
      expelled Mr. McDonald (of Jackson.) I say this resolution had its birth in that caucus, and
      some of them conversed with me and almost made me think the Senate had done wrong. I regard
      the resolution as a stroke at the Senate and a strike at my own act. I was governed entirely
      by the Committee on Elections, and I was willing to take the word of my
      colleague from Marion (Mr. Bailey.) I know he is a conscientious man, and I don't think
      he is capable of doing a wrong. I will not vote, a reflection upon my own conduct, and upon
      the conduct of gentlemen I know so well in this chamber. I therefore vote "aye," and
      I am glad to get clear of it. 
     Mr. THARP: If this resolution does not intend to affect the right or privilege of the
       Election Committee under Rule Ten, I can't see the purpose of it. If
      the Election Committee should report on a contested elec- tion case and it was the sense of the Senate that the question
      should be debated for hours or days why,sir, this body could do so. If this resolution not
      desiring to confer on this body that power and that privilege how can we get at what the
      purpose of the resolution is? 
     Mr. BAILEY (interposing): I think the purpose of the resolution is to make the majority here
      stultify itself. It was introduced for campaign thunder in the next campaign. 
     Mr. CAMPBELL : I think the Senator is carrying the right of explanation too far by going
      into an argument.
      Mr. THARP : The gentleman has had the floor fifty times and- this is the first time I have
      had the floor. If this resolution is intended as a criticism upon the action of the Senate in
      the decision of the election case of Mr. McDonald (of Jackson) I am opposed to it. I acted in
      that matter as I did and I have not a single thing to take back on that score. If that matter
      was again before the Senate I would repeat my conduct. I have no excuses or apology to offer
      for my vote. If another election case comes up and we have time to debate it my conduct would
      be different. Senators have referred to conduct in the other end of the capitol in an election
      contest case there. It was the merest farce on that floor. It was a mere farce because there
      was no power of eloquence or force of logic that would have changed the conviction of the mind
      of each and every man of that body who had resolved expel Mr. Meagher. This resolution has
      taken the time of the Senate for hours. We ought to table it and table every other buncombe or
      political motion made on this floor, I vote aye."
      Mr. JOHNSON: I call attention to the language of the Senator from Marion (Mr. Bailey). His
      language was unparliamentary.
      The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The chair did not understand any objectionable language by the
      Senator from Marion. What was the objectionable language?
      Mr JOHNSON: The language was that this resolution was introduced for political and campaign
      thunder in the face of the fair and square declaration to the contrary.
      The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The chair was not paying attention to what the Senator was
      saying.
     The vote was announced as above.
     Mr. McDonald moved to amend, to-wit:
     Provided, That the construction and spirit of this resolution shall in no wise conflict with
      the standing rules of the Senate, or cast reflection upon any action heretofore had and done
      by the Senate. L. B. McDonald.
     The amendment was accepted, and the resolution adopted.
     The Senate adjourned.
    
   
   
   
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
    
     Thursday, January 20, 1887.
    
     The session was opened with prayer by Rev. M. L. Haynes.
    Mr. FLEECE offered a resolution which was adopted, inviting the veterans of the Mexican war,
     in session in this city, to visit the House.
    The SPEAKER appointed Messrs. Conger and Jewett a committee to escort the Mexican veterans to
     the hall of the House.
    Mr. GORDON said that the gentleman from Hancock, Rev. Mr. Ackman, had informed him that he
     (Mr. Gordon) had done him a great injustice in protesting against this voting in joint
     convention; that he had assured him that he had a plurality of the votes, and that he (Mr. G)
     withdrew the protest.
    Mr. BUCKLES introduced a concurrent resolution requesting Indiana delegates in Congress to
     use their influence to secure the passage of the bill to extirpate certain contagious diseases
     among cattle.
    The resolution was adopted.
    
     SOLDIERS' PENSIONS.
      Mr. BRIANT, of the Committee on Military Affairs, reported in favor of a
      substitute for a resolution (Mr. Loop's) requesting the Senators and Representatives in
      Congress from this State to use all honorable means to secure the passage of the pension
      bill.
     
      Mr. PATTON moved that the report be concurred in.
      Mr. GARDINER moved that the resolution be amended so as to include all ex-soldiers who may
      hereafter become disabled.
      The amendment was adopted and the report concurrd in.
    
    
     SOLDERS OF THE MEXICAN WAR 
     The veterans of the Mexican war came into the hall of the House led by General M. D. Manson
      and were introduced by Mr. Jewett, of the Committee on Invitation.
     Speaker SAYRE said that when he reflected that forty years have passed since the veterans
      responded to the invitation to go to the land of almost equatorial sun and there battle for
      their country and its rights , and when so few of that grand army are alive, and when it is
      recognized in the gray hair of the survivors that the places that now know them will soon know
      them no more, it is a great pleasure to welcome those few. It is more pleasing because,
      although perhaps not designed by those who brought about the war in which the veterans fought,
      it gave to this government an empire in territory and more than an empire in wealth. It ought
      to be a matter of pride each and every veteran of that war whenever or wherever one meets
      them. He referred to the fact that the Speaker of two years ago had said that he had always
      had an ambition to be a Major, and that the association had elevated him to that proud
      position. He, too, had some ambition in the military line. His first name, Warren, reminding
      him of General Joseph Warren, of the Revolutionary war, and his second name was Grover, who
      was now the highest in command of the army. His highest ambition was, therefore, that he might
      be made a General. He still further congratulated the association that the bill to pension the
      Mexican veterans had become a law. He then tendered to them the freedom of the House. 
     General MANSON returned the heartfelt thanks for the association for the compliment paid
      them. The Mexican veterans felt under obligations to the Legislature for its instruction at
      different sessions to the Indiana delegation in Congress to vote, for the pension bill.
      Forty-one years was a long time in any man's career, yet there were four or five thousand
      veterans of that war in this country, and they felt complimented that last Monday the bill
      giving each of them $8 per month after reaching sixty-two years had been passed. You have
      referred to the action taken by this body two years ago, in making the distinguished Speaker
      of the House at that time a Major, and placing the badge on his breast, (which I see he has
      not on to-day.) I think that it is nothing more than right, considering the distinguished
      names. which you have carried during your life, that of the great General who fell in the
      first battle for liberty in this country at Bunker Hill (Warren,) and especially as you have
      that sweet middle name of Grover, [applause,] I feel that the Mexican soldiers are willing to,
      at least, make you a member of the association. General Manson then proceeded to the
      Speaker's stand and pinned the badge of the association on the breast of Mr. Sayre's
      coat. He then declared the Speaker a member of the association in good standing, and expressed
      the hope that when he was sixty-two years of age he would draw a pension of $8 per month. The
      House took a recess for ten minutes.
      Reports of committees were considered till---
    
    
     THE JOINT CONVENTION.
      The SPEAKER of the House: The chair will state that the business of the House will now be
      suspended inasmuch as the hour has arrived for the meeting of the Senate and House in joint
      convention to take proceedings in reference to the election of a person to represent the State
      of Indiana in the Senate of the United States. 
     [The Senate being announced by the Doorkeeper of the House, Senators entered and were seated
      on the right of the Speaker's platform.] 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: The Joint Convention will now come to order. All
      persons  are respectfully requested to maintain order.
      For the purpose of ascertaining, whether there is a quorum present in each House, the
      Secretary of the Senate will first call the roll of the Senate. 
     It discovered fifty Senators present and answering to their names. 
     The SPEAKER of the House: The Clerk of the House will call the roll of the House of
      Representatives. Members will answer to their names as called.
      The roll-call discovered one hundred Representatives present and answering to their
      names.
      The SPEAKER of the House: The journal of the Senate having been read in the Senate as I am
      informed, and the journal of the House having been read here, I am undecided whether to read
      them in joint convention or not, 
     Senator WINTER: I move that the reading of the journal be dispensed with.
      The motion w agreed to.
      Representative GORDON: For reasons not necessary now to state I desire in the presence of
      the Joint Convention to withdraw the objections I made yesterday to the gentleman from
      Hancock, Mr. Ackman. I withdraw the protest. 
     The SPEAKER of the House: If there is no objection it is so ordered. 
     Senator JOHNSON: I would like to inquire whether it is the agreement and understanding that
      all protests made yesterday shall be entered to-day without the formality of rising and
      repeating them? 
     The SPEAKER of the House: That order, as the chair understands, was taken yesterday, that
      the protests shall be allowed to appear in the journals on each ballot the same as they appear
      in the first ballot, and that is to be continued until the business is ended. 
     Senator JOHNSON: I suggest that it be not necessary to hand in the formal protests until the
      final vote is had, and then in conclusions let the protests relate back to cover all the
      ballots.
      Representative JEWETT: Does the Senator think it necessary to have the protests entered
      each day? 
     Senator JOHNSON: If it be desirable, though the decisive ballot is the one to which the
      protests should be applied.
      Representative JEWETT: Let it be understood that the protests be entered as occurring at
      the time the final vote is taken. 
     The SPEAKER of the House: That the protests offered on the first ballot may a entered when
      the final ballot is taken and may be entered as if then made. If there is no objection such
      will be the order of the Convention. 
     Representative GARDINER: It might appear that the right of these various gentlemen would be
      sinking away after several days ballotings. 
     The SPEAKER of the House: The idea as expressed by the gentleman from Floyd (Mr. Jewett) and
      the Senator from Wayne (Mr. Johnson) is that on every ballot these protests shall be
      considered in, but they need not be recorded or entered on the journals except when the
      decisive ballot may be taken. 
     Representative GARDINER I withdraw my remark. 
     The SPEAKER of the House: The reading of the journal having been dispensed with, it is now
      in order to proceed to call the roll and to take a ballot for United States Senator. 
    
    
     THIRD-BALLOT.
     
      The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: The Secretary of the Senate will call the roll of
      the Senate. Each Senator will rise in his place and designate by name the person for whom he
      votes for United States Senator as his name is called. Call.---[When the call was concluded.]
      Hear the vote of the Senate: For David Turpie, 32 votes; for Benjamin Harrison, 18 votes. 
     The SPEAKER of the House: The Clerk of the House will call the roll of the House. Each
      member as called will rise in his place and designate the person for whom he desires to vote
      for United States Senator. The clerk will call the roll.
     
     When the call was completed---
      The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: Hear the vote of the House: For David Turpie, 43;
      for Benjamin Harrison, 53; for J. H. Allan, 4. Hear the vote of the Joint Convention: For
      David Turpie 75; for Benjamin Harrison, 71; for Jason H. Allen, 4. [Same as printed on page
      141 of this book. ] No candidate having received a majority of all the votes cast, it is in
      order for this Convention to proceed to another ballot. 
     Senator WEIR: I move that the Convention adjourn. 
     The SPEAKER of the House: It is moved and seconded that this Joint Convention adjourn.
      [After putting the question.] The ayes have it.
      The Senate retired to its chamber. 
     The House took a recess for dinner. 

    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
      BUSINESS OF THE SUPREME COURT.
      Mr. MOCK offerred the following:

         the Supreme Court be and is hereby required to report to this House, not later than
         Thursday, the 27th day of this month, the following facts, to-wit: 
        
          How many undecided cases were pending in said court on the first day of
          January, 1887, respectively. 
          How many cases were decided during each of the years 1884, 1885 and 1886. 
          How many of said causes decided during the said years involved a money
          judgment, exclusive of costs, in excess of $1,500. 
        
       
      
     
     The resolution was adopted. 
    
    
     RELIEF FOR A TRUSTEE. 
     On motion by Mr. PLEASANTS, the constitutional restriction was dispensed with and his bill
      [H. R. 105] for the relief of Samuel Dickerson was pressed to the final vote and passed the
      House by yeas 76, nays 14. 
     Pending the roll-call---
     Mr. JEWETT, when his name was celled, said: I vote for all such bills as this, and always
      have, because I am opposed to requiring official bonds. I do not believe that the
      responsibility of electing a bad officer should be shifted to a few of his personal friends.
      An equal chance for public office should be given without regard to wealth or position, I
      therefore vote "aye." 
     Mr. LINCK, in explanation of his vote, said: I believe when there is a fire or a robbery
      that is a public misfortune and should not be borne by a single individual; and the breaking
      of a bank is much. the same thing. I vote "aye." 
     Mr. PATTON, when his name was called, said: I do not wish to deprive the tax-payers without
      their consents of the same amount of money that the highwayman carried off. I am no
      highwayman. I vote "no." 
     So the bill passed the House.

    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
     VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    
    IN SENATE.
    
      FRIDAY, January 21 1887.
    
     The session was opened with prayer by Rev. H. A. Edson, of the Presbyerian Church.

    
     STENOGRAPHIC ASSEMBLY REPORTER. 
     Mr. MCDONALD offered the following:
     
     
     
      
       
         Whereas, There has been much misunderstanding and controversy concerning the duties,
         services and payment of the stenographic reporter; therefore, be it 
        Resolved by the Senate, the House of Representatives concurring, That the Joint
          Committee on Claims be instructed to consider the necessity of passing some law
         appointing a State Legislative Stenographer, by which his duties and proper compensation
         can be justly regulated as Official Reporter of the Legislative Sessions of the State, and
         that said committee report by bill, or otherwise, at an early day. 
       
      
     
     Mr. WINTER had heretofore, not only this session, but at previous sessions, opposed the
      course of the stenographer in publishing the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS without more definite
      employment; and he had not in any way recognized Mr. Drapier as the legislative stenographer,
      but considered it desirable that this matter should be decided in some proper way, and,
      therefore, was heartily glad than the Senator from Whitley (Mr. McDonald) had introduced this
      resolution. 
     It was adopted. 

     
      BILLS FOR ACTS WERE INTRODUCED

      SOLDIERS' ORPHANS' HOME.
       On motion by Mr. MCDONALD his bill [S. 6] to amend the act establishing
       the soldiers' and sailors' orphans' home, was taken up, read the second time,
       and the favorable report of committee concurred in.
      
      Mr. ZIMMERMAN moved to amend by reducing the pay of trustees from five hundred to three
       hundred dollars.
       The PRESIDENT pro tem. [at 12 minutes before noon]: Further business will now be
       suspended. The Secretary will call the roll. Senators Fowler and Campbell will notify the
       House that the Senate is ready to proceed to the House of Representatives for the purpose of
       balloting for United States Senator. The chair desires employee to remain at their posts.
      Mr. CAMPBELL: Will the Senate expect us to return? 
      The PRESIDENT pro tem.: Yes, sir. 
      Mr. CAMPBELL: The Senate can meet us half way. 
      The Senate repaired to the hall of the House of Representatives. When Senators returned-- 
      The Senate took a recess for dinner. 
     
     
      AFTERNOON SESSION.
       The Senate resumed the consideration of the soldiers' orphans' home bill [S.
       6.]
       Mr. BARRETT : I think this bill introduced in response to a very general desire of the
       people of the State, and with the general purposes of the bill I am in hearty sympathy. I
       agree with my distinguished colleague (Mr. McDonald) that the orphans of the soldiers and
       sailors should be separated from the feeble winded children; and while doing justice and
       equity to these orphans, we should not forget to do justice and equity to the various
       sections of the State. I understand this bill to require an entirely separate institution
       which shall be supervised and controlled by an entirely separate and distinct management, and
       in that I heartily concur. Representing as I do the second largest county in the State of
       Indiana--second both in population and in wealth--I desire to appeal to members of the Senate
       on its behalf; that they will grant equity and justice to that section of the State. Not a
       single dollar of the State's money has been expended in North-east Indiana in the
       erection of public institutions of the State. If it is right, as I concede it is, that there
       shall be two separate and distinct institutions for the orphans of soldiers and sailors, and
       for feeble-minded children, I say they should be separated by distance as well, and so far
       that there mingling of these two classes of children. I have the honor to come from a county
       that has the largest Grand Army Post in the State, and you should accede to their wishes in
       establishing a home for the orphans of their late comrades in war, in that county. While the
       bill does not provide for the erection of this institution upon any particular ground, I will
       say that the people of Allen county will most cheerfully grant the land upon which to erect
       it if the location is given to them. It is right and proper. that it should be located there,
       as there above all other places in the State will be found the largest number of valient
       soldiers who will have its interests at heart. While the Senator from Fulton (Mr. Zimmerman)
       moves that the salaries of the Trustees be reduced to three hundred dollars, I can say on
       behalf of these soldiers that you can rest assured the Trustees will act without compensation
       and without reward. The city of Fort Wayne is a great railroad center while the little town.
       where the institution is at present located has but one single railroad running through it.
       If we establish a separate institution for the soldiers' orphans, as I believe to be the
       sentiments of this General Assembly and of the entire people of the State, then I ask in
       behalf of North-east Indiana that this institution shall be located at the great railroad
       center in North-east Indiana and given to the second county in the State, having the largest
       Grand Army Post. 
      Mr. JOHNSON: I sincerely hope this amendment will not prevail. I suppose it is generally
       understood by members of this Senate that it is the desire of the people throughout the State
       that there shall be a separation of the soldiers' orphans' home - from  the feeble-minded children. If this Legislature shall adjourn
       taking no such steps I think it would meet with the disapproval of the people. I cannot see
       why Allen county is a better place than where it is now located. As far as location is
       concerned it seems to me the present location is preferable. It is true that Ft. Wayne is a
       greater railroad center, but it is equally true that location, as far as geographical center
       is concerned, is in favor of the present location. These soldiers' orphans are scattered
       throughout the entire length and breadth of the State of Indiana--throughout the central,
       southern and eastern, as well as the northern and north-eastern part of the State. The
       distance to be traveled in order to get at the home should not be overlooked in deciding the
       question as to where it shall be located. I favor a central location. The present location
       has almost direct communication with Indianapolis where those from the west, south-west and
       south can pass onto Knightstown. There is another thing to be considered in this connection:
       The counties of Henry and Rush have had that institution in their midst so long they have
       become attached to it, and it has become a center of attraction to them. It seems to me this
       consideration should not be lightly discarded, for the citizens of these counties have shown
       themselves worthy of protecting and caring for this institution. You must remember there are
       other soldiers in the State of Indiana than those in Allen county, and I express their
       sentiment when I say it is their earnest desire that this institution remain where it is now.
       It is said that the good people of Allen county are willing to contribute out of their means
       to secure the location of this institution in their midst; but we do know that we have
       purchased and paid for a large and beautiful farm where the location now is. There is not in
       the State of Indiana any location more desirable, or possessing more natural advantages, than
       the one we now have. There is on that farm a substantial and large building contracts have
       been made for another, on which work has been commenced and money has been expended, upon the
       statement that the orphans' home would remain where it now is. The certainty there
       should not be exchanged for the uncertainty of a donation of land in Allen county. The wishes
       of the soldiers of the count of Wayne, and other reasons name are worthy of consideration;
       and this Legislature ought not to make a change unless some more substantial reasons are
       given. As far as I am personally concerned I have no other desire than to see this important
       institution located where it has always been located. 
      Mr. KENNEDY: The soldiers' orphans', home is situated in one of the most
       beautiful locations in the State. It is a beautiful and healthy location, and it is as near
       Fort Wayne as Fort Wayne is to it. It is about in the center of the State as to north and
       south; it is easy of access from points of the State, and there is a railroad direct from the
       city of Fort Wayne to it. There has been between sixty and seventy thousand dollars spent
       there on the place. One of the bravest Generals from Indiana who fell in battle was General
       Hackelman from that county. I don't want that institution moved from Henry county. The
       location cannot be beat in any section of the State. It is nigh to the center of the State,
       and it would be an unnecessary expenditure of thirty to fifty thousand dollars to remove it. 
      Mr. SELLERS: This question has been raised time and again and was seriously considered
       during the sittings of the last General Assembly. I took the ground then as I do now that
       these institutions ought to be separated: and when separated let them be so separated that
       there can be no charge that there is any connection between the two managements;--let us send
       the soldiers' orphans far away from the feeble-minded children. That is what the
       soldiers and seamen are asking us to do. The purchase of a location is an expense that would
       be saved if the  stitution is taken to Fort Wayne. As
       far as railroad facilities are concern= ed, I do not give that much consideration. These
       children are supposed to be orphans and wards of the State, and there will not much money be
       expended in traveling, by the orphans, as the fact that they are orphans convinces me they
       will not have many friends. In locating benevolent institutions the policy of the Legislature
       has been to give to the several portions of Indiana some one of these institutions. The
       south-western portion of the State has several; the State University is in Bloomington; the
       central portion has institutions located about Indianapolis; one is at Plainfield; Lafayette
       has Purdue University ; Logansport has one of the new Insane Asylums ; Richmond also has one
       on the east, and near to it is Knightstown, and Knightstown will still have the Home for
       feeble-minded children. The fifty-four acres there belonging to the State will be sufficient
       for that purpose, and if any money has been expended in erecting a building it may be
       utilized for that purpose. That leaves a line to be drawn from Richmond, to this city and
       north--leaving one-fourth of the State,north-east, without a single State institution ; a
       wealthy portion of the State, and as I understand it representing largely the Grand Army of
       the Republic and other soldiers not members of that organization. I understand also that an
       offer is made by the Senator from Allen (Mr. Barrett) that there will be donated to the State
       sufficient grounds for this institution, and that among good citizens of Fort Wayne will be
       found men able and willing to look after the interests of the institution for perhaps nothing
       or but a nominal compensation. While other portions of the State have benevolent institutions
       and the north-east portion has paid one-fourth of their cost, it is but fair that this
       institution, which is asked for by that portion of the State, should be given them. The
       question of the value of the fifty-four Acres at Knightstown is nothing in comparison with
       the question of separating the soldiers' orphans from the feeble-minded children. The
       building is even now unfit for their use and it will take a great deal of money, to make it
       of sufficient capacity to accommodate even the feeble-minded children. If the advantages
       named can be obtained at Fort Wayne it seems to me that part of the State which has
       heretofore received no such recognition should now be granted the location. 
      Mr. JOHNSON: This bill having been prepared by a committee of the Grand Amy of the
       Republic, their wishes as to the location should be respected. 
      Mr. SELLERS: I understand the question of location was not seriously considered.
       Mr. WEIR: If I were in favor of the bill I should favor the amendment but I desire to call
       attention to the Governor's message on this subject. I think it is a great deal easier
       for this Legislature to appropriate money by the hundred thousand dollars than it is for the
       people to pay it in the Treasury. In his biannual message referring to the Soldiers Orphans
       Home--and I presume he has given more thought and reflection to the financial condition of
       the State than any member of this body--the Governor says:
      "I recommend that the Feeble-Minded Institution be separated from that of the
       Soldiers' Orphans' Home, and suggest that the feeble-minded inmates be removed to,
       one of the new hospitals now in course of construction." 
      It seems to me that is just the course for the Legislature to pursue. We have three new
       insane asylums, and I might say I consider it a great misfortune to the people that these
       asylums are scattered--one at Evansville, one at Richmond and one at Logansport. These
       practically useless institutions have cost the people nearly one million of dollars; and I
       believe there are large appropriations now asked for the maintenance of these institutions.
       What is to hinder carrying out the the recommendation in the Governor's message? This
       bill proposes to appropriate ninety-five thousand dollars I think. Will Senators stop and
       think what the Execu  tive has said about the condition
       of the State's, finances? We must borrow money or increase taxation. While I believe
       these two institutions should be separated, I am not in favor of appropriating a single
       dollar of the people's money that is not necessary, and I am opposed to this bill,
       because I do not, believe it is necessary. 
      Mr. MULLINIX: I feel that I would not be discharging a duty I owe to the men who were by my
       side in the late war, and to their children, now the wards of the State, if I did not say
       something relative to this subject. I am in favor of taking the soldiers' orphans'
       home from Knightstown. The greatest reason for such a step is that I object to our
       comrades' children associating with the feeble-minded of the State. I care not so much
       about their home going to Fort Wayne, though I would support such a measure. It should be
       located on the most choice ground in the State of Indiana. If there is a class that is
       entitled to the love and care of American citizens it is the children whose fathers have died
       in defense of the glorious flag. When gentlemen say they object on the ground that it
       requires a large appropriation of money, I would ask what saved this country but the men who
       offered their lives for its perpetuity? If our flag had been trailed in the dust where would
       the commonwealth of Indiana be to-day? I am in favor of the amendment taking this institution
       to Fort Wayne where there is the largest post of the Grand Army of the Republic the State. I
       will support the amendment. 
      Mr. BARRETT submitted the amendment foreshadowed in his remarks on page 154, as follows: 
      Mr. PRESIDENT: I move to amend Section 1 of Senate Bill No. 6, introduced by Senator
       McDonald, of Allen, and Whitley, so that It will read as follows:
       "Section 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Indiana, That there
       shall be established and maintained an institution located at or near the city of Fort Wayne,
       in Allen county, Indiana, which institution shall be known as the Indiana Soldiers' and
       Sailors' Orphans' Home." 
      I also, move to amend Section 7 of said bill by striking out the words "adjoining the
       lan now owned by the State" in line 6 of said section, and by inserting the word
       "one hundred" in place of the word "seventy-five" in line 5 of said
       section. 
      I further move to amend Section 24 of said bill so as to read as follows:
       "Section 24. There is hereby appropriated out of moneys in the State Treasury not
       otherwise appropriated, to be drawn by the Treasurer of said Board, the sum of one hundred
       thousand dollars, to be expended under the direction of the Trustees, in purchasing suitable
       grounds, in erecting suitable buildings thereon, and in furnishing the same: Provided, That
       not to exceed ten thousand dollars shall be expended in purchasing the grounds."
       Mr. HUSTON: The Soldiers' Orphans' Home located at Knightstown happens to be not
       far distant from where I live. I know the people of Rush county, and I know how true, how
       earnest and how devoted the have ever proven themselves to th orphans of the soldiers of the
       Union. When it was first located the grounds were purchased by contributions from; the.
       pockets of the people of that vicinity. They have ever felt and taken a deep interest in the
       institution and they have their committees to visit it, who are constantly informed as to any
       mal-treatment of the occupants. In 1881, as a member of a committee raised to make a thorough
       and searching investigation of the institution, when our report was made to the House of
       Representatives and the faults found in the institution and its management stated, as a
       result, the men who had charge of it and treated with unkindness the inmates, were summarily
       discharged. That institution has accomplished much good. Unfortunately a few months ago a
       building was burned and the loss was about twenty-five thousand dollars. Upon the building
       there was y an insurance of nearly that amounts The insurance companies have since paid about
       twenty thousand dollars; there is five thousand dollars unpaid; and that amount is in
       litigation. As soon as the money was paid in, the men in control of the institution commenced
       to rebuild that which had been burned and that work has gone on until the buildings are now
       nearly ready for occupancy. Some four hun-.  dred and
       odd dollars from the general fund has been expended, in addition to the twenty thousand
       dollars received from the insurance companies.---Now it is proposed to take that institution
       from among a people who have fostered it, who love the institution and are true to it and
       desire its continuance and its existance amongst them. The grounds have been laid out to meet
       the peculiar requirements of the institution. Let it be said to the credit of Indiana that
       she has shown great sympathy for and in the care of her unfortunate people. I oppose the
       adoption of the amendment because I recognize the straightened financial condition in which
       we end our State. Our Governor reports that we are paying an enormous sum by way of interest.
       It is reported that unless expenditures are cut down the receipts of the State during the
       coming year will be insufficient to meet the requirements. The time for retrenchment is at
       hand. I oppose this proposition for another reason. It is proposed to take this institution
       from a people who have always been ready to do their utmost for its advancement. It is
       proposed to take it to an end of the State not accessible from all parts. Then again this
       bill proposes an expenditure of ninety-five thousand dollars. No man is more willing than I
       to expend money and make taxes ever so heavy to take proper care of the wards of the State. 
      Mr. JOHNSON [interposing]: Can the Senator state what is the amount of the contracts
       entered into with a view of restoring the institution ? 
      Mr. HUSTON : Upwards of twenty thousand dollars has been contracted for, according to the
       statement made by the Governor of the State, for the erection of buildings. I am informed
       that the buildings are now of almost ready for occupancy and the children can be removed in
       a, short time. An additional fact is, if it is proposed to remove them to a new institution
       that of itself will necessitate their being huddled together for months to come where they
       were forced to be while the rebuilding was going on. 
      Mr. JOHNSON: Is it not true that there are seventeen thousand dollars in the walls, and the
       total valuation of the improvements is upwards of twenty-five thousand dollars?
      Mr. HUSTON: Yes, sir.
      Mr. JOHNSON And also that this bill would involved a loss of two-thirds of that?
      Mr. HUSTON: There are twenty-eight thousand dollars, at a low valuation, as a basis upon
       which to reproduce the Soldiers' Orphans' Home, and upwards of twenty-five thousand
       dollars has been expended and contracted for, making an expenditure of a sum total of nearly
       or quite fifty thousand dollars. It is proposed by this bill to make it impossible for these
       children to be placed in pleasant and suitable quarters this summer, and that fifty thousand
       dollars of the people' money shall be useless; and a building erected at Fort Wayne, an
       inconvenient portion of the State, at a cost of ninety-five thousand dollars! I sincerely
       trust the Senate before adopting this bill will take further time to consider it.
      The PRESIDENT pro tem.: Whoever was on the floor when the Senator from Fayette (Mr. Huston)
       was recognized can have the floor now.
      Mr. FRENCH moved to make the bill a special order for next Wednesday at 2 o'clock P.
       M. 
      Mr. FOWLER moved to amend the motion by referring the bill to the Committee on
        Benevolent Institutions, with directions to inquire into the propriety of
       converting one of the new insane asylums for the feeble-minded children or a soldiers'
       orphans' home instead of an insane asylum.
      Mr. MCDONALD addressed the Chair.
      Mr. CAMPBELL: I rise to a point of order. The motion is not debatable. And this bill has
       nothing to do with the asylum for feeble-minded children; so that portion of the motion is
       out of order, not being germane to the bill.
      Mr. MCDONALD: I wish to state as a matter of personal privilege that
       this bill was drawn by the executive  committee of the
       Grand Army of the Republic. The bill was drafted three times and it is just right to suit the
       Grand Army of the State. Personally I would be glad to have the institution located at Fort
       Wayne, but when I consider the recommendation of the Governor, and see the situation of the
       children at Knightstown, I fear the will of the people of the State. We don't want to
       defeat the will of the people; we can't afford to do it. I care not what burden is put
       upon me to maintain these children of the soldiers of Indiana. 
      Mr. THARP: How many wards are maintained in this institution? 
      Mr. MCDONALD: I understand some two hundred.
       Mr. CAMPBELL: I insist the part of the pending motion instructing the committee with
       regard to the feeble-minded children asylum is not germane. 
      Mr. FOWLER, : If there is nothing in the bill referring to the feeble-minded children
       can't the committee put it in?
       Mr. BAILEY: Can you state how many feeble-minded children there are in the
       institution?
       The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The chair has indulged the question business to the largest
       extent. 
      Mr. RAHM : As chairman of the Committee on Benevolent Institutions I
       would state that it is useless to refer this bill to our committee. If Senators will look at
       the Governor's message on page---
       Mr. DeMOTTE [interposing]: I rise to a point of order. Debate is out of order on a motion
       to refer. 
      The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The chairman of the Committee on Benevolent Institutions (Mr. Rahm)
       is making a statement from that committee and it will be heard. 
      Mr. RAHM : There are thirty-five hundred and thirty insane people in the State. The new
       asylums will hold about eleven hundred. So after all three of the new asylums are completed
       and filled there will be still twenty-four hundred and thirty that will want accommodation.
       And what is the use to refer that bill to a committee with a view of ascertaining whether one
       of these institutions can be utilized for the feeble-minded children? 
      The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The Senator (Mr. Rahm) has stated a reason why the bill should not
       be referred back. Other debate is not in order. 
      Mr. BARRETT: I move as a substitute for the pending motions, that the further consideration
       of this matter be made a special order for two o'clock on Tuesday next. 
      Mr. FOWLER accepted this motion as a substitute for his. 
      The substitute was agreed to. 
     
     
      THE KANKAKEE RIVER. 
      Mr. DeMOTTE offered the following:
      
      
      
       
        
          Whereas, About seven hundred thousand acres of land in the valley of the Kankakee
          river, and within the counties of St. Joseph, Laporte, Starke, Jasper, Newton, Porter and
          Lake, in this State, cannot be drained because of a natural obstruction in the Kankakee
          river at Momence, in the State of Illinois; therefore, be it 
         Resolved by the Senate, the House of Representatives concurring, That a committee,
          consisting of two senators and three Representatives be appointed to confer with the
          Legislature of the state of Illinois, now in session, with the view of securing the
          necessary legislation to accomplish the removal of said obstruction. 
        
       
      
      It was referred to the Committee on Swamp Lands.
      
     
     
      A, RIPLEY COUNTY GRAVEL ROAD.
      On motion by Mr. URMSTON his bill [S. 53] was taken up. 
      Mr. WINTER: I have been trying to get at the facts concerning this bill. I am opposed to
       any bill of this kind. A party has promised to put in my possession by the first of next week
       some facts in regard to this matter. I think this bill ought not to be passed beyond the
       stage of amendment. The question is as to legalizing an assessment and putting the people to
       four or five thousand dollars costs. I only desire an opportunity to have these facts
       enquired into. 
      Mr. URMSTON: It seems to me that in a short time any one acquainted with the law on the
       construction of gravel roads can understand this matter. If there is anything wrong ir is
       simply a technicality. The board  failed to obtain
       jurisdiction. [He read and explained the statute.] 
      The PRESIDENT pro tem. [Mr. Bailey in the chair] took the floor in favor of the bill,
       declaring that it ought to pass under a suspension of the rules, as the people of Ripley
       county unanimously want it passed, except those living along the line of the road. 
      It was ordered engrossed. 
     
     
      A BILL FOR AN ACT WAS INTRODUCED BY 
      Mr. Johnson [S. 143]: To amend section 2932 of the R. S. 
     
     
       A PAIR. 
      .The PRESIDENT pro tem.: There is a consultation going on about the death of the brother of
       a Senator, with regard to a pair. The chair suggests that the Senators from White (Mr
       Sellers) and Laporte (Mr. Weir) join the Senators from Hendricks (Mr. Campbell) and Marion
       (Mr. Winter) on that matter.
       Subsequently the following agreement was submitted to the Senate:
       Senators Duncan of Tipton and Duncan of Brown pair with each other upon the question of
       the election of United States Senator and all questions in any way connected therewith, and
       also upon all political questions, whether arising in joint convention or in the Senate, and
       during their pair the name of neither Senator is to be recorded as being present or in voting
       in the joint convention or in the Senate upon any roll-call or call of the Senate in joint
       convention, this pair to continue until both Senators agree in announcing it to be
       terminated, and such agreement shall be announced in the Senate, or reduced to writing signed
       by each of said Senators. This pair is entered into by reason of the death the brother of
       Senator Duncan of Tipton. CHAR. C. DUNCAN of Tipton. W. C. DUNCAN of Brown. January 21, 1887. 
      Mr. SELLERS : I suggest that two gentlemen be selected from each side who shall agree as to
       what is a political question. 
      Mr. CAMPBELL: We are perfectly willing to leave that question to the Senate. 
      The PRESIDENT pro tempore: I desire to ask Senators Winter and Campbell and Huston whether
       this pair will be respected in joint convention? [After an affirmative response.] That is all
       I wanted to ask. 
     
     
      RECESS TILL MONDAY.
       Mr. CAMPBELL made an ineffectual motion to concur in a House resolution that the two
       Houses adjourn till Monday. 
      The Senate adjourned.

      Mr. BUCKLES offered the following: 
     
     
     
      
       
        Resolved, That the Committee on Fees and Salaries are hereby
         instructed to inquire into the expediency of reducing the fees, salaries and emoluments and
         perquisites of office of the following named State and county officers, to-wit:

         and Clerk of the Circuit and Superior court, one-half, or such amount as may be necessary

         of the people of the state, and report by bill or otherwise. 
       
      
     
     Mr. PATTON moved to amend by including the Reporter and Clerk of the Supreme Court.
      On motion by Mr. MONTGOMERY of Owen,the amendment was amended by inserting "County
      Auditor and County Sheriffs." 
     The amendment as amended was agreed to.

     INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS.
      Mr. IBACH, in connection with his bill [H. R. 198] to create an industrial department in
      the public schools, introduced a resolution to refer it to the Committee on
       Education with instructions that the President of the State Normal School, the
      President of Purdue University and the Superintendents of the public schools of Indianapolis
      and Fort Wayne give their views to the committee as to the wisdom of the movement, and also to
      send a sub-committee to visit the industrial school at Chicago. He said: I have been satisfied
      that the practical working of industrial schools should be examined by some committee, I
      therefore hope that the House will have some further information on this subject. I want to
      state the House that there is an Industrial School in successful operation in Chicago and it
      is easy of access.
      Mr. PATTON: It seems to me that it is unnecessary to send outside to get information and
      experience. I believe we can get along without any extraordinary help from anybody. I have no
      objection to industrial schools, but I do not wish to discus this matter now. I apprehend that
      this committee is capable of taking care of its business. Therefore I am not in favor of
      sending a committee to Chicago at the expense of the State of Indiana. 
     Mr. MAJOR : If you stop and shut off all the supplies for these higher institutions you will
      kill them and then have a corpse you will mourn over. 
     Mr.PLEASANTS : I am opposed to this resolution, which provides that the Committee
       on Education shall to Chicago. It would be nothing but a junketing trip at the
      expense of thee people of the State. It is certain that an investigation of a day or two could
      do no good. 
     Mr. IBACH withdrew his resolution.
    
    
      APPROPRIATION FOR GETTYSBURG. 
     Mr. GRIFFITHS offered the following:
     
     
     
      
       
         Whereas, Other States have given to the Gettysburg Battlefield Memorial Association
         large sums of money for the purpose of enabling said association to purchase and preserve
         the lauds upon which the Battle of Gettysburg was fought, and also to preserve and care for
         the monument erected on said battlefield; and 
        Whereas, The State of Indiana has erected on said battlefield six beautiful monuments,
         marring the places occupied in that great battle by the six regiments from the state of
         Indiana; therefore, 
        Resolved, That the sum of fifteen hundred ($1,500) dollars be, and the same is hereby,

     Senator HUSTON: I move the Convention adjourn till meridian to-morrow.
     Representative JEWETT: I ask that the roll of the Joint Convention be called on that
      motion.
     The SPEAKER: If we cannot ascertain the result in any other way; not unless it is absolutely
      necessary, because there is no rule authorizing it. As many as favor the motion to say
      "aye." [After the negative response.] In the opinion of the chair the

      [H. R. 32] prohibiting the trapping or shooting of quail. 
     Mr. GROVES : I hope members of this Legislature will examine that report well before they
      vote. I cannot see the value of forbidding the killing and trapping of quails at all times.
      There, should be some provision, in that bill to allow the owners of lands to kill quail
      during January and December, and I would like to have it amended to that effect. I hope the

     Mr. FOSTER: I : wish to say in defence of this bill that I believe the sense of the great
      majority of the people of the State, and those who are to be benefitted by these birds, is,
      that this bill shall pass. The present law is almost a failure; it has not presev -  ed this species of birds, and it is evident that the only
      way we can preserve them is by absolutely prohibiting their being killed. If the quails should
      come into this State in too great numbers, it will be very easy to pass a bill allowing them
      to be killed. I say that these birds are useful, and that they are a great benefit to farming
      communities, because they eat the useless bugs and insects that infest the crops. I hope that
      this bill will not be voted down. It has been reported favorably from the committee composed
      largely of a farming interest. I feel that you should not add anything to it. 
     Mr. GOUGH Before we can vote intelligently on this question we ought to consider what the
      law is at present. It prevents the killing of quail the entire year from the twentieth day of
      December to the fifteenth of October in the following year. Every farmer who desires to
      prevent the killing of quails on his land can do so now, for all he has to do is to put up a
      notice on his farm to prevent the killing of those birds. It is no use to add to that law. It
      is simply wasting the time of this body. We have all the protection that is necessary for
      these birds and I trust this bill will not be massed. 
     Mr. SCOTT : I do not believe this report should be agreed to. I have been, somewhat in
      communication with gun clubs and "city dads" and hey bitterly oppose this measure,
      and I have not had any, communications from the farmers telling me to favor this bill. I
      understand that the n clubs are the best means we have for the enforcement of the present law,
      and as the gentleman from Warrick [Mr. Gough] has said, the statutes we have will, protect
      these birds all that they should be protected. It permits any farmer to post notices upon his
      place that hunters shall not hunt quails upon his farm. As it is, the gun clubs of this State
      are in favor of the protection of the quails; they want them for the purpose of their sport,
      and so they are jealous and zealous in the enforcement of the law. You pass a law that the
      quails cannot be killed at any time and the consequence will be simply this, the law will lack
      in enforcement. The gun clubs will give it the go-by and the law will be violated.
     Mr. LINCK: The law upon the statue books was gotten up by the best friend of the birds in
      this State and probably in America. He secured the passage of the present law and under it the
      quails of this State have increased very fast, and if we allow this law to remain we will have
      plenty of quail. I know that during the past winter there were very many quails in our section
      of the country where heretofore there have been very few.
     Mr. KELLY, of Boone: The operation of this law may do very well for New York and other
      States, but I will say for my section so far as I can lear it does not operate to satisfy the
      farmer. The bird is reduced until there is none hardly in the country.
     Mr. METZGER: I am a farmer and I know the operation of the present law. It don't
      prohibit the hunters from coming out on your farm in spite of your notices and killing these
      birds off. I think all killing should be stopped for a few years.
     Mr. CUSTER: I wish to raise my voice in favor of the quail. The gentleman from the other
      side (Mr. Scott) has spoken about the gun clubs. They are known by the farmers as outlaws. In
      the roaming of thes outlaws over our farms the farmers frequently have their stock crippled,
      if the stock happens to have in the way. We want this bill.
     Mr. DAVIS: It seems to me that this bill is a ridiculous think on the face of it. It has
      been said by gentleman on this floor that the present law don't prohibit. Well if we
      can't enforce this law that now is, how can we enforce a stricter law? There is such a
      thing as that the very strictness of a law will kill the law and make it inoperative. The idea
      of making an absolute prohibition upon hunting quails is preposterous. I am in favor of some
      kinds of prohibition but not in favor of quail protection. 

     
      Mr. STUBBLEFIELD: I am in favor of this bill. I know the law spoken of by the gentleman
      from Warrick(Mr. Gough) is disregarded. The reason why it has not been enforced because it is
      almost impossible to enforce it. Whom do those quails belong to? Whose feed do they eat? They
      are raised by the farmer. Last there was a gang of quails in a neighbor's wheat field and
      a man shot one of them and there was fifty-two chinch bugs in its craw. 
     Mr. SHAMBAUGH : I am somewhat surprised at the position of some gentlemen. I belong to a gun
      club myself. We all look anxiously for the 15th day of October to come so that we can go out
      and shoot these birds. Two days before the law went into erect I was out hunting and I saw a
      flock of these birds and I actually did not shoot at them. I say that the hunter should not be
      denied the privilege of this sport. 
     Mr. ROBINSON : Some gentleman the right has said that; the quails an becoming very numerous
      under the present law. That is not the case my portion of the State. They are coming very
      scarce. I do not know f a farmer anywhere in my neighborhood who undertakes to trap, or catch
      them in any other way; but I do know that the men from the city come out and kill them. These
      gentlemen seem to go upon the proposition that quail are valuable because they are good to
      eat. Why, it is a very rare dish. I am fond of them and I am fond of the sport of shooting
      them, but I refrain from that because I know that they more valuable living in the fields than
      dead upon the table. The quail is a very valuable bird. It destroys many insects. I am a
      friend of the nail for his value on the farm, not on the table; and I insist that the present
      law does not give us very much protection. The hunters pursue and ki11 them promiscuously and
      kill them at any time, and kill them in season out of season. I have a little farm and I allow
      the boys to go on that farm and shoot rabbits and squirrels and any game that I shoot myself,
      but I don't kill the quail and don't permit them to. But we can't always
      prevent them. I believe that the quail ought to have absolute protection, I insist that the
      quail is the most valuable bird that we have on the farm and it ought to have the protection
      of the law. 
     Mr. BUCKLES : I am a farmer. I have had some experince in the, quail business. If I had one
      hundred full grown quails on a farm to-day you could not come to me and buy them of me for one
      hundred dollars in gold. They are the farmer's friend, and work late and early for his
      welfare. Let him turn up a field of sod in the spring of the year and before the sun goes down
      they will be on it. Some gentlemen say we ought to let the quail alone, and let the hunters
      kill then, because a these gentleman from town want a little quail once in a while. Allow me
      to suggest that they do as we do,--raise them for themselves. But it is said the quail have
      sufficient protection. The hunters pass by our notices and it don't do a particle of good
      unless we have a guard on our farm. I supposed this season that I had a fair supply of quails
      on my farm, but in about ten days after I thought ht there were two or three hundred on m
      farm, not two dozen were left. I who had fed and raised them did not get a fry. I am in favor
      of not crushing out the bill of the gentleman from Madison (Mr. Foster.) Let the quail
      increase until the farmer and everybody else can see their importance. This bill was carefully
      considered and as I remember indorsed by every member of the committee.
      The report of the committee was concurred in. 
     Mr. PATTON offered an amend meat to the bill giving the owner or person in charge of farm
      lands the right to kill the birds from October 1 to February 1, and said: You are not
      considering any legislation here in the interests of the farmer. You want hunters to go upon
      his lands and shoot his stock and they go there. They put on their silk hats and their steel
      pent coats and they go. They go out for the very purpose of getting a  reputation as hunters. They are created that way and they
      can't help it. They are a nuisance to the farmer. I want the quail. It is insectivorous.
      I don't know whether it eats chinch bugs or not; I don't believe anything but
      lightning will kill. I tell you when you go through the fields and see the quails fly up it
      looks home-like. But then you have these fellows come in there. I don't allow it; I would
      rather they would come into my poultry yard and kill my poultry. They are creating a nuisance
      in every little town by forming a gun club. They take their dog and gun, and if they
      can't own a dog they take their shot-gun, and if they can't own a gun they borrow
      one. I would like to have a law that they can't go out of their towns, and if they do I
      would want to call together a commission of justices of the peace to sit on them and send them
      to the Insane Asylum. 
     On motion by Mr. BUCKLES, the amendment [Mr. Patton's] was laid on the table. 
     Mr. KELLY, of Boone, moved to amend the bill by limiting its operation to five years. 
     On motion by Mr. MONTGOMERY, it was laid on the table. 
     Mr. HARRELL thought there. should be a provision in the bill exempting from punishment any
      one who had quails or pheasants in his possession, which had been got out of the State. He
      moved an amendment to this effect. 
     On motion by Mr. DAVIS, it was laid on the table. 
     On motion by Mr. GORDON, the bill was recommitted to the Committee on
       Agriculture.
     
     The House adjourned.

         Whereas, Under the copyright laws of the United States the text-books used in the public
         schools have been copyrighted, and the publication and sale thereof to the people has been
         monopolized by a few publishing houses, thereby greatly enhancing the price and cost of
         said books to the people:
         Be it Resolved by the Senate, the House concurring therein,, That our Senators in
         Congress are instructed, and that our Representatives are requested, to secure the passage
         of a law repealing all copyright laws, so far as the same may apply to the text-books used

     Mr. DEMOTTE made an ineffectual motion to lay this substitute resolution on the table.

      Mr. OSBORN offered, a resolution, to legalize the appointment of two extra clerks. 
     It was adopted. 
    
    
     RECESS TILL MONDAY. 
     On motion by Mr. JORDON, it was 
     
     
     Resolved by the House, the Senate concurring,' That when the two Houses of the General

     FISH LADDERS. 
     Mr. LOOP returned from the Committee on Rights and Privileges Mr.
      Groves' fish ladder repeal bill [H. R. 53] with a recommendation that it be indefinitely
      postponed. 
     Mr. GROVES: I earnestly hope, the recommendation of the committee will not be concurred in.
      This bill is to repeal the fish ladder law requiring persons who are owners of dams across
      streams to build ladder so that fish can go over the dams. The Legislature has passed that law
      compelling them to put in, at a large expense, these fish ladders which they claim the
      Legislature hart right to do, and in my county it has led to lawsuits. The experience of the
      citizens of my county is that in streams where there are the greatest number of dams the fish
      are more plentiful than where there are no dams. As it is no protection to the fish I hope the
      report of that committee will not be concurred in. 
     Mr. MORSE : I am in favor of concurring in the report of the committee for this reason: when
      the fish spawn they go as near the head of the stream as possible where the water is shallow
      and warmer. When the streams are obstructed by dams they cannot go above the dams without
      ladders. The object of the law the gentleman from Perry (Mr. Groves) desires repealed is to
      provide fishways. Such a law is in force in New  York,
      Pennsylvania and Ohio, and I think we are retrograding when we abolish, laws of this kind. The
      principal objections to the law is the cost Oil the fish ladders. The cost has been somewhere
      in the neighborhood of three hundred or four hundred dollars. I believe the Fish Commissioner
      reports that they can be made at a Cost of not more than fifty dollars. 
     Mr. LINCK : Our people in the southern part of the State are in favor of this fish ladder
      law. The people who own the mill dams object to it, but the people generally are in favor of
      protecting the fish, and the only way to protect them is by building these fish-ways so they
      can get over the dams to spawn. This matter has been investigated by scientific men who have
      made a study of it, sand they are in favor of fish ladders. 
     Mr. JEWETT demanded the previous question. 
     The House seconded the demand and under its operations the report was concurred in, and so
      the bill was indefinitely postponed. 
    
    
     WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.
      Mr. LOOP, from the same committee, returned Mr. Pleasants' bill [H. R. 106] to
      regulate weights and measures, with a recommendation that it pass with an amendment increasing
      the weight of corn from sixty-eight to seventy pounds to the bushel. 
     Mr. GARRISON: I hope the report of this committee will not be concurred in for this reason:
      The present law fixes the weight of corn at sixty-eight pounds to the bushel while this
      committee's amendment would fix the weight of a bushel of corn at seventy pounds to the
      bushel. 
     Mr. PLEASANTS: This bill is an exact copy of the old law except that the weight of onions is
      stated at forty-eight pounds to the bushel while the bill makes it fifty-six. The committee
      recommend the passage of a further amendment making the weight of a bushel of corn seventy
      pounds instead of the present weight of sixty-eight pounds. These are the only changes from
      the old law. 
     Mr. PATTON: I am surprised that any farmer should be in favor of this amendment to this
      bill. In the first place members of the House all understand that corn grown in the State of
      Indiana is superior to corn grown in any other State in the Union. It is of a higher grade; it
      is of a better quality, and sixty-eight pounds of corn is equal to seventy pounds of other
      corn. I believe this change is not necessary. It is not asked for by the farmers. It is
      legislating against the interest of the farmer. The present standard has been on the statute
      books a long time and it is well and right to leave it alone.


     On this motion, the report was laid on the table.

     The bill was ordered engrossed for the third reading.
     The SPEAKER: The business of the House will now be suspended until the Joint Convention for
      the election of United States Senator shall meet and adjourn.

    
    
     THE JOINT CONVENTION.
     The Senate appeared, and 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate said: The Joint Convention will please come to
      order. The chair desires to announce the fact that Senators Duncan of Tipton and Duncan of
      Brown have paired on this vote for the reason of the death of a brother of the Senator from
      Tipton. The name of neither will be called. For the purpose of determining whether there is a
      quorum of the two Houses present, the Secretary of the Senate will call the roll of the
      Senate. [After the call.] Senators are all present except Duncan of Tipton and Duncan of
      Brown.
     The SPEAKER of the House: The Clerk of the House will call the roll of the House of
      Representatives. Members will answer when their names are called. [After the call.] Members of
      the House of Representatives are all present. The Clerk will read the journal of the two
      Houses in the presence of the Joint Convention.


     Senator FOWLER: I move that he reading of the journals for the House and Senate of yesterday in the presence of the Joint
      Convention, be dispensed with. 
     This motion was agreed to.
    
    
     The SIXTH BALLOT.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: The Secretary of the Senate will call the roll of
      the Senate, and as each of the Senator' name is called he will arise in his place and
      announce for whom he votes for United States Senator. [After the roll-call.] Hear the vote:
      For David Turpie 31 votes; for Benjamin Harrison 17 votes.
     The SPEAKER of the HOUSe: The Clerk of the House will call the roll of the House of
      Representatives. Each member of as his name is called will indicate the preson for whom he
      desires to vote for United States Senator.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate [after the roll-call]: Hear the vote of the House:
      For Benjamin Harrison 53 votes: for David Turpie 43 votes; for J. H. Allen 4 votes. Hear the
      vote of the Joint Convention: For Benjamin Harrison 70 votes; for David Turpie 74 votes; for
      J. H. Allen 4 votes. [The same as printed on page 141 except for the pair of the Senators
      Duncan.] There being no choice it is in order to proceed to another ballot.
     Representative GARDINER: I move that the Joint Convention adjourn till Monday.
     The SPEAKER of the House: [after putting the question]: The ayes have it. 
     The Senate retired, and ---
     When the SPEAKER called the House to order,
     The House adjourned under a previous order till Monday at 11 o'clock.

    
   
   
   
   
    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
     IN SENATE 
    
     Monday, January 24, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Hon. H. C. Smith, a Senator from the counties of Wells
     and Huntington. 


    
     THE BRANAMAN & M'DONALD CONTEST. 
     Mr. WINTER presented the proceedings of a meeting in Jackson county, at Seymour, setting
      forth that William N. McDonald has been elected to the Senate by a majority of six hundred and
      ten over Frank Eranaman; that a despotic majority in the State Senate;upon a malicious charge;
      unsupported, had removed McDonald without a hearing and seated Branaman, "a man shown,
      upon unimpeachable testimony, to be guilty of corrupting voters that the citizens deem
      McDonald still their Senator, and denounce the action of the tyrannical majority in the Senate
      as revolutionary and shameful.
      Before the Clerk had read it all--
     Mr. BAILEY moved to refer the paper to the Committee on Elections, as it
      is disrespectful in terms, and as it characterizes the action of the Senate as despotic. 
     Mr. WINTER: Every citizen has the right of addressing his Representatives on the floor of
      this Senate and his petition cannot be rejected without being heard on an objection to the
      propriety of the language of any citizen who presents a memorial.
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion: I rise to a question of order. The memorial is not respectful in
      terms, and is therefore out of order.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: It is not for the Senator from Marion (Mr. Winter) to refuse to
      introduce a petition, but if citizens choose to send in blackguardism it is the right of the
      Senate to reject it. We have no right to be blackguarded by citizens of Indiana or any other
      State. If Senators in the minority desire to set it down for some day when we can discuss it,
      they can do so; otherwise, if the point of order is insisted upon, the chair will hold that
      the communication is an indecent document and not fit to be heard.
     Mr. WINTER: It has not been read.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair has heard enough not to permit it to be read.
     Mr. HUSTON: It seems to me it will do us no harm to have this paper read.
     A Senator insisted on the point of order.
     
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Let the Senator from Fayette (Mr. Huston) who does not occupy
      much of the time of the Senate, have his say.
     Mr. HUSTON: It seems to me they have given vent to their ill-feelings possibly in the first
      part of the resolution. No one will more readily censure improper language addressed to this
      honorable body than myself, but I think it is but just that it should be read. Every
      communication sent to this Senate should be given decent and proper consideration.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: All communications have had decent and proper consideration, but
      if a communication is sent to the Senate that is indecent and improper, the chair will decide
      it out of order.
     Mr. HUSTON: I may not distinctly understand the words that give umbrage. If the reading
      clerk will read those words ----
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [interposing]: The reading clerk will fold the document up and lay
      it on the table.
     Mr. JOHNSON: I have been seeking for some time to get the eye of the Chair.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: If the Senator will step a little to one side I can see him. I
      can't see anything in that light. The chair recognizes the Senator as soon as he comes in
      order, and will be glad to recognize him upon any question.
     Mr. WINTER: The Chair directs the Secretary to lay the paper on the table---
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: It will be here at your command. You can take it back if you
      desire, or it can sleep here in the bosom of righteousness.
     Mr. WINTER: I desire ----
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [interrupting]: The question has been decided.
     Mr. WINTER: I desire to appeal from the decision of the Chair in thus disposing of that
      document.
     Mr. JOHNSON: I join in the appeal.
     Mr. FRENCH: I move to lay the appeal on the table.
     The yeas and nays were demanded, and being ordered----
     Pending the roll-call---
     Mr. CAMPBELL, in explanation of his vote, said: I think it right and proper that the
      constituents of any member from any part of the State should send a petition or remonstrance
      to this body, and I believe it ought to be read if in respectful language. Therefore I vote
      against laying the appeal on the table. I vote "no."
     Mr. GRIFFITHS, when his name was called, said: This body having passed upon the case
      referred to in that communication, and believing it misrepresents and scandalizes a majority
      of this Senate; and being willing to discuss that matter when it comes up properly, but
      believing this is not presented in the proper way, I vote to lay it on the table. I vote
      "aye."
     Mr. JOHNSON, in explanation of his vote, said: I have discovered nothing very objectionable
      in the language of the petition. If there is, it is not from any conduct of mine that it is
      before the Senate. I have never heard it read----
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [interrupting]: The Senator can read it at his leisure. How does
      the Senator vote?
     Mr. JOHNSON: I vote "no."
     Mr. SELLERS, when his name was called, said: I think every Senator can read this in the
      Indianapolis Journal. There petitioners, if they be petitioners, have taken the precaution to
      have this matter published before presenting it to the Senate. I have read it and don't
      find that it comes within the provision of the bill of rights. I therefore vote
      "aye."
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair is informed that it is twelve o'clock. This clock
      has been stopped. Wait a moment. What time is it? The Senate will form in line to go to the
      hall of the House of Representatives.
     A SENATOR: " Call the roll first."

     
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Call the roll.
      It discovered every Senator present.
      The Senate left its chamber to take ,rt in the Joint Convention to ballot for United States
      Senator.
      When the Senate returned the call of yeas and nays was resumed on laying the pending appeal
      on the table. 
     Mr. SMITH of Wells, in explanation of his vote, said : Believing every memorial should be in
      respectful language, and if not it should not be heard or read, I vote " aye." 
     Mr. WEIR, when his name was called, said : Believing in the right of petition to the fullest
      extent, and. that every communication that comes here should be read, and, if not in proper
      language, it should be returned to the petitioner with that explanation, and in this case,
      believing that other Senators are satisfied it is couched in improper language and should be
      returned to the petitioners, and for a reason and that this body is the judo of the
      qualifications of its own members, I vote "no." 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: For the same reasons the Chair declared the paper out of
      order.
     
      The vote resulted--yeas 30, nays 18. So the appeal from the decision of the Chair lies an
      the table. 
     Then came a recess till 2 1/2 o'clock.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
      ANOTHER EXTRA CLERK.
      Mr. FOWLER announced that he had appointed Miss Effie Fritts, of Gosport, Owen county, as
      clerk of the Committee on Enrolled Bills.

         of the Senate an account stated, showing the income from all sources, the expenditures,
         names of employes, salaries paid each individual connected with the University, including
         the pay drawn by Trustees. 
       
      
     
     It was adopted.

     The Senate adjourned. 
    
   
   
   
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
    
      MONDAY, January 24, 1887.
    
     The session was opened with prayer by Rev. T. E. Leight, of the German Baptist Church.
    
     A BILL FOR AN ACT WAS INTRODUCED 
      Mr. Patton [H. R. 231]: To limit railroad passenger fare to three cents per mile.
    
    
     STOCK AT LARGE.
      Mr. GARRISON called up his bill [H. R. 27] requiring constables to impound stock running at
      large, said after the second reading of the bill moved to concur in the report of the
      committee recommending its passage. 
     Mr. PATTON moved that the bill be indefinitely postponed. 
     Mr. GARRISON: Two years age a bill very similar to this was introduced and the gentleman
      from Sullivan made the same motion as he does at this time. I suppose that he is in interested
      in seeing stock running at large. The only thing sought in this bill is to enforce the law as
      it is on the statute book. With that explanation I am willing to abide the voice of the
      General Assembly. 
     Mr. GORDON: This bill allows constable for keeping animals six dollars a month. In the
      summer season they could be kept on pasture for one 
      dollar a month. Suppose an animal is kept for a year--six twelves is seventy-two--that would
      likely be more than the value of it. I do not like this bill at all, and it might as well
      disposed of now as at any time. I believe as long as the people are willing stock shall run at
      large they ought to be allowed to do so. I think that this would be a very oppressive law. 
     Mr. WHITE: I am in favor of this bill. One of the strongest points that can make in its
      favor is the objection made by the gentleman from Putnam (Mr. Gordon.) One of the great of
      legislation, in this State is the passage of laws that are never executed. If a law is right,
      if it is a necessity, or if it is beneficial to the people, it ought to be enforced ; and a
      law that ought not to be enforced ought not to be permitted to remain on the statute book. For
      the reason that no one will see that the law is enforced, and stock is allowed to run at.
      large, there should be some method provided by the law to enforce it. The running of stock in
      the highways a nuisance to the persons that travel on it, and it is for the protection of the
      highways in the State and the persons who travel on them this law is desired. If this law is
      right it should be enforced, and if means are provided for its enforcement it shall have my
      endorsement. I am in favor of it.
     Ir. PATTON : I do not understand how any body-could be in favor of this bill. The gentleman
      from Johnson (Mr, White) has pretended to give a season in the protection of highways end the
      people who travel over them. .he farmer is the one who is to be b tided b stock running at,
      large. xt that does not. cut any figure in ooutte where stock is not allowed to run at large.
      In my county stock not allowed to run at large, and if at 'y 'time a storm breaks
      down E -, fences and" stock gets out, the owner will be compelled to pay , The'
      SPEAKER [interposing]: The bxess of the House oRepresenta- 'fires will be suspended for
      the purpose of a Joint Convention for the election of a United States senator.
    
    
      THE JOINT CONVENTION.
      Senators took their seats in the Hall. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: The pair heretofore existing between the Senator
      from Tipton (Mr. Duncan), and the Senator from Brown (Mr. Duncan) is declared off. Both
      Senators are present. The Speaker of the House will arrange pairs in the House of
      Representatives. For the purpose of determining whether there is a quorum of both Houses
      present the Secretary of the Senate will call the roll of Senate. [After the call. ] Senators
      are all present. 
     The SPEAKER of the House: The Clerk of the House will call---
      Representative JEWETT [interrupting]: Before the roll is called will the Speaker announce
      that pair? 
     The SPEAKER of the House: The gentleman from Tippecanoe, Mr. Osborn, is paired with the
      gentleman from Monroe, Mr. Worrall. The gentleman from Tippecanoe is present. Mr. Worrall is
      detained at home by sickness; therefore the names of Mr. Osborn and Mr. Worrall will not be
      called. The Clerk will call the roll. [After the roll-call.] Members of the House are all
      present except Mr. Worrall who is paired with Mr. Osborn. The first thing in order is the
      reading of the journal of Saturday in Joint Convention. 
     Sentor FRENCH: I move that the reading of the journal be dispensed with. 
     The motion was agreed to.
      The SPEAKER of the House: The next thing in order is to proceed to the election of a United
      States Senator.
    
    
     THE SEVENTH BALLOT.
      The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: The Secretary of the Senate will call the roll of
      the Senate, and as each Senator's name is called he will arise in his place and announce
      for whom he, votes for United States Senator. [After the roll-call] Hear the vote: for David
      Turpie 32; for Benjamin Harrison 18.
     

     The SEAKER of the House: Th Clerk will call the roll of the House. Each member as his name
      is called will rise in his place and designate the person for whom h will vote. 
     Th PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: Hear the vote of the House: for Benjamin Harrison 53
      votes; for Davie Turpie 42 votes: for J. H. Allen 4 votes. Hear the vote Joint Convention: for
      David Turpie 74 votes; for Benjamin Harrison 70; for J. H. Allen 4 votes. There being no
      choice it is in order to proceed to another ballot.
     Representative HARLEY: I move that the Convention adjourn. 
     The SPEAKER of the HOUSE [after putting the question]: The ayes have it.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: Senators will return to this chamber.
     The SPEAKER called the House to order.
     Then came a recess for dinner.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     STOCK AT LARGE.
      Mr. PATTON, resuming his remarks interrupted by the Joint Convention said: I think this is
      an important measure. I apprehend that there is no other bill that has been presented before
      this House that will command the attention of the people of the State of Indiana more strongly
      than this question, which has agitated the people of Indiana for many years. We have been
      legislating year by year on this question. Every man is compelled to take care of his own
      stock, which is just and right. If they trespass he is responsible for the damage done. The
      bill seeks to amend the law already in force and put the power in the constable's hands
      and take it out of the people's hands. It is a conflict between the widow woman and her
      cow, and the officer. Now if stock trespass on me I have the right to take them up or let them
      trespass. That is a better law than to give the constable in each township and take up stock.
      I know how it is. In my own county we have what is called the stock law. The town council hare
      enacted a law to carry out exactly the provisions of this bill. The to the constable the power
      to carry it out, and the office of constable is worth more than the office of sheriff of the
      county. We cannot stand it and we won't stand it. It is unjust. 
     Mr. BUCKLES : I do not know who is the author of this bill. I suppose he, is inclined to
      protect the interests of the farmer. The proper way for a Legislature to act is to asks first,
      whether there is an evil to remedy; and second, whether the remedy suggested will properly
      answer the purpose? The addition this bil makes to the law is this: It provides that the
      constable of a township, having notice, that stock is running at large in violation of the
      law, is to take the Stock up and impound it. It is said of the present law that it is good
      enough. In answer to the gentleman from Sullivan (Mr. Patton) I want to say that the constable
      has no right to take up an animal until he knows that animal is running at large with the
      owner's consent, and he must show it. The man who in violation of law turns his stock on
      hie neighbor's pasture ought to lose something. That is what penalties are for;--to make
      people obey the law. 
     Mr. LINCK : There is simply, one point in this bill, and that is whether we will put this
      matter of impounding animals into the hands of constables or leave it in the hands of the
      farmers. There were a few matters that I had intended to refer to, but they have been spoken
      of by the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Buckles.) But there is one thing which I wish to call
      attention to, and that is the enormous expense of keeping fences. In the year 1879 for
      building new fences and repairing old ones more than forty thousand dollars were expended in
      Sullivan county alone, and I imagine that is not the most expensive county. The average is in
      the neighborhood of fifty thousand dollars. Now the question is, whether we will sustain this
      stock  law and compel every one to keep up own stock?
      There is just one post in this bill and that is this, whether the farmers shall be compelled
      to take up stock, or whether the cars shall do it. I think that the officers should do it, for
      several reasons. I believe it is the duty of the State to protect the citizens against such
      encroachment. A great deal of this stock that runs at large belongs men who are not good
      citizens, and he farmer who takes up their stock is liable to have his barn burned. I may this
      is one of the best propositions that has come before this House. I am sorry that the able
      gentleman (Mr. Garrison) who got up this bill did not take up the whole matter. But this is
      better than the law now on the statute books. 
     Mr. KELLISON: I believe that this question has been discussed to as great an extent as is
      profitable at this time, therefore I move to lay, the motion of the gentleman from Sullivan
      (Mr. Patton) on the table.
     The motion was agreed to. 
     On motion by Mr. PEASLEY, the bill was recommitted to the Committee on
       Agriculture, with instructions to report at ten o'clock next Tuesday. 
    
    
     BILLS FOR ACTS WERE INTRODUCED BY
      Mr. Foley [H. R. 232]: To appropriate $562.27 to pay the claim of Levi R. Green for hose,
      etc., for hospitals for insane. 
     Mr. Fleece [H. R. 233]: To appropriate $3,500 to build an addition to the chapel at the
      Reform School and furnish the same.
    
    
     WORK ON HIGHWAYS.
      The Committee on Roads reported in favor of the passage of Mr.
      Catey's bill [H. R. 57] concerning work on highways and exempting Union soldiers and
      sailors, with an amendment compelling labor to be performed on the roads. 
     Mr. PLEASANTS moved to recommit the bill to the Committee on Roads, with
      instructions to amend so not compel labor on the roads, but to improve the roads by taxation. 
     Mr. GARRISON: I believe that it is the duty as well as the privilege and desire of every
      citizen of Indiana to show all due respect and courtesy the soldiers of the late war. I
      believe, sir, that such respect has been shown on all proper occasions, but I do not think
      that it is a matter of courtesy to the Union soldiers to concur in this amendment. I cannot
      see any good reason why the soldier under fifty years of age should be exempted from, his part
      of the labor on the highway, 
     Mr. IBACH: I am opposed to the amendment because I am opposed to the law compelling any
      gentleman to work out his tax on the highway. 
     Mr. PLEASANTS : I think a little reflection will satisfy any one that the present system is
      unjust. There is a large body of citizens who have no interest in keeping up these roads, and
      under this system they are compelled to do the work. These roads are kept up for the benefit
      of the men who own the land, and the men who own the land should bear the expenses of keeping
      up these roads. 
     Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Owen : Nine out of ten in my part of the State were opposed to a former
      law for working the roads by taxation, and I think it would be wrong now to pass another law
      similar to that. The poor men in my part of the country are in favor of working a certain part
      of this on the road, and the law not compel any one to work on the roads. I think such an
      amendment would be wrong. 
     Mr. FOSTER: As has been said it is not only the men who own land that derive benefit from
      the roads. In many cases they do not own a foot of, land, such as teamsters, livery men,
      bankers and men of various other description who travel over the highways. Therefore I am
      opposed to this amendment. 
     Mr. FOLEY: I am opposed to making those work the roads who have no horses and pay as much as
      those who have. I think it should be done by taxation, but when men are compelled to go out
      just like drafting them, they make very poor workmen and do not do half a day's word, but
      they lose their time. 
     Mr. GARRISON: I am in favor of the adoption of this amendment.
     

     Mr. HOBSON: I think the men in our county felt relieved when the road law was passed. I am a
      farmer, myself and never saw a day when I could go and work the roads without loss.
     Mr. KELLY, of Boone: Being a farmer and knowing something about working the roads, as far as
      my experience goes, the superintendent of the roads will not give men work on the roads unless
      they give him full satisfaction that they will do a good day's work. For that reason, in
      behalf of the farmers, I do not think it would be right and proper to set a tax on those poor
      people. Therefore in behalf of the farmers and poor people, I am opposed to the measure. 
     Mr. VAN SLYKE : It is a very great benefit to a great many of the farming community to have
      the privilege of working out a portion of their taxes on the roads. They who sneak out will
      not be apt to pay the superintendent for doing the work. The man who is paid one dollar and
      twenty-five cents a day is not likely to shovel any more dirt than the farmer who goes out and
      works a day and calls it so much tax money paid. I am opposed to making men pay money and
      having the superintendent employ somebody to work the road. 
     Mr. PARKER : I come from a county where the chief wealth is in agricultural products. In
      recent years they have been heavily taxed for gravel roads and large drains, and I feel that
      imposing a tax an them to up the roads would be a great injustice. I do not believe it is a
      benefit to the poor class of persons whose condition the gentleman who introduced the bill
      would relieve. These poor people will be compelled to pay their taxes instead of working out
      the tax. 
     Mr FLEECE : Young men use the roads and it appears to me that they should put in two or
      three days in working out their taxes. Then the teamsters, they use and tear up the roads more
      than any other close of men in the country. They are frequently men who have no property at
      all, and they are willing to work two or three days in order to hays good roads. There is no
      demand on the part of that class of people to have this amendment and they do not ask anything
      of this kind, for they do not want to be exempted. 
     Mr. IBACH : We are getting away from the question under discussion. It is not a question
      whether a person will be permitted to work out any part of his tax, but whether we should warn
      out people to work on the roads. There are nine out of every ten the cities, towns and
      villages who are unable to spare time to work them, and who receive no benefit whatever from
      the highways. Whether, it right that that class of people should be warned out upon the
      highways is the question. They need every hour and every dollar that they can earn for the
      benefit of their families. It only reaches the honest men. They will go and work upon the
      highways when they are warned out. Why have a law upon our books that we can't enforce
      and will not enforce? 
     Mr. MILLER: There is not a per, son living in the State but receives benefit from the public
      roads of our country. How could they get their provisions, how could they get their coal even,
      how could they get their wood if it was not for the roads? There may be some who object to it
      but there is not a young man in our county that would even object to working on the roads.
      They are constantly on the roads going from one place to another, to all kinds of meetings,
      and they will be ashamed such a law as this is passed., I consider it would be one of the most
      unpopular laws that we could pass. 
     Mr. NOLIN: I have but little sympathy with the young man who is not willing to work on the
      roads. If he is not willing to contribute that much he should be kicked out of the community,
      where he lives. I believe that we cannot do a better thing than to leave the law just as it
      is. 
     Mr. METZGER: The time of year that we usually work on the roads one of the busiest on the
      farm. I am in favor of taxing the people and have a man see that the roads are worked, and I think that the people of my county will support me in
      so voting.
     Mr. FOSTER made an ineffectual motion to lay the amendment (Mr. Pleasants') on the
      table.
     It was rejected.
     On motion by Mr. JEWETT, the enacting clause was stricken from the bill.
    
    
     AN EXTRA PAGE.
     On motion by Mr. KERCHEVAL, Willie Reed was granted pay for services as a page while not
      regularly appointed.
     And then the House adjourned.

     M'DONALD AND BRANAMAN CONTEST. 
     Mr. DRESSER, in behalf of a minority of the Committee on Elections,

         In the matter of the contested election case of Frank Branaman against William N,
         McDonald for a seat in the Indiana State Senate.
         The undersigned minority of your committee to whom was referred the papers and evidence
         relating to the contested election case of Frank Branaman vs. William N. McDonald for a
         seat as Senator in your honorable body from the counties of Jackson and Lawrence, beg leave
         to submit a minority report herewith in said case: 
        1. The undersigned minority, members of Committee on Elections, show
         to your honorable body that they have carefully examined all the testimony taken and
         produced in said case; that the charges against William N. McDonald, the contestee in said
         case, to the effect that he had used or offered to use money corruptly to secure his
         election as Senator, are not sustained in any particular; that no witness testified in the
         case that Mr. McDonald had at any time or place given money to anyone to be used to secure
         his election; nor is there a sentence of testimony in all the record showing, or tending to
         show, that anyone was influenced by money, expended by Mr. McDonald, or by anyone else with
         his consent, or that anyone worked for him or voted for him directly or indirectly who
         received money from Mr. McDonald or his supporters. The two witnesses, namely, Richard
         Madden and John B. Able, who testified that Mr. McDonald had given them fifty dollars ($50)
         each the day before the election, both testified that Mr. McDonald had never asked them to
         work or vote for him, and they also testified that they had worked and voted for Frank
         Branaman, the contestor. One Frank Fassold, who was elected as County Commissioner in
         Jackson county on the second clay of November, 1886, being the only Republican who has been
         elected as Commissioner in that county, as the evidence shows, for nearly forty years, and
         who was unquestionably elected by the aid of the votes of Democrats on account of his
         well-known character for honesty, testified that be was acquainted, with the general
         character of Richard Madden and John B. Able for truth and veracity, and that the same was
         each bad, and no evidence was offered by the contestor in rebuttal of such testimony.
         Another witness on behalf of the contestor, William Champion, testified that prior to the
         day of the election he asked William N. McDonald to loan him five or six dollars and that
         McDonald did so, but that nothing was said by Mr. McDonald or him at the time about the
         election, or about votes for Mr. McDonald. The witness further testified that he had both
         worked and voted for Frank Branaman, The only other witness who testified as to having
         received money from Mr. McDonald was William McClellan, who testified that Mr. McDonald had
         loaned him six dollars; that he was needing a small amount of money, and that Mr. McDonald
         loaned it to him, but that nothing was said at the time about his voting or working for
         McDonald; upon the contrary he testified that he had voted and worked for Frank Branaman,
         and that be bad borrowed money from Mr. McDonald before that time. Such is in substance the
           testimony upon which the majority of the committee
         has recommended the unseating of Mr. McDonald. 
        The action of the majority of the committee, in the opinion of the undersigned minority.,
         does great injustice to Senator McDonald, as it is nowhere shown in the testimony that Mr.
         McDonald, directly or indirectly, by himself or through another, used any money corruptly,
         or with the intent or purpose of influencing anyone to vote or work for him, and the
         assumption on the part of the majority of the committee that money loaned by Mr. McDonald
         to persons in need, when there was no conversation or understanding at the time, or before
         the money was loaned, or any understanding subsequently that it was for the purpose of
         influencing anyone to vote or work for Mr. McDonald, is unwarranted and without precedent
         in the annals of con tested election cases. To presume guilt in criminal practice or fraud
         in civil is reversing all of the well-known and long-established rules of law, but such, in
         the opinion of the minority of your committee, is the effect of the report of the majority,
         and. they can conceive of no emergency or condition of affairs, political or otherwise,
         which justifies such report.
         Notwithstanding such is the testimony upon which the majority of your committee
         recommend that McDonald be unseated, they, in the face of the six hundred and ten majority
         by which McDonald was elected as Senator from Jackson and Lawrence counties, as conceded by
         Branaman, and as shown by the returns, and without any proof whatever tending to reduce the
         majority for McDonald or showing that Branaman was entitled to more votes than were counted
         for him, recommend that Branaman be seated in McDonald's stead.
         Branaman in his notice of contest, seeks to contest the seat of McDonald as an elector,
         and not as a defeated candidate seeking or claiming the seat; in his notice he does not
         claim or pretend to claim that he is entitled to the seat; upon the contrary he conceded
         before the committee, through his counsel, that when this contest was originally
         commenced,it was simply to inquire into the methods by which McDonald was elected, and not
         to secure the seat himself. There is no evidence whatever tending to show that anyone voted
         illegally for McDonald, or that anyone voted for him otherwise than voluntarily, or that
         there were more votes cast and counted for him than he was entitled to; nor is there any
         testimony whatever tending to show that Branaman was entitled to have more votes counted
         for him than were counted. There is no proof whatever that any money was used by Mr.
         McDonald or his supporters in any way in Lawrence county. Jackson county usually gives from
         ten to twelve hundred Democratic majority, and all the election machinery in Jackson county
         was therefore in the hands of the Democrats. The only and sole ground upon which the
         majority of your committee recommend that Branaman be seated, was that prior to end on the
         day of the election, it was publicly rumored n Jackson county that McDonald was using large
         sums of money to secure his election; and in support of such rumor, although not contained
         in the notice of contest, and over the objection of McDonald, Branaman introduced as a
         witness one Herman Bruning, of Seymour, for many years a saloon-keeper of that city, and a
         Democrat, who testified that although he was only in Seymour and Browstown during the
         campaign, it was publicly rumored all over Jackson county that McDonald was using large
         sums of money to secure his election that he talked with people from all parts of Jackson
         county, and they spoke of the rumors that McDonald was so using money. Branaman testified
         in his own behalf that such was the public rumor in Jackson county, and that he had made
         two speeches in each township in Jackson county during the campaign, and that in each and
         every speech he had warned the people about the use of money by McDonald to secure his
         election, and the inference is that if Branaman that he and he alone is responsible for the
         origin of such rumor, and especially is the minority of your committee led to his
         conclusion, when there is no proof whatever that such rumor was true. 
        McDonald, in his behalf, introduced as witnesses Hamlin Smith, of Brownstown, who
         testified as follows: 
        Q. What connection if any had you with the campaign last fall?
        A. I was the chairman of the Republican central committee of the county.
        Q. Jackson county?
        A. Yes, sir.
        Q. What time was you elected as such chairman?
        A. I think it was in February of March.
        Q. Then you were its chairman during its entire political campaign?
        A. Yes, sir.
        Q. I will ask you to state if you was pretty generally over the county?
        A. I was.
        Q. When did the campaign open down there?
        A. About the middle of September.
        Q. Between that time and the second of November, the day of the election, were you over
         the county pretty generally?
        A. I was.

        Q. I will ask you to state what rumor, if any, you heard in any part of the county
         concerning the use of money by Mr. McDonald to secure his election?
        A. I never heard of any at all.
        Wilbur C. Benton of Brownstone, Daniel Bedel of Crothersville, William Bennett of Salt
         Creek township, W. P. Stewart, a Democrat of Seymour, Frank Fassold of Brownstown, County
         Commissioners-elect, all testified that there was no such public rumor in Jackson county,
         and that they have never heard of such rumor in any part of said county, and that they
         never heard of Mr. McDonald or any one else using money to secure his election. McDonald
         offered to prove by these same witnesses before the committee that Branaman had used at
         least five thou  sand dollars ($5,000) to secure his
         election and that is was publicly rumored in Jackson county that he did use money corruptly
         to secure his election, but the majority of your committee sustained the action of Mr.
         Branaman and would not allow the witnesses to testify on that point. The majority of your
         committee would not allow Mr. McDonald to introduce any testimony before the committee
         whatever showing the use of money by Branaman to secure his election. .Your committee
         further show and report that at the time of taking the testimony before the two Justices of
         the Peace in Jackson county pursuant to the Statute, on behalf of Branaman and after he had
         concluded the taking of testimony in his own behalf, McDonald asked the Justices of the
         Peace to issue a subpoena for certain witnesses in his behalf, but the Justices of the
         Peace declined to issue such subpoena, and that at the request of McDonald indorsed their
         refusal upon the subpoena tendered to them for issuance.In consequence of their refusal to
         issue such subpoena, McDonald was compelled to and did, to secure testimony in his own
         behalf, serve notice on Branaman, that he would take depositions in the case before a
         Notary Public; and at the time fixed for taking testimony, Branaman appeared in person and
         by counsel, and was present in person or by counsel during the taking of the testimony
         before the Notary, as appears in the record. The testimony thus taken was read before the
         committee but rejected by the majority of your committee, and not referred to in their
         reports upon the ground that the testimony sought to show the corrupt use of money by
         Branaman to secure his election and was not therefore admissible. Not withstanding the
         rejection of the testimony aforesaid, the minority of said committee, believing that it is
         a well settled rule of law that in a contested election case like this all the testimony,
         pro and con, should be received and acted upon, beg leave to report that they have
         considered such testimony as pertinent in this case, as it affects the right of Branaman to
         occupy a seat as Senator. The testimony is substantially as follows: [Here was printed the
         testimony of seventeen or eighteen witnesses, making between twenty and thirty pages of
         printed matter.] Such was the character of the testimony taked by Mr. McDonald, but which
         was rejected by the majority of the committee for the reason that it tended to prove that
         Branaman ha dused money corruptly to secure his election, and yet the committee was
         considering not only the question of unseating McDonald, but also the question of seating
         Branaman in his place, and the minority of your committee are of the opinion that such
         testimony was competent and abundantly sufficient to prevent the Senate from seating
         Branaman; and especially is the minority of your committee of that opinion since Branaman
         at no time denied the truth of the evidence offered against him, although he went upon the
         witness stand before the committee, where he had an opportunity of denying the. corrupt use
         of money to secure his election, but did not do so; nor did he offer to testify concerning
         the use of money by him in any way. The majority of your committee recommended the
         unseating of McDonald and the seating of Branaman upon the ground, and that alone, that
         McDonald had used or offered to use money to secure his election, and that such use of
         money was. publicly known in Jackson county. The corrupt use of money by a candidate to
         secure his election to an office disqualifies him from holding the office, but it does not
         thereby render him ineligible to the office; yet the majority of your committee acted upon
         the assumption that the use of money corruptly, when that fact was publicly known, rendered
         McDonald ineligible and thereby entitled Branaman, who received the next highest number of
         votes, to take his place in the Senate. In the case of Gulick vs. New, 14th Ind. p. 93, the
         Supreme Court held that when a majority of the ballots at an election were cast for a
         person, not eligible to the office under the Constitution, that such ballots were
         ineffectual, and that the person receiving the greatest number of legal votes, though not a
         majority of the ballots, was elected and entitled to the office. But this is a case where a
         judicial officer was elected to the office of Sheriff before the expiration of the term for
         which he had been elected to such judicial office, and, under the Constitution, is
         therefore ineligible to hold any other thana judicial office during the term to which he
         was elected to such judicial office; but such is not the case here for Mr. McDonald was
         eligible to hold the office of Senator, and was eligible to be voted for at said election,
         and if the report of the majority of your committee as to the corrupt use of money by him
         to secure his election were true, it would simply go to his disqualification to hold the
         office and not to his eligibility to the office, and therefore Brapaman would not be,
         entitled to a seat on the Senate. Again, in the case of the State ex. rel. Morley vs.
         Johnson et al., 100 Ind., p. 489, it was held that where a township trustee had held office
         two consecutive terms, he was not eligible to re-election to succeed himself for a third
         term, for the reason that the statute limits his holding of such office at two consecutive
         terms, and if be sought re-election a third term to succeed himself he was ineligible not
         to hold the office, but ineligible to election, and that votes thus cast for him would not
         be counted against an eligible candidate, as the public were chargeable with his
         ineligibility. Here again the question was not that be had disqualified himself from
         holding the office, but that he was ineligible to election. Such is the law in this State,
         and perhaps in this State alone, but no authority can, be found anywhere to the effect that
         where one disqualifies himself from holding office, by the use of money to secure his
         election, that the next one receiving the highest number of votes is entitled to the
         office. It will thus be seen that votes cast for an ineligible candidate, or rather a
         candidate  who is ineligible to election, are not
         counted; but such is not the case when one is eligible to the office, as McDonald clearly
         but disqualifies himself from holding the office, merely, as reported by the majority of
         the committee. Such a procedure a novel and unwarranted way of electing members to the
         General Assembly, and can not be sustained by any authority from any tribunal, judicial, or
         otherwise, save and except the Senate of Indiana. 
        Again, there was no evidence before the committee tending to show what number of votes
         were cast for Branaman, nor was there any evidence whatever before the committee showing
         that Branaman had received any votes, except those who testified as witnesses in the case,
         and the majority of them testified that they voted for Branaman through the influence of
         money. There is, therefore, no evidence in the case showing or tending to show that
         Branaman received the next highest number of votes, or that he is entitled to
         McDonald's seat in case he should be unseated, upon the ground of having received the
         next highest number of votes, and it is a mystery to the minority of your committee how it
         was ascertained that any votes were returned and canvassed for Branaman, as it is not even
         shown in the notice of contest that Branaman received any votes, and, therefore, for that
         reason is not entitled to the seat, even if McDonald should be unseated. Your committee,
         after a careful examination of all the testimony in the case, are of the opinion that
         McDonald is clearly entitled to retain his seat; that he has not disqualified himself from
         holding the office of Senator(if the position of Senator be an office,) and that he was
         eligible to election. Your committee, therefore, recommend the adoption of the following
         resolution: 
        
        
        
         
          
           Resolved, That William N. McDonald, Senator elected from the counties of Jackson and
            Lawrence to the present General Assembly of Indiana, was eligible to election as such
            Senator, and that he has not disqualified himself from holding such office by the use of
            money or otherwise to secure his election, and that he is entitled to retain his seat as
            such Senator in this General Assembly. 
          
         
        
        Inasmuch as the report of the majority of the committee was acted upon be ore the
         minority report was reported to the Senate and Mr. McDonald unseated and Mr. Branaman
         seated, the minority of your committee, while believing that there was no evidence,
         whatever tending to disqualify McDonald from holding the office of Senator, yet having been
         unseated, the minority of your committee are clearly of the opinion that it was
         unconstitutional and in violation of law to seat Branaman in his stead, and protesting
         against that mode of electing a Senator, we recommend the adoption of the following
         resolution: 
        
        
        
         
          
           Resolved, That Frank Branaman is not entitled to a seat in the Senate as Senator from
            Jackson and Lawrence counties for the reason that he has disqualified himself from
            holding such office by reason of the corrupt and unlawful use of money, by himself and
            through his supporters, in trying to secure his election as such Senator; and that, for
            that reason, he should be unseated and the office of Senator from Jackson and Lawrence
            counties be, and the same is, hereby declared vacant. 
          
         
        
        J. M. DRESSER,
         GEO. MOON,
         R. B. SEARS. 
       
      
     
     Mr. DRESSER moved the adoption of the report and accompanying resolutions, and stated a
      desire to be heard in support of his motion. 
     Mr. GRIFITH moved the report be made a special order for Thursday week, at 2 o'clock
      p.m.
      Mr. HUSTON raised the point of order that the latter motion was out of order, the Chair
      having not stated the former motion.
     The Chair stated the question.
     Mr. HUSTON: I raise an additional point of order. Can a question be seconded or amended
      until the President as stated it? I think it cannot. 
     Mr. GRIFFITH: The question having now been stated, I now ask to make the motion. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The question is on the motion of the Senator from Switzerland
      (Mr. Griffith.)
     Mr.HUSTON: I asked in most respectful terms that the point of order I raised shall be
      determined before the Senate takes additional action. My position is: The Senator from
      Tippecanoe (Mr. Dresser) moved the adoption of the last resolution read, and stated that he
      desired to be heard upon that resolution. The Chair had not stated the motion when the Senator
      from Switzerland (Mr. Griffith) moved to fix the time for its consideration next Thursday. The
      point of order I raise is, in the first place, the motion for the adoption of the resolution
      had not been seconded, and could not be until it was in possession of the House, and
      consequently could not be amended; and, again, that the Senator from Tippecanoe announced his
      desire to be heard on the resolution at the time his motion was made, and had not yielded the
      floor.
     Mr. DRESSER: Mr. President---
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Wait a moment. The chair does not regard the formal stating of
      the mo  tion as of much importance, as the two Senators
      took the floor about the same time; but after the chair stated the first motion the Senator
      from Switzerland renewed his motion. 
     Several SENATORS addressed the Chair .
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Proceed in order, gentlemen. You shall all be heard. There shall
      be nobody hurt. 
     Mr. WINTER: The Senator from Tippecanoe (Mr. Dresser) had the floor and stated that when the
      Chair had stated his motion to the Senate he would still retain the floor. He did not yield
      the floor. And I also insist upon the other point of order made by the Senator from Fayette
      (Mr. Huston) that until the Senator from Tippecanoe had yielded the floor no other motion
      could be made, and therefore the motion of the Senator from Switzerland (Mr. Griffith) is out
      of order. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Does the Senator say that until a Senator yields the floor no
      other motion can be, made? 
     Mr. WINTER: Yes, sir, if speaking is in order.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: He was not speaking. The motion of the Senator from Switzerland
      was made before the Senator from Tippecanoe stated he desired to have the floor. If the
      Senator from Tippecanoe (Mr. Dresser) desires the floor for the purpose of making a speech
      upon this report and resolution the chair will grant it to him. Proceed with your speech. The
      Senator from Switzerland will be recognized after your spate is done. 
      Mr. DRESSER: Unless we can go into a discussion of this matter at this time I don't
      know that I desire to make a speech. It will be remembered by the Senate that a few days ago
      the Committee on Elections made a report unseating Senator McDonald, who
      had been elected by a majority of six hundred and ten votes from the the district of Jackson
      and Lawrence; and that under the operations of the previous question a resolution unseating
      him was passed without giving the minority an opportunity to state the evidence which had been
      taken upon the question. We then stated that we desired before that question was submitted to
      the Senate, to have an opportunity to present Senator McDonald's case, to the Senate,
      believing that Mr. McDonald was entitled to the seat as Senator from that district. As soon as
      the testimony could be prepared by the stenographer the minority prepared a report, and it is
      now before the Senate. We think, in all candor and fairness, that McDonald was and is entitled
      to his seat, and that the seating of another person was wrong; and the minority insist that
      the testimony shows clearly that Mr. Branaman, under no consideration, is entitled to a seat
      in this Senate. The only evidence that he received any votes comes from those who testify they
      were bought to vote for him. There is nothing before this Senate, no certificate from the
      clerk of any court, or from any other officer to the effect even that Mr. Branaman was voted
      for at any election. The only way is for the Senate to assumes he was a candidate, and upon
      that assumption assume that he did receive votes. There is not one iota of testimony to show
      that he was voted for at that election, except that which comes from those who state that they
      received money for it; and if one part of this testimony is to be taken, the other the part
      must also be taken--that he paid money for his votes, and is, thereby disqualified from
      holding office. The minority feel that great injustice has been done Mr. McDonald. He has been
      sent out before the world as a briber, when there is nothing to show that he used money
      corruptly to secure his election. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair desires to state with reference to the point of order
      made by Senator Winter, that the motion of the Senator from Tippecanoe was subject to an
      amendment to set this discussion for a particular day and make it a special order. There is no
      question better settled than that a motion to amend naturally has precedence of a motion to
      adopt.
     
      Mr. GRIFFITH: I move that further discussion be made a special order for next Thursday week
      at two o'clock.
      Mr. DeMOTTE: I desire to amend the amendment so as to allow two hours for discussion at
      that time, to be equally divided--one hour on each side. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: I suppose there will be no objection to that. 
     Mr. JOHNSON: I oppose the amendment and the amendment to the amendment. I don't see any
      need of postponing this matter for so long a time. A much shorter time would give opportunity
      for every member to prepare himself. If this Senate, without hearing any argument, and without
      any report thereon except the majority report, is qualified, under the operations of the
      previous question to unseat Mr. McDonald and to seat Mr. Branaman, surely it will not require
      ten or twelve days' time to prepare for the discussion of this question when both the
      majority and minority reports of the committee are before them. If this gentleman is not
      entitled to the seat he ought not to be permitted to retain it. Every hour he is upon this
      floor is an outrage upon the rights of the people. If he is elected it is right and just to
      him that the legality of his election should be settled. 
     The, PRESIDENT pro tempore [interrupting]: Will the Senator---
     Mr. JOHNSON [continuing]: I am opposed to postponing this subject for so great a length of
      time. It does seem to me this question can be intelligently discussed at a much earlier period
      than proposed. 
     Mr. DeMOTTE: I ask permission to modify my motion. I would move that this matter be
      discussed on Thursday of this week, at the hour named, and that two hours be allowed therefor.
      I so amend my motion. 
     Mr. JOHNSON: I don't object to that. I am desirous that sufficient time be allowed for
      an examination of the law and the facts, so that the question may be finally settled. 
     Mr. HUSTON: I dislike greatly to take a position in opposition to any colleagues on this
      floor; but for one I hope neither the amendment nor the original motion will prevail. I
      believe it is a right and privilege of the minority, on this floor to demand, or at least to
      ask the immediate consideration of this report. It will be remembered by all present the other
      day when the majority report was presented, that no discussion was had upon it at all. I said
      then, and I believe it to be true, as I believe yet,that political exigency demanded hasty
      action. A United States Senator is to be elected. It is then a question of the highest
      importance whether Mr. Branaman is entitled to a seat upon this floor or not. I for one,
      believe that, Senator McDonald was entitled to his seat, and I believe that he was honestly
      elected, and I believe he has done nothing to disqualify him from holding his place as a
      member of this Senate. On the other hand Mr. Branaman has no right whatever upon the floor of
      this Senate, and consequently no right to vote for United States, Senator. Believing that to
      be they case, it is then certainly my duty to demand a consideration of this report at this
      time. The majority report was acted upon without discussion; there can certainly be no,
      greater reason why this report cannot be acted upon. If the majority on this floor, having the
      voting power sufficient to crush the minority out of existence, is afraid for the people of
      this State, to know why such action is taken, then let the white flag be run up. 
     Mr. FOWLER [interposing]: Are you in favor of acting upon this report without discussion? 
     Mr. HUSTON: The Senate has as good reason for acting on this report under the previous
      question as they had on the report unseating Senator McDonald. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [interrupting]: Why not move the previous question? 
     Mr. HUSTON: Because it is not a } true and fair way to favor the gag, law under any
      circumstances.
     
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [interrupting]: At the suggestion of the Senator from Fayette (Mr.
      Huston) the chair will entertain a motion for the previous question on this. 
     Mr. HUSTON : I do not believe in it nor approve of it, and didn't approve of it the
      other day. When the motion for the previous question was made the other day, it was with the
      understanding that the report of the majority was simply to be read, and on the next morning
      the minority would have ample opportunity to introduce its report before any action would be
      taken upon the majority report. As far as fairness is concerned, the Republican minority upon
      this floor can stand upon its record. It is for the other side to say whether it is satisfied
      with its own record or not. In my judgment they cannot justify themselves in the arbitrary
      manner in which they disposed of the McDonald contested election case. I can see no reason why
      this discussion should be deferred until Thursday or why it should be deferred one hour. I am
      ready now to go into the discussion of this question, and I am not afraid for the people of
      Indiana to know what position the Republican minority on this floor has taken. I am not afraid
      to have this report thoroughly discussed. I want these reports carefully considered, the
      points clearly stated and then let each Senator act as his conscience dictates. I believe
      there are men here who, if you could satisfy them that Mr. Branaman is not entitled to his
      seat, would not consent to send a United States Senator to Congress if that one vote would
      elect him. At least I want the attempt made. I want them to understand distinctly what is
      being done. The proposition now is to consider these reports. No discussion has been had, and
      the result is that en .tors voted as they were asked to vote on the majority report alone. I
      sincerely hope that fairness, at least, will be conceded to the minority upon this floor and
      that thirty-two men will act fair in meeting eighteen men. 
     Mr. BAILEY: I move that the Senator's speech be printed and a copy placed on the desk
      of each member of the House of Representatives. 
     Mr. JOHNSON: It will be found to be one of the best speeches made before the Senate this
      session. 
     Mr. HUSTON : I would like all his (Mr. Bailey's) remarks and the conversations he had
      with the Committee on Elections during the pendency of the
      McDonald-Branaman contest, made part of it. 
     Mr. JOHNSON: I object to that. There are certain facts about that a which will not bear the
      light.

        NAYS. Andrew, Bailey, Barrett, Branaman, Bryant, Cox, Duncan (of Brown,) Fowler, French,
         Griffith, Hale, Howard (of Decatur), Howard (of St. Joseph), Logsdon, McClure, McDonald,

         Trippet, Urmoston, Zimmerman, Mr. President. 30.
       
      
     
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The question now is on the amendment to the original proposition
      that the report of the committee be made a special order for Thursday week at two
      o'clock. 
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I desire to offer my amendment as to time. I understand that is accepted. 
     Mr. GRIFFITH: I accept it. 
     Mr. WINTER: There are members who desire to vote in opposition to retaining as a Senator
      here a person who is not entitled to his seat. It seems to me no greater outrage could be
      perpetrated upon the people of State, and especially upon the people of Lawrence and Jackson
      counties, than to retain upon the floor of this Senate a man who is not rightly their
      representative, or to retain him one moment beyond the time when the question as to his right
      can be passed  upon. If there is any right that ought to
      be sacred, it is the right that the people shall not be misrepresented. That the people of a
      district should be misrepresented upon the floor of this Senate by a person who has not been
      elected, but who has been repudiated by them by a majority of six hundred and ten, is an
      intolerable outrage. Yet he is to-day occupying a seat upon the floor of this Senate and
      voting here as a representative; voting upon ordinary questions and voting upon the question
      of electing United States Senator. And when question is raised as to whether or not he has a
      right to a seat here, and when there is no question of greater importance, in the face of
      that, what is the proposition now? To postpone it for ten days ! not even to discuss it for
      ten days. For ten days longer to allow this man who the people of his district have said shall
      not represent them, to sit here and vote here day after day as their representative, upon most
      important questions ! What useful purpose will be subserved ten days hence, when perhaps a
      United States Senator will have been elected by his vote, and then after a careful discussion
      of the proposition as to whether or not he had a right to sit here, decided, as they must
      think, that he had no right? But he has sat here for two weeks and voted without right for two
      weeks, and his vote may determine a most important question. It is a question of the highest
      privilege that this matter shall be disposed of without delay: and all other business should
      stand back and allow this question to be paramount. I submit the Senate ought not to postpone
      this question, but take it up and decide it now. If a majority of this Senate say Branaman
      shall sit here they have the power though not the right. Let them take the responsibility now;
      let them not postpone it for ten days until mischief is done by this man. 
     Mr. FOWLER [interposing]: I would ask if the Senate has not already taken action on this
      question? 
     Mr. WINTER: If the Senate has aleady taken action, let its members have the courage to
      adhere to the responsibility they have assumed; let them not run up the black flag and run
      away, and postpone this question for ten days when discussion will only demonstrate their
      great error. The sooner the discussion is had the better. 
     Mr. FRENCH [interposing]: I will ask if in the compact under which the Joint Convention is
      held, it is not understood that the roll shall not be changed?
      Mr. WINTER: I will answer the Senator. My understanding of that compact was, and the
      compact as I last saw it was, that it was simply for the purpose of a Joint Convention upon
      the nineteenth day of this month. The clause he referred to was put there in my absence and
      without my knowledge. 
     Mr. FOWLER [interposing]: Was it not put there with the consent of the Senator's
      colleagues? 
     Mr. WINTER: I know nothing about that. I don't suppose it could be managed so as to
      preclude members of the House and Senate from inquiring as to the qualification of members,
      and tie their hands so they could not, undo a wrong after they had done wrong. 
     Mr. FRENCH [interposing): Did not the Senator sit quietly in the Joint Convention without
      raising his voice about it? 
     Mr. WINTER: I did, in Joint Convention, just as one hundred others did who knew nothing
      about it. But that is not the question, Mr. President. There are certainly enough members on
      the floor of this Senate who can consider this question so we can discharge our constitutional
      duties as a Senate and undo a great wrong. 
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I offered the amendment I did, not because I approve of the proposition to
      postpone this question and not because I consider myself bound by the contract referred to. I
      care nothing about that just now. We have been taught here so far this session, when any
      question comes before this how which might tread upon the toes of  the majority, it will be either strangled with the previous
      question or a motion to lie upon the table. We have not succeeded in getting the majority to
      meet at any time, squarely, any proposition in favor of anything but delay. Now why can't
      we have a fair and full expression on this question ? If you were right, and I believe you
      thought you were right, (I am not uncharitable enough to say otherwise,) are you not willing
      now to know you were wrong and act as men do under such circumstances? 
     Mr. JOHNSON and Mr BARRETT addressed the Chair. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair did not see which one arose first. 
     Mr. BARRETT: The distinguished Senator has had the floor.
      Mr. JOHNSON: I beg pardon--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [interposing]: The chair will give you both an opportunity to
      speak. The Senator from Allen (Mr. Barrett.) 
     Mr. BARRETT: We are in great danger of consuming the entire session of this Legislature by
      speeches from the other side of this house upon a simple political question. Two weeks have
      gone by and the Senate has passed but one or two local legalizing bills. Committees are now
      ready with many important bills for the consideration of the Senate. I think gentlemen should
      be granted at least a week in which to consider this report which occupies so much of the
      time, of to-day's session by our rapid reading clerk. Ten days is not too short a time to
      consider it, for the other report and that must be considered together; and in order that the
      constitutional right may not continue to be abused I demand the previous question. 
     Mr. JOHNSON : In my humble opinion it were far better that this legislative body pass no act
      than to Brush out on this floor the constitutional right of members to express themselves. I
      am not surprised at the gentleman, when the right of a member to his seat in this Senate is
      involved, moved the previous question to cut off debate. I am not surprised that he should cry
      out against continuing the discussion. He is not willing to have the light of a free an fair
      discussion thrown upon his conduct. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [interposing]: The chair begs the Senator's pardon, we are
      not operating under the previous question. Thy chair has kept faith with the Senator. Wait a
      moment. The chair said the Senator should have the floor, and although the Senator from Allen
      (Mr. Barrett) moved the previous question, the chair has not entertained the motion and
      intends the Senator shall speak. 
     Mr. JOHNSON: I am making no complaint against the Chair, I am deprecating what the Senator
      said when he deprecated free discussion. I say it is better that this Assembly should adjourn
      without taking one step than that it should crush out the right of free and proper expression
      upon this floor, or deprive a member of his constitutional right to a seat upon the floor.
      Some reference has been mae to the Joint Convention agreement. Unlike the Senator from Porter
      (Mr. DeMotte) my judgment approved the agreement which I entered into on account of the
      surroundings of the occasion. There is not a syllable in I desire to go back upon, and I
      ratify and approve it now. The question of a right of a member to his seat or th exclusion of
      a member, is a parliamentary question of the highest importance. As laid down in all
      parliamentary law the first question to determined is the right of a member to his seat. And
      why? Because it is one of the greatest consideration, and no member should be permitted to
      vote who is not properly seated. But on the threshold of such a question, when we should
      determine whether a member is entitled to his seat we are met with a motion for delay. This is
      in perfect keeping with the general character of legislation we have had upon this floor. We
      are asked to sit here day after day and see a man who has no right to sit here, participating
      in legislation and when we ask that the question shall be fully and fairly and immediately discussed, we are met with dilatory motions which
      will this discussion off for ten days. Other gentlemen have heard all the testimony and have
      decided that Branaman is not entitled to his seat. He sits silently on the floor of this
      Senate chamber and does not deny the accusations against him made in this report. I would rise
      and not only move but demand as a matter of justice and right that this question should be
      immediately discussed to end that my right shall appear. The people who he misrepresents have
      virtually demanded that this shall be unseated. There are other considerations calling for
      immediate action, to say nothing of parliamentary demands. It should be determined at an early
      day, and it should e determined as a parliamentary set on; because his people are demanding
      it; because this man has no legal right to sit upon this Senate floor, because he is not
      legally elected. But the majority will bring in the previous question, or in some mar way will
      cut off a full and fair discussion of this matter. Why not let the minority have the right to
      be heard in this matter? As I protested against the previous question upon the case of Senator
      McDonald, I do now insist and demand that this question shall not be put off but that this
      majority shall come up and meet in and honorable warfare the minority they have throttled upon
      this floor. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [interrupting]: Will the Senator defer his speech till afternoon? 
     Mr. JOHNSON: I am through. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Call the roll of the Senate. 
     It discovered every Senator, present.
     The Senate left its chamber to meet the House in Joint Convention. Returning in twenty
      minutes---
     The Senate took a recess till 2.30 o'clock. 
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
      Mr. MOON : I was on the Committee on Elections when this case was
      considered, and while I believe it is possible for an honest man to say that Senator McDonald
      was not entitled to his seat, I can't conceive how an honest man can say that Mr.
      Branaman is entitled to his seat; therefore I enter my protest against it. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Senator will write out his protest; and send it up at his
      leisure. The question is on the adoption of the amendment. [After a vote.] The ayes have it. 
     Mr. HUSTON: We want the yeas and nays on that. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair asked if the yeas and nays mere demanded but heard no
      response. The question is decided. 
     Mr. HUSTON: As there seems to be an honest misunderstanding I move to reconsider in order
      that we may take a vote by yeas and nays. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: How did the Senator, vote? I guess you are out on that. 
     Mr. SELLERS: Only in cases where a record is made can you ask how a Senator votes. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The question is on the motion to reconsider. 
     Mr. FRENCH: I move to lay that motion on the table. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: That will take the whole thing on the table. 
     Mr. HUSTON: I want to get the results on record. 
     Mr. FRENCH: I have sat here all day and listened to a debate on this attempt to postpone
      this matter to a day certain. I wish to stop this dilatory progress. 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair will not state the question again. The question is to
      lay this proposition on the table. 
     
     
     It was rejected by yeas 15, nays 31. 
     The motion to postpone till February third was agreed to by yeas 31, nays 17, as

     SCHOOL BOOKS-COPYRIGHT.
      Mr. CAMPBELL called up his motion, entered yesterday, to reconsider the vote adopting a
      resolution in relation to the repeal of the copyright law for publishing school books and
      requesting Indiana Congressmen to favor such a law. [See page 169 of this book.] He said: When
      I voted for this resolution I did not consider the merits of it. I regard such resolutions as
      of not much importance. I assume that a Representative in Congress is able to discharge his
      duties without advise from the General Assembly. 
     Mr. JOHNSON : I thought the Senate made a mistake in passing that resolution. The more I
      have thought of it the more has occurred to me the necessity of retracing our steps.--There is
      now pending in one of the branches of this Assembly a bill to Provide for a uniform system of
      text books for the public schools, and one of the most sensible features of that bill provides
      that the State Board of Education shall procure to be written a complete set of text books and
      when written a copyright shall be taken out. This body had better go along with the spirit of
      the present age than to go against it. It seems to me it is hardy time for us to press a
      resolution of that character. I hope it will not be permitted to pass. I am satisfied this
      resolution went through without thought of the Senate and that it can't stand the
      scrutiny of careful investigation. 
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I hope, the resolution will be reconsidered. 
     Mr. HOWARD of St. Joseph: Books used in the common schools have become common property;
      there is essentially nothing new; but there is a new arrangement of old matter. It seems to me
      this resolution is in the interest of book publishers. 
     Mr. JOHNSON: I would ask if the price of copyrighted school books not out of proportion to
      the price of other copyrighted books? 
     Mr. HOWARD, of St. Joseph: The price of books depends upon the number printed, usually. The
      price of school books should be much less than ordinary works. It has been a common complaint
      for years as to the exorbitant price of school books. 
     Mr. TRIPPETT interposed a point of order under Rule 30. [See page 23 of this book.] 
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: This motion to reconsider was made yesterday. 
     Mr. SMITH, of Wells: At the time the resolution was adopted I believed it was a good one.
      The youth of the country must have school books, and the poor cannot afford to buy books at
      high prices. The fine character of school books has been in accord with the prices. The price
      of sewing machines has come down one-half or more, and the price of school books should be
      reduced. I am in favor of this resolution as it passed. Let us open up to the world the right
      to publish school books by the million. 
     Mr. MCDONALD : I have been connected with schools ands school books or
      twenty-seven years, and if the State of Indiana wants to publish school books it shall have my
      vote. 
     
     
     The motion to reconsider was rejected by yeas 18, nays 27. 
    
    
     CHOOSING OF UNITED STATES SENATOR.
      Mr. LOGSDON offered a concurrent resolution calling upon Senators and Representatives in
      Congress to vote for a constitutional amendments providing for the choosing of United States
      Senators at popular elections. He said: When the framers of the Constitution of the United
      States engrafted into that instrument the pres ent
      provision for electing United States Senators by the Legislature of the States, I presume they
      were controlled principally by the idea that by that method the States would secure better and
      more competent Senators to sit in that distinguished body. I do not believe, however, that at
      the time they took in to consideration or were in any sense influenced by the idea that a
      majority in any Legislature of any State might be so small that a minority of that Legislature
      would not be satisfied with the verdict of the people as expressed at the polls; and that
      obstacles would arise in the contest for Senatorship such as would materially prevent and
      obstruct legislation. It is a fact with which every member on this floor in familiar that for
      years past there have arisen in different Legislatures in various States in the country
      serious muddles, such as in now obstructing necessary legislation in the General Assembly of
      Indiana, that have prevented the enactment of laws, and that the people are demanding relief.
      We have been in session nearly one-third of the time which is allowed by law for a regular
      session of this Legislature, and what has been accomplished? Absolutely nothing, unless it is
      that a few legalizing acts have been passed, together with an appropriation to defray the
      expenses of the present session of the General Assembly. During that time thirty thousand
      dollars have gone out of the treasury of this State to pay the expenses of this General
      Assembly; fifteen hundred dollars a day; three hundred dollars for every hour that this
      Legislature has been in session; fifty dollars for every minute of time in which this
      Legislature has been engaged in work or attempting to work. What has been the cause of this,
      Mr. President? From the very tie of the organization of this General Assembly the
      all-absorbing question has been: who shall succeed General Harrison in the United States
      Senate for the six years beginning the fourth day of March next. No other question has been
      deemed of sufficient importance to demand the candid consideration of members of this General
      Assembly. For that reason, as well as for others, Mr. President, I am in favor of this
      resolution. If it were in my power I would divest the General Assembly of all, appointing
      power in every particular. I would have an Assembly here of members of the Legislature who
      would legislate in the interest of the people, to do up the legislative work at once, and when
      through go to their respective homes. Another thing, Mr. President, it is an evident fact that
      for years past, to my mind at least, the standing of the United States Senate has been
      depreciating all the time. It has in my judgment become monopolistic, and corporations have
      grown to such gigantic proportions that as long as this question of electing United States
      Senators is left to the Legislatures they will assume to dictate who shall be elected to that
      position. The result is, that frequently it is the case they go on to say who shall be
      nominated in the different districts as a Representative or, as a Senator, and they follow
      their men into the General Assembly and presume to bring their arguments to bear there and
      dictate who shall be elected by that General Assembly. The result is that of recent years our
      Senate of the United States, instead of being composed of men like Webster, and Clay, and
      Calhoun, who were ever on the alert in the interests of the people and the whole people, we
      have a Senate of the United States composed to-day principally of representatives of
      corporations and of millionaires and that class of leaders who feel a great interest in such
      laws, as will tend to benefit the monied class in this country, and of the corporations of
      this country, as against the interests of the great masses. For that reason, Mr. President, I
      am in favor of this resolution. I believe that the people are capable of self-government, and
      I believe they are becoming more and more capable of self-government all, the time in the
      light of the influence of the schools of this country. I believe the honest people are more
      capable of selecting a man for the posi-  tion of United
      States Senator than the legislative body of any State, and for these reasons, Mr. President, I
      am in favor of this resolution. 
     Mr. KENNEDY: I advocate this resolution, for I believe that is the right principle. I
      believe in popular government, but I believe the people are now prevented from expressing
      their sentiments. I advocate the right of members who are sent to this or any other house, to
      hold their seats when they are elected by the popular will of the people. 
     Mr. BAILEY [interrupting]: I rise to a point of order. It is not in the power of any member
      of this Senate to criticise the action of the House of Representatives. 
     Mr. KENNEDY: I was not criticising the action of the House of Representatives.
      The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Senator will refrain from improper reference to the House of
      Representatives. 
     Mr. KENNEDY: Actions speak louder than words. If Senators now claiming to represent the
      people would vote as they want--if the popular will of the State of Indiana was adhered
      to,--we would elect our United States Senator on the next ballot by a good majority.
      [Applause.] It is better to show your faith by your actions than by your words.
     
     

     Mr. WEIR: I am heartily in favor of the resolution. It was adopted by yeas 43, nays 4. 
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. CAMPBELL, when his name was called, said: I am heartily in favor, of the resolution. I
      vote "aye." 
     Mr. HUSTON, in explanation of his vote, said: I am heartily in accord with the spirit of the
      resolution. Whenever the time comes that a vote in the southern part of this country counts as
      much as in the northern part of this country I should be in favor of the resolution, but at
      the present time I shall vote "no." 
     Mr. SMITH, of Wells, when his name was called, said: I feel we are neglecting the work we
      are sent here to do for the election of a United States Senator, and to prevent a recurrence
      of this I vote "aye." 
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion,in explanation of his vote, said: It is the first time I ever heard
      in the Legislature of a proposition to elect United States Senators by the people. I have
      thought on that subject as much as any other man of my age. This resolution meets with my
      hearty approval. I have known persons who coup not be elected to any office by their
      neighbors, picked up and elected to the Senate of the United States. The Legislatures have not
      exhibited any ability to select honest men, but when it comes to the people, they are the
      proper ones to make the selection. The people of this country are the best judges of men. I
      have known persons who have run and run in the State to which they belonged, for office after
      office, and finally the Legislature picked them up and sent them to the United States Senate
      merely as payment for party services. I am opposed to all that. I most heartily a prove of
      your resolution, sir. I wish I could see it accomplished in my day and generation. I would be
      delighted with it. I vote "aye." 
     Mr. TRIPPETT, when his name was called, said: I have read with a great deal of interest, the
      debates up on this question in the Continental Congress, and my opinion formed by reading
      those debates is that the great and wise men of that body settled that question right. I vote
      "no." 
     The result was announced as above. 
     So the resolution was adopted. 
     The Senate adjourned. 
    
   
   
   
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
    
      TUESDAY, January 25, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Rev. G. G. Mitchell, of the Fifth Presbyterian
     Church.
    
     WORK ON HIGHWAYS.
     Mr. KELLY, of Boone, moved to reconsider the vote of yesterday by which the enacting clause
      was stricken out of Mr. Catey's road bill [H. R. 57--see pages 177, 178, 179.]
     Mr. FLEECE: The bill provided that the soldiers in the late war should  be exempted from working on the roads. Nearly all the soldiers that
      served from two to four years are disabled in some manner.
     Mr. FOSTER: I rise to a point of order. The motion is to reconsider.
     The SPEAKER: The point of order, it seems to the chair, is not well taken. The gentleman has
      not gone so far as to be out of order.
     Mr. FLEECE: I think that we ought to exempt these men from working on the highways and that
      they will hold us responsible if we do not.
     Mr. JEWETT: On yesterday I took no part in the discussion, nor did I care much about this
      bill or amendment. I rather favor the views of the gentleman from Whitley [Mr. Garrison] but
      made the motion to strike the enacting clause simply to get the sense, of the House on this
      question. The majority was decisive that the enacting clause should be stricken out, and I
      took it as showing that there was no desire to tinker with the present road law. As to
      exempting any any class of citizens, I doubt whether such a thing could be done. If a man is
      not an able-bodied man he cannot be made to work on the road, and the men who would be
      affected are most of them above age. It seems to me that the vote of this House shows that it
      is pleased with the present road law. I move the motion to reconsider be laid on the
      table.
     This motion was agreed to.
    
    
     STOCK AT LARGE.
     Mr. Garrison's bill [H. R. 27] to regulate the taking up of animals running at large,
      was returned from the Committee on Agriculture with an amendment allowing
      constables a reasonable compensation for their care and keep, &c. [See pages 174 to
      177.
     Mr. GORDON: I cannot conceive how that amendment to the bill will make it any less
      objectionable. The objection is to the very essence of the bill. It is the fact of requiring
      the constable, under penalty, to take up animals that are found at large. I can see that the
      time will come when this bill will be proper; that the time will come when fencing material is
      harder to obtain and more expensive than now. But I cannot conceive of any good reason why
      this bill should pass at this time except to add to the advantages the property owners already
      have. The Board of County Commissioners can regulate the whole matter. There might be a few of
      the landed people who would be pleased with the bill but the great mass of the people would
      not look with favor on any such measure.
     Mr. STUBBLEFIELD: I favor this bill for the reason that it puts the responsibility upon the
      officer instead of upon the farmer. One neighbor will suffer a great deal from the others
      before he will take up and impound stock. I know of men who let their stock run at large, and
      the reason why a great many people do not take up and impound it is because they are afraid of
      their owners. When it is in the hands of the proper officer to enforce the law, it will be
      enforced; but as it now stands it never is and never will be enforced. I know that or the
      lower/lands of the White river, people turn their stock out and they throw the fences down,
      and a man must ride three or four days to find to whom the stray cattle belong. The river
      comes up and the little bit of fence is torn away and the cattle get in and range over and
      ravage the country.
     Mr. METZGER: I do not believe the time is here to make a big grass pasture of all the public
      highways of our State. That time has gone by.
     Mr. ROBINSON: It seems that the only satisfactory provision in this bill is in reference to
      a means of enforcing the law. As has been said, under the common law it is made the business
      of no one to enforce it and it is inoperative. The farmers in my part of the country want some
      one to enforce the law. Neighbors do not desire to secure the displeasure of one another by
      taking up stock unless the animal is trespassing on their crops. The gentlemen of the cities
      would not consent that stock should run at large within the confines of the cities and have no
      one whose duty it is to  arrest them; but it is not
      unusual, for the cows of the towns and cities. to come out in, the country in herds of
      twenty-five or fifty or even a hundred and graze all day on lands of the farmers. If the laws
      allow the owners of the cows to take the farmers' hay and grass, or allows him to send
      his cow to take it, I would suggest that the law which permitted the ranging cow to take the
      farmer's crop should go one step further and allow the farmer to milk the cow. In my part
      of the country the farmers do not want the laws to authorize them to arrest the cows, but they
      do want it to be the duty of some officer to do this. I insist that the people in the country
      are as much entitled to an officer to look after their interests in this matter, as the people
      in the city. I think that this measure ought to beceome a law, though I think that the
      commissions are a little too high, and when the commissions are reduced I shall certainly
      favor the bill.
     Mr. KELLISON: I believe that this bill in its general scope and intention is a good one, but
      it is too indefinite. If its provisions are to apply to all the animals that are taken up, the
      fees would be enormous. I favor fixing a specific fee for each animal, and if there is more
      than one animal fixing an additional compensation. I consider its defects are that it provides
      three dollars and fifty cents for the trouble of taking up a single animal that may not be
      worth twenty-five cents. It would result in great oppression and the fees would be enormous.
      It ought to provide mileage, because if the officer has to go four or five miles he ought to
      get more compensation than if he only goes forty rods. Therefore I have prepared a motion to
      recommit the bill to a special committee with instructions. [To grade the fees.]
     Mr. BUCKLES: It is not the purpose of this bill, under any circumstances, to interfere with
      the rights of the people of a district where stock is allowed to run at large, but it is the
      purpose of this bill, where stock is not allowed to run at large, to authorize a constable to
      take up and impound cattle running at large with the knowledge and consent of the owner. In
      our town perhaps four or five hundred head of cows are kept. The howl has been raised that
      they were the poor widows' cows; when the fact is nineteen out of twenty belonged to
      wealthy men in the town, and but two belonged to poor widows. That is about the size of this
      widow's cow business.
     Mr. KELLISON: Don't the gentleman think that it is better to give the constable a
      reasonable fee for services rendered?
     Mr. BUCKLES: I think, whether the gentleman means it or not, the effect of his proposition
      simply is put a much larger amount of money in the hands of the constable. Under the
      provisions of this bill, it don't matter whether the constable has taken up one or one
      hundred and fifty cows, he gets three dollars and fifty cents, and I think that is enough. I
      do not think there is a single constable in the State of Indiana who won't discharge the
      duties for this price. We have a statute providing that upon the adoption of certain orders of
      the Board of Commissioners that animals may run at large. Now in the absence of such an order
      every man is compelled to keep his stock upon his own premises. The Commissioners in a large
      portion of the State have made the necessary order. The people may have them run at large in
      one of the townships and not in another. We want the law enforced, and we want some means of
      compelling men to respect the law and respect the rights of their neighbors. On his
      motion--
     The amendment (Mr. Kellison's) was laid on the table.
     Mr. BERTRAM: I am not opposed to the general features of this bill, but I am opposed to
      concurring in the report of the committee as far as the fees in this bill is concerned. There
      seems to be a feeling of fear among the farmers about enforcing this law. There are laws that
      the farming community are not afraid to enforce. The law against horse stealing for example.
      This bill would certainly not be  in accordance with the
      wishes of my people. If the fees were reduced as the gentleman from Marshall (Mr. Kellison)
      proposes, I would be in favor of the bill.
     Mr. WEYAND: It is my impression that the law now in force is a good one. I cannot see from
      the amendments that have been proposed how it is to be improved. The main point made is
      something like this: Instead of allowing each citizen to take up stock, an officer is to do
      that rework, and thus avoid neighborhood disturbances. This bill is just as liable to create
      trouble, for the constable has to be notified by some one. In our county stock is prohibited
      from running at large. In other parts of the country, there are thousands of acres that are
      vacant. Around these lands are small land holders who are trying to build up this country, and
      they should have the advantage of the grass on these vacant lands. I am opposed to any bill
      that will change the present law.
     Mr. HARRELL: I am in favor of the stock law, and think it is just and fair to all parties.
      The first proposition that I see in this bill is this: to take the responsibility of the law
      out of the citizen's hands and put it on an officer. Then we should change the bill so
      that the officer would be protected. The common law on the statute books make the constable
      liable to a fine after having been notified that the stock is running at large. There is not
      one place in a hundred that has a pound to put stock in. Now where is he to put then? The
      responsibility is put on the constable; therefore he is liable personally for the cost of
      keeping this stock. For instance, my cattle are running at large; and I dispute that they are
      running at large with my knowledge and consent; if he takes up a hundred sheep he has to stand
      the expense of keeping them. It is putting a responsibility on the constable and not giving
      him a right to protect himself. A reasonable compensation should be allowed for all the
      expense. I do not believe you could get any man to serve as constable under this feature; and
      I know some places where they have no constable at all. I object to this bill, first, that it
      is unfair and unjust; and second, that the stock law now in force is sufficient.
     Mr. GARRISON: It seems to me that there is a misapprehension of the provisions of this bill,
      notwithstanding the lengthy debate upon it. I am aware that there are quite a number of
      gentlemen whose interests would not be subserved were this bill passed and become a law. The
      gentleman from Franklin (Mr. Harrell) admits, that although he is a lawyer he has a farm. He
      can't keep a cattle on his land for his fences are not sufficient, and he is opposed to
      this bill because it would compel him to put his cattle in the stable. I give him credit for
      honesty and sincerity on this question. There are quite a number of gentlemen who I believe
      are induced to oppose this bill because they are living in towns and cities. These gentlemen
      are influenced by personal motives, and although I believe that the gentlemen themselves are
      worthy, yet I don't approve of their motives. If the interests of the people require that
      a certain class or all classes of stock run at large, the Commissioners may issue a
      proclamation to that effect. I know that in my county this bill is required, and that the
      interests of the farmers there demand it. It is necessary for their protection, and without it
      you might as well repeal the present law on the statute books.
     Mr.GORDON moved to strike from the bill the enacting clause, and on that motion demanded the
      previous question. The House seconded the demand, and under its operation--
     
     The motion was rejected by yeas 43, nays 56.
     Pending, the roll-call--
     Mr. HARRELL said: I desire to explain my vote. I am not opposed to a stock law, but think it
      is right and proper to strike out the enacting clause of this bill.
     Mr. JEWETT: I desire to explain my vote. It is largely with a view to expediting the
      business of this House. This House has fallen largely into the  habit of discussing the merits of bills on the report of
      committees, and also on the motion to strike out the enacting clause. I think the discussion
      should be made on its passage and its third reading. I vote "aye."
     Mr. PATTON, when his name was 'called, said: For the reason that there is now a statute
      that makes it the duty of every one to bring his action directly against the trespasser; and
      for the reason that this bill seeks to substitute a third party--a constable--and as much
      litigation has arisen out of it, and the costs have been assessed against the third party, I
      therefore vote to strike out the enacting clause. I vote "aye."
     The vote was announced as above.
     The report of the committee was then adopted, and the bill ordered engrossed.
    
    
     THE JOINT CONVENTION.
     The Senate appeared at noon and the two Houses in Joint Convention voted twice for a United
      States Senator--the eighth and ninth ballots--resulting as on page 141 of this book.
     When the Senate retired--
     The House took a recess for dinner.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     
      LIVE STOCK SANITARY COMMISSION.
      Mr. Buckles' Stock Sanitary and State Veterinarian bill [H. R. 109] was taken up with
       a favorable committee report.
      Mr. BEASLEY: I desire to offer an amendment. It is to Section 9 [to provide for the
       appraisement of condemned animals.] In case this commission appraise stock, suppose there are
       one hundred head of hogs that have the cholera. In that case the farmer might be able to
       preserve a great many of them. Not having an opportunity to, the damage may be assessed at
       one dollar and a half when in fact they would be worth one thousand dollars. I believe that
       provision as it now stands would be unconstitutional. They should have the right to contest
       the question of the amount of damages.
      Mr. GORDON: I have read this bill very carefully, and at first thought of offering the same
       amendment, but I have since considered that matter as carefully as I could, and I have talked
       with stock men whom I have met, and also members of this committee. This bill was prepared by
       committee appointed by the State Board of Agriculture, and there was no part of it that was
       not carefuly considered, and especially this very provision. It seems that any man who is
       having his property condemned should have the right to have it appraised by his neighbors,
       but the State Commissioner will certainly be the most disinterested person that could be
       found. It seems to me there could be no ground for charging the commissioners with any but
       fair dealings, as they would be fair minded men, and they would be supposed to make inquiries
       in the neighborhood, and I do not think it would be best to change that feature of the bill
       on his motion.
      The amendment (Mr. Beasley's) was laid on the table.
     
     
      ANOTHER EXTRA EMPLOYE.
      Mr. GRIFFITHS offered a resolution that a competent person, an ex-Union soldier, be
       employed to take charge of the lighting of the hall.
      Mr. PATTON moved to amend by substituting a "colored brother" for the ex-Union
       soldier.
      The amendment was accepted, and the resolution was adopted.
     
     
      TIPPECANOE BATTLE GROUND.
      Mr. OSBORN described the unsightly condition of the fence surrounding the Tippecanoe
       battle-ground, and moved that a committee of two on the part of the Senate and three on the
       part of the House be appointed to inspect the same, and report next Monday.
      Mr. PATTON thought that a proviso should have been added, "if, in the meanwhile, a
       United States Senator had not been elected."
      The resolution was adopted.

     HOUSE BILLS PASSED--FOR RELIEF.
     
     On motion by Mr. FRENCH, the bill [H. R. 166] to pay
      Nathan P. Gilliat, ex-Trustee of Orange county, for township funds stolen from him, was
      finally passed under a suspension of the rules--yeas 44, nays 1.
     On motion by Mr. GRIFFITH, the bill [H. R. 105] to
      pay Samuel Dickerson, of Dearborn county, for township funds lost by failure of a bank, was
      also finally passed under a suspension of the rules by yeas 34, nays 12, Mr. G. stating that
      seven-tenths of the tax-payers, representing nine-tenths of the taxables of the township, were
      petitioning for the passage of this bill.
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. FOWLER, in explanation of his vote, said: On general principles I am opposed to this
      class of legislation, but on the statement of the Senator (Mr. Griffith) that a large
      proportion of the tax-payers favor it, I vote "aye."
     Mr. JOHNSON, when his name was called, said: I am opposed to relieving trustees who receive
      interest on deposits, but under the circumstances in this case, I vote "aye."
     Mr. KENNEDY, in explanation of his vote, said: In view of the fact that seven-eighths of the
      persons interested favor this measure,I vote "no."
     Mr.MARSHALL, in explanation, said: Having talked with the Senator from that district and
      seen a memorial stating that nine-tenths of the tax-payers are favorable to this, I vote
      "aye."
     Mr. MCDONALD, when his name was called, said: This is an act Of honesty
      and fairness. The citizens there propose to make this man whole; they can stand it much better
      than he can stand to lose a large sum, and I think it right the Senate should  comply with their wishes. I vote "aye".
     Mr. SMITH, of Wells, in explanation of his vote, said: I am opposed to these kind of acts. I
      vote "no."
     Mr. THARP, when his name was called, said: As has been stated by Senators, I am opposed to
      this kind of legislation. If there was a remonstrance signed by a single tax-payer of the
      township I would vote against this bill, but as there is a petition for it on which are the
      names of a great majority of the tax-payers, I will vote in favor of the bill. I vote
      "aye."
     Mr. WEIR, in explaining his vote, said: Believing if the citizens of the township wish to
      refund this money, it is a matter for them to consider, I am willing to vote for such a
      measure. I vote "aye."
     The result was then announced.
     On motion by Mr. DAY, the constitutional restriction was again set aside by more than a
      two-thirds vote, and the bill [H. R. 191] to give an
      additional term of court in the fourth judicial circuit was put upon its passage.
     Mr. MCCLURE: I would like to have been consulted as to that bill before
      it was called up, inasmuch as it involves our county; but I have no objection so it does not
      change the days of holding courts in the county of Clark.
     Mr. DAY: I understand it does not change the time in Clark county at all. Two years ago a
      bill was passed giving Floyd county three terms, and now we ask four.
     Mr. MCCLURE: I would be glad to have an opportunity to examine this bill,
      but I will take the word of the Senator from Floyd (Mr. Day) with regard to that.

     
     

     The bill passed by yeas 41, nays 0.
    
    
     A BILL FOR ACTS WAS INTRODUCED BY.
     Mr. Bailey [S. 168]: To define the Nineteenth and Twenty-second Circuit Courts, the first to
      be confined to Marion county and the second to Hendricks and Montgomery counties.
     The Senate left its chamber for a joint convention with the House of representatives to
      select a United States Senator for Indiana. Returning in fifteen minutes--
     The Senate took a recess till 2 ½ o'clock.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     ANOTHER EXTRA CLERK.
     Mr. BRYANT offered a resolution that the Committee Clerk of group three be "ordered and
      authorized to appoint an assistant."
     The resolution was adopted.
    
    
     A LOST HOSPITAL PATIENT.

     
     

     Mr. DRAKE offered the following:
     
      
       
        Whereas, On or about the first day of October, 1885, the Superintendent of the Indiana
         Hospital for the Insane notified the family of Mrs. Camelia E. Dallas, an insane inmate of
         said Hospital from the county of Lagrange, that the said insane person has, escaped from
         the ward of said Hospital in which she was confined; and,
        Whereas, No trace of the said Camelia E. Dallas has yet been discovered, so far as known
         to her family; therefore,
        Resolved, That the Senate Committee on Benevolent Institutions be and the same is hereby
         directed to fully investigate said case and to report the facts therein, and what effort
         has been made to discover and return the said Camella E. Dallas to said Hospital, and also,
         if necessary, to prepare and report a proper bill providing for the punishment of employes
         of public hospitals for gross negligence in the care of inmates, making the same a
         misdemeanor.
       
      
     
     It was adopted.
    
    
     DENTISTS' LICENSE.
     A committee's substitute for Mr. Schloss' bill [S. 13] to regulate the Practice of Dentistry, coming up--
     Mr. WEIR: I object to the power given to the Board to decide upon the reputability of
      Colleges, and to the provision that gives it the right to collect from a certain class of
      persons "the sum of twenty-five dollars." That is unreasonable--unconscionable. I am
      in favor of the principles of the bill, but these clauses are giving to the Board more power
      than it has any business with.
     Mr. SELLERS: I am opposed to this bill because a dentist practicing nine years and nine
      months, or any less than ten years, cannot get a certificate from this Board. I think he ought
      to be entitled to practice.
     Mr. WEIR: The Senator is mistaken. The Board can examine that person and if competent it may
      permit him to practice.
     
     Mr. SELLERS: And make him pay twenty-five dollars for the examination!
     Mr. WEIR: That is what I object to.
     Mr. HOWARD, of Decatur: In Section 1 of the bill there is a proviso which says that nothing
      in this act shall apply to any one engaged in the practice of dentistry in this State at the
      time of the passage of this act. I understand there will be no examination of those in this
      State at this time practicing dentistry. The bill proposes, as I understand it, to remedy
      evils in the profession of dentistry and to strike at some rule by which the qualification of
      members of the profession may be determined. The bill proposes to ignore these institutions
      that are job concerns--they are known to the profession all over the United States. It is a
      fact known the members of the profession of dentistry as well as in the profession of medicine
      that from these institutions diplomas can be bought, and bought cheaply. I think in this bill
      the provision which relates to that is well thought of and will please the profession.
     Mr. WEIR: If the Board has the right to determine that question it has the power to reject a
      diploma in every instance.
     Mr. HOWARD, of Decatur: That is something that must be determined somewhere. I might say in
      advocacy of this bill that other States are passing laws of this character, and they are
      unloading upon us those who are not qualified to practice, and unless we have some protection
      in this State we will soon be burdened to such an extent that reputable practice in the
      profession cannot be maintained. Therefore, on this ground if for nothing more, I would be in
      favor of this bill.
     Mr. HARKNESS: I hold a letter in my hand from a gentleman who says this bill has been
      prepared with great care, and he has known of the operations of a similar one since 1879,
      which has been found to be beneficial. I only have his word for it, but I know him to be a man
      largely interested dentistry.
     Mr. HUSTON: But few have understanding of this bill they would like to have, to vote
      intelligently on it. I move it be set down for further consideration a week hence at two
      o'clock.
     This motion was agreed to.
    
    
     COUNTY BOARD MEETINGS.
     Mr. Griffith's bill [S. 4) to,legalize meetings of County Commissioners in certain
      cases, was read the second time.
     Mr. THARP: No doubt there are many law suits pending on the question as to whether Boards of
      Commissioners have been called together legally and as the statute directs. In some cases
      Boards are hastily summoned together for the purpose of calling an election to vote to levy a
      tax on the people for railroads. The second section of this bill proposes to legalize every
      act of every Board of Commissioners in the State. In one of my neighboring counties a great
      law suit has recently been determined involving this very question. I think the Senate ought
      to consider this question before ordering this bill engrossed.
     Mr. WINTER moved to amend the bill by adding a section providing that "nothing
      contained in this act shall affect any suit now pending."
     This amendment was adopted.
     The bill was ordered engrossed.
    
    
     INTIMIDATION LAW--REPEAL.
     Mr. Rahm's bill [S. 7] to repeal Sections 2126 and 2127 of the Devised Statutes coming
      up--
     Mr. BAILEY: These sections were passed in 1881 for the specific purpose and benefit of
      railroad companies. They were intended either to intimidate or prevent men from meeting for
      the lawful purpose of opposing a reduction of their wages. [Reads Section 2126.] I know of no
      State which has such a law except Indiana, and there is no use for it. All offences that might
      be embraced under these sections are fully embraced by other laws. The next section certainly
      ought to be repealed because of the outrageous punishment attached to  the offence therein described.-- [Reads.] That punishment is equal
      to the punishment for manslaughter.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: What possible excuse can be given for men who desire to commit the offences
      described in these sections?
     Mr. BAILEY: The offences described here would be properly punished under the statute for
      malicious trespass. It has been construed by some courts to refer to a congregation of men who
      met together for the lawful purpose of sustaining and keeping up their wages. I think this
      statute ought to he repealed.
     Mr. JOHNSON: Under what statute other than Section 2126 could any individual be prosecuted
      who simply threatened an employe of a railroad corporation with violence?
     Mr. BAILEY: If that be mere intimidation, it depends upon what the court or jury would
      construe to be intimidation. If a threat, it could be prosecuted under the statute for
      provoke. If by force and violence, it could be prosecuted under the statute defining assault
      or assault and battery. I think the provoke law in many respects is bad and leads to useless
      litigation.
     Mr. JOHNSON: I would ask the Senator if he considers it a fit matter of criminal prosecution
      if any man by force or violence interferes with any other man in attempting to engage in a
      lawful avocation?
     Mr. BAILEY: Undoubtedly; there is no question about that.
     Mr. HARKNESS: What other law covers the offences there defined?
     Mr. BAILEY: I think the section prescribing punishment for assault or assault and
      battery.
     Mr. WEIR: I will do as much as most of men can justify themselves in doing for the class of
      men my friend the Senator from Marion (Mr. Bailey) seems, without stating so directly, to
      represent. I fully justify the laboring men, so termed, in the organizations they have made
      for self-protection. I believe it is a necessity and I justify it. But it is a mistaken idea
      for one class of persons to interfere by force with another class of persons, in their
      business. Instead of strikes and using force to accomplish this purpose, there is another way
      to accomplish it, and a way which does not interfere with the good order of society or with
      business. By carefully reading these two sections it will be seen they comprise just such a
      law as should be upon our statute book. It is not intelligent laboring men who are asking for
      the repeal of this statute. It is an insult, by interference, to say they are demanding it.
      The repeal is demanded that a certain class may be permitted to interfere with the legitimate
      business of railroad and other corporations, and of individuals, as well. Perhaps the
      punishment attached to this law is too severe, and I would vote to make it less. The best way,
      however, is for laboring men to remember that they are American citizens, interested in the
      good order of society, and that the Constitution and laws of this country point to a remedy,
      through their votes, for every wrong.
     Mr. BAILEY obtained the floor--

     Mr. KERCHEVAL offered a resolution to pay extra doorkeepers for services rendered prior to
      the passage of the resolution authorizing their employment.
     It was adopted.

     Pending the introduction of bills--
    
    
     ANOTHER EXTRA CLERK.
     Mr. LINCK offered a resolution to legalize an appointment of an additional journal
      clerk.
     It was adopted.
    
    
     SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE.
     Mr. GARRISON offered a concurrent resolution requesting Congressmen to endeavor to create a
      Department of Agriculture, the chief of which shall be a cabinet officer.
     It was adopted.
    
    
     A STATE STENOGRAPHER.
     The Senate concurrent resolution to create a State Legislative Stenographer [see page 154 of
      this book] was read and referred to the Judiciary Committee.
    
    
     JUSTICES' JURISDICTION.
     The Judiciary Committee returned Mr. Askren's bill [H. R. 18] to provide that the
      jurisdiction of Justices shall be co-extensive in their townships, with a recommendation that
      it be indefinitely postponed.
     Mr. MOCK: I hope the report of the committee will not be concurred in. The intention of the
      bill is all right, but in its present form it ought not perhaps to become a law. The bill
      ought to be amended and then passed. It is to prevent persons who commit misdemeanors in any
      township from being taken to the county seats and there prosecuted. If a person commits a
      misdemeanor in his own township he should be tried and fined there. I think that feature of
      the bill is good.
     Mr. COX, of Miami: I am opposed to the adoption of the report of the committee. I believe
      that the bill, if properly amended and adopted, will largely lessen the expenses of
      litigation, and it will decrease the annoyance that people are put to.
     Mr. GORDON: The law as it now stands gives Justices of the Peace jurisdiction co-extensive
      with the county. Now the bill proposes to simply change the word "county" and
      substitute therefor the word "township" so that the Justice of the Peace will have
      jurisdiction only co-extensive with his township. The gentleman who offered the bill desires
      to have the report of the committee non-concurred in so that he can amend it.
     Mr. HARRELL: I think the report of the committee ought not to be concurred in. If some
      fellow gets into a fight in one of the outside townships they will procure an affidavit and
      bring him into the county seat and there have him tried. The Justice will send for probably
      fifteen witnesses and it makes a great deal of cost, while the case ought to be tried in the
      out township. I think the bill ought to be referred back to the committee, and with that
      amendment, be passed.
     
     The business of the House was interrupted by--
    
    
     THE JOINT CONVENTION
     Senators appearing, the Senate and House re-assembled in joint convention, pursuant to
      adjournment on yesterday, and proceeded with a tenth ballot for United States Senator, which
      resulted as the vote printed on page 141 of this book, except that Representative Connely was
      paired with Representative Dickerson, called away by sickness in his family.
     When the Senate retired--
     The House took a recess for dinner.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     On motion by Mr. GARRISON, the pending bill [H. R. 8] concerning the liability of
      corporations for injury or death of an employe by fault of co-employe, coming up, with a
      favorable committee report--
     Mr. GORDON said: I am not yet ready to concur in this report. There is a bill on the same
      subject before the Judiciary Committee introduced by the gentleman from
      Floyd [Mr. Jewett.] I think that these matters ought to be very carefully considered. I now
      make a motion that this bill, with the report, be re-committed to the Committee on
       the Judiciary.
      Mr. ROBERTS: I hope that this course will not be pursued. The merits of this bill are
      manifest and its provisions are very clear. The bill should receive immediate attention. Last
      session a similar bill, except the proposed amendment, received the unanimous endorsement of
      the members--there being ninety-six votes cast for it and none against it. I am not inclined
      to enter the discussion of the bill at this time, but trust the House will not defer the
      bill.
     Mr. JEWETT: I desire to amend the motion of the gentleman from Putnam (Mr. Gordon.) This
      bill was introduced early in the session two years ago and was known as H. B. 92, and it is a
      significant fact that no vote was taken on it until in April during the special session. My
      vote was cast, as doubtless the votes of many other gentlemen who went to make up the House of
      Representatives, as an expression of a desire and willingness to take some steps to modify the
      hardships of employes of the great railroad corporations. The bill which I introduced and
      which is now in the hands of the Judiciary Committee I introduced two years
      ago and sought to have substituted for this bill. It was rejected and the one vote was upon
      this bill. I am satisfied that this bill ought not to pass in its present shape, and I am
      satisfied that my bill ought not to pass without amendment. But I am also satisfied that we
      cannot discharge our duty to our fellow citizens if we allow the session to close without
      passing some such bill. It is with that in view that I support the motion of the gentleman
      from Putnam (Mr. Gordon) and to which I shall offer an amendment. Many of the members of this
      House are not lawyers.
     Mr. GROSE [interposing]: Where did this report come from?
     Mr. JEWETT: The Committee on Corporations. In fact there are but
      thirty-three gentlemen in this House denominated lawyers on the roll of the House, therefore I
      assume that two thirds of them do not devote their time to that profession. And briefly, it
      may be said that this is the trouble. Away back about fifty years ago a common law decision
      was made which is familiar to every law student, an English decision, and the questions in
      that case are valuable. I refer to the case of Priestley vs. Fowler. It was an action at law
      by a butcher boy against his master. It was Priestley's business to haul in the cart or
      van the quarters of beef, mutton, etc. The van was one day overloaded by the butchers and it
      broke down, and thereby broke the thigh of the boy. He brought his action for damages and the
      court held, and it is the leading case on that subject in the world that it was conclusively
      presumed, when he entered the service of this butcher, that he would take all the risks
      incident to his employment, and one of these risks was that they migit  overload the van. But two exceptions exist in the Indiana law so
      far as I know. One is where the injury arises though the defect of machinery, and the other is
      where the negligence is that of one who is supposed be in the place of the master. Aside from
      these I know of no distinctions in the law, and it has been my duty several times to look the
      matter up carefully. Now it has been extended until our courts have held that the brakeman or
      engineer and the trackman, a man whom the others do not know and probably never saw, are
      fellow servants. In a case that arose in southern Indiana where a fireman threw off a stick of
      wood or lump of coal and thereby injured or killed a section hand, although the section hand
      never saw the fireman, it was held that they were fellow servants. It was decided against the
      plaintiff, in both the lower and upper courts. I think Judge Elliott delivered the
      opinion--either Judge Elliott or Judge Niblack. In delivering the opinion the court said: If
      it were an open question, he would say that the plaintiff, was entitled to recover, or words
      to that effect. Judge Woods said that appeals for the abatement of this rule must come to the
      Legislature. I favor with all my heart, in fact I came here with this bill in my head for the
      very purpose of putting railroad men on an equality with other men in regard to these things.
      In 1880 there was passed an act in a country where the liberty of the citizens is of the
      highest concern and where corporate rights and the rights of all persons are carefully
      guarded. I call attention to this because I propose to move to amend the motion of the
      gentleman to instruct the Committee on Judiciary to report a bill embodying
      the provisions of this act. I refer to an act of the British Parliament passed in 1880 on the
      7th of September. Now the same difficulty exists in England, and this act of Parliament worked
      well. This affects everybody,--it affects the farm hand on the farm and the journeyman who
      works for the boss carpenter. It is not limited to railroad men, it cannot in my opinion be
      constitutionally limited to them. [Reads the part of the statute found in the Statutes at
      Large 43rd and 44th years of Victoria.] I have given this matter thought attention for more
      than two yeas, and I believe that this act of Parliament comes nearer giving an intelligent
      and comprehensive and at the same time safe proposition than anything else I have seen. And it
      seems to me that we can do nothing better than to embody in an act of our own the provisions
      of this law of Parliament. We get much of our law from the common law of England and I believe
      that this act of Parliament known in law books as the "Employer's Act" is the
      safest thing that could now be enacted. It would doubtless be a step in the right direction.
      If in practice it is found to go too far, let the succeeding Legislature qualify or modify it.
      I have many young friends in the employment of railroad companies who have spoken to me of
      their injuries and their inability to get justice, and I told them that I shared their feeling
      and that I would do my best to bring about a change in the matter.
     Mr. GORDON: I am opposed the motion of the gentleman from Floyd (Mr. Jewett) for a reason
      that seems to me to be a good and strong one. I am opposed to giving instructions because it
      would compel us to do one of two things. It would compel us to adopt that bill and vote for
      the amendments when it comes up for its third reading, or vote against it when it comes upon
      its third reading.
     Mr. JEWETT: I withdraw my amendment.
     Mr. ROBERTS: I said a moment ago that I did not desire to enter upon the discussion of the
      bill at this time, but the extraordinary position taken by the gentleman from Floyd (Mr.
      Jewett) compels me to say a few words. I must say I am surprised when he voted for this bill
      at the last General Assembly he did so simply as an expression of opinion. An opinion of what?
      A member of the last General Assembly--the Speaker of 
      the House--ignoring the solemnity of the act, stands here and says that he supported the bill
      simply as an opinion; not as a solemn act of legislation. He now asks that the record he made
      should be simply recorded as an opinion. What is the effect of that bill? It simply removes
      the old hard, rugged rule which enables a corporation to escape liability. The rule has
      existed since the day of corporations. The acts of an agent are the acts of the corporation.
      More than that, the gentleman well knows that every act the agent performs, the corporation is
      presumed to be present in the person of that agent. This rule has been carried to such an
      inordinate and unreasonable extent that they may escape liability notwithstanding that rule,
      by showing that a fellow servant has caused the injury. Do they object to the second section?
      It simply applies to the case of the servant when the injuries result in death. I would ask
      the gentleman from Floyd if he wants to recommit on account of the fourth section of this act?
      [Reads.] Why is that provision inserted? The object of that provision is to meet this
      contingency: Many of the railroads and manufacturing corporations or companies are requiring
      their employes on entering into their employ to sign an agreement that they are not
      accountable for any injuries received. I think the decision of the Supreme Court of the State
      of Indiana and of the United States hold that such a contract is void. All there is in this
      bill is simply to establish the rule that if an employe of a corporation, without carelessness
      on his part, has received an injury that the plea that it was the fault of a fellow servant
      shall not be received. I dare say the gentleman's bill is a very good one, yet what objection
      can he have to the objects of this bill? Mr. GARDINER: It seems to me that we are wasting time
      unnecessarily. We might reach a more rational conclusion by considering the various bills that
      have been introduced. I favor the motion of the gentleman from Putnam (Mr. Gordon) that was so
      ably seconded by the gentleman from Floyd (Mr. Jewett,) not because I am in favor of
      engrafting on our statute books an act of the British Parliament, but if there is good to be
      found in an act of the British Parliament I see no reason why we should not utilize it. It
      seems to me to be a very proper subject for the Committee on the Judiciary
      to consider. There you will have these bills together and the gentleman from Dearborn (Mr
      Roberts) who is a member of that committee can then have an opportunity to enforce his
      views.
     Mr. BEASLEY: I do not desire to take the time of the House in further discussion of these
      two bills more than to say that I believe there is a general demand all over the State of
      Indiana for legislation on this subject. I believe the bill presented by the gentleman from
      Dearborn, (I know he is an able lawyer,) is a good one and covers the ground well. I believe
      that if the motion to reconsider prevail it would do nothing but to cause divisions between
      those who introduced the different bills and only delay consideration of them. I believe that
      the bill we now have under consideration covers the ground and covers it well, and I therefore
      move that the motion of the gentleman from Putnam do lie on the table.

     
     

     This motion was rejected by yeas 28, nays 65.

     Pending the vote--
     Mr. THOMPSON said: I wish to explain my vote. This bill was referred to the
       Committee on Corporations in good faith and that committee has reported
      favorably. It should not go again to another committee. I consider that an insult to any
      committee in this House. The committeed is composed of good lawyers, and they investigated it
      and made a favorable report in the House. Now I am opposed to transferring the action of one
      committee to another, and so I vote "aye," to lay the motion on the table.
     Mr. COX, of Miami: As that motion to lay on the table is lost I suppose this matter is
      debatable?
     
     The SPEAKER: That is what the books say.
     Mr. COX: If the Speaker says so I don't care what the books say. I would like to say
      just a word or two on this subject. It seems to me that there is some force in the remarks of
      Mr. Thompson. That bill was sent to a committee which was willing to investigate it. It
      reported favorably on this bill and I don't believe it is right now to refer it to the
       Committee on the Judiciary. If it is sent to the Committee on the
       Judiciary you will never hear from it again this term. It is sent there to be
      killed. Now then this is a radical measure. It is the most important measure of this character
      that will come before this House. It will affect more people than any other measure.
     Mr. GARDINER: The bill that was introduced by the gentleman from Floyd (Mr Jewett) was under
      discussion last night in the room of the Judiciary Committee, and there was
      no disposition to delay action upon it for one moment, but we knew that the present bill was
      to come before the House and we waited to see what disposition was made of it. We have no
      disposition to smother a bill embodying the provisions of this bill.
     Mr. COX: It is not altogether a disposition to do or not to do. The session is already
      advanced to a considerable extent. There is a United States Senator to elect. If any
      legislation is done at all it must be done promptly. I know that the railroad companies are
      opposing this bill. Every man is interested in it; he is interested in it because it proposes
      a great and needed reform, because it proposes to restore the law back to what it was fifty
      years ago and prior to the day when railroad companies came into existence. This evil has
      grown with their growth and strengthened with their strength and now there are more than two
      thousand decisions--railroad decisions--upon this question. I say railroad decisions because
      they are in the interests of the railroads. Sherman & Redfield, Section 86, say that the
      case of Priestley vs. Fowler never was an authority. That was followed by a case in South
      Carolina. This second one was founded on the first, which was never an authority but has given
      rise to the great array of decisions. The old doctrine was that the superior should respond in
      damages. That was without exception; the common law knew no exception. Then when that case was
      decided it did not decide the principle that was afterwards adopted as an authority, for now
      the courts say that there are two things that enter into every contract: first, when an
      employe of a railroad company makes contract he does it with an implied agreement that he will
      relieve the master from all responsibility for injury through the negligence of a co-employe;
      second, that the servant can better protect himself. Francis Wharton, the most philosophical
      writer on the law of this country to-day says that both of these are false. Sherman &
      Redfield say that the Legislature must be applied to. Now then the law is in this condition:
      no master--no railraad company is liable for the negligence of any co-employe. They say that
      the brakeman on the train and the train despatcher, the engineer who is on the locomotive and
      the trackman who is repairing the track, are co-employes, and so on through all the
      departments of these great railroad corporations. Every servant and employe, no matter if he
      is in authority, the engineer, or the conductor who has control of the train, is a co-employe
      of the trackman or track repairer and every other employe of the same company. Now then the
      question is whether this reform shall be granted by the Legislature. As suggested by the
      gentleman from Floyd (Mr. Jewett) Judge Woods also says the Legislature must be appealed to.
      Now I do not want to say anything that would be considered a reflection upon our courts of
      last resort; and it is no reflection on them, it is simply this: the Judges do not make the
      law, they follow precedents that make that great body of the common law that controls this
      country. And the Judges of our courts, when they come to con- sider a question of this kind must see what the precedents are and
      follow them. It is only from the Legislature that this relief can be granted. We should
      restore the law that the superior shall respond in damages, and do away with this exception
      that never had foundation in reason and never had any in law. I believe if the bill is
      recommitted that will be the end of it. If we want any legislation of this kind we must
      support this bill and pass it and send it to the Senate for their action, and we must do it
      now. I think that this bill proposes a radical reform, but it is supported by the best text
      books in the country. Now then just a word more, if this bill is radical let some gentleman
      explain wherein. I believe that the bill proposed by the gentleman from Dearborn (Mr. Roberts)
      is better than the law of Parliament. And I 'believe it would meet with the hearty
      support the people, I believe they want it, I believe that they demand it. In 1878 the
      Legislature of Wisconsin adopted a law very much like this and it was declared
      constitutional.
     Mr. LINCK: I desire to say but a word or two and that is, it seems to me that the remarks of
      the gentleman are unnecessary. I have not heard during the term of this Legislature that any
      member opposed a measure of this kind. I say that the reflections upon the Judiciary
       Committee is wholly unjustifiable. They have shown no disposition to bury this law.
      Last night we worked until eleven o'clock, and I think it was upon the suggestion of
      Judge Roberts that we delayed action upon this other bill. This is a matter that has become
      engrafted upon the common law for fifty years. We are in danger of going too far. There are
      two bills of similar import, and it is right and proper that they be sent to a committee aid
      be acted upon, and that the most proper bill should be brought before this Legislature. During
      the contention in this House no one can understand the import of bills read here at our
      clerk's desk. I think the best thing would to send the bill to the Judiciary
       Committee. There is no spirit there to bury this thing. There was not a dissenting
      voice in objection to this question.
     Mr. ROBERTS: That bill has never been before the Judiciary Committee.

     Mr. LINCK: I say a bill of similar import. It was delayed at your suggestion. It is too
      important a measure to be passed on in a day and should have full consideration.
     Mr. GROSE: I am a friend of this bill in some shape, but I don't want to vote on it at
      long range without, considering what we are doing. I do not believe there is anybody who wants
      to kill it or let it lay and die in the hands of a committee. I demand the previous
      question.
     This demand was seconded by the House, and under its operations the motion, (Mr.
      Gordon's) to recommit was agreed to by yeas 57, nays 37.
    
    
     CIVIL SERVICE.
     A majority of the Committee on the Judiciary reported in favor of the passage of Mr.
      Griffiths' bill [H. R. 39] to improve the civil service of the State.
     Mr. GRIFFITHS moved that the bill be made the special order for next Tuesday at two
      o'clock, to give time for a minority report.
     Mr. PATTON: I apprehend that this is a political matter, and I am convinced in my own mind
      that I do not want any civil service in mine. I therefore move that the report of the
      committee and the bill be indefinitely postponed.
     On motion by Mr. GORDON, this motion was laid on the table.
     The motion (Mr. Griffiths) was agreed to.
    
    
     SIX PER CENT. FOR SCHOOL FUND.
     Mr. Pleasants' bill [H. R. 10] to fix the rate of interest on school fund loans at six
      per cent. was returned from the Judiciary Committee--the majority
      recommending its indefinite postponement and a minority its passage.
     Mr. PLEASANTS I hope the minority report will be adopted. The rate of interest has been
      coming down so that it is possible for a man to undoubted good security and get  money at 6%. The present rate is working a very great hardship upon
      a great many counties. A poor class of farmers can get the money nowhere else and the counties
      have been compelled to take in land they cannot realize upon. The rate of interest being 8%
      the expense of securing them makes the interest on school fund loans ten or eleven per cent.,
      which is more than the State ought to ask any man to pay.
     Mr. GORDON: The proposition is to reduce the rate of interest on school funds from 8% to 6%.
      To do that would result in shortening the school term or increasing the taxation of the
      people. On the other hand I think an investigation was made about two years ago to see if
      there were any counties whose funds were not all loaned out. The report showed that 90% of
      school money in all the counties was loaned.
     Mr. IBACH: I am in favor of the majority report for I know that in my section of the State
      there is no trouble in loaning out school funds at eight per cent.
     Mr. MOCK: The question is, is the school fund to be for the accommodation of those who wish
      to borrow, or is it to be for the benefit of the school? An investigation was made two years
      ago and that investigation showed that the school funds can be readily loaned at 8%. In
      counties where it cannot be loaned it can be loaned in adjoining counties. I think that it can
      all be loaned at eight per cent.
     Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Owen: I am in favor of the minority report. I care not whether the money
      in the counties can or cannot be loaned at 8%. I believe that the principle is wrong. I
      believe that 6% is high enough for the school fund.
     Mr. ROBERTS: I have given this subject considerable consideration. While the intention of
      the law is that this fund should keep up the common schools of the State, yet I cannot
      conceive that it ever entered the heads of the legislators who passed that law that this fund,
      which came from the pockets of the people, should be made a source of privation to those whose
      necessities require that they should draw on this fund for their individual relief. One fact
      is clear, at the present rate of interest that school funds are loaned, other funds can be
      obtained from private individuals at cheaper rates. Who is it that borrows this money? It is
      not the rich, but as a rule it is farmers in limited circumstances, or poor persons who have
      real estate and necessity compels them to obtain money. Eight peer cent. is more than money is
      worth. Every money lender is opposed to reducing this rate. Why? Because it gives the private
      lender an advantage over the school funds. Reduce the interest upon these funds and you bring
      it within the reach of every man, in the State of Indiana to obtain it at reasonable rates. My
      friend from Putnam (Mr. Gordon) says that this will injure the school system. If it should for
      a time shorten the school term the grand object of giving the people who need money the
      benefit of these funds will be accomplished and great good will result from it.
     Mr. GARRISON: The people of my county, a great many of them, are in debt. If there was money
      enough to supply the demands of the people that are compelled to borrow, I should support the
      minority report. But inasmuch as all the school funds are loaned out, and part of our people
      are compelled to borrow money and pay a higher rate of interest; and inasmuch as the Auditor
      would be compelled to take 6%, if this bill should become a law, I am opposed to the minority
      report and in favor of the majority report.
     Mr. SHAMBAUGH: I will say that when I signed the minority report I believed the people
      should have the benefit of the money. I did not know whether there was a surplus in our county
      or not. I have, understood since that they have loaned all the money they have. Yet I maintain
      that the people to whom the money belongs ought to have the right to use that money at 6%. If
      I believed the passage of this bill would harm our public schools, I would be the last
      individual to raise my voice  in support of this minority
      report; but I do not think the schools will be injuriously affected. I have been advised that
      there are some of the counties that cannot loan out all their school funds, for the simple
      reason that the rate is too high; and that in some of the counties borrowers have notified the
      Auditor that they can get their money at a less rate, and so have refused to continue to keep
      their loans. I am in favor of the minority report.
     Mr. MCCALLUM: I favor the minority report for the reason that the
      interest on school loans is higher than any other interest in the State, saying nothing of the
      additional cost of procuring them. This I think is wrong. This money is loaned to poor
      people,--to men in hard circumstances. As to the effect on the school fund, I would not
      decrease the school fund but I would decrease the rate of interest and increase taxation. I
      would relieve the poor man in hard circumstances by placing a little more burden on the
      shoulders of the rich. No man would pay this rate if he could better his condition. Therefore
      the rate ought to be decreased. I hold that there is no man needs legislation worse than the
      man who is suffering under a mortgage; it is a mortgage on his time and his health; it is a
      mortgage on the time and health of his wife; it is a mortgage on his children's school
      opportunities, and it is a mortgage on everything that goes to make a happy home and happy
      family. Therefore I favor the minority report.
     Mr. THOMPSON: I am in favor of the minority report. The county that I represent has still
      three thousand dollars of school funds that are not loaned, and that will be increased unless
      the interest is reduced. Now as far as reducing the school term is concerned, I see no point
      in that whatever. The people are taxed at the rate of 8% to pay for these school funds; if the
      rate was reduced to 6% they could stand it better. I hope that this question will be carefully
      considered and that the minority report will be adopted.
     Mr. GOUGH: I signed this minority report and I think that should be the law. When the great
      State of Indiana comes to borrow some part of this fund what does she pay? Does she pay 8%?
      She does nothing of the kind, as you will see by the statement that the Governor makes. The
      State of Indiana borrows nearly four million dollars, not at 8% as the poor people of this
      State have to pay, but at 6% as we see here by the statement referred to. Our great mother,
      Indiana, borrows of this fund at 6% and she says to her children by her laws that they must
      pay 8%. I say that is unjust. The report of the Superintendent of Public Instruction shows
      that there are sixteen counties in the State where the school fund is not all loaned out, and
      that in 1875 the counties were compelled to pay more than thirty-two thousand dollars interest
      on this fund remaining unloaned.
     The minority report was substituted for the majority report by yeas 74, nays 21.
     The minority report was concurred in.
     Mr. MOCK moved to amend by increasing the rate of interest from "six" to "seven" per
      cent.
     On motion by Mr. THOMPSON, this motion was laid on the table.
     The bill was ordered engrossed.
     The House adjourned.

    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    IN SENATE.
    
     THURSDAY, January 27, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by J. M. Canfield, pastor of the Sixth Christian
     Church.
    
     STATE NORMAL SCHOOL
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore laid before the Senate the following communication:
     
     
     
      
       
        STATE OF INDIANA, EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT.
        
         Gentlemen of the Senate:
        

        In pursuance to the provisions of Section 4544, R. S. 1881, I appointed on the 22d day of
         February, 1886, subject to the approval of the Senate, Murry Briggs, of Sullivan county,
         and Joseph Gilbert, of Vigo county, as Trustees of the Indiana State Normal School, each to
         serve as such for the term of four years from the 20th day of December, 1885, and I now
         submit said appointment to the Senate for its confirmation.
        
         ISAAC P. GRAY,
         Governor.
        
       
      
     
     On motion by Mr. FOWLER, it was referred to the Committee on Executive
       Appointments.
    
    
     COMMON SCHOOL REVENUE.
     Also, a communication from the Superintendent of Public Instruction showing the average
      semi-annual apportionment for seventeen years to be: From State taxation, $666,618.05; from
      interest on common school fund $212,314.53; from interest on Congressional fund
      $86,332.87.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore ordered it to lie on the table and that two hundred copies be
      printed.
    
    
     THE INTIMIDATION LAWS.
     The Senate resumed the consideration of Mr. Rahm's bill [S. 7] to repeal Sections 2126
      and 2127 of R. S.
     Mr. WEIR moved that the bill be referred back to the Committee on Labor
      with instructions to amend Section 2127 R. S., so that the punishment by fine should not be
      less than one dollar and by imprisonment not less than six months nor more than two years.
     Mr. RAHM: It was stated on yesterday on the floor of the Senate that nobody was asking for
      the repeal of these sections known and commonly called "the intimidation law." That
      may be the case in Laporte and some other counties of the State, but in Vanderburgh county
      their repeal is demanded, not only by one party, but by all of them. The Republican party in
      convention, the Democratic party and the Labor party, each and every one passed unanimously a
      resolution instructing and requesting Representatives and Senators in the Legislature to urge
      the repeal of these two sections of the intimidation act. It is universally demanded; and who
      demands it? It is not the men who want to strike, it is not the anarchists and the roughs who
      demand it. It is the respectable part of the people that want its repeal, and why?  That law is enacted for the benefit of a certain class. It just
      protects railroad companies when they are amply protected in a dozen or fifteen other setions
      of the statutes. I would call the attention of members of the Senate to the following sections
      of the Revised Statutes, which amply cover all the criminal offenses named in the intimidation
      law: Section 1908 is in reference to manslaughter, and prescribes as punishment imprisonment
      in a State prison not more than twenty-one years, while the punishment in section 2127 is as
      high as twenty-one years in the penitentiary and one thousand dollars fine with
      disfranchisement and incapacity for holding any office of trust or profit if he interferes
      with or prevents, or attempts to prevent, the running of any railroad train. Yet, if he is
      convicted of manslaughter, he cannot be punished with imprisonment more than twenty-one years,
      but to interfere with the operations of a railroad company or the running of cars subjects him
      to a penalty more severe than that prescribed for manslaughter. There are many sections which
      apply to the punishment of offenders included in the intimidation laws all along through the
      statutes. Section 1981 refers to riot and could be made to punish all who interfere with hands
      working for corporations or individuals, as well as under 1982 and 1983; also sections 1909,
      1910, 1911, 1930, 1941, 1955, 1957, 1958, 1960, 1971 and 2169. Some of these sections are
      directly applicable and others indirectly. Section 1960 refers to persons obstructing railroad
      tracks and imposes a penalty of as high as fourteen years' imprisonment in the
      penitentiary, besides disfranchisement. Now why we should fear to repeal the sections referred
      to in this bill before the Senate I cannot see.
     Several Senators have stated that nobody has ever been punished under this law. Then, why
      keep it on the statute book. We got along all right until six years ago without such a law,
      and nobody complained, and why can't we get along just as well hereafter without it?
      There is no special reason why that law should stand on the statute books. If I have men at
      work for me at one dollar and six bits a day, there is no special law enacted to protect me in
      such a transaction, and there is no special law needed. We have no special law to help a
      furniture factory at Evansville or Tell City, or in this town, and why in the name of common
      sense should we have a law enacted for the express purpose of helping railroad companies?
     My business is almost exclusively with railroads and steamboats; and I have some warm
      friends among railroad men--presidents, directors, freight agents and conductors-and I am the
      last man who would want to repeal any law that would give any set of men the right to
      interfere with the workings of railroads. But every sensible railroad man will admit and agree
      that we have plenty of laws in that direction, and they don't need any more special
      legislation.
     These laws have been charged to Judge Turpie as their author, but Judge Turpie had nothing
      more to do with them than myself. The laws were so indefinite that a business man on reading
      them would not know what the law was. It take a Philadelphia lawyer to find out what the
      correct law was, and he wouldn't know. [Laughter.] The State employed Judge Turpie and
      others to compile the existing laws, to which the General Assembly added or repealed. The
      Commissioners had no power to enact new laws whatever. I remember well when those laws were
      passed. There were thirty-four members present on the floor of the Senate, or just a quorum,
      when one of the members, who was a railroad lawyer, moved that the bill be taken up and put on
      its passage. There were sixteen members who had not yet arrived in the hall from breakfast
      (myself included,) and it was put through on the hurry and spur of the moment. I do believe
      that railroad lawyers had something to do with these two sections of the intimidation law. If
      there was a necessity for such a law why didn't they enact it in 1879?
     
     Mr. WEIR [interrupting]: Will the Senator allow me to ask him a question?
     I won't allow any lawyer to interrupt me, for I hear they ask more questions than a business
      man can answer.
     In 1877 we had a big railroad strike in this country. Was such an intimidation law necessary
      then? If it was, why didn't the Legislature in 1879 enact these laws? There was
      protection enough on the statute books--the same protection we have to-day outside of these
      two sections. If a man enters upon another man's premises unlawfully he can be punished
      for it, and a railroad right-of-way belongs to the railroad. Their depots and their shops, and
      everything belonging to them, is the property of the corporation, and if I tresspass and am
      ordered off I have got to get off. If it was really necessary for the protection of railroad
      corporations to enact such a law, why didn't the Legislature of 1879 enact it? There was
      not a word said about it in that General Assembly, but in 1881 this law was passed by a
      Republican Legislature, signed by a Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives and a
      Republican Lieutenant-Governor who was President of the Senate and approved by a Republican
      Governor--or at least it is the law today.
     Mr. HUSTON [interposing]: Will the Senator permit me to ask a question?
     Mr. RAHM: No, sir; I don't want to answer anybody. I am particular about that. If my
      farmer Senatorial friend (Mr. Kennedy) wants to ask me a question I will answer him. The
      Senator from Fayette (Mr. Huston) knows that I am his friend, and it is not because I have any
      dislike for him that I refused to be interrupted, but I fear I may get cut out of my speech.
      In my section of the country, Mr. President, labor assemblies have urged the repeal of this
      law because it is a stigma upon a certain class of men who think it is unnecessary to
      legislate particularly in favor of corporations. Not one out of a hundred men in my district
      ever strike, and Evansville is as law-abiding a city as any man on the floor represents. And
      the people in my locality don't want it to be said that it requires a special law to keep
      them quiet. Since 1881, when this law was enacted, they have requested its repeal. They
      requested it in 1883 and I was ready to offer the proper bill, but at the request of a House
      member, who had introduced the bill in the House, I awaited its passage there, so as to take
      it up in the Senate. It met with opposition and was killed, and from appearances some Senators
      want to kill it here, or at least not to give us a fair chance to debate it. Its repeal was
      demanded in 1885, and it is demanded now.
     We have six daily papers in Evansville, four Democratic and two Republican, and we have six
      weekly papers, and, Mr. President, every one of these papers time and again in the strongest
      language, have asked and demanded the repeal of this infamous law.
     It there were no other laws on the statute book covering the points embraced in this I would
      be the last man to advocate its repeal, but under all the circumstances I say, gentlemen of
      the Senate, this bill, having received a favorable report from the committee, should be
      ordered engrossed. I hope you will look at all of the numbers of sections to which I have
      referred providing for the punishment of every offense named in the sections which we desire
      to be repealed, and I will be glad if each member between now and the time for the passage of
      the bill--say some time next week, which would give members plenty of time and opportunity to
      see if there is not law sufficient--will examine the question carefully and give us a fair
      chance for the repeal of the intimidation laws.
     Mr. BAILEY : I am opposed to the motion (Mr. Weir's.) It would practically kill the
      bill. It is a question of greater importance to the people of this State, and especially the
      class which it seeks to affect, than many members of this body seem to  appreciate or be willing to acknowledge. These laws were passed in
      1881; they were prepared by a railroad lawyer of that session and passed a by a Republican
      Legislature. It was signed by a Republican Speaker of the House (Mr. Ridpath,) and signed also
      by that parliamentarian monumental farce of a presiding officer, the Hon. Thomas Hanna, of
      Greencastle, then President of the Senate. I think the number of the bill was House Bill 393
      of that session. This legislation can be entirely traceable to Republican sources, and I take
      it as proper and consistent for the minority here to oppose the repeal of this odious and
      notorious section of the intimidation law; and it occurs to me quite as proper for the
      majority upon this floor, true to the traditions of their party, and to the platform and
      resolutions of their conventions, to strike forever this useless and unnecessary law from the
      statutes books of Indiana.
     Mr. SELLERS: If these sections are entirely useless, and others provide the same or more
      severe penalties, why is it, sir, the class of men you represent are so loud in their demands
      for the passage of this repealing bill?
     Mr. BAILEY: I have not said the punishment was more severe. The punishment provided in
      Section 2127 is outrageously severe. There it says a threat shall be punished with twenty-one
      years imprisonment--equal to that of manslaughter. For mere threatening, the courts have in
      some cases construed the consultation of men to prevent a reduction of wages, or about the
      supplanting of new men in their places, to be this very offence.
     Mr. WEIR: Can the Senator refer to any court that has given any such construction to a mere
      consultation? What court has done so?
     Mr. BAILEY: I was told last night that some court in Pennsylvania considered a mere
      consultation of some employes of a railroad to be a threatening that would come under the
      provision of Section 2127. I know there was a great deal of trouble in Pennsylvania, I think
      last year, on this subject, and these laws were printed in large black letters and placed all
      through the shops of railroads for the purpose of intimidating and cowering the men who were
      employed there. This is nothing but special legislation for the special purpose of protecting
      these railroad corporations, and I take it we may expect all railroad men and all railroad
      lawyers to oppose this bill which seeks to repeal these setions.
     Mr JOHNSON: Will the Senator I allow me to ask him a question?
     Mr. BAILEY: I will not.
     Mr. JOHNSON: He ought to come here prepared to answer all questions about this bill.
     Mr.BAILEY: I assume to be just, and demand as far as I am able the enactment of just and
      fair laws. I do not come as a railroad lawyer seeking legislation for corporations.
     Mr. JOHNSON: I would--
     Mr. BAILEY: I refuse to be interrupted.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Senator refuses to be interrupted.
     Mr. BAILEY: I desire to call attention to section 1981. [Reads, also sections 1982, 1983,
      1910, 1911, 1930, 1941, 1955, 1957, 1958 and 1916, commenting on each.] It seems to me these
      sections cover all possible offences described in the two sections sought to be repealed by
      this bill, yet some gentlemen would have these two sections stand out boldly as a menace. Why
      should these creatures of the State be better protected than are the humblest of her citizens?
      There has been a wide spread demand for the repeal of these sections. Since we have been in
      session over fifty assemblies have demanded their repeal. These statutes are odious to all
      classes of working people; they are useless and unnecessary and ought not longer to be
      tolerated. In the past few weeks the Indiana Journal has been teeming with abuse and charging
      Judge Turpie with the authorship of these sections. Why is it that righteous sheet should seek
      to abuse any man for aiding the passage or being the author of laws so just and good as in the
      opinion of the Senator  from Wayne (Mr. Johnson) these
      laws are? The truth is, as has been stated, that Judge Turpie had no more to do with the
      authorship or passage of those two sections than the men who bound the books or the typos who
      put them in type. I sincerely hope the motion of the Senator from Laporte (Mr. Weir) will not
      prevail.
     Mr. KENNEDY: Whatever I have I earned by labor, and I won't do a thing in the world to
      interrupt a man who is trying to make a living by honest labor. It is the source of all our
      wealth. There is no wealth produced except by labor. I am sorry to differ with my friend from
      Vanderburg (Mr. Rahm) in this matter, but I think laboring men ought to be protected in their
      rights. Everything ought to be done in fairness for the protection of laboring men when
      peacably at work. The class of people that make the most difficulty about this question is the
      class neighbor Jones used to tell about when I was a boy; a class of men that are going around
      hunting work and wishing they might not find it. You will never find these riots gotten up by
      laboring men. The great riots in Pittsburgh, that cost the State two or three million dollars
      was gotten up by those fellows who never do any work. Those men who got up the difficulty on
      the Haymarket in Chicago were not laboring men. These sections of the law are not intended to
      prevent men from laboring. I believe it is the right of any set of men to meet together and
      favor the laboring man's interest, and it is the right of anybody to quit laboring for
      another whenever he sees fit to do so. I have had men quit me in the harvest field; they have
      a right to quit, but not the right to say another man shall not work for me. Just as far as a
      laboring man goes without interfering with the right of others, I want that privilege granted;
      but it is striking at the very foundation of our Government to let any order get together and
      pass lawas and say "we will not work, and no one else shall." A laboring man has
      nothing to sell but his labor, and let him sell it as high as he can.
     Mr. JOHNSON : No one recognizes more fully than I that the labor question will be one of the
      questions of the future. There has been some how or other an unfair treatment of labor. It
      sometimes manifests itself by acts of violence. There is a screw loose somewhere. It is the
      province of men of broad minds to examine this question and see where to apply a solution. It
      demands the most advanced thought of the age. There is no class more honest in a desire to
      arrive at a great solution of the question than a great many who are included in the ranks of
      the labor organizations. But there is another class seeking to strike down these provisions of
      the law which are not only wise and just but which are also desirable because they are the
      statutory exponents of the most advanced thought of the day. The Senator from Marion (Mr.
      Bailey) comes in here with his face begrimmed with the smoke of the shops and proposes to
      strike from the statute book a statute whose only purpose is to prevent violation of law. The
      other day the gentleman was free to admit he thought one man attempting to prevent another man
      from working should be punished. There are many men who believe this law should stand who have
      never received one dollar from any railroad corporation. As far as I am personally concerned,
      although frequently employed against railroad companies, it has been my misfortune never to
      have been employed in there interest. I propose to be actuated by a higher sense of public
      duty. If the punishment prescribed in these two sections is too severe, why don't the
      Senator seek to amend that? Why seek to overturn them? To me the reason is apparent: the
      Senator is opposed to the principle of law and order and obedience to law, and is not
      satisfied because the penalty is out of proportion to the character of the offence. As far as
      Judge Turpie's connection with this statute is concerned all I have to say is, the paper
      which assailed him because he is in favor of  these laws
      has descended to demagoguery to do it. It is said they ought to be repealed because there are
      other laws covering the case; I say these statutes fill a long felt want: but is that any
      reason why they should be repealed? Who wants to repeal a law simply because it is covered by
      another law?
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: I would call the attention of the Senator to the fact that at
      this hour there is a special order, being the Knightstown Orphans' Home business, and if
      the Senator would as lief withhold his argument he shall have the floor when this subject
      comes up again.
     Mr. WEIR: I move the further consideration of this matter be postponed and made the special
      order for next Tuesday at two o'clock.
     This motion was agreed to.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: It requires no motion to take up the special order. The chair
      will not insist upon the Senator's yielding unless he so desires.
     Mr. JOHNSON: I am willing to yield the floor unconditionally.
    
    
     SOLDIERS' ORPHANS' HOME.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The question before the Senate is on Senate Bill 108, concerning
      the Soldiers' Orphans' Home.
     The clerk read the pending amendment to locate the Institution at Fort Wayne.
     Mr. WEIR: I enter a protest against the acceptance of this amendment by the author of the
      bill.
     Mr. MCDONALD): We have been making appropriations to Indianapolis, to
      Lafayette, to Bloomington, to Terre Haute, to Knightstown, to Logansport, to Richmond, to
      Vincennes, to Jeffersonville, and a most magnificent appropriation for an institution in the
      county of my excellent friend the Senator from Laporte (Mr. Weir.) We are asking an
      appropriation now for North-eastern Indiana, if this Institution is to be kept up. I take it
      that no fair-minded Senator can object to this Institution going to the beautiful city of Fort
      Wayne. The original proposition was to put it at Knightstown but the people demanded the
      soldiers' orphans should be separated from the feeble-minded children's asylum. We
      want to change the location and we can afford to justice to North-eastern Indiana. The State
      is not a pauper. No county pays taxes more cheerfully than the counties of Whitley and Allen.
      Can any Senator deny the fact that we are entitled to it?
     Mr. WEIR: Yes, sir, I deny the fact that any section of the State has any right to ask an
      appropriation the people's money for the benefit of any locality. Money should be
      appropriated for the benefit of the State. I am not in favor of entering into any arrangement
      for the benefit of any locality. The question is whether this appropriation should be made,
      and whether it is proper to make it out of the Treasury of the State. The question is: what
      are the needs of the public?
     Mr. MCDONALD: I agree with the Senator. But if there is to be an
      appropriation made to Knightstown, where is the inequity of giving it to North-eastern
      Indiana?
     Mr. WEIR: Satisfy me of the necessity.
     Mr. MCDONALD: Exactly; if there is no necessity I agree with the
      Senator;--but there is a necessity. If this Institution is to be fostered, I ask in the name
      of justice and common equity that the amendment be allowed.
     Mr. HOWARD, of St. Joseph: I understand this bill is in answer to a demand of the soldiers
      of the State. The very name of Knightstown has become an offence in the nostrils of every
      soldier in Indiana; and I understand the real question is as to the removal and separation of
      the feeble-minded children from the soldiers' orphans. The people of Indiana, and
      especially the soldiers, are unwilling these two institutions shall remain together, even in
      the same town. Two years ago the soldiers from all over the the State petitioned the General
      Assembly that these institutions should be separated. The people are not satisfied that the
      children of our soldiers should be kept under the influence and in the presence of feeble-  minded children. If our children become wards of the State
      we want when they go out in the world it shall not be said of them that they are graduates of
      Knightstown; leaving it doubtful whether of the feeble-minded school or the soldiers'
      orphans' home. We do not wish the name even; we do not wish they shall go in the same
      train of cars. I am in favor--very much in favor, of removing the Soldiers' Orphans'
      Home to Fort Wayne. But as the sentiment of the State seems to be strong against that, and
      inasmuch as the Knightstown Home was started by soldiers' money, I am willing the
      soldiers' orphans shall stay at Knightstown. Being the only city in the State which has a
      Revolutionary Hero for a patron I should like this institution to go to that great name-sake
      of Anthony Wayne, but if that is not the sentiment here, and it is desired that the
      soldiers' children shall remain at Knightstown, I am willing, and insist on the
      separation of the two schools, not by a few acres of ground, but a removal of the
      feeble-minded children to Fort Wayne.
     Mr. HARNESS: It occurs to me that before we pass upon this report, and especially the
      proposed amendment, it is time for us to halt. It is not necessary for the State of Indian to
      go to the expense of purchasing ten thousand dollars worth of land when we can have a
      sufficient amount of land offered free somewhere else. Howard county, one of the best in the
      State of Indiana, comes here with an offer, by her best citizens, proposing to donate for this
      home the amount of land they desire without the cost of a single dollar or a single cent paid
      out of the Treasury of the State. We propose more than that: we submit a proposition, backed
      up by the county officers and board of trustees, to sink a natural gas well in the vicinity
      where the institution may be located and furnish the institution with light and fuel free to
      the State. I do not know what Allen county may have to offer, but she has no better claim than
      has any other county in the borders of the State. Howard county has some claims: There never
      has been one dollar appropriated from the State funds within the border of Howard county; nor
      are we asking it on that ground. If these feeble-minded children are taken from the present
      institution--and I am in favor of it and would go as far as any man by vote and speech, to
      separate these two institutions, so it will be a separation not by an imaginary line, but
      leaving the soldiers' orphans at Knightstown and taking the others elsewhere--I am not in
      favor of going to the expense of buying ten thousand dollars worth of land if the land will be
      given by some other county to the State. In a short number of years you will find that outside
      of the natural gas district it will cost the State tens of thousands of dollars,--in a few
      years even,--for coal necessary for fuel. We are in the natural gas district and claim such an
      institution can be run there for one-tenth the cost it can in any other district of the State
      where you cannot furnish natural gas. Senators had better consider these things. I would not
      consider a few dollars or a few cents when it comes to the State providing a home for her
      soldiers' orphan children.
     Mr. MULLINIX: I have an interest in this matter; not so much as to the location, for I am
      not very particular where you locate the feeble-minded children, though I would prefer the
      feeble-minded children should remain at Knightstown. I would like to see the soldiers'
      orphans go to some place so that when they finish their education they may have the benefit of
      the close proximity of manufacturing interests, so when they go out in the world they may have
      an opportunity to engage in business. I have been favorable to taking the soldiers'
      orphans from Knightstown because as my comrade (Mr. Howard of St. Joseph) has said upon this
      floor, Knightstown has become odious to soldiers. An application has come up here to remove
      the soldiers' orphans from among the feeble-minded--to remove the children of those
      gallant men who sleep the sleep of death  to-day, and who
      offered their lives in defence of the great and glorious flag ghat now waves over us. These
      institutions should be separated; they must be separated; and the man who places himself upon
      record not in favor of separation can't be a candidate for any office in the State of
      Indiana or he will take a march to the rear. I would prefer this institution shall go to Fort
      Wayne. It won't be many years until there will be no soldiers' orphans--a half
      century more and all the children will have passed along with their fathers. We owe more to
      them than to any other orphans in the country and we don't want to bring them up along
      side and under the influence of the feeble-minded. They should be fed upon the best food, and
      sleep upon the softest beds, and receive the best attention, because they deserve it. I will
      favor any measure that has in view the separation of these two institutions. I never will cast
      my vote for any man or any party, I care not who they are, that is not willing to take these
      children of the soldiers from among the feeble-minded.

     Mr. SHIVELY: I desire to say a word or two defining my position upon this question. The bill
      before the Senate is an important one. It proposes to separate the soldiers' orphans from
      the feeble-minded children of the State, a thing that most assuredly ought to be done. And as
      far as I have heard an expression from Senators upon this floor upon this subject they are
      favorable to such a separation. The only question appears to be in what way can this be
      accomplished? I think the most expedient measure would be to place the feeble-minded children
      in one of the new insane hospitals, as suggested in the Governor's message.
     The time having arrived for the meeting of the Joint Convention Senators repaired to the
      hall of the House of Representatives to ballot for a United States Senator. When the
      returned--
     The Senate took a recess for dinner.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     Mr. KENNEDY: The Sixth Congressional district of Indiana is the best educated of any in the
      United States. In the census report of 1880 you will see the least number live in that
      district that cannot read and write than in any other district in the United States. The
      Soldiers' Orphans Home is surrounded by men who labor and are united for its advancement.
      I am for the bill with some amendments. It would not be acting in good faith to the people who
      donated fourteen thousand dollars to the erection of this institution for the soldiers'
      orphans, to take it away. No better site could be had; and no better community can be found. I
      will vote for the feeble-minded children to go to Fort Wayne.
     Mr. WEIR: Would the Senator give Allen county the preference over Howard county if Howard is
      willing to give the land?
     Mr. KENNEDY: If it is to be set up to the highest bidder I will knock it off to the highest
      bidder. [Laughter.] I think it would be doing justice to give it to Fort Wayne as it was the
      first to make application. I agreed with my friend (Mr. Barrett) that I would help him and I
      never go back on my word. I stand right there, but if it is to be sold out, that is a new
      deal, and I would be for giving it to the highest bidder, all other things considered.
      [Renewed laughter.] Not being a lawyer or a preacher, in the excitement of being interrupted
      it kinder knocked me off and broke into my speech. I want to get back. I believe we ought to
      look at this matter calmly and dispassionately. We don't want to appropriate money that
      is not needed, nor start a building that will tumble down for want of a proper foundation. No
      doubt the State at the proper time will make suitable preparation for her wards as it may be
      needed. The State located the home at Knightstown, and the Grand Army of the Republic in this
      State seeing the situation, got up this bill for the re-establishment and the support of this
      institution. Every man that gets up here takes the time 
      to say that these schools must be separated. There is no man but what is committed to that
      without an argument. My opinion is, if you do find a man not in favor of it, if he was not an
      associate with feeble-minded children in his younger days, I am mistaken. [Laughter.] I felt
      like it was necessary for me to say this much as the home is adjoining my counties. These
      things need not be argued. I think the whole thing will be righted up and we might as well
      call the previous question and vote for it.
     Mr. HARNESS offered an amendment locating the institution at or near Kokomo, in Howard
      county, and embracing the proposition as stated in his remarks this forenoon. [page 216.]
     Mr. WINTER: There is no question as to the propriety of separating these two institutions,
      but it is not necessary that either one should be removed to Fort Wayne or to Kokomo. It can
      be just as effectively done by remaining at Knightstown. The Governor has said to us in his
      message that this is a question of paramount importance. He has shown the debt of the State to
      be considerable because of the erection of the three new Asylums for the Insane and other
      things. There was a time debt when the State was practically out of debt. We have now a bonded
      debt of seven millions of dollars, and the interest on this debt is a great burden on the
      people. The carrying on of the State Government is going to be a serious burden for the tax
      payers and we ought not unnecessarily to impose upon the tax payers any other burdens. This
      bill contemplates a complete and total separation of the Asylum from the Soldiers'
      Orphans' Home. We have laid on our tables a communication from Mr. Smith, one of the
      trustees of the institution at Knightstown, who is more familiar with the facts than any
      Senator here, and in that communication he calls attention to the fact that the Morrison
      property can be purchased for about eight thousand dollars, and to put it in a condition in
      which it will be suitable for the care of the inmates the Asylum for feeble-minded children
      for all time to come an expenditure of six thousand dollars would be all that is required.
      This bill provides for an appropriation of eight thousand dollars, and an additional
      appropriation for putting this building in suitable condition of but three thousand dollars. I
      have been informed by a gentleman greatly interested in this home for Orphans that the
      Morrison property is an elegant residence built by Probasco, of Cincinnati, and it contains
      twenty-two rooms. In the statement of Mr. Smith which we have here, there is stated to be a
      property one mile from Knightstown and three miles from the present Orphans' Home eight
      acres and a house with fourteen large rooms and five small rooms which can be purchased for
      eight thousand dollars and with an expenditure of six thousand dollars can accommodate one
      hundred and fifty children. I presume this statement is correct and that the trustees in
      recommending the purchase of this property acted upon their best judgment. Their
      recommendation is for fourteen thousand dollars while the bill cuts down their appropriation
      three thousand dollars, and calls for but eleven thousand dollars. The Morrison property is
      three miles from the Soldiers' Orphans' Home. It is not only separated by three
      miles but by a river which runs between. There could not be a more complete separation than is
      contemplated by these two bills. There will be as complete a separation as could be by
      locating one at Kokomo or Fort Wayne. But another consideration should weigh with us and that
      is the saving of expense to the people of Indiana. Here is a bill which contemplates but
      eleven thousand dollars to make a suitable appropriation. The amendment proposed by the
      committee and which contemplates a location at Fort Wayne, contemplates an 
       appropriation
       appropriatlon
       of ten thousand dollars for the purchase of land, and then on top of that forty
      thousand dollars for the erection of buildings, or thirty-nine thousand dollars more than the
      location at Knightstown. The proposition for the location at Kokomo con-  templates that the real estate shall be donated, but leaves the
      forty thousand dollars for the erection of buildings, leaving an appropriation twenty-nine
      thousand dollars more than the location at Knightstown. In one case thirty-nine thousand
      dollars of the people's money is proposed to be spent unnecessarily, and in the other
      case twenty-nine thousand dollars. It would be making a large expenditure of money at a time
      when the people cannot afford to bear it. But there is still another consideration: All agree
      that provision shall be made for a Soldiers' Orphans' Home. That rests upon us as a
      sacred obligation. A bill on that subject will pass, and it will require a considerable sum of
      money. We are in possession of a valuable property over there, and we must consider that the
      use of a soldiers' orphans' home is not to be perpetual. In the course of ten years
      the orphans of soldiers will no longer be an expense upon the State. In a few years the
      soldiers themselves will become old and it can be turned into a Soldier's Home, and then
      this institution which will cost the State perhaps one hundred thousand dollars will be thrown
      upon the State without use. If the location of these institutions remain at Knightstown,
      perhaps in the lapse of time the Probasco property will not be adequate to the demand, and
      they can be transferred to the Soldiers' Home which will be no longer needed for the
      soldiers' orphans. If the feeble-minded institution is located at Kokomo or Fort Wayne,
      in twenty years hence, the Soldiers' Home will be no longer needed.
     Mr. SELLERS: From the first I have been in favor of removing the soldiers' orphans from
      Knightstown. The very name of Knightstown has become odious to the people of Indiana because
      of its connection with that other institution;--the two have been associated together because
      located at the same place. The soldiers have been clamoring and asking that these orphans
      should be removed from association with or contamination with these feeble-minded children.
      That that will be done there seems to be no doubt. Now the question arises what will we do
      with the feeble-minded children? The Governor has recommended that they be sent to one of the
      new insane asylums. Ordinarily I would favor a recommendation of the Governor, but I beg leave
      to differ with him on this one. I would as soon vote to send the incorrigable youth to the
      State prisons to be subject to the contaminating influences of associating with condemned
      criminals, as I would to send these unfortunate children to that hell on earth--an insane
      asylum. If the State cannot afford to maintain a separate institution for the feeble-minded
      children we had better give up our State government and attach ourselves to Illinois where
      they keep--
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion, [interposing]: I understand it was the intention of the Governor
      that the idiotic should occupy one of the new buildings entirely to themselves.
     Mr. SELLERS: If that be true there would not be so much objection. Yet after four hundred
      thousand dollars has been appropriated by the people for each one of these buildings, and it
      will take from one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand dollars more to keep them
      running, is it possible we are to have that much money invested for the purpose of taking care
      of these people, when every poor-house in the State contains from one to six incurable insane
      who would be crowded out if one of these buildings is taken for these feeble-minded children?
      We are called upon to determine whether this institution shall go to Fort Wayne, to Kokomo or
      to an old tumble-down farm house three miles from the soldiers' home. If the State of
      Indiana can of afford to take care of her unfortunates, she can afford to do more than buy an
      old farm house and waste six thousand dollars in putting it in repair for use, without any
      assurance but that the building will need repairs every year. It is not good policy to buy a
      second-hand building for the use of the State any more than it is good policy to buy second-
        hand furniture or clothing for our own use. We ought
      not to make foolish or unnecessary appropriations. That being disposed of, there seems to be
      but two propositions left: to locate at Fort Wayne or at Kokomo. As far as the proposition
      from Kokomo is concerned we take our chances upon their raising the money by voluntary
      contribution. The county of Howard has no more right to donate to the State than it has to
      donate to me. This question must be disposed of now, and are we to take a chance of this kind?
      or shall we vote it to the place that pays the State the highest consideration?
     Mr. WEIR: Has not the State done that with other institutions?
     Mr.SELLERS: I suppose it perhaps it has been done, but it is not to the credit of the State.
      I know there is a great deal of crime committed in Fort Wayne, but I am prejudiced in favor of
      Fort Wayne because it has railroad advantages over Kokomo. The city of Fort Wayne is second in
      wealth in the State, and that part of the State has no institution belonging to the State, and
      it is but fair that we should give this one to the north-eastern portion. Then there is one
      institution within twenty miles of Kokomno--the insane hospital at Logansport. Now let these
      institutions be equitably distributed. If the Senate thinks the appropriation too large, cut
      down the amount. That we ought to do, to the very lowest possible figure.
     Mr BARRETT: The other day I moved an amendment [see page 158] to Senate Bill 6 to locate the
      Soldiers' Orphans' Home near Fort Wayne. I then gave reasons [see page 155] why I
      thought this institution should be located in accordance with the policy which has been
      adopted from the organization of the State in the distribution of public institutions. It
      seems to me every Senator on this floor has come here with the determination to see that these
      two institutions are separated ; and that is in accordance with a demand from the people of
      the State. In separating them they ought to be separated so far that there will be no further
      cause of complaint on that ground. The north-eastern is equal to any other portion of the
      State in population and wealth, and a peer in intelligence; and I say if the policy of the
      State is right, it is not fair that the public institutions shall be located around and, near
      the city of Indianapolis. My section of the State has had to acquiesce in the payment of its
      share of taxes for these institutions, and it asks equal and exact justice. Coming as I do
      from the metropolis of North-eastern Indiana I say it is right and fair for this institution
      to be located near her, because she is a great city in population, in wealth and in railroad
      facilities. There has been a great cry for economy here, and I am glad to see it comes from
      distinguished Senators who were int he last Legislature. I will stand with any Senator to
      guard against any possible outrage upon the Treasury. If we are to be generous let us be
      generous with those whose intellects have been clouded and who are to-day suffering for the
      sins of their fore-fathers even to the third or fourth generation. As to the number of
      soldiers' orphans in the State the report of the Superintendent of the Home shows that
      those cared for and the possibilities of the future number two hundred and fifty-two. As to
      the number of feeble-minded children in the State the census of 1880 shows five thousand
      imbecile and feeble-minded in Indiana. There is not a Senator but knows that all over the
      State of Indiana these poor unfortunates are found wandering through the streets and highways
      of every village in the State; and they should be all provided for. The chairman of the
       Committee on Benevolent Institutions informed the Senate that it was
      impossible to send these children to one of the insane asylums because there is no room for
      them. After the three new asylums are completed and filled there will be eight hundred and
      thirty or nearly one thousand insane persons unprovided for. There is no subject which appeals
      stronger to kindness and every good element in man  than
      the providing of homes for the unfortunate.
     Mr. HUSTON: I feel that having the honor of representing Henry county upon this floor it is
      but right and becoming that I should say a few words on the pending question. It has been
      intimated upon this floor by various Senators that there possibly might be some member who
      would be inclined to vote that the feeble-minded children and the soldiers' orphans still
      be kept together in one institution. I credit each and every member with too much conscience
      and too much sense of justice and too much patriotism to entertain for a moment such a view.
      No one will go farther than myself to do my full duty as a citizen to the soldiers'
      orphan; nor will any one go farther than I in providing a place, for the care of the
      unfortunate children of the State. The question is as to how best to make that change. We are
      informed by the chief executive that the State's exchequer is low. We know the people of
      Indiana are greatly burdened with taxation, consequently I believe it not my duty to entail an
      additional cent of expense upon them. If it were necessary--absolutely necessary--that the
      removal should be made to Fort Wayne or to Kokomo I would not question the item of expense,
      but as has been said the proposition to move to Fort Wayne entails an expenditure of ten
      thousand dollars for ground forty thousand dollars for buildings.
     Mr.WEIR: And what in the end would be the probable cost of the building?
     Mr. HUSTON: A good suggestion. We all know estimates of the cost of public buildings fall
      short of the amount required to pay the sum total. This handsome building [the State House]
      was to cost but two millions of dollars, but I venture the assertion that three millions will
      come nearer covering its actual cost before we are through with it. It is proposed to move
      this institution to Kokomo, a beautiful village in an excellent locality, and I feel that the
      people there have made a liberal proposition, but a removal there will entail an expenditure
      of as much money to erect buildings as though the removal was to Fort Wayne, and as much to
      furnish the building at either place as if the institution remained at Knightstown. That
      brings us back to Knightstown. The proposition is not to buy an old worn out farm building, as
      suggested by the Senator from White (Mr. Sellers.) I am informed that the building proposed to
      be proposed is, as has been said, three miles from the present Soldiers' Orphans'
      Home. It is a building erected at cost of twenty-two thousand dollars for the building, and
      the ground embraces about eight acres. We have a statement in reference to that from the Hon.
      Ben. L. Smith, who I know intimately, and who is as thoroughly in sympathy with the
      unfortunate as any man in the State--a man I respect and I admire, and the only thing I can
      say against him is that he votes the Democratic ticket; but nevertheless, when he makes a
      statement I believe it to be true. There never has been to my knowledge since the
      establishment of that institution as many as a hundred and fifty inmates at one time. It has
      been said that it is desirable to remove this institution as far as possible from Knightstown.
      I want to say in defence of the good people of Henry county that they are as moral and as
      upright and as good citizens as can be found in any county in the State of Indiana. I know a
      few years ago, coupled with the Soldiers' Orphans' Home there were evil reports that
      will not even bear the mention, and I only refer to the fact to say that it was not due to the
      conduct of any citizen of Henry county, but that the investigation which led to the exposure
      and removal of the hellish fiend that perpetrated the outrage, were set on foot by the good
      and loyal people of Henry county. The charges of immoral conduct were made against that man
      Goar and that man White, but they were not included in the Republican host of Henry county. I
      sincerely trust before we take any definite action on this question that we give it the
      consideration  to which it is entitled. The State is not
      in a condition to put on foot plans that will require the expenditure of a large amount of
      money. The people about Knighttown have pride in this institution, and I feel that Knightstown
      is entitled to this institution and can see no reason why we at this time should foist upon
      the State an expenditure of thousands of dollars when it can be avoided.
     Mr. WEIR: I feel a very deep interest in the matter under consideration and I want to have
      it distinctly understood that I am as much in favor of a separation of the Soldiers'
      Orphans' Home from the Asylum for feeble-minded children as any one. I believe it should
      be done; I believe there is a demand for it; and I believe the demand is justified. But there
      are other considerations in connection with it. It has been stated that certain things were
      agreed to. How were they agreed to? Who are parties to the agreement? And I would like to know
      how agreements of this description are ratified in a legislative body. I consider myself
      interested in any matter pending here, and I never proposed to enter into any agreement as to
      what shall be the determination of this body on any question. What has brought about this
      condition of things? First, a bill was introduced by the Senator from Whitley (Mr. McDonald)
      to provide for the establishment of a Soldiers' Orphans' Home. That I am willing to
      support with my vote and anything I can do to influence anyone else, if influence is
      necessary. That bill was prepared by those who represent the soldiers'
      orphans',--by, a committee representing the soldiers of the Grand Army of the Republic of
      this State. Then it became a question what is to be done with the feeble-minded children? And
      that Senator, in the fullness of his heart, immediately answered that question by introducing
      a bill providing for the feeble-minded children an Asylum at Knightstown,--one Senator says to
      purchase an old tumble-down farm house. There is no evidence that it is an old tumble-down
      farm house. The bill asks for an appropriation of eleven thousand dollars. As long as it
      stayed in that condition everyone was in favor of it. But after a little, some one recollects
      a fraud that was committed on the people of Indiana a few years ago when institutions for the
      insane were scattered all over the State at a time when five hundred thousand dollars would
      have provided accommodations for more inmates than all three of these buildings which, with
      what has been appropriated and what is necessary, will cost nearer a million than eight
      hundred thousand dollars. Now it is discovered that perhaps here is a chance for the people of
      Howard county or of Allen county to obtain an appropriation of a large amount of money at the
      expense of the tax-payers. There is not a single Senator, or a person in this presence, who
      has given attention to the erection of public buildings but knows that when fifty thousand or
      a hundred thousand dollars is appropriated for their construction it means one hundred
      thousand or two hundred thousand dollars instead of the fifty thousand or a hundred thousand
      dollars appropriated; I care not whether it is built in Allen or in Howard county. The
      question is: what is the need of appropriating such an amount of money? We have a large
      delegation here from Fort Wayne and they are all very anxious that this appropriation should
      be made to Allen county, every member of it, in order that a fine building shall be erected in
      Allen county, more than for the purpose of providing a home for the feeble-minded. And they
      are not more selfish than any other locality. The first amendment is accepted by the author of
      the bill, but he did not see the necessity of it when he introduced the bill. Now if Senators
      will examine the condition of the State's finances they will find that appropriations are
      asked for amounting to nearly two millions of dollars. It is an easy matter to vote away money
      to found institutions, but it is a harder one for the people to earn it and pay taxes to raise
      the money to pay it. If Senators will stop and consider this question and realize the fact that with twenty thousand dollars they can provide
      for these feeble-minded children without delay and answer this demand to separate them from
      the soldiers' orphans, they will not sit here and vote to appropriate money for an
      institution, to gratify a certain locality, that in the end will cost the State from a hundred
      and fifty thousand to two hundred thousand dollars.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: The first proposition is the creation of an institution for the care of the
      feeble-minded. I believe the sentiment of the county is for it, and therefore I shall vote to
      establish it. As to the amount to be expended, that is to be determined by what is necessary.
      I presume the institution will not be carried on in an extravagant way. When we determine we
      will establish it, the next thing to determine is where will we locate it. It is the settled
      policy of Indiana; to distribute her benevolent institutions over the State. It might have
      been wiser in the beginning to have located them all at the Capital, but it was not done, and
      it is now so well settled there is no hope that policy will be done away with. We find the
      State prisons are distributed, one in the northern and one in the southern part of the State;
      the Hospitals for the insane are at Indianapolis, Logansport, Richmond and Evansville; the
      State University at Bloomington; the Normal School at Terre Haute; Purdue University at
      Lafayette; the Reform School in Hendricks county, and we have a Soldiers' Orphans'
      Home at Knightstown. I do not controvert the statement made about there being an especial
      moral people there, but conceding all that, we propose to maintain the Soldiers'
      Orphans' Home there; for we have agreed to support this institution. I don't believe
      in maintaining the two institutions together. The whole north-eastern quarter of the State is
      without a State institution, and as we have adopted this distributive system, and as we are
      determined to separate the two institutions under consideration, I am going to vote to locate
      one of them in the north-eastern quarter of the State and will therefore vote for the location
      at Fort Wayne. I would favor Kokomo but it is within twenty-two miles of the institution at
      Logansport. Let us put this new institution in that quarter where they have none.
     Mr. JOHNSON: This subject has been so thoroughly discussed by the Senate I don't think
      I can throw any additional light on it, but I feel as if the importance of the question is one
      which calls for an expression of some few more thoughts. I think I know the sentiment of my
      constituency, and I would be direlict to duty if I failed to give voice to that sentiment. If
      there ever was a time in the history of this State when her charitable institutions were
      portioned out solely on the ground of geographical situation, the sooner we abandon such a
      policy the better, because it is no good ground for such distribution. I should think the
      first part of the remarks of the dignified Senator from Allen (Mr. Barrett) was based upon the
      erroneous theory that we should consider the geographical location as of paramount importance.
      It is too frequently the case in legislation that our individual desire to get something for
      our own locality overrides our better judgment. It seems to me there is no section of this
      State which has any peculiar claims for the location of an institution, as against other
      public and paramount considerations. If we had a State out of debt and the question should
      come up, I am free to admit I would be perfectly willing to see one of these institutions
      located at Fort Wayne. I think each one of these classes should be the object of the
      solicitude of the people. The unfortunates who are susceptible of a certain amount of
      intellectual and moral education should be recipients of our generosity, and no man will go
      beyond me in desiring to legislate for the betterment of their condition; and the children of
      those men who went to the rescue of our country in the hour of its peril, and laid down their
      lives upon the altar of their country for the perpetuity of our free institutions--each one of
      these class-  es is worthy of our earnest support. If the
      financial condition of our State were such as to justify the additional expense I would be
      willing that they should be 
       separated
       seperated
       by a vast distance, and one taken to a locality which has heretofore been denied any
      of the State asylums and therefore has a superior claim; but we are not in that condition. We
      have to make liberal appropriations to complete this magnificent building; we are required to
      make large appropriations for the finishing of the three new Asylums for the insane; we are
      compelled to take steps to meet the interest on the public debt; and we have a vast amount of
      expenses for which appropriations must be made. With that condition of affairs what shall be
      done? Here are two classes of the State's wards. As far as I am personally concerned
      while I am unwilling that the feeble-minded shall be neglected if one class has to yield to
      another, to a certain extent, I am resolved, to a certain extent, I am resolved and determined
      that the soldiers' orphans shall have paramount claim to my voice and vote. I believe
      they are paramount to any class that can come to the Legislature and ask for relief. I am
      satisfied that the placing of one of these institutions at Kokomo or Fort Wayne will require
      an enormous expenditure of money. I honor the gentleman from Allen in favoring the town he
      lives in. We all take pride in the flourishing city of Fort Wayne; but to take these
      feeble-minded children from Knightstown, where they can be provided for at reasonable
      expenditure of money, to Fort Wayne where there will have to be a large appropriation made, is
      not economy or public policy. It is said that land will be donated at Kokomo, but if
      sufficient land is given there every Senator knows that a building must be erected there
      commensurate with the character of the donation of land. It would take three or four times the
      amount necessary to maintain a separate institution at Knightstown, were we to establish the
      Asylum at Fort Wayne or Kokomo. For that reason I am unwilling to do it. The financial
      condition of the State is such that we cannot afford to do so. I am not in favor of locating
      the Asylum for the feeble-minded either at Fort Wayne or Kokomo, nor do I ask that it shall be
      located in either one of the insane asylums. It is utterly incongruous to associate the
      feeble-minded with the insane. They ought to be separated by impassible barriers. No
      feeble-minded child with a mind capable of having some intelligence invested in it ought to be
      placed in juxtaposition with those hopelessly insane or those deprived of their mind for the
      time being. Then the question comes home to us: What is to be done whereby the needs and wants
      of the feeble-minded will be fully met, without going into the extravagant expenditures to
      which I have referred? This bill as introduced meets my approval. It has been said that the
      soldiers demand that a division of these two classes shall be made. It has always been my
      understanding that the soldiers were not asking that the soldiers' orphans shall be
      removed or that the feeble-minded children shall be removed from there, but that they simply
      should be separated and orphans taken away from the feeble-minded. The most exacting demand
      that has been made by any man would be met by separating the feeble-minded from the orphans in
      the manner which has been provided in this bill. The Soldiers' Orphans' Home is
      situated one mile and-a-half south of Knightstown; this Morrison property is one-and-a-half
      mile in an entirely different direction; the separation and divorcement would be complete and
      absolute and every soldier would say so. A further separation would cost an immense
      expenditure when the State cannot afford it, and that should be a good explanation, and in my
      judgment a sufficient one. In a short time there will be no longer need for an institution for
      soldiers' orphans, and these feeble-minded children, which are a growing class, when an
      opportune time comes, and when soldiers' orphans no longer need a Home,--these
      feeble-minded can be transferred and maintained  there.
      For these considerations I must vote against the amendment of the Senator from Allen (Mr.
      Barrett) much as I regret to do so.

     Mr. MARSHALL: It seems we are all agreed that the orphans of the soldiers shall be left at
      Knightstown. In 1867 the Legislature appropriated money and there was built at Knightstown a
      Home for the orphans of soldiers. Eight or nine years after, the feeble-minded children Asylum
      was located there, and the same Board which had charge of the soldiers' orphans had
      charge of the feeble-minded children. The soldiers had just cause for complaint, and have at
      every session since called upon the General Assembly to take the feeble-minded children out
      from amongst their children; and they make no unreasonable demand. They have a right to ask
      the State of Indiana not to be placed in connection with the feeble-minded; not that they are
      better, but just as good as other children. Several Senators on this floor have said it would
      be good policy to remove the idiotic children one or two miles, but I say when removed from
      Knightstown remove them so far that there can be no possibility of their coming in contact.
      Whether you take their Asylum to Fort Wayne or to Howard county, I do not care. The soldiers
      demand that the separation shall be made, they care not so much whether to Kokomo, Ft. Wayne,
      or to Attica, in my county. Not that the soldiers have any objection to they people of Henry
      county; but from the time the Legislature sent the feeble-minded in company with their
      children there, they received an insult.
     Mr. TRIPPETT: I am in favor of the amendment of the Senator from Allen (Mr. Barrett) because
      the Post of the Grand Army of the Republic in my town sent me a petition that I should
      advocate the removal to Fort Wayne, and by all means have these institutions separated by a
      long distance. They will not be content to have both remain at Knightstown I think, as has
      been said on the floor of the Senate. If these institutions are to be scattered over the State
      let us be fair and let us be just. There can be no denial of the fact that North-eastern
      Indiana is entitled to an institution of this kind. The fact that we should have separate
      institution for the feeble-minded of the State is apparent to anyone who will think of it. I
      venture to say there is not a poor-house in the State of Indiana but has some poor
      feeble-minded child confined in it, where it grows up with the paupers of the county. I hope
      the amendment to the amendment will be lost, and the amendment to establish the institution at
      Fort Wayne will be carried. The State of Indiana is plenty able to support an institution of
      that kind. There his been a great deal said about economy; and that the State is in debt. To
      my mind the State of Indiana cannot go into debt with any more honor than she can go into debt
      to build an institution of this kind. It is something we should do, because the people of the
      State demand it. For my part I am willing to vote for a bill appropriating one hundred
      thousand dollars to build an institution for the feeble-minded. I agree with the Senators who
      condemn the action of the Legislature in building the three new immense Insane Asylums. There
      has been spent upon these Insane Asylum so much money that for every patient they accommodate
      the room for each patient has cost about fifteen hundred dollars. There is no necessity for
      building rooms of that kind. An institution for feeble-minded can be built to accommodate all
      in the State at the rate of fifteen or twenty dollars each.
     Mr. DRAKE: If this bill contemplated a temporary home for the feeble-minded it might be said
      it would do to buy a moss-covered farm house for a couple of years use; but this bill means a
      permanent home, a home not for the year 1888 but for the next hundred years, or the next
      thousand years perhaps, if the world shall stand so long. Whether you establish it at
      Knightstown, at Kokomo or at Fort Wayne it will cost the people of the State of Indiana as
      much to establish a suitable, permanent home at 
      Knightstown as at Fort Wayne and I am not so sure but it will cost more. If we establish this
      home in an old moss-covered farm house at Knightstown the next Legislature will be called upon
      to erect suitable buildings. Every man who understands the cost of building knows it will cost
      just as much to erect this building at Knightstown as at Fort Wayne, for building material and
      brick and stone is as cheap at one place as the other. I have not heard it said that this farm
      house would be a permanent home, hence I am in favor of the amendment of the Senator from
      Allen (Mr. Barrett) because one of the arguments made is, that in justice to a proper
      distribution of the public buildings of the State Allen county is as good a place as can be
      found for this one. The great State of Indiana contains two millions of people and it will not
      do to say she is not able to assess her people fifty thousand dollars for a home for the
      feeble-minded, and it cannot be said that is too much; if anything it will be too little, to
      furnish a proper and decent home for such unfortunate creatures. Therefore I am in favor of
      the amendment of the Senator from Allen because it will cost no more to build a permanent home
      in Allen than in Henry or any other county.
     Mr. MCDONALD addressed the Chair.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Senator has the floor to close the argument.
     Mr. MCDONALD: If no other gentleman wishes to be heard I will proceed to
      make what I conceive to be a fair statement of this matter. I offered these bills in good
      faith believing they met with the wishes of the people; but after consultations with Senators
      and others, and when I found the tide of remonstrances from soldiers of Indiana, I am honest
      enough to say, and I have the courage to say, that I was mistaken; and that public sentiment
      is not with that bill. The people of Indiana and the soldiers demand that there shall be a
      separation of these two institutions; and there is no use of trying to dodge it; we have got
      to meet it. It is urged that the Governor has said that the children should go to one of the
      new Insane Asylums. I have great respect for Governor Gray as a gentleman, but Governor Gray
      is as liable to be mistaken as the humble Senator from Allen and Whitley. After these new
      Asylums are filled there will be twelve hundred insane people in the State uncared for. We
      must take the facts and face them as they are. Then that proposition falls. In the matter of
      necessary expenditure for the care of these unfortunates no man, not even the Honorable
      Senator from Laporte (Mr. Weir,) will go farther than the humble Senator who represents the
      good people of the counties of Allen and Whitley on this floor. As chairman of the
       Joint Committee on Claims I propose that no proposition and no man shall
      get a dollar from the State Treasury unless it is right and just. Right and justice to these
      institutions demand that they shall be supported. Now what is the best thing to be done? We
      can start an Asylum at Fort Wayne that will be adequate to meet all our wants; and there will
      be no job in it either. With forty thousand dollars we can start a good building there. I know
      approximately what a large building will cost; I have had as much experience in building as
      any man on the floor probably; I know what labor is worth, and what brick will cost, and I
      know we can build as cheap at Fort Wayne as anywhere else. We have as good mechanics as there
      are in the State of Indiana, and we have men that will expend your money in an honest and
      honorable way. When you talk about this matter of economy, there is such a thing as niggardly
      economy--excuse me for using that term. I appeal to Senators on this floor to yield to the
      soldiers' wishes with regard to the orphans of their dead comrades. Out of twenty
      thousand members of the Grand Army of the Republic in Indiana, ninety-nine per cent. want
      these institutions separated.
     The amendment to the amendment (Mr. Harness') was rejected.
     

     The amendment (Mr. Barrett's) was agreed to by yeas 43, nays 6--
     Mr. WEIR explained his vote, saying: If this institution is to be removed from Knightstown
      and a new one built entirely, I would as soon it should be built in Allen county as any other;
      I therefore vote "aye" as it seems to be the fate of it.
    
    
     GREEN RIVER ISLAND.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore laid before the Senate the following message:
     
      
       
        EXECUTIVE DEPARTMERNT, INDIANAPOLIS, January 27, 1887.

        
          Gentlemen of the Senate:
        
        It is my desire to call your attention to the controversy that has existed for many years
         between the States of Kentucky and Indiana in relation to the boundary line between the two
         States through what is known as "Green River Island," and which has been the
         subject of legislation to some extent by this State. A Commission was authorized (Acts
         1875, regular session, page 8) to survey and locate the boundary line, with a like
         Commission appointed by the State of Kentucky, but that this act was repealed (Acts 1877,
         special session, page 23) and the Governor was authorized to enter into negotiations and
         make an agreement with the Governor of the State of Kentucky for a cession of Green River
         Island, or to establish the line between the States, provided the assent of Congress was
         obtained. Any cession was to be ratified by the Legislature of each State at its next
         regular session.
        There was an amendment to the latter act (Acts 1881, page 525,) authorizing the Governor,
         in case no cession or agreement for establishing the boundary line could be effected, to
         institute proceedings in chancery in the United States Supreme Court for the purpose of
         determining the boundary line, but no proceedings were instituted under such amendment
         because the appropriation was deemed insufficient to pay the necessary costs of the suit.
         It is generally conceded that the proceedings had under the act of 1875 were void, being in
         contravention of the Constitution of the United States prohibiting States from fixing their
         boundary lines without the consent of Congress. The courts of both States have exercised
         jurisdiction over a large portion of the territory embraced within the controversy.
         Frequent contentions have arisen between the land owners, and, in some instances, with
         imminent danger of bloodshed.
        Those owning and occupying land and who hold deeds made and recorded within this State,
         and claiming to be citizens of Indiana, are appealing to the State to take some action to
         determine the boundary line, in order that they may know under which jurisdiction their
         person and property is liable. If the boundary line remains undetermined, a serious
         question of jurisdiction might arise between the States. The matter is submitted for your
         consideration.
        
         ISAAC P. GRAY,
         
         Governor.
        
       
      
     
    
    
     LEAVE OF ABSENCE--A PAIR.
     Mr. WEIR: I have such news from home that I feel justified in asking leave of absence from
      to-morrow till Tuesday morning. I have arranged a pair with the Senator from Elkhart (Mr.
      Davis.)
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair will suggest to the Senators if they desire a pair that
      they arrange their pair with the Committee on Pairs. After the pair is
      made, a leave of absence will be in order.
     Mr. SELLERS moved to adjourn.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Has the Senator from Laporte (Mr. Weir) concluded his
      arrangements for a pair?
     Mr. WEIR: I have it in writing.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: It will be sent to the Senator from Posey and Gibson (Mr. French,
      the chairman of the Committee on Pairs.)
     Mr. MCDONALD: I move that the Senator from Laporte (Mr. Weir) have a
      leave of absence.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Leave of absence will be granted whenever the pair is
      consummated.
     Mr. FOWLER: I think it should be a matter of record.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: It will be. The chair will vote on the motion to adjourn whenever
      the pair is presented.
     Mr. WEIR presented an agreement for a pair and it was read.
     Mr. CAMPBELL (the Republican member of the Committee on Pairs): I cannot
      consent to it unless it is sent to the committee appointed to arrange pairs. I will not
      consent to it in any other way.
     Mr. WEIR: The question has been suggested: If it takes this length of time to make one pair
      how long will it take to make two?
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: I don't think the Senator from Laporte (Mr. Weir) ever would
      make two.
     Mr. WEIR: They will have it ready in a moment.
     

     Subsequently Mr. Weir submitted the following:

     
      
       
        We, Morgan H. Weir, Senator from Laporte county, and William J. Davis, Senator from
         Elkhart county, hereby agree to pair upon all political questions, especially upon the vote
         in joint convention for United States Senator, until both return, and until that time the
         name of neither shall be called in joint convention nor recorded as being present.
        
         M. H. WEIR,
         
         W. J. DAVIS.
        
       
      
     
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Senator from Hendricks (Mr. Campbell) must have written that.
      Has that been signed by both of you?
     Mr. WEIR: Yes, sir.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: It will go upon the journal. Leave of absence is granted the
      Senator from Laporte (Mr. Weir) unless there is some objection.
     The Senate then adjourned.
    
   
   
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
    
     THURSDAY, January 27, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Rev. T. A. Rondthaler, of the Presbyterian Church.
    
     THE PROVOKE LAW.
     The Judiciary Committee returned Mr. Pierce's bill [H. R. 92] to repeal the provoke
      act, with a recommendation that it be indefinitely postponed.
     Mr. PATTON favored the repeal of the law because it was only a shield for cowards.
     Mr. LINCK believed in protecting weak men and women against bullies, as they could not
      protect themselves. He thought the act had a tendency to prevent quarrels and preserve the
      peace.
     Mr. PIERCE as a prosecuting attorney found that men are put to costs and trouble who ought
      not to be prosecuted, there being more prosecutions under this than under any section of the
      statutes. Under the provoke law cases could occur in which there was no intent to provoke the
      other party. He was working against his interests as a defender of criminals when he worked
      for the repeal of the law.
     Mr. JEWETT offered an amendment to make the law applicable only to cases where the provoke
      causes an assault and battery.
     Mr. ROBERTS looked upon the law as it stood as a warning to men to restrain their passions.
      He asked if anybody in his experience knew of an act of violence that was not preceded by
      aninsulting conversation. It was cowards who provoke brave men to outrage the law. It was the
      coward who then went before the court and got the brave man arrested.
     Mr. JEWETT thought the law was very much abused, and the wisest course was not to repeal it
      or to let it stand as it is, but to steer between the two points.
     Mr. GARDINER spoke against the repeal of the law. As far as his experience had gone a person
      uttering an insulting epithet had generally apologized for it.
     Mr. GOUGH thought the law a good educator, and taught people to restrain their passions.
     Mr. KELLISON said the law was preventative of a very great evil--preventing professional
      tongue-lashers from getting in their work on inoffensive persons. If offensive signs and
      gestures should be continued for a sufficient length of time, that should be considered an
      attempt to provoke an assault.
     Mr. FOSTER thought that the mere fact that abuses had grown up under the law was not
      sufficient reason for its repeal.
     On motion by Mr. KELLISON, the amendment was laid on the table.
     The report of the committee was concurred in.
    
    
     A TEMPORARY LOAN.
     The special order was then taken up--the bill [H. R. 189] to make appropriations for the
      completion and finishing of the State-house and three new insane hospitals, and authorizing a
      temporary loan of one million dollars, the report of the Committee on Ways and
       Means recommending that it pass.
     Mr. CAVEN, chairman of the committee, explained that the bill disposed of very considerable
      sums of money, and yet did not accrue to this Legislature a debt of a single dollar. They had not been called upon to create these taxes, but had
      been called on liquidate them. During the last ten years the extraordinary expenses of the
      State for new buildings had been $4,400,000, and at the same time the current expenses had
      been increased from year to year. There were two alternatives, and possibly a third way, of
      meeting these debts. They might discontinue work on the new hospitals for the insane, but they
      ought to be finished at once, for they were greatly needed. The new State-house should be
      completed at once. One of the means was to double the assessment of twelve-and-a-half cents on
      the hundred dollars, but this could not bring in the funds at the proper time. This would be a
      hardship on the present generation. The committee had come to the conclusion that the proper
      course was to borrow $1,000,000. The estimated receipts for the current year were $1,448,000,
      and the estimated expenditures for general expenses already made were $1,387,000. The
      estimates on extraordinary expenses were: Additional hospitals, $419,000; completion of new
      State-house, $150,000; semi-annual school fund revenue, $117,000; rebuilding the
      Soldiers' Orphans' Home, $40,000. These estimates made by the Auditor of State make
      a deficit of $666,000, and do not include the cost of the maintenance of the new hospitals.
      The State-house Commissioners would take $200,000 to complete the building and $70,000 to
      furnish it, fit up the grounds, etc.; but with these additional amounts the total cost of the
      building would not exceed the original estimate of $2,000,000. The various extraordinary
      expenses of the State were estimated, and the total expenses of the State for the current year
      were $2,491,187, an excess of $1,043,000 over estimated receipts, a deficit which would have
      to be provided for.
     The business of the House was here suspended for--
    
    
     THE JOINT CONVENTION.
     A call of the roll discovered every Senator present, and also every Representative except
      Mr. Dickerson, who was paired with Mr. Connely. But for this pair, the eleventh ballot for
      United State Senator resulted as the one printed on page 141 of this book.
     When the Senate retired--
     The Housetook recess for dinner.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     [Mr. VAN SLYKE introduced a bill (H. R. 286) providing a loan of $1,000,000 to pay the
      interest on temporary loans and to provide for a sinking fund.]
     Mr. GROSE spoke on his appropriation bill [H. R. 189] at some length, insisting that the
      amounts were absolutely necessary. There are in the Insnae Asylum here about fifteen hundred
      patients, while in the county poor-houses over the State there are over one thousand, the
      condition of many of whom is worse than one would believe. There is also a large number
      outside of these institutions. It is estimated that the whole number is about thirty-six
      hundred. The estimated capacity of the new asylums is as follows: Logansport, 400; Richmond,
      400, and Evansville, 300; total, 1,100. But by reason of certain changes that have been made,
      they will probably accommodate twelve hundred. There are enough insane and idiotic persons in
      the State to fill these three asylums as soon as they are finished next summer, and three more
      like them. The commissioners having charge of these buildings could stop work, but they ought
      not to do that; but the buildings ought to be completed, and then necessary appropriations
      made for that purpose. The demand for money for the completion of the State-house was
      imperative. Men had been paid in certificates, and they needed their money. He had promised
      not to vote for any appropriation bill until he voted for this one, and he had not; and when
      he drew his pay as a member of the House he felt that the money ought to have been paid to
      these men who were working for one dollar and one dollar and fifty cents a day. These amounts
      should not be raised by taxaction, because the mon-ey
      could be obtained for three-and-a-half or four per cent. interest, and should bedone, and the
      debt be then paid off by the creation of a sinking fund.
     Mr. PATTON 
       opposed
       opposefl
       the appropriation: The instructions in putting up these new Insane Asylum buildings
      were to favor Indiana as far as possible for material used. Yet the contractors had sent to
      Italy for marble pillars on which there was a duty of $10,000, and had sent to Michigan for
      chairs and desks. The number of insane and idiotic persons was overestimated. The buildings
      were going to cost much more than was intended. He ridiculed the appearance of the
      State-house, and said it looked like a tar barrel floating in the Mississippi. Distance had to
      lend enchantment to the view. He would not vote to help tax the people more for this great
      barn or barracks with a top above it.
     Mr. GARDINER moved to recommit the bill.
     Mr. KELLISON moved, as an amendment, to recommit the bill to the Ways and Means
       Committee, and that said committee be instructed to examine carefully and
      thoroughly into the amount of money that will be necessary to meet the extraordinary expenses
      of the State, and for such purpose said committee be empowered to send for persons and papers,
      and to examine under oath the State-house Commissions, the Commissioners of the new Hospitals
      for the Insane and such other officers as they may deem necessary for the information of such
      committee; and that they examine as to what appropriations have been made for the State house
      and Insane Hospitals. He was not prepared to vote for these vast amounts until satisfied that
      they were correct. He and Mr. Jewett had never been notified of the meeting of the committee.
      He was not willing to take the estimates made by the Commissioners or boards as correct. He
      wanted to hear others before accepting this bill or taking any radical measure of this
      kind.
     This latter motion was agreed to.
    
    
     BRIBERY OF VOTES.
     The Committee on the Judiciary reported in favor of the passage of Mr.
      Roberts' bill [H. R. 104] against bribery at general and primary elections and nominating
      conventions.
     Mr. MOCK was opposed to the use of the word "corruptly." It simply enabled wealthy
      men to employ others to work for them.
     Mr. ROBERTS regarded the bill as a very important one, and explained its merits. He thought
      the word "corruptly" ought not to have been used. Money could not be legitimately
      used.
     Mr. GARDINER said the Judiciary Committee had agreed to strike out the
      word "corruptly."
     Mr. HARRELL offered an amendment to Section 3, regarding the making of any false return or
      count.
     Pending which the House adjourned.
    
   
   

   

   
    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    IN SENATE.
    
     FRIDAY, January 28, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Rev. R. E. Neighbors, of the Baptist Church.
    
     NATIONAL ARBITRATION.
     Mr. CAMPBELL offered a resolution for a memorial to Congress in favor of settling
      differences among Nations by arbitration.
     It was referred to the Committee on Federal Relations.
    
    
     PAIRING OF SENATORS.
     Written agreements for pairs were submitted for record as follows: Mr. Schloss with Mr.
      Kennedy; Mr. Rahm with Mr. Moon; Mr. Mullinix with Mr. Sears; all worded similar to the one
      between Mr. Weir and Mr. Davis submitted last evening.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: If it is understood the pairs are in proper form they will be
      entered on the journal.
     Mr. HOWARD of Decatur: It is bad policy for this body to recognize indefinite pairs by
      members, and I want to protest against it.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair has stated to some of these Senators personally what
      his opinion is. The chair does not understand it is important that any Senator should go home
      at this juncture for the purpose of a mere trivial business transaction that might be
      transacted at any other time. If a Senator has sickness in his family that is allowable; I
      would pair with him myself in order that he might get home and see his sick wife or child; but
      I can't see how this thing can go along with so many pairs.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: There are not exceeding eight Senators now paired, and that is not an unusual
      number absent.
     Mr. FRENCH: I saw this thing breaking out like wildfire and think it best to offer the
      following resolution, and I demand a vote upon it:

     
     
      
       
        Resolved by the Senate, That members of this body shall not be granted leave of absence
         except in case of sickness or positive necessity.
       
      
     
     Mr. WEIR: I feel that these pairs ought to be restricted within reasonable bounds. I have
      had but one leave of absence. My wife is in poor health, with her father eighty-five years old
      an inmate of the family, confined to the house by a broken leg and in precarious condition.
      They are there with the servants. I state this by way of explanation, and that is the reason
      and none other in the world that I ask leave of absence.
     Mr. BARRETT: I am willing to state, as it seems to be necessary, that I ask leave of absence
      on a pair be-  cause of the death of relative of my
      wife.
     Mr. WINTER: I don't believe there is danger of Senators' pairing reducing this
      Senate below a quorum, and even if it were so I take it would not be productive of danger. I
      suggest an informal ballot could be had on Saturday without a quorum being present.
     Mr DEMOTTE: I think there is a reasonable limit to our sitting here.
      There is scarcely a Senator but what has private business of some importance that needs his
      attention. I desire to go home for one day. I offer the following substitute for the
      resolution:

     

     
      
       
        Resolved by the Senate, the House of Representatives concurring. That when the General
         Assembly adjourns this afternoon it adjourns until Monday morning, January 31, at 11
         o'clock.
       
      
     
     Mr. BAILEY: I am opposed to the adoption of the concurrent resolution. If there be no quorum
      in the Joint Convention the rolls can be called and that be ascertained and an adjournment can
      be had, and the law will be fulfilled.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair will appoint Senator French and the Senator from
      Hendricks (Mr. Campbell) to confer with a like committee on the part of the House to see what
      is the wish of the House of Representatives as to this resolution on adjourning over. We
      can't attend to any business, and the matter will stand in statue quo until they return.
      The matter will stand in statue quo until there is some understanding as to whether there will
      be a resolution adopted to adjourn to each and every member pair to go home.
     Mr. THARP: Is there any business before the Senate?
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair has suspended all business until that committee
      returns.
     MR. BAILEY: I would like to introduce a bill.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Senator is out of order. He has more bills in now than he
      will ever get passed. [After half an hour.] Is the committee ready to report?
     Mr. FRENCH: Members of the House decline to give us any satisfaction. The only way would be
      to pass the concurrent resolution and let them take action.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Then the question is on adopting the concurrent resolution.

     

     The vote was reported yeas 21, nays 21.
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. FRENCH said: I at first recommended the passage of this resolution and desire to say a
      word in explanation: After futher consideration I think it is not proper to do so to-day, and
      therefore vote "no."
     Mr. MCDONALD, when his name was called, said: I have been trying for a
      week to get the Committee on Military Affairs together; and this is the way
      with other committees. If there is going to be so much feeling about this, and Senators are
      bound to go home; as those living near are voting against this resolution, I am in favor of
      protecting members living far away, I will vote 'aye."
     After the last name on the roll had been called--
     Mr. JOHNSON said: I will change my vote to "aye."
     The vote was announced as above, and the resolution declared rejected.
     Among other agreements for pairs presented for record were Mr. Ensley with Mr. Sellers; Mr.
      Barrett with Mr. Drake; Mr. Urmston with Mr. DeMotte; Mr. Branaman with Mr. Thompson, of
      Jasper; all worded similar to the one submitted by Messrs. Weir and Davis last evening. When
      the agreement between Messrs. Branaman and Thompson, of Jasper, was read by the clerk--
     Mr. CAMPBELL in objecting to it said: Of course you would not expect our committee to
      approve of such a pair.
     Mr. WINTER: We insist he (Mr. Branaman) has no right to vote.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: There are now twenty Senators paired, and if we can have a quorum
      after that I don't understand how you will get it. The chair will announce that in the
      arrangement of these pairs  the Senate will be left after
      to-day without a quorum, This Senate on roll-call cannot proceed to the hall of the House of
      Representatives without a quorum. The chair will not recognize these pairs. The chair will
      take it into his own hands and will see that Senators are here.
     Mr. DAY asked if the Senator from Owen (Mr. Fowler) suggests that?
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: That is no matter. The Senator from Owen did mention it, but the
      chair understood it. The chair has been figuring on this matter. As the House of
      Representatives has indicated an intention not to pass a resolution to adjourn, they will have
      seventy-six members if we cannot go there.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: The House of Representatives would have passed the resolution for an
      adjournment until Monday if the Senate had, and if the Senate passes it now the House will
      concur in it.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair appointed two capable and honorable Senators a
      committee to wait upon members of the Housae, and the House ought to have testified their
      desire in the matter.
     Mr. CAMPBELL didn't want to criticise the action of the Chair, but there is a way pre
      scribed for communication between the two Houses, while we went there without such
      authority.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: There is plenty of time to pass a resolution after the
      adjournment at noon. If it passes the chair thinks it will be all right. If we break a quorum
      we could not proceed to the hall of the House of Representatives. It would be criminal conduct
      on the part of this Senate to allow this to be done.
     Mr. SELLERS: It appears to me pairs ought to be recognized where members have already gone
      home; but if there should be danger of having no quorum, there are enough here of those
      already paired who will remain until this question is settled. As far as my pair is concerned
      it may be declared off, and I have no doubt the Senator from DeKalb (Mr. Ensley) will agree to
      that, and it may operate after the Joint Convention when this resolution passes, if it passes.
      If it does not pass I will stay until the end of the session rather than anything of this kind
      should happen.
     Mr.JOHNSON: I move to reconsider the vote cast on the concurrent resolution for an
      adjournment.
     Mr. SELLERS: Let me make a suggestion. Let the names of those who have paired be called, and
      if they are present let their names be stricken from that list, to be reinstated after the
      Joint Convention.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair will call the names of Senators who have paired.
      [Calls.]--Kennedy and Schloss, Weir and Davis, Rahm and Moon, are the only Senators who have
      carried into effect their pairs.
     Mr. SELLERS: Is it understood that these three are the only pairs until after this joint
      convention?
     Mr. CAMPBELL: The understanding is that a pair will operate where the other Senator is
      absent.
     Mr. JOHNSON: I ask that my motion to reconsider be put.
     It was agreed to.
     And then--at noon--the Senate repaired to the hall of the House, to take part in a joint
      convention to ballot for United States Senator. Returning in fifteen minutes--
     The Senate took a recess till 2½ o'clock.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: There are but three pairs that will be held good; the others have
      not been acted upon, and there are other Senators who ought to be allowed to go home on
      account of sickness in their families.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: Gentlemen who have entered into an obligation for pairs will respect their
      agreement; but as to whether they obtain leave of absence will depend upon the action of the
      Senate and not upon the decision of the Chair.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair has something to do as to regulating the question
      whether a  quorum shall be broken, and as far as the
      chair is concerned the chair will exercise that authority. The mere fact that Senators have
      entered into an arrangement to pair is not conclusive;--the very fact Senators desire to pair
      does not bind the Senate.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: The point I make is this: That when one Senator is present and one absent who
      is paired, the Senator on the Republican side will not vote if the Senator on the other side
      is absent.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair knows a pair once made and carried into effect will be
      maintained, not only by the Republican but by the Democrat; but when carried into effect for
      the purpose of breaking a quorum the chair will interfere.
     After a number of leaves of absence had been granted--
     Mr. WINTER said: The fact that there is not a quorum here need not disclosed, and the
      non-presence of a quorum need cut no figure at all.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: It is not uncommon on Saturdays to transact business without calling the roll.
      The records will not show whether there is a quorum or not and we can agree that no business
      will be done except that which can be done without calling the roll.
     Mr. DUNCAN of Tipton: I do not consider anybody has a right to declare a pair off except the
      Senators interested, even if it resulted in breaking a quorum. There can be no difficulty grow
      out of this matter with me because my associate and I have arranged to withdraw our
      application for a pair. But I deny the right of the Chair to declare it off.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair has not declared the pair off, but the chair has
      disregarded it, and claims the right to do so; and will do so. It don't make any
      difference to the chair. The chair can send a doorkeeper after them, and I mean to do it.
      There need be no niceties about that. There was a concurrent resolution pending at the time of
      the 
       adjournment
       adjonrnment
      . [To the clerk.] Read the resolution.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I introduced that resolution and as there seems to be a fear
      that the minority will override the majority I wish to withdraw the resolution.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: If there is no objection the resolution will be withdrawn. The
      resolution is withdrawn.
    
    
     PAY OF EMPLOYES.
     On motion by Mr. JOHNSON, the bills [S. 2 and H. R.
       14] concerning the payment of employes engaged in manual or mechanical labor, were
      taken up.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: This kind of legislation has done more to injure the workingman than
      otherwise. He has ample law now. I shall hardly agree that the laborer shall have a first lien
      to pay for his labor, as is proposed in this bill. While this bill may have merits in it for
      certain kinds of business, to make it apply to all the people in Indiana, individual farmers
      and ordinary business men, and say they shall all have money every Saturday night to pay their
      hands, will put such a restraint upon them that men will not hire help. The law now in force
      has tended to restrain building and other enterprises. In your efforts to benefit laboring
      men, when you put restraints upon capital or upon individuals you do more injury to the
      laboring man than to capital. These attempts to reach a certain vote in this country, which I
      take it is the main object of many who support this bill, have already, and will do, more to
      injure the laboring class than any other class of people. Capitalists can get along; they are
      not obliged to develop the mines of this country nor to manufacture crude materials into
      articles of necessity and comfort; and they can leave the laborer to get along as best be can.
      I think we are doing a very wrong thing when we undertake to pass a law of this kind. It is a
      mistaken idea. The laborer is dependent and needs daily wages; and for the reason that he does
      need it and his family needs it, I will vote against this bill. I believe if it were not for
      the demagogues in this country capital  and labor would
      work together in harmony. The law of common sense and justice between the employer and the
      employe and the needs of the two should meet and blend together, and they would get along a
      great deal better without such interference.--Thousands of men who are idle today, are idle
      because of just such laws as this. I vote against such measures in the interest of the poor
      laboring man.
     Mr. MARSHALL. As far as corporations are concerned perhaps this bill would be all right; but
      scarcely any farmer would like to make a contract with a hired hand to pay his wages every two
      or four weeks.
     Mr. BARRETT: It may be the first section of the bill is not perfect. If the Senator from
      Hendricks (Mr. Campbell) has any desirable amendment to offer I for one will be glad to
      consider it. The purpose of the bill is to see that laboring men are paid at least once every
      two weeks. I think most Senators will agree they ought to receive their pay at least that
      often.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: Do you think we have the power to pass such a law and impose a penalty for its
      violation?
     Mr. BARRETT: If it does not conflict with the statute, for one I am inclined to think a
      penalty may be imposed. I introduced the bill believing it is right for laborers to receive
      their pay once in two weeks. I don't see why a farmer should escape that responsibility
      any more than a corporation. If it is right for one, it is right for every man; and it is not
      right to make discrimination in favor of railroads, corporations, farmers or individuals.
      There is no penalty attached until the employe has demanded his wages. There is to be
      twenty-four days after the labor is performed before any penalty will attach, and I say that
      is long enough. Unless some penalty is attached the law will be violated. It is universally
      demanded by all the laboring men of Indiana. I say this measure is right and just and the
      Legislature should pass the bill as it is.
     On motion by Mr. URMSTON, the report of the committee [on the bill S.2] was amended by
      striking out the emergency clause and section seven.

     

     The report of the committee as amended was adopted by yeas 34, nays 8.
     Pending the vote--
     Mr. CAMPBELL said: Believing the bill will operate oppressively to the laboring man, and
      will increase the number of poor laboring men who will be in idleness, I vote
      "no."
     Mr.SMITH, of Wells, when his name was called, said: Believing the bill can be amended to
      exclude the farming community, I vote "aye."
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Jasper, in explanation of his vote, said: As this bill excludes the power
      to contract for manual labor I shall certainly oppose it. Then the bill applies to all
      persons. I vote "no."
     The vote was announced as above.
     Mr. ZIMMERMAN moved to insert in Section 1, line 3, these words: "in the absence of an
      expressed contract to the contrary."
     Mr. SMITH, of Wells, moved to further amend by appropriately inserting the words
      "farmers excepted."
     Mr. BARRETT: The amendment would be fatal to the bill.
     Mr. BAILEY: You might as well kill the bill at once as adopt this amendment. They will
      compel the laborer to sign just such contracts as they deem necessary to keep him ground down
      to their ideas. I can't see how any fair man can object to this bill.
     Mr. THARP: The clause proposed by the Senator from Fulton (Mr. Zimmerman) will absolutely do
      away with the entire bill. These identical words nullified the act of 1885 because they compel
      their help to subscribe to a contract which does away with the terms of the law. Capital has
      exclusive control of labor without giving a single right to the laboring man. It should come
      forth with the cash to pay for the labor which sustains its business. This amendment should
      not pass.
     
     Mr. MCDONALD: I always pay at the end of the week; I don't ask two
      weeks; but I tell you there are times when it can't be done. I want a bill passed that
      will give equal rights to the laborer. I don't see any particular objection to this bill;
      it may work hardship in one way, and it may do a great good in another. I think it ought to be
      well considered. I hope we can all vote for this bill in the interest of labor and in the
      interest of the men who pay for labor.

     

     The amendment was rejected by yeas 14, nays 26.
     Pending the vote--
     Mr. FOWLER said: I take the position, like a clean chip in a mush pot, it it would do no
      harm. I don't see it can do any harm in the world. If this bill becomes law without it
      in, it can be put in a contract, and it would be a valid contract anyhow; therefore I vote
      against the amendment. I vote "no."
     Mr. THARP: Knowing from observation and investigation that the insertion of the words
      proposed by this amendment would render the bill absolutely nugatory; and in every case, under
      such an amendment, capital can dictate to the laboring man any terms;--I say believing this, I
      certainly shall vote against the amendment. I vote "no."
     The vote was announced as above.
     Mr. SMITH, of Wells, moved to amend by excepting "those actually and solely engaged in
      farming."
     . WINTER: The largest class of laborers are agricultural laborers, and I would like to hear
      some good reason for exempting the largest class. If a farmer has not the money to pay his
      laborers every two weeks he should go and borrow the money. Their employes have the same right
      to have a remedy for the collection of their wages when due as any other laborers. If we are
      here passing bills for the sake of getting votes from a particular class, and if we are
      legislating because legislation is just and right and proper, I want to know why the largest
      class of laborers is to be left out?
     Mr. FRENCH: I was brought and bred on a farm and I think I know about as much about farm
      laborers as the Senator from Marion (Mr. Winter.) To include the farmers of this country in a
      law of this character, and say to each one "you shall get your money together and pay
      your laborers every two weeks" would have the stamp of folly upon its face. It may be
      with great corporations there are such grievances, but there never has been a single complaint
      of this kind come up from the farming class--at least not enough to make a grievance of it. If
      there is a grievance of this kind let us think of it; but if there is nothing of this kind let
      us not make an invitation for it. Unless you show me there is a necessity for it, I am not
      here to place it upon the statute book, especially when there is nothing of the kind
      demanded.
     Mr. BAILEY: The evils and wrongs sought to be remedied by this bill, it seems to me, are not
      directed towards the agricultural interests of this country. I don't believe there has
      any general complaint come up from that class of employes. It is directed against shops,
      factories, rail-roads and large corporations employing a large number of men. The complaint
      against farmers in this respect does not hold good. It is the custom as I understand, and I
      too was raised upon a farm, to pay the farm hand at the end of the season; and they are
      sometimes employed by the year. I don't believe there is any objection to this amendment,
      and I think I am in favor of it.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: The Senator speaks as though there is a demand for this kind of legislation on
      the part of employes in large manufactories. In my district there are large nail factories,
      large woolen factories, and large manufactories of other kinds, and I have not heard the first
      complaint from any laboring man or any number of laboring men that any legislation of this
      kind is necessary for their protection.
     Mr. DAY made an ineffectual motion to adjourn--yeas 11, nays 32.
     
     Mr. MCDONALD [before the vote] said: I wish to make the statement to the
      President that the House has adjourned till Monday at 11 o'clock.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: That has no influence over this body.
     Mr. HOWARD, of St. Joseph, moved a substitute amendment so the bill shall apply to
      establishments having more than ten employes at the same time engaged in the same
      business.
     Mr SMITH, of Wells: Why should those who employ ten be exempt any more than those who employ
      a less number? It is a well known fact that corporations do not pay their hands weekly as a
      general thing, but usually once a month. In our community some have worked six months and have
      not got their pay yet. I am in favor of the amendment I proposed and which I offered in good
      faith.
     Mr. URMSTON: I hope the substitute will not prevail. It seems to me it will apply to
      everybody, whether engaged in agricultural pursuits or not. There are many farmers who employ
      more than ten men. Farmers hardly ever indulge in bucket-shop business and cannot always pay
      their help every two week. I take it that the farmer proposes to do right by his laborers and
      will do it. I think my amendment ought to prevail. But in order to expedite business I will
      withdraw it.
     The substitute was rejected.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: This section [3] provides anyone who has done labor may make
      a demand and it will be a lien upon the property for all time to come--as long as the statute
      of limitation runs. I regard that section as being imperfectly drawn. I desire, if this bill
      pass, some definite right shall be given to laboring men. [He made an ineffectual motion to
      amend Section 3 by adding a proviso: "That such employe shall have given notice of such
      lien in accordance with existing lien law, and shall commence his action to foreclose within
      six months after the performance of said labor."]
     The bill [S. 2] as amended was ordered engrossed.
     And then the Senate adjourned.
    
   

   

   
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
    
     FRIDAY, January 28, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Rev. A. Bessonies, pastor of St. John's Catholic
     Church.
    
     BRIBERY OF VOTES.
     The consideration of Mr. Roberts election bill [H. R. 104] was resumed.
     Mr. JEWETT thought the pending amendment (Mr. Harrell's) was not in harmony with the
      bill, and that there was no means of preserving the returns from primary elections.
     Mr. HARRELL supported his amendment and explained its provisions.
     Mr. ROBERTS said the amendment was in exact keeping with bill.
     Mr. REYNOLDS spoke in favor of the bill and the amendment.
     Mr. COX, of Miami, demanded the previous question, which was seconded by the House, and,
      under its operations, the amendment was adopted and the bill ordered engrossed.
    
    
     ASSISTANT DOORKEEPERS.
     The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from the Doorkeeper embracing a list of
      sixteen of his employes.
     Mr. KERCHEVAL moved that the Assistant Clerk be "instructed to issue warrants for the
      compensation of the persons therein named."
     The motion was agreed to.
    
    
     TO DEFINE ARSON.
     The Judiciary Committee recommended the passage of Mr. Alexander's bill [H. R. 122] to
      amend the law defining arson.
     Mr. ALEXANDER said the object of the bill was to make it applicable tc all dwellings instead
      of limiting it, as the present law does, to those that were of the value of twenty dollars and
      upwards. Under the present law men had escaped punishment because the house burned was of
      little value, even though the contents were entirely destroyed.
     Mr. FOSTER thought the bill was getting legislation down to trifles.
     Mr. ROBERTS asserted that the humble owner of a house worth but ten dollars was entitled to
      as full pro- tection of the law as the owner of a
      palace.
     On motion by Mr. PARKER, the bill was amended by appropriately inserting these words:
      "or any wharf-boat, water-craft, or vessel, finished or unfinished."
     The bill was ordered engrossed.
    
    
     A COMMITTEE ON PAIRS.
     On motion by Mr. GARDINER, a resolution providing for the, appointment of a
       committee on pairs was adopted.
     The SPEAKER appointed Messrs. Gardiner and Jewett as such committee.
    
    
     BILLS FOR ACTS WERE INTRODUCED BY
     Mr. Kline [H. R. 287]: To repeal the intimidation act.--Sections 2126 and 2127 R.S.
     Mr. Alexander [H. R. 288]: To amend the act concerning the appointment of notaries
      public.--Section 5960 R. S.
     Mr. Jewett [H. R. 289]: To prevent the transfer of claims for the purpose of unjust
      garnishments.
     Mr. Ackman [H. R. 290]: To incorporate the town of Fortville, Hancock county.
    
    
     THE JOINT CONVENTION
     The Senate appearing at noon--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate called the Convention to order and announced three
      pairs, viz: Senators Schloss and Kennedy, Weir and Davis, Rahm and Moon.
     The roll-call discovered all Representatives and all but these six Senators as present and
      answering to their names.
     After the twelfth ballot for United States Senator--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore announced the result as follows: David Turpie, 72 votes; Benjamin
      Harrison, 68; Jason H. Allen, 4. Total, 144. Necessary to a choice, 73.
     On motion by Senator JOHNSON, the Joint Convention adjourned.
     When the Senate left the hall--
     The House took a recess for dinner.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     ATTORNEYS' FEES IN NOTES.
     The Committee on the Judiciary returned Mr. Mock's bill [H. R. 195] to provide that all
      claims for attorneys' fees be void unless the rate per cent. be stated in the note. The
      majority report recommended that the bill pass, and the minority report that it be
      indefinitely postponed.
     Mr. MOCK said that the bill was just, and detailed its merits.
     Mr. ROBERTS pointed out that under the bill it should be agreed in advance what the
      attorney's fee should be. It assures equality to all.
     Mr. GRIFFITHS spoke in favor of the minority report, because no rule could be fixed that
      would meet all cases, no one knowing, when a note was executed, what amount of litigation
      would grow out of it. Every one supposed when he gave a note that it would be paid and not
      sued on, and so did not notice the amount of fees. The highest rate would always be put
      in.
     Mr. BUCKLES moved to recommit the bill to the committee to strike out all references to the
      matter of attorneys' fees. The bill had been drawn entirely in the interest of the
      creditor class. It is an outrage, and the members of the bar ought to be ashamed of themselves
      for the manner in which they had taken fees for judgments on these notes. He had been there
      himself and knew how it was.
     Mr. IBACH had seen attorneys' fees to the amount of six thousand dollar drawn on such
      notes. It was an outrage, and should not be permitted. It was time they should stand up
      against such practices.
     Mr. GORDON was astonished at Mr. Buckles' strictures on the members of an honorable
      profession. It was strange that the advocate of the interests of labor, of the farmers, and
      "the widder and her cow," should come here and say that the poor lawyer shall not
      have a right to live. He was astounded at the admission that the gentleman had taken such fees
      himself. He should at once hunt up those clients or their descendants and refund the amounts
      thus taken.
     [Mr. BUCKLES withdrew his motion to recommit the bill to allow Mr. Roberts to offer an
      amendment, which the Speaker ruled out of order.]
     The minority report was substituted for the majority report.
    
    
    
     BILLS FOR ACTS WERE INTRODUCED BY
     Mr. Beasley [H. R. 291]: To make the day of any election a legal holiday.
     Mr. Harley [H. R. 292] To amend an act concerning change of channel of streams.
     Mr. Morse [H. R. 293]: To amend Sections 1 and 3, and repeal Sections 5 and 9 of an act
      concerning mechanics' liens.
     Mr.Parker [H. R. 294]: To legalize the incorporation of W1ndfall City.
     Mr. Buskirk [H. R. 295]: To provide for and protect primary elections.
    
    
     CALENDAR OF BUSINESS.
     Mr. ROBERTS offered a resolution asking for a committee to inquire into the cost of printing
      the weekly calendars. In support of this, he had reliable information that for the last
      session they cost $3,500, and that each time bills were added the printers charged for the
      entire work as if it was new.
     The resolution was adopted, and Messrs. Roberts, Covert and Dickerson were appointed as such
      committee.
    
    
     LEAVES OF ABSENCE.
     Were granted sixty members until Tuesday next, they having paired and filed written evidence
      thereof.
     The House adjourned.
    
   
   
   
    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    IN SENATE.
    
     SATURDAY, January 29, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by E. J. Gantz, pastor of the Central Christian
     Church.
    
     LEAVE OF ABSENCE.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: I ask leave of absence for Senator Thompson, of Jasper, who has paired with
      Senator Thompson, of Marion.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: If there is no objection it will be granted. Does not that have
      the effect to break a quorum?
     Mr. CAMPBELL: I am quite sure there will not be a quorum in the Joint Convention. We will
      only go through the form of a ballot.
     Mr. FRENCH: I don't think we ought to press this matter of probabilities. I understand
      a great many of the pairs in the House of Representatives don't go into effect until this
      afternoon.
     Mr. JOHNSON: The Speaker thinks there are thirty pairs, consequently there would be only
      forty members of the House in the Joint Convention to-day. It was his opinion that there would
      be just seventy-six members present in joint convention--barely a quorum. If this leave of
      absence is granted it will reduce the convention to less than a quorum.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The way the pairs stand now there are just thirty-six Senators
      who ought to be here. The chair is not inclined to take further steps. The chair will state
      that there is no rule of this Senate, nor parliamentary rule the chair knows of, regulating
      pairs and where it can be done consistently with the decorum of the Senate the chair will
      heartily acquiesce in it; but if for the purpose of breaking a quorum the chair will not
      consent. Call the roll of the Senate. It is necessary for this body to have a constitutional
      quorum to take any independent action in reference to any matter. The chair thinks a majority
      of the convention is a quorum in the Joint Convention.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: I don't think anybody has a right to say whether I shall go there or
      not.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: You can do as you please about it. I apprehend the Senator will
      be there. What the chair shall try to prevent is the breaking of a quorum of this Senate.
      There are many reasons why it should not be broken. Not because we require thirty-four to go
      in there to vote, but this body should maintain itself; it should not be left here a helpless
      orphan, dependent upon the caprices of anybody; and it will not be if this chair can prevent
      it.
     
     Mr. WINTER: I don't see why the leave of absence asked for should not be granted.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The roll of the Senate will be called and if there are enough
      present the leave will be granted. Call the roll.
     The roll-call discovered thirty-eight Senators present and answering to their names.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Will there be thirty-four members with the proposed pair?
     Mr. BAILEY: There will be thirty-four with the proposed pair.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The question is: will the Senate grant leave of absence to
      Senator Thompson, of Jasper, on this pair? If there is no objection it will be so ordered.
      This is the last pair the chair will recognize; so there need be no more asked for, for there
      will be no more allowed.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: Suppose I pair.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Well, I will not recognize it. There is no rule for pairs. The
      chair has one determination and it will be carried out, and that is the quorum of the Senate
      shall not be broken; and that might as well be agreed upon now. This pair had better be read
      and see that it is right; I suppose it is.
     Mr. CAMPBELL [after it was read]: I prefer to make it just exactly as the others. [See page
      228.] Senators have written this without consulting the Committee on
      Pairs.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: These unlimited pairs are dangerous things to enter into. They
      ought to be limited.
     Mr. JOHNSON: I don't wish to be put in the attitude of criticising the Chair, but--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [interrupting]: The chair will consent that you may both criticise
      and antagonise.
     Mr. JOHNSON: I don't believe it is the province of the Chair to determine whether we
      shall or shall not be paired.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [interposing]: Wait a moment. The chair has not decided that is
      within the province of the chair. The chair has decided there is no rule for pairs and if
      pairs run to the extent of breaking a quorum the chair will interfere to prevent it. Then you
      can grant leave of absence if you want to, and the responsibility will be upon the Senate. The
      chair will not attempt to do anything that seems to be tyrannical with any member. Every
      Senator ought to see the importance of this, and if Senators will not interfere the chair
      will. [To Mr. Campbell]: Does that pair [between the Senators Thompson] suit? Is it in proper
      language?
     Mr. CAMPBELL: Yes sir.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Well then, that is an additional pair.
     Mr. HUSTON: Has the pair between Senators Fowler and Schroyer been declared off?
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: It has not been allowed.
     Mr. FOWLER: I announce to the Senate that if the Senator from Cass (Mr. Schroyer) is not
      here on Monday I shall not vote, and if I am absent I apprehend he will not. I made that pair
      and intend to stand by it unless I am forced to do otherwise.
     Mr. MCDONALD: I have been sitting here since yesterday morning listening
      to this talk about pairs. I endorse the position taken by the President and shall vote on all
      occasions to sustain the President, that a quorum shall not be broken. I want to protest
      against such a long-winded talk about pairs.
     Mr. JOHNSON: The Senate has been all yesterday and this morning talking about pairs. Now I
      call for the regular order.
    
    
     PAY OF EMPLOYES.
     The Committee on Labor returned the bill [H. R. 14] for the weekly payment of employes with an
      amendment requiring the payment to be made every two weeks.
     Mr. JOHNSON moved to strike from the bill all after the enacting clause.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: You are proposing to legislate against capital and in favor of labor, but this
      would be le-  gislating against labor and in the
      interests of capitalists. The men engaged in heavy lumber business in my district are not
      capitalists. I have not heard a complaint, for they are working in peace and harmony. They
      would be almost compelled to suspend if this bill were passed. I interpose an objection to
      your making the bill apply to that class of men. There is no need of this kind of legislation.
      It will do great injury in my opinion.
     Mr. HOWARD, of St. Joseph: I think I represent as busy a constituency as any Senator on this
      floor. There is nothing in this bill which will interfere with the relation of employer and
      employe. The only objection I have is that it requires payments to be made every week. In
      South-Bend and Mishawaka, which I represent, payments are made by manufacturers every two
      weeks.--There are large wagon and carriage works, plow factories, sewing machine, agricultural
      implements, clover-huller factories, paper mills, brick making, and almost all kinds of
      corporations except mining. To require payments every two weeks would be entirely in harmony
      with all I know in relation to manufacturing in St. Joseph county. I know if the large number
      of laborers in South-Bend were not paid every two weeks there would be suffering, but payments
      are made every two weeks and things work along in harmony. I support this bill for payments
      every two weeks simply because I know it is necessary. We have several large establishments in
      South-Bend making brick. The brick are not sold till in the summer when buildings are being
      erected. Two or three of them, I call to mind, have started in the business poor, but they
      always provided the pay for their help by borrowing money or in some other way, and they pay
      their hands without fail. Occasionally employers are not able to pay their men, and a
      provision in section two authorizes the employer to give his paper. I don't think that is
      necessary I think the money should be paid; but if the Senate thinks otherwise I am willing it
      shall stand. It seems to me the general features of this bill are in entire harmony with the
      feature of the bill passed to the engrossment yesterday. I think the bill is unobjectionable
      as it is.
     Mr. THARP: I don't think it necessary for the Senate to complicate legislation. House Bill 14 is certainly defective. If a man is employing
      ten, fifty, or a thousand hands, and fails to come to time on any pay day, say he is employing
      one hundred, is liable to a fine of fifty dollars for each one of his employes, so his fine
      would amount to five thousand dollars if each filed a complaint. The penalty is enormous as it
      is; there is no doubt about that. Senate Bill No. 2 is the correct measure on this subject. It
      certainly ought to be satisfactory to laborers. It gives to the laborer everything he can
      reasonably demand. Then I am opposed to any measure which will favor the infamous check
      system. It recognizes the issuing of checks and says they shall bear eight per cent. interest.
      That would be evaded without effort by every employer of labor. Senate Bill 33 is the bill for
      that purpose; making it a misdemeanor to issue or circulate anything like a check, card or
      anything of that kind. If Senate Bill 2 and Senate Bill 33 passes we have every kind of
      legislation on this subject that any reasonable man could demand; therefore I move to
      substitute for House Bill 14 Senate Bill 33.
     Mr. FOWLER: There is probably no Senator upon this floor that feels the necessity of some
      legislation on this subject more than I do for the people of one portion of my district. At
      the last session of the Legislature there was a bill passed the other house that about covered
      my idea of this class of legislation, and it is now before the Senate as No. 132. And also
      Senate Bill 33. I think either one of those bills preferable to this. In mining districts
      there has been great abuse by persons operating coal mineds in paying their hands in check
      cards. I know of no greater abuse in the payment of day labor. This bill, instead of remedying
      that, legal- izes it. If the second section were adopted
      it would be a nullity in regard to that evil. In large mining districts you will find at the
      mouth of every mine that amounts to anything a little store. Their payments to their hands run
      through a whole month, and checks are issued, and goods are sold at their own prices. So when
      pay day comes their workmen absolutely have no money coming and they pay from one-third to
      one-half more than the goods are worth. Section one, taken in connection with section five, I
      object to.-- The fifth section might be amended so it would not work so harshly. I am I
      opposed to the whole bill; I don't believe it will cover the evils we are seeking to
      remedy.
     Mr. BAILEY: The provision in section one covers in more specific detail the general
      provisions of Senate Bill 2 ordered engrossed yesterday. I take it there is nothing in
      conflict between these two measures; each embraces one or two provisions material and
      important, and which ought to be laws upon the statute book. Section five might be stricken
      out as section four prescribes a penalty.
     Mr. HARNESS: I am at member of the Committee on Labor and Labor
       Statistics which reported favorably upon this bill. I thought at the time that it
      was a good bill, but such objection has been made to it that now I am opposed to the first
      section and am in favor of striking it out entirely. If I were to make a speech on it I would
      adopt the one made by Senator Campbell. I think his theory is right; instead of fostering and
      protecting manufacturing interests that give employment to laboring men, I think it would have
      a tendency to stamp them out and kill them, and be directly opposed to the interests of
      laboring men instead of being a help to them.
     The pending motion [Mr. Johnson's] was rejected--upon a division--affirmative 9,
      negative 15.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: When gentlemen insist upon a division and a quorum is not voting, I insist the
      amendment is not lost.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Only twenty-four are voting. Call the roll of Senators. Senators
      will take their seats on the floor of the Senate. The roll-call is to get Senators in their
      seats. The Doorkeeper will see where Senator Huston is.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: The order of the Senate can direct the Doorkeeper to bring in members.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair directs the Doorkeeper to ask Senator Huston to take
      his place in the Senate. If this Senate remains in session a quorum has got to remain upon the
      floor. [After the roll-call.] Thirty-four Senators having answered to their names the further
      roll-call will be suspended. As many Senators as favor striking out the enacting clause of the
      bill will say "aye." [After the negative response.] The noes seem to have it; the
      noes have it.
     Mr. SMITH, of Wells: Under this bill if the employer don't pay every two weeks, whether
      the demand is made or not, he would be subject to the penalty. I move to so amend it as to
      leave it to the employe whether he will take advantage of this provision or not, and thus
      relieve the odiousness of this section.
     Mr. WINTER moved to amend section one by appropriately inserting the words "if
      demanded," and by adding the words: "and any contract to the contrary shall be
      void."
     M. SMITH, of Wells, accepted the amendment in lieu of his.
     A few minutes before noon the Senate proceeded to the hall of the House to ballot in joint
      convention for United States Senator. When Senators returned at 1.30 o'clock--
    
    
     RECALLING ABSENTEES.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair directs the Senator from Posey and Gibson (chairman of
      the Committee on Pairs) to call in all pairs. That is the order of the
      chair, and the Senator from Posey and Gibson will execute it. There will be no snap judgment
      taken here. I authorize the Senator from Posey and Gibson, as President of the Senate, to  telegraph to every Democrat who is paired to return to his
      seat at once.
     Mr. HUSTON: Shall I have the pleasure of asking the President of the Senate his reason?
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: I can state briefly and pointedly the conduct of the Republicans
      in joint convention to-day has been in bad faith. They paired in that convention for some
      purpose--remaining present and not voting.
     Mr. HUSTON: I want to know if the President of the Senate has the constitutional or legal
      right to make a demand that men shall be sent for to whom this Senate has granted leave of
      absence for a time longer than when he makes his demand?
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The President of the Senate has given directions to the Senator
      from Posey and Gibson, and you can do likewise if you wish, to telegraph to members who are
      paired to return to their seats at once.
     Mr. DAY: I understand the President of the Senate has the right in spite of the granting of
      leave of absence by the Senate, to capias them.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The President of the Senate when he sees bad faith has the
      right--
     Mr. HUSTON [interrupting]: Has the presiding officer the right--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The President claims the right. The Senator will take his
      seat.
     Mr. HUSTON: When I am out of order I will take my seat.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair says the Senator is out of order.
     Mr. HUSTON: Then I will take my seat; but there is not power enough in that chair to make
      me.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair has the power. The Doorkeeper will present himself to
      the President of the Senate.
     A SENATOR: I move to adjourn.
     Mr. JOHNSON addressed the Chair.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Senators will take their seats.
     Mr. BAILEY: I would like to say a word.
     Mr. JOHNSON: I think I have the floor.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Does the Senator from Wayne desire the floor?
     Mr. JOHNSON: Yes sir.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Then let us have order.
     Mr. JOHNSON: The whole responsibility rests upon the Senate. We were unable to understand
      what arrangements had been made in the House and didn't know how to conduct
      ourselves.
     Mr. MCDONALD: Mr. President--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Let the Senator have his say.
     Mr. MCDONALD: I wish to ask a question.
     Mr. JOHNSON: I will cheerfully yield for a question.
     Mr. MCDONALD: Was there good faith evidenced by the majority of the House
      in joint convention to-day?
     Mr. JOHNSON: Yes; and I will proceed to state the reason.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: State the reason.
     Mr. JOHNSON: There was confusion about pairs, induced by the action of this body. When we
      got on the floor of the Joint Convention we were unable to understand to what extent pairing
      was carried in the House, and fearing there might be some misunderstanding whereby a United
      States Senator might be elected in violation of law we deemed it best not to vote at all; to
      the end that there might not be a claim that there was any wrong, or either party have to
      excuse or saddle a wrong on the other. The proper way is not to send for members absent by
      leave of they Senate, but hereafter to prevent this pairing except in extraordinary and
      extreme cases. It seems to me that is a right of the Senate, wnich I concede to be the proper
      party to refuse to grant these pairs.
     Mr. BAILEY: I am satisfied, in fact I know the Republicans acted in perfect good faith. I
      consulted with some of them on that question. In the House the pairs were badly mixed. It was
      first announced there would be thirty-eight but there ap-  peared forty. I think it was a just and fair protection of their party to refuse to have
      their names recorded as voting, or in fact as being present and not voting. With reference to
      pairs that have been made in this Senate it seems to me we can't very well or
      consistently call for absentees to return until their leaves of absence has expired. They must
      stand that way; the Senate can't violate its faith. The Senate has absolute control in
      granting leaves of absence and I agree with the Senator from Wayne (Mr. Johnson)that
      hereafter, except in extraordinary cases, leaves of absence should not be permitted. And I
      don't think, if the President will permit, there ought to be any order of the kind
      proposed issued.
     The PRESIDENT pro temppre: The chair made inquiry in the Joint Convention of Senator
      Campbell to give the reason why he would not vote, and also of the Senator from Fayette (Mr.
      Huston), but a reason was not given; no reason was attempted to be given; the chair was not
      informed about anything. It looked like a trap had been laid and had been defeated only
      because the situation did not assist in carrying it out. If the Senator from Hendricks (Mr.
      Campbell), in whom the chair has always had the most implicit confidence, and in whose word
      the chair has the utmost faith, had explained the action of the Republicans, the chair would
      not have felt as though he had been imposed upon.
     Mr. HUSTON: Senator Bailey came to me before we went into the Joint Convention and said they
      did hot propose to take any advantage and had not sought to gain that advantage; and I assured
      him on the honor of a gentleman that we had not endeavored to take any advantage. When we went
      to the House, as has been stated, we found that no one knew the condition of the pairs there;
      and there was no intention to show the presiding officer any disrespect whatever. We had no
      trap set, or anything of that kind, but not knowing what might be the possible result, we
      deemed it best to refuse to vote. It was not intended to show disrespect to the President of
      the Senate, nor because we had any real reason to believe the majority had set any trap, but
      we didn't understand the situation. As far as pairs are concerned, I had a pair arranged
      for myself, but after the President of the Senate expressed his earnest desire that a quorum
      would remain, I determined not to ask for that pair. I have not been home since some time
      before the session convened. I think the President of the Senate failed to understand the real
      position.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair would be gratified to know that he was mistaken about
      that. The chair does not wish to reflect upon any Republican in either branch or outside, but
      the chair felt from the very :inception of this movement that he was being imposed upon.
     On motion by Mr. DAY, it was ordered that when the Senate adjourns it adjourn till 2½
      o'clock.
     Mr. BAILEY: I wish the President of the Senate would have this matter settled so there will
      be no misunderstanding about the order given to the chairman of the Committee on
       Pairs. I think it entirely unnecessary; everybody is acting in good faith, and
      there is not the slightest danger--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: In view of the statement made by the Senator from Fayette (Mr.
      Huston), the chair relies upon the word of the Senator and belives it will be carried out in
      good faith; and that it was simply a misunderstanding in their own ranks and not an attempt to
      take unfair advantage. The order will be recalled which the chair has made to the Senator from
      Posey and Gibson (Mr. French).
     Then came a recess for dinner.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     PAY OF EMPLOYEES.
     The consideration of the bill [H. R. 14] being
      resumed--
     Mr. FOWLER moved to amend by striking out of Section 2 all after the word
      "obligation." He said: If this bill is intended to protect labor from being paid in scrip, these words ought to go out; otherwise the bill
      is utterly nugatory and amounts to nothing.
     Mr. THARP offered a substitute for this section prohibiting the circulation of any
      commercial paper in payment for labor not authorized by the government of the United States.
      He said: I think it would be in taking an extreme step to pass a law prohibiting any party
      from issuing negotiable or commercial paper. If they choose to pay off an employe in
      commercial paper he can go to a neighboring merchant and buy goods and the merchant can compel
      the payment of the paper in cool cash. The amendment offered by the Senator from Owen (Mr.
      Fowler) I understand to prohibit a man from issuing even commercial paper. It would be a great
      stretch for legislation to go that far, and shut off any man from issuing a check, card or
      commercial paper which is good on the market provided the party issuing it is good.
     Mr. BAILEY favored the substitute.
     Mr. MCDONALD preferred the bill as it stands.
     The substitute was adopted.
     The bill, after further amendment, was ordered engrossed.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [in answer to a query]: The reason why the chair does not have the
      roll called for the introduction of bills is that the roll-call would show the fact that there
      is no quorum present.

      and Campbell.
     A message from the Governor was read concerning the State's claims to certain swamp
      lands under certain federal laws. Referred to Committee on Judiciary.
     The Senate adjourned.
    
   

   
   
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
    
     SATURDAY, January 29, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Rev. J. W. Duncan, of Hall Place Methodist Church.
    
     PURDUE UNIVERSITY.
     The Committee on Education recommended the indefinite postponment of Mr.
      Patton's bill [H. R. 154] to repeal Sections 4675 and 4676, R. S., 1881, concerning the
      appointment of students to Purdue University.

     Mr. PATTON: I had hoped that bill would not be reported until we had a full House, as it is
      a very important measure. Purdue University is supposed to be a State institution; which is
      not the case. It never has been, and, under the present law, never can be a State institution.
      It has come to the State of Indiana for years for support, simply because there has been a law
      which this bill seeks to repeal. The practical working of that law has been that any Indiana
      students who go there are charged as much for tuition and expenses as anybody. So Purdue
      University has been advertised to the world as educating farmers' and mechanics'
      sons, and what has been the result? The people have not been benefited one particle by this
      institution. Two years ago, after eight days wrangling, it was demonstrated to this House that
      Purdue University bad not benefited the agricultural interests of the State a particle. No
      work has been done in the blacksmith shops--they have even gone into the city of La Fayette
      and paid for the shoeing of the horses. Yet, how to shoe a horse was a branch of the course
      the students are supposed to learn. You cannot find a single farmer in the State of Indiana
      that ever graduated from Purdue University, yet Purdue University comes before you and wants a
      large sum of money.
     Mr. ROBERTS suggested that, as Mr. Osborn, the Representative from Tippecanoe county, was
      not present, it would only be fair to postpone further discussion of the subject until he was
      present, and thereupon--
     Mr. PATTON moved to postpone the further consideration of this report till 10 o'clock
      Tuesday.
     The motion was agreed to upon a division--affirmative 29, negative not counted.
    
    
     SURPLUS IN THE UNITED STATES TREASURY.
     Mr. Gough' concurrent resolution for distributing the Treasury surplus among the States
      for soldiers' memorials was recommended to be indefinitely postponed by the
       Committee on Military Affairs.
     Mr. GOUGH: I do not believe this House ought to concur in this report, for I think that this
      resolution is a proper one for this body to pass.-- There are two recitals in the resolution.
      The first one is, that there is a vast sum of money in the Treasury of the United States, and
      it seems to be a question at Washington what disposition shall be made of this money. A number
      of propositions have been made in reference to the disposition of it; some proposing to apply
      it to educational institutions,and some to distribute it to the various States.-- There is a
      bill now before this body proposing that the state shall give $200,000 to erect a
      soldiers' monument. I am opposed to this State going further in debt to provide a
      soldiers' monument, but I do say that the Government of the United States whose life was
      prserved, out of this vast sum of money should give some of it to the several States,
      according to the number of soldiers and seamen furnished by each, for the purpose, as this
      resolution says, of erecting a suitable memorial to the soldiers, and I say there could be no
      more appropriate disposition made of some part of that money than to appropriate it for the
      purpose named.-- The way things are going on I cannot see that this State will be out of debt
      for the next quarter of a century. The last General Assembly increased the indebtedness of the
      State over a million of dollars, and there is a bill pending now before this House to increase
      that indebtedness another million dollars. I cannot consent to in-  -crease that indebtedness by appropriating a large amount for a
      monument.
     The report was concurred in.
    
    
     FREE TOLL FOR WORSHIPPERS.
     The Committee on Rights and Privileges reported in favor of the passage
      of Mr. Oursler's bill [H. R. 195] to prohibit the collection of toll from persons
      attending a religious meeting.
     Mr. FOSTER: I am very decidedly opposed to the passage of any such as this, for I believe it
      is contrary to the spirit of the Constitution of Indiana. We are not here to favor any
      religious institution. I believe that people who go to meeting should pay their toll as well
      as anybody else. Of course where corporations want to show any special favor, it is all right
      to do so, but when it comes to the State of Indiana placing on her statute books a law of this
      kind I am decidedly opposed to it, and I hope the report of the committee will be immediately
      and efficatiously set down on.
     Mr. OURSLER: I hope this bill will pass. I think from what the gentleman says that he never
      goes to Church or Sunday school, but there are a great many people in the country who want to
      take their families to Church and Sabbath school who have not money to pay toll, and I think
      this class of people ought to be favored. There are a great many gravel roads that do not
      charge people who are going to Church, but there are some who are a little hard-headed like
      the gentleman from Madison (Mr. Foster), and it is this class of men we want to reach. In my
      county we have a great many Friends and, they have meetings in the week time, and I think if a
      man wants to sacrifice his time and business to go to Church he ought to be favored. I think
      that this bill ought to pass.
     Mr. PLEAK: I think if this bill does become a law the toll companies and gravel road
      companies that have been at a great outlay will be partly shut off from collecting toll during
      the week. In our county seat during the winter season you will find that in some of the
      churches there are protracted services for at least three continuous months, and the people
      there can avoid the payment of the toll during this whole time under the provisions of this
      bill. I hope members will consider carefully before they enact this bill. I move to
      indefinitely postpone it.
     Mr. ACKMAN: The remarks that have been made have pleased and somewhat amused me. The
      gentleman from Adams, who has just spoken, has suggested the idea to my mind that the people
      in his county are uncommonly religious;--more so than they are in the other counties of the
      State. He says if this bill would become a law that it would affect the road companies through
      the whole week, that there is not a day in the week for months but somebody goes these roads
      and says to the gatekeeper "I am going to church."-- Again it is said that there is
      already a statute relieving persons going to meeting on Sunday from paying toll. I think the
      gentleman is mistaken in respect to that; it only exempts preachers going to their
      appointments, or people going to and from funerals. Another objection is, it would be an
      inducement to tell falsehoods that a great many people would say to the gate-keeper "I am
      going to church" and then they would go and visit a friend. I do not think there would be
      any more falsifying after this bill passes than there is now. I think that the bill would be
      an advantage in many respects, and for myself I shall support it. I should like to see it
      become a law.
     . Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Owen: I am opposed to the bill and in favor of the motion to
      indefinitely postpone the same. I think if this bill should become a law that everybody would
      be going to church. I think it would be a hardship to those who build the roads of the
      State.
     Mr. ROBERTS: I cannot comprehend the argument of the gentlemen who insist if this bill
      becomes a law, that persons will impose upon the proprietors of turnpikes as to the object of
      their journey. If this bill should becomes law and a citizen ap- proaches a toll-gate and makes a false declaration to the keeper of
      the gate, and it turns out that he is simply making a visit to his neighbor, it is a fraud
      such as would enable the turn pike company by a proper action to recover a penalty off the
      party making such false representation. There is a law against going around a toll-gate to
      evade the payment of toll, and the falsehood would come in under that definition. This bill
      would not change that statute, it only adds to the list of free persons. As the law now
      stands, it provides that funerals may pass over them free of charge. Now then, if this bill is
      allowed to pass it tends to the moral instruction of the people. I say it is superior to the
      provision for funerals, for this relates to the living and that to the dead.
     Mr. KELLISON: I am not in favor of the bill. The argument of the gentleman from Dearborn
      (Mr. Roberts) has convinced me that it would be a very bad bill. He says, to mis-represent the
      nature of travel would be a fraud. That is very correct. I do not want to load the courts down
      with damage suits for a sixpence, six cents or five cents. I do not want to put any turnpike
      company in this State under obligation to protect themselves from fraud when the damage is two
      cents.
     Mr. ROBERTS: The penalty is five dollars.
     Mr. KELLISON: Who gets the penalty?
     Mr. ROBERTS: The company.
     Mr. KELLISON: That would not be sufficient.
     Mr. BUCKLES: I am for the bill. The experience in my county has been very different from
      that of some of the gentlemen. By common courtesy all persons are allowed to go through the
      gates there free on Sunday, I think it is the best little thing we can adopt. I do not know of
      any people who need this more than the constituents of the gentleman from Madison (Mr.
      Foster.)
     The SPEAKER: The business of the House of Representatives will now be suspended to take
      steps toward the election of a Senator in the Congress of the United States.
    
    
     THE JOINT CONVENTION.
     Senators appearing on the right--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate said: The Joint Convention will now come to order.
      The chair is authorized by the Senate to announce the following pairs, who will not be present
      and will not be called in this body to-day: Schloss and Kennedy, Mullinix and Sears, Barrett
      and Drake, Sellers and Ensley, Weir and Davis, Rahm and Moon, Urmston and DeMotte, Thompson of
      Marion and Thompson of Jasper. For the purpose of determining whether there is a quorum of the
      Joint Convention present, the roll will be called. There are sixteen Senators paired. Does the
      Speaker of the House of Representatives desire to announce the pairs in his body?
     The SPEAKER of the House: The House of Representatives has appointed a Committee on
       Pairs: the Representative from Daviess (Mr. Gardiner)and the Representative from
      Floyd (Mr. Jewett), to which the question of pairs is referred.
     Representative JEWETT: I have a statement of the pairs.
     The SPEAKER of the House: I presume it can be presented after the Senate roll-call.
     Senator CAMPBELL [four minutes before noon]: It is not quite the hour fixed for the
      Convention; let that business be suspended till Judge Gardiner relurns.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: For the purpose of determining whether there is a
      quorum in this Joint Convention the roll will be called. Call.
     It discovered thirty-four Senators present and answering to their names.
     Representative JEWETT: I suggest that the roll-call of the House be dispensed with. I desire
      to state that sixty-two members of the House are, paired, and unless the paired members who
      are present are allowed to answer at roll-call it will disclose the absence of a quorum in the
      House. I have the pairs, which leaves the names of all
      members entitled to vote; it shows twenty-two Republicans, thirteen members on the Democratic
      side, and the four gentlemen who have been voting together for United States Senator.
     Senator CAMPBELL: How many altogether are entitled to vote?
     Representative JEWETT: Altogether, thirty-eight; it preserves the prepoderence of the
      Republican majority.
     The SPEAKER of the House: The gentleman from Floyd (Mr. Jewett) moves to dispense with
      calling the roll of the House.
     Representative KELLISON: It seems to me we have a quorum present. If not, I suggest they
      state their pairs, and then let the rol1 be called, in order that we may have a quorum in the
      Joint Convention.
     The SPEAKER of the House: The roll-call would be only the calling of those not paired.
     Representative KELLISON: I understand if persons who are paired are present, that would
      break a pair; and I believe there are enough such to make a quorum for the Joint
      Convention.
     Senator CAMPBELL: In response to that suggestion I will say as I construe the law, whether,
      or not a quorum is present is determined by the vote when the roll is called. We can determine
      it in no other way.
     Representative JEWETT: If the gentlemen paired would answer it would cause confusion.
      Sixty-two gentlemen have paired--thirty-one Democrats and thirty-one Republicans.
     Representative GARDINER: I suggest that the resolution which passed the House yesterday
      states that those paired should not be called.
     Representative KELLISON: I now make a motion that the roll of the House be called, and that
      after the roll has been thus called, let it be called again for such persons as are paired and
      both present, in order that we may determine whether we have a quorum present.
     Representative JEWETT: I see a much easier way than that: Call the entire roll for the
      purpose of ascertaining whether there is a quorum, and when the vote is taken call the roll
      with the pairs marked off.
     Senator WINTER: That would be a violation of the terms of the pairs; the express term of
      each pair is that the name of the person paired shall not be called in joint convention for
      any purpose.
     The SPEAKER of the House: I was going to state that is the case in the House of
      Representatives.
     Senator SMITH of Wells: I am paired with Senator Dresser, and Senator Dresser is here. I am
      here also.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: You are not paired with Senator Dresser. You have no leave of
      absence.
     Senator SMITH of Wells: I have no leave of absence but we are paired.
     Senator JOHNSON: If the Senators are paired for the Joint Convention I can't see how it
      will make any difference in the line of conduct; it can't change the legitimate
      result.
     The SPEAKER of the House: The question is on the motion of the gentleman from Floyd
      (Mr.Jewett) that the call of the House be dispensed with. [After the response to his call for
      a vote.] The ayes seem to have it; the ayes have it. The first business in order is the
      reading of the journal of yesterday's proceedings in joint convention.
     Senator MCDONALD: I move that be dispensed with.
     The motion was agreed to.
     The SPEAKER of the House: It is now in order to proceed in the election of a Senator in the
      Congress of the United States.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: The Secretary of the Senate will call the roll of
      the Senate. As each Senator's name is called he will rise and announce for whom he votes
      for United States Senator.
     Pending the roll-call

     
     Senator CAMPBELL, when his name was called, said: I decline to vote.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: Why don't you vote?
     Senator CAMPBELL: There is confusion about pairs.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: What is the confusion about pairs?
     Senator CAMPBELL: I decline to vote.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: Call Senator Campbell. [After the name was again
      called.] Mark him present and not voting.-- [When Senator Dresser's name was called there
      was no response.] Senator Dresser is not paired. Mark him present and not voting. [There was
      no response to the call of Senator C. C. Duncan's name.] Mark Senator Duncan of Tipton as
      present and not voting. [There was no response to the call for Senator Harness' vote.]
      Did Senator Harness hear his name called?
     Senator HARNESS: I did, sir.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: Did you vote?
     Senator HARNESS: No, sir.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: Mark him present and not voting. [When Senator
      Huston's name was called.] Does the Senator choose to answer to his name? [No response.]
      Mark Senator Huston present and not voting. [There being no response when the names of
      Senators Johnson, Marshall, Macy, Schroyer and Winter were called, in each instance he said]:
      Mark Senator present and not voting. [When the call was completed]: Hear the vote of the
      Senate: David Turpie received 24 votes; present and not voting 10 Senators.
     The SPEAKER of the House: The gentleman from Floyd will now state a list of the pairs.
     Representative JEWETT: In a moment. The pairs we have arranged are as follows:
     Brown and Shambaugh; Stubblefield and Worrall; Montgomery, of Gibson,and Whitworth; Kelly,
      of Boone, and Garrison; Thomson and Metzger; Beasley and McCray; Conger and Major; Leighty and
      Darroch; Linck and Cushman; Galbraith and McMath; Stull and Groves; Askren and Sinclair; Dunn
      and Bertram; Connely and dickerson; Commons and Foley; Conder and Buskirk; Roberts and Van
      Slyke; Mock and Covert; Kelly, of Lagrange, and Cruson; Parker and Nolin; Trout and custer;
      Carrick and Cox of Miami; Howard and Weyland; Klein and Patton; Osborn and White; Fleece and
      Barnes; Reynolds and Selvey; Friend and Cox of Cass and Miami; Grose and Niblack; Gordon and
      Little.
     The SPEAKER of the House: There are thirty pairs. The Clerk of the House will call the roll
      except those designated by the Committee on Pairs, whose names will not be
      called. The Clerk will call; as members names are called they will rise in their places and
      vote. [Mr. Ackman's name was called several times, there being no response]: Proceed with
      the call.
     Representative KELLISON: I suggest the roll should show he is present and not voting.
     The SPEAKER of the House: The gentleman refuses to vote. Proceed with the call. [When the
      roll-call was concluded]: Hear the result of the vote of the House of Representatives: For Mr.
      Turpie 13 votes; for Mr. Allen 3 votes.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: Hear the vote of the Joint Convention: For Mr.
      Turpie 37 votes; present and not voting 34; for Mr. Allen 3 votes. Total vote' 74. There
      being no quorum in the Joint Convention there is no election.
     On motion by Representative SCOTT, the Joint Convention adjourned.
     When the Senate retired--
     The House adjourned till Monday at 11 o'clock.
    
   
   
   
    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    IN SENATE.
    
     MONDAY, January 31, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Rev. J. H. C. Smith, a Senator from the counties of
     Wells and Huntington.
    
     JOINT CONVENTION MINUTES.
     On motion by Mr. SCHLOSS, the reading of the Secretary's journal was dispensed with (as
      usual,) except that part relating to the Joint Convention of Saturday.
     Mr. HUSTON: The reading of the journal discloses the fact that but seventy-four members were
      present in the Joint Convention on Saturday, and that only a certain proportion of the
      seventy-four were voting. What I want to know is: how the Chair knew, or the journal clerk
      knew, there were seventy-four present? as there was no call of the House.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair in Joint Convention requested the Secretary of the
      Senate to note those present and not voting. It is of no importance to the chair, or anyone
      else. If you desire--
     Mr. SELLERS: The journal sets out the names of those present and declining to vote.
     Mr. HUSTON: The point I make is that the roll of the House of Representatives was not
      called: the Clerk of the House only called the roll on the vote for United States Senator and
      did not record any who were paired; after that was done the President--the chairman of the
      Joint Convention--announced that seventy-four were present, a certain number voting and a
      certain number not voting. How that fact was discovered I do not understand. The question is
      whether the Secretary of the Senate has anything to do with calling the roll of the House or
      not?
     Mr. TRIPPETT: When the roll was first called there were seventy-four answered, but when the
      vote was called the Republicans refused to vote; the record shows that.
     Mr. HUSTON: Suppose seventy-four were there at roll-call, that is not proof they were there
      at the time the vote was taken.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempere: I think a majority of the Senate will agree with the chair that
      it is of very little importance whether the record shows those present and not voting or not;
      and unless there is some objection to that course, the chair will consent that the record may
      show the facts in accordance with your wishes. As to the roll-call of the Senate, you
      understand that remains as recorded; but as to the record of the House, as far as the chair is
      concerned, it has no feeling upon the matter at all.
     
     Mr HUSTON: I think the journal should be made to show the facts.
    
    
     A BLLL FOR ACTS WAS INTRODUCED BY.
     Mr. Davis [S. 196]: Concerning the State librarian and the selection of that officer.
     Mr. French [S. 197]: To repeal the act of regulating the rental allowed for the use of
      telephones.
     Mr. Kennedy [ S. 198]: To set apart a place in the
      State-house to erect a statue in memory of the late Gen. Pleasant A. Hackleman. [Passed under
      a suspension of the rules.]
     Mr. Sears [S. 199]: To regulate the sale of drugs and medicines, and to establish the
      Indiana Board of Pharmacy. Also [S. 200]: To provide for removal of county superintendant of
      schools.
     Mr. Thompson, of Jasper [S. 201]: To amend Section 4993 of the R. S., concerning the medical
      bill.
     Mr. Harness [S. 202]: For the protection of the ballot-box.
     Mr. Bailey [S. 203]: To pay Andrew Steffen for work done for the State.
    
    
     ANOTHER AGREEMENT.
     A SENATOR addressed the Chair.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair is not permitting the transaction of any business now,
      but is waiting on the action of a committee on a proposition that there be no joint convention
      at twelve o'clock. [After some time.] There being no desire on the part of Democrats or
      Republicans to take advantage of either, an arrangement has been entered into so the ballot
      for to-day will be a formal ballot.
     Mr. DAY: I don't propose to go into the Joint Convention if I don't vote; there is
      no use in that.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: An agreement has been made for the purpose of having a formal
      ballot in the Joint Convention, showing no quorum present. Those persons agreed upon can go to
      the House and cast a vote, and then adjourn until to-morrow.
     Mr. SELLERS: There will be no call of the Senate, nor of the House.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: Will the journal of the Joint Convention show that Senators
      who do not vote are present?
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: There will be no showing about this agreement, except as you
      understand it yourself.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: But fourteen Senators will be called?
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: And a like number in the House of Representatives.
     Mr. SELLERS: Shall I read the list of those agreed upon? The names of those who are to be
      called under this agreement are Bailey, Campbell, Cox, Day, Duncan of Brown, Duncan of Tipton,
      French, Harness, Huston, Marshall, Smith of Jennings, Tharp, Trippett and Zimmerman.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair suggests that all Senators go; (of course those whose
      names are agreed upon to be called,) but that the Senate be there for there for the purpose of
      giving respect to this agreement, if nothing else. That is suggested, if you will permit, by
      Judge Turpie.
     Mr. FOWLER: I shall acquiesce in this agreement to-day, but inform the Senate now that I
      shall not acquiesce in it hereafter. I don't want any agreements of that kind made. I
      staid here over Sunday in order to be in the Joint Convention.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: If Senators had not been so anxious to pair there would be no
      necessity for this.
     Mr. DAY: I move the roll be called.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: It is time to go. We will just go without a call; and I hope all
      the, Senators will go.
     Senators left the chamber for the hall of the House. When they returned--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The agreement just carried out is not to be continued any longer
      unless another is entered into. That is the understanding, is it not, Senator Huston?
     Mr. HUSTON: Yes, sir.
     Then came a recess for dinner.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     BILLS FOR ACTS WERE INTRODUCED BY
     Mr. Fowler [S. 204]: To reduce taxes on real estate.
     Mr. Schloss [S. 205]: To regulate foreign insurance companies doing business in this
      State.
     Mr.Duncan, of Brown [S. 206]: For the relief of Joel S. Davis, of Bartholow county.
     Mr. Cox [S. 207]: To amend Section 412 of the R. S. of 1881.
    
    
    
     FEEBLE-MINDED ASYLUM.
     The bill [S. 108] concerning the establishment of a
      school for feeble-minded children at Fort Wayne came up as the special order.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: I don't want to defeat this bill, but I think the people there should
      contribute to the establishment of this institution. It is an institution that will grow of
      more importance as time rolls on. I have not time to prepare a suitable amendment.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair will give the Senator time to prepare his
      amendment.
     Mr. BARRETT: I think it would be extremely unfair to ask the citizens of Fort Wayne or any
      other locality to go around begging to get an institution from the State of Indiana. As was
      stated, we put the amount to be appropriated at the lowest possible sum. There are at least
      one thousand of these feeble-minded children in the State of Indiana.--Fort Wayne should not
      be begged for a little bit of land on which to establish a State institution. It is not right.
      I hope no such amendment will be offered.
     Mr. FOWLER: I offer the following amendment. To Section 4, add these words: "Provided,
      That Fort Wayne shall donate the land upon which said institution shall be situated, not
      exceeding eighty acres." This will in a few years become an important institution, far
      more than the Soldiers' Orphans' Home. The city of Logansport gave a subsidy in way
      of land for the establishment of the State institution there, and I believe the city of
      Richmond did the same thing for her institution. It is almost a universal thing, where any one
      of these institutions is located for the people to make some little sacrifice in order that
      they shall have it established in their neighborhood. And it is not an unreasonable
      request.
     Mr. HARNESS: The amendment should be a little broader in terms. Allen county is anxious to
      have this institution located there. Other counties in which State institutions have been
      located have donated land. Last week a proposition was before this body that land would be
      given if you would go elsewhere in this State with this institution. If the location is made
      in Allen county they say we don't propose to go around begging for a building site. I am
      in favor of Allen county doing as much as other counties have done for similar institutions.
      Wayne county donated one hundred and sixty acres; Cass county donated one hundred acres; yet
      Allen county, which has been posing here as one of the grandest in the State, having the
      second city within her borders, now don't proposed to invest a cent, but still wants this
      institution there! We can locate this institution elsewhere as well as in Allen county. A
      number of counties are willing to donate land, and give one hundred acres if necessary. I
      offer the following amendment to the amendment: Add " and not to exceed the cost of
      $10,000," and that citizens of said county donate sufficient land.
     Mr. RAHM: I don't think it just to ask the tax payers of Fort Wayne to buy any number
      of acres of land for a site. The citizens and tax-payers of Allen county have paid their share
      of taxes towards the building of other State institutions; and I don't see why you should
      now ask them to buy a site for the building of this institution. The citizens of Fort Wayne
      would have taken the Soldiers' Orphans' Home, and would have been glad to buy the
      land for a site for that institution; but the name "feeble-minded" don't sound
      near as well as the Soldiers' Orphans' Home. While they would have pride enough to
      contribute five hundred dollars for the one they would not want to give one dollar for the
      location of the Feeble-minded Asylum. This is not a matter of dollars and cents. It is
      something concerning a county in this State where the people claim it ought to have more
      consideration in this body; and I think they are right.--Evansville didn't give a cent
      for her Insane Asylum. Why Allen county should be compelled to contribute be-  cause some other county offers land I don't see. I am opposed
      to both amendments.
     Mr. JOHNSON: It is true in some instances, cities and counties, in clear violation of law,
      and over protest, have made such donations. It is also true in many instances such
      institutions have been located without any donation. The requiring of donations to be made as
      a pre-requisite, it seems to me would tend to excite the cupidity of every section of the
      State, and the institution would be located on theories of false economy. It is true that 
       Wayne
       Wanye
       county gave one hundred and sixty acres of land, but as I now remember it was
      contributed by the city in plain violation of the law of the land. It seems to me, considering
      the character of this institution, we should not ask from the city of Fort Wayne any donation.
      It seems to me Fort Wayne should have full opportunity to secure the location on the ground
      that it was entitled to it. At first I opposed the location, but now I submit to the will of
      the majority and am anxious the bill shall be speedily passed. I hope these amendments will
      not prevail.
     Mr. MCDONALD: The people of that section of the State have been
      contributing their thousands and thousands of dollars into the State Treasury without
      grumbling. We have paid our taxes freely and brought the money to Indianapolis by the million
      of dollars, and Allen county has never had one thing from the State.
     Mr. HARNESS: Has Allen paid any more in proportion to her levy than any other county in the
      State?
     Mr. MCDONALD: Has she ever had anything from the State? Let us be fair.
      Allen county is asking nothing more than her right. Allen county is asking this for that
      section of the great State of Indiana--for all this vast territory in the upper Wabash
      country. I do hope Senators will see this in the right light. I thank Senators for their
      rightful appreciation of this matter, and no man will be more willing to make a suitable
      return than the humble Senator representing the counties of Allen and Whitley.
     Mr. MULLINIX: As far as this matter is concerned it does not seem to me that there ought to
      be anything thrown in the way of separating these two institutions--the Soldiers'
      Orphans' Home and the Asylum for Feeble-minded Children. In order to have the separation
      complete, which the soldiers of this State are demanding, we ask it, and we ask it
      immediately. I am in favor of saying where this institution ought to go, and letting the State
      of Indiana pay for it. I don't think it right to ask of any people to pay for land and
      make the State of Indiana a present of it. I hope, gentlemen, that no man will antagonize this
      bill, and that it will not be said of any member of the Senate that he has had anything to do
      with preventing a separation of these institutions. What is a few paltry dollars to the people
      of the State of Indiana when they are demanding this separation at our hands? We decided the
      other day where this new one should be, and to me it does not look like very good faith to
      demand of the people of Allen county to pay and give us so much for it. I was in hopes my
      comrades' children would go to Fort Wayne and let the feeble-minded children stay at
      Knightstown, because Knightstown has become odious to me.
     Mr. KENNEDY: We have propositions from other localities to donate land for a site for this
      institution, and I don't propose to throw a damper on such propositions. I am here for
      economy to the tax-payers; and before this Senate adjourns you will see one of the biggest
      appropriation bills that ever came before a Senate in Indiana. You talk about a few paltry
      dollars for this thing; we had better look where these dollars are to come from. We are piling
      up something for our children to pay in taxes. Forty thousand dollars is not actually
      necessary for an outlay for a building; I believe thirty thousand dollars will furnish ample
      accommodation; I do n't believe in making such fine houses. I look at these long silk
      cur-  tains in this room and think of the laboring men
      who have to pay for these expensive things. We should be careful how we spend the
      people's money. Men here don't seem to know how tax-money is made. I tell you I am
      opposed to any unnecessary appropriation.
     Mr. HOWARD, of St. Joseph: It seems to me this matter was fully discussed the other day and
      then determined. These amendments are really directed against the separation of these two
      homes. We don't wish to endanger the passage of this bill at all. I think the bill is
      drawn carefully; the amendments made were simply to change the location; that matter has been
      discussed fully, pro and con, and the Senate has come to an almost unanimous conclusion as to
      that.
     Mr. URMSTON: The first amendment as I understand it is that the city of Fort Wayne shall
      donate, and the other is that the people of the county shall donate. It is not uncommon for
      the Legislature to pass laws providing for donations to secure the location of such
      institutions, but this bill is different in that it locates the place at once. Now it is
      proposed to make this bill, before it goes into operation, contingent upon the happening of a
      certain event, and that is, that Allen county must give not exceeding eighty acres of land. I
      would have no objection to this amendment if Commissioners were appointed to locate this
      institution; there ought to be nothing in this law to make it contingent on the happening of a
      certain event.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: As I hear the discussion; I am afraid such an amendment will result in
      defeating the bill, which I don't want shall be done. If Senators think the appropriation
      of forty thousand dollars is too much, an amendment can reduce that. I am going to vote
      against both of the pending amendments. The location of this institution is settled, and
      whatever appropriation may become necessary will be made at some future time; no danger about
      that.--The only question is whether to appropriate forty thousand dollars now. Make an
      appropriation to buy land such as will complete one building, and the people will see the
      necessity of it. I believe I will vote for the bill as it is, for I don't want to
      jeopardize its passage. I think the separation of the two institutions should be made, and
      hope the bill will pass without further amendment.
     Mr. SMITH, of Wells: A committee from one of my counties came here asking for the location
      of this institution at Huntington, and saying they will donate one hundred acres of land on
      which to build this home. I told them I had been talking favorable to Fort Wayne, and it would
      be placing me in an embarrassing position to favor Huntington. There is only one question that
      embarrasses me, and that is the fact here are two counties that have offered to give land
      sufficient on which to locate this home. How I can vote against each, consistent, is the
      question. My constituents say they will donate one hundred acres of land upon which to locate
      this institution, and if I vote against Allen county donating the land when one of my counties
      proposes to do so, I would not be treating my constituents right. The citizens of Huntington
      county met in convention an there authorized and selected a committee of two to make that
      proposition, and they came and found a committee from Allen county here on a similar mission;
      and they held back, hoping that in some way they might bring to bear their proposition. I
      can't consistently vote against these amendments. If I should vote against these
      amendments, thereby saying that Allen county should have the location free, I would not be
      consistent. I think the city of Fort Wayne is the proper place to locate this institution, but
      this proposition coming from Huntington county embarrasses me to that extent.
     Mr. SELLERS: Suppose we pass this amendment, and the location of this institution at Fort
      Wayne is made dependent upon the condition that the people of Fort Wayne donate so many
      thousand dollars or so many  acres of land, and the
      people there fail to secure the land or the money, then we will have failed to satisfy the
      demand that these institutions be separated, and failed to provide for the feeble-minded
      children of Indiana. Here we may make a condition precedent, and we don't know whether it
      will be complied with or not. If these propositions for a donation had been submitted before
      we located the institution, and we had given it to some other place in consideration of its
      donating the State so much for our doing so, that might have been done. The donations ought to
      have been required, if at all, before the institution was located. It is too late now;
      considering that we have located it, we must make an appropriation that will secure these
      children a home, and that appropriation ought not to be dependent upon an uncertainty. I doubt
      if any law can be passed that depends for its operation upon a subsequent condition. We cannot
      depend upon the action of the people to put a law in operation.
     Mr. MARSHALL: It seems to me nothing but fair, if Fort Wayne wants this institution, and
      wants it badly, that her citizens should appropriate ten thousand dollars to pay for the land
      for its site. I see nothing unfair about it, as other counties have given large sums of money
      for the establishment of State institutions therein.-- But under the provisions of this bill,
      at this late day, we are too late in springing this question, and as we advocate the
      separation of the feeble-minded from the soldiers' orphans I am opposed to the
      amendments.
     Mr. BARRETT: I believe Senators will agree with me that the asking of such donations is an
      unwise policy. If it has been adopted heretofore as the policy of the State, it should be
      stopped now. Members coming from that portion of the State, as well as other Senators, think
      the north-eastern part should have one of these institutions, and that the metropolis of that
      section should have it. Richmond gave some land to secure an institution there and if Senators
      will look at the records they will find that the contracts for the buildings was let at
      $362,000, while Allen county is to get but $40,000 for buildings.
     Mr. FOWLER: Don't you know the appropriation will reach as much again?
     Mr. BARRETT: Perhaps; and don't the Senator know that the appropriations for the
      institution I have mentioned will increase from year to year in proportion to what was given
      at first?
     Mr. FOWLER: I hope not. I do not believe they will. I think we have about two more insane
      hospitals than we need.
     Mr. BARRETT: Then the Senator has not read the Governor's message, because he says the
      State has thirty-five hundred insane persons who ought to be provided for, and yet the three
      new asylums will only accommodate eleven hundred.
     Mr. FOWLER: Has the Senator read what Dr. Fletcher [the Superintendent of the Insane
      Hospital] says on that subject?
     Mr. BARRETT: The Governor has made his statement from the report of the Engineer, and I
      believe the statement therein made. An appeal has been made on behalf of the laboring men of
      Indiana not to make this large appropriation of $40,000 to erect a building and furnish it to
      care for the feeble-minded children. The opposition that will come against the erection of
      this building will not come from the laboring men of Indiana; and why? Because the laboring
      men of Indiana know that this appropriation is made to care for poor, unfortunate children of
      the poor, unfortunate men and women of Indiana who have no means to send their children to
      private asylums and who are not able to provide necessities and care for them from day to day;
      and I make the appeal on behalf of the laboring men that a proper and suitable institution
      should be erected, for every Senator knows they are the children of the poor laboring men of
      Indiana who will be cared for in this institution. With our two-and-a-half million of
      population in Indiana it  means but two cents apiece to
      each person, or ten cents apiece to the head of each family, and I will say on behalf of the
      laboring man there is not one but will gladly give ten cents to furnish a home for these
      unfortunates; and if opposition comes, it will come from men who have large wealth and who
      will be called upon to pay a little more than ten cents. The voice and hand of every poor man
      will be raised in behalf of this bill and in behalf of those poor children unfortunately
      feeble-minded; they are generous; they are liberal, and don't care for paying such a tax
      as does the rich man and the capitalist with his thousands of dollars.
     Mr. DRESSER: I am pledged to favor of the separation of the feeble-minded children from the
      soldiers' orphans, and the further they are separated the better it suits me. I have been
      in favor of taking this institution to Fort Wayne, but I am not in favor of the system of
      farming out these institutions to counties or cities who will make donations for the purpose
      of securing them. I believe the State ought to select a place and make the proper
      appropriations to erect the buildings.
     The amendment to the amendment was rejected.
     On motion by Mr. BARRETT, the bill was considered as engrossed, read the third time and
      finally passed the Senate by yeas 46, nays 0.
     The Senate adjourned.
    
   
   
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
    
     MONDAY, January 31, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Rev. E. A. Bradley, of the Episcopal Church.
    Mr. Shambaugh introduced a bill [H. R. 296] to prohibit conferring police powers on
     non-residents.
    
     NO TOLL FROM WORSHIPPERS.
     The unfinished business of Saturday, the bill [H. R. 195] prohibiting the collection of toll
      by turnpike or gravel road companies from any person attending a religious meeting was then
      taken up, and the committee recommendation in favor of the passage of the bill was concurred
      in.
     Mr. PLEAK moved to amend the bill by inserting after "other religious meetings"
      the words "on the Sabbath." He said: We all know that at many times, especially
      during the winter season when there are protracted meetings being held, under the provisions
      of this bill, unless it is amended, the people will be allowed to pass over our toll roads
      free. In many sections of the State it is customary to exempt people from toll when attending
      worship on the Sabbath day. Saturday I moved the indefinite postponement of this bill, but I
      now offer an amendment to restrict this exemption from toll only to travel on the Sabbath. I
      think this is fair and just, and I hope the House will adopt this amendment.
     Mr. FOSTER: I was opposed to the report of this committee, and while I have been satisfied
      of the good intentions of the gentlemen who have reported this bill, and the gentleman who got
      it up, I have not changed my mind as to the constitutionality or the advisability of passing
      the bill. I will read from the constitution of Indiana. [Reads Section 4, Article I.] I
      contend that this is giving preference to certain organizations and churches. You undertake,
      under this bill, to say that one class of people shall be preferred over another. I do not
      think that can be done legally. On the other hand, I do not believe that from any corporation
      which has been chartered by the State, we can take away the right to charge what they please.
      You may just as well say that on sunday the liveryman shall not charge anything for his
      horses, or that the railroads shall carry passengers free on that day. I say it cannot be
      done. One gentleman has said to me that this would work a blessing in this way: That it would
      discourage these toll-pikes;--it would break them up. But will we say, after the State has
      chartered a company, that we will make its business non-paying? It is absurd. It cannot be
      done. For these  reasons I am opposed to the amendment as
      well as the bill.
     Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Owen: Saturday I was opposed to the bill as it read then. Now I am in
      favor of the amendment offered by the gentleman from Decator (Mr. Pleak.) I think the
      gentleman (Mr. Foster) has placed a wrong construction on the Constitution. I do not think
      this bill will show any favor to any creed. I think every turnpike will earn enough during the
      six days of the week to allow passage over the road during Sunday free. I am in favor of the
      bill with the amendment.
     Mr. REYNOLDS: With the gentleman from Madison (Mr. Foster) I doubt the right of the
      Legislature to pass such a bill. I am in favor of the amendment offered by the gentleman from
      Decatur. I believe that it is nothing more than right that these corporations, which have
      constructed the highways and erected these toll-gates, should be required to permit the
      people--at least those who are in the habit of attending public worship--to go over these
      highways free on the Sabbath. These corporations have been running for years and have made
      money enough to make their stockholders comfortable, or at least they have been paid a very
      fair dividend for the money they have invested. I will heartily and willingly give my vote and
      support to the amendment.
     Mr. LINCK: I am opposed to this bill. It seems to me it simply proposes to bribe a lie.
      People will go to a picnic and say they are going to Church. I shall oppose the bill.
     Mr.FOLEY: I am in favor of a bill to exempt from turnpike toll the people who go to church.
      I am in favor of a cheap road to Heaven.
     On motion by Mr. BUCKLES, the word "Sabbath" was changed to "Sunday,"
      and then the amendment as amended was agreed to, and--
     The bill was ordered engrossed.
    
    
     THE JOINT CONVENTION.
     The SPEAKER of the House: On 
       account
       ccount
       of the pairs, a list of which has been read in the House of Representatives, that
      will this morning constitute the roll of the House to be called joint convention.
     Senators appearing in the hall at noon--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: The Joint Convention will come to order. The chair
      desires to state that by an understanding between Republicans and Democrats, which will not
      appear upon record however, the following persons will be called this morning on the part of
      the Senate: Bailey, Campbell, Cox, Day, Duncan of Brown, Duncan of Tipton, French, Harness,
      Huston, Marshall, Smith of Jennings, Tharp, Trippett and Zimmerman. The Secretary of the
      Senate will proceed to call the names of the following Senators.
     Senator SELLERS: I move that the call of the roll of the Senate and House and the reading of
      Saturday's proceedings be dispensed with.-- [Laughter.]
     The SPEAKER of the House put the motion.
     It was agreed to.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: The Secretary of the Senate will call the names of
      Senators as indicated. Those called will designate by name the persons for whom they vote for
      United States Senator. [After the call.] Hear the vote of the Senate: For Mr. Turpie, 9 votes;
      for Mr. Harrison, 5 votes.

     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     ATTORNEY' FEES IN NOTES.
     The bill [H. R. 183] to declare void Attorney's fee clause in notes, came up on a
      favorable committee report--the question being on a motion [Mr. Major's] to strike out
      the enacting clause--
     Mr. MAJOR said: There seems to be with some parties a deep-seated feeling against a set of
      individuals commonly known as attorneys, and I suppose this bill was introduced to make a
      strike at those individuals. But this bill does not strike at attorneys. Every lawyer who is
      employed to collect a note gets his fee either from one party or the other. The question is,
      from whom shall he receive it? The man who desires to pay his debts fears not to sign a note
      with attorney's fees. The man who thinks when his note becomes due he will dilly-dally
      along, is the one who refuses to sign such a note. The result of this law, if enacted, would
      be just about this: it would be a direct strike at the commercial interests of our country.
      And it bears directly on the rate of interest in the State of Indiana. Mark my words: whether
      you enact this law or not the notes will be collected just as certainly as now. Foreign money
      loaners bring their money in here and loan it at five and six per cent., and if you borrow
      from a domestic loaning agent you will have to pay eight per cent. If this law is passed the
      note will be made and be discounted at enough to compensate the loaner. This cheap money that
      comes in here would be entirely shut out. You can get no company to come here and loan money
      on long time for five and six per cent. unless a note with attorney's fees is given. The
      result of this law as I said will in no wise affect the collection of an attorney's fee.
      I am an attorney myself, and when I do work for any man I am going to get my fee, I don't
      care from whom it comes. I hope the House will think very carefully before they pass this
      bill, as it is a matter that will revolutionize the commercial business of the State.
     Mr. LINCK: In the interest of the poor class, and men who have to borrow money, I am in
      favor of defeating this bill by striking out the enacting clause.
     Mr. GOUGH: I am very sorry that I cannot agree with my friend here (Mr. Linck) but I cannot
      always agree with him. I am so unfortunate as to be an attorney, and they seem to be an
      unfortunate class just now. I think this Legislature could not do a better thing than to pass
      a law prohibiting attorney's fees in notes for this reason: There seems to be a general
      demand on the part of the people of this State that this should be done. I think that it makes
      no difference to the attorney whether he gets his fee from the defendant or the plaintiff. I
      think that we might try the experiment for at least two years. We have all known cases where
      the attorney would divide the fees with the plaintiff.
     Mr. OURSLER [interrupting]:--How many cases of that kind has come within the knowledge of
      the gentleman from Warrick?
     Mr. GOUGH: Well, I did not make a list of them but there has been a good many. I think that
      abuse will justify this House in passing a law of this kind.
     Mr. GRIFFITHS: I am sorry that I cannot agree with the gentleman from Warrick (Mr. Gough.) A
      bill has already been introduced reducing the interest on school fund loans to six per cent.,
      another creating a homestead law and increasing the exemption to one thousand dollars. I am
      not saying anything about the merits or demerits of any of these bills, but I do say that
      there seems to be a tendency during this session to look simply to the rights of one class of
      people and ignore those of all other classes of people. I am speaking simply as a citizen and
      not as an attorney. In my judgment if this bill passes we might as well build a great  fence around the State of Indiana and say we don't
      want anybody to come in. You will not be able to borrow any money, for no foreign capitalist
      will loan money. And if this bill becomes a law a man cannot renew his loan for the simple
      reason that the creditor will not renew it unless he can do so upon the same conditions as
      before. Suppose a man executes a note for two hundred dollars at one year; the interest on the
      note is sixteen dollars, and if he has to employ an attorney to collect it, it will cost him
      from fifteen to twenty-five dollars so that he receives nothing whatever for the use of the
      money. A man loans money on the presumption that it will be paid when it is due, and it is a
      misfortune if it is not paid at that time.
     Mr. JEWETT: Like most of the gentlemen who have spoken I practice law for a living. Only a
      few weeks ago I got nearly five hundred dollars on a foreclosure of a mortgage as
      attorney's fees, and notwithstanding all that, I am convinced that public policy demands
      the enactment of such a law as this. There are two considerations influence me in this matter:
      First, that the insertion of this clause would stimulate litigation. It ought to be the aim of
      the Legislature to suppress the possibility of litigation in our courts. Another consideration
      is that, I honestly believe, no single thing has so far brought the profession of law into
      disrepute as this thing of iron-clad notes and attorneys' fees. I know of no class of men
      who are so universally trusted as the lawyers, and I know of no class where so few fail to
      justify the confidence thus reposed in them, but these iron-clad notes are growing to be an
      abasement of the profession. I believe if all such suits are scrutinized it will be found that
      nine tenths are brought by lawyers either not practicing law for a living or by collection
      lawyers. As a rule they are young men who are connected with trust companies, or something of
      that kind. In the city where I live the man who does the largest collecting business gives all
      but two-and-a-half per cent. of the amount recovered as attorney's fees to a National
      bank; and I do not know but every county in the State has such men. This is a fact, that
      numerous suits are brought that would never be brought but for the undue influence held out by
      the attorney. But it is not necessary to abuse the lawyer or the law in order to support this
      bill. It seems to me the two considerations I named to influence us all. A law of this kind
      will not prohibit the collection of honest debts, but it will give to many a hard pressed
      debtor many a month of grace on a mortgage on his farm.
     Mr. BEASLEY: I believe that it would be a mistake for this Legislature to repeal the law on
      this subject and allow parties to contract to pay attorneys fees. I know that in the county
      where I live the great amount of money that is loaned and borrowed is from and to people in
      circumstances in life. I was asked in regard to this when I was making my campaign and I told
      the people that I would oppose anything of this kind. I think there are abuses, but that is no
      argument to do away with attorneys' fees. I think that this Legislature should legislate
      on the abuses and not against attorneys' fees. I do not believe the poor people of the
      State would have us repeal this law. It has been well said on this floor that if this bill is
      passed the effect will be to drive out foreign capital. I know there is not enough capital in
      Sullivan county to meet the demand.
     Mr. WHITE: It seems to me that gentlemen who favor the passage of this bill assume the very
      point in controversy. One of the chief arguments in favor of the passage of this bill is this,
      that it promotes litigation. Now that statement has been made by a number of gentlemen, and it
      is stated as an argument, as a proposition assumed to be true. I have heard no reason,
      satisfactory to me at least, why it is true and I am unable to see why it is true. It seems to
      me that the converse of that is true. In the first place, in my section of the State at least,
      a large proportion of  loans are made at a rate in excess
      of six per cent. In every instance where the creditor resorts to suit for the collection of
      the money he is bound to take on his judgment six per cent., and if the debtor is sufficiently
      responsible he is able to replevy the judgment, and the result is that for six months or more
      the creditor must receive six per cent. only upon his loan. Now the attorney' fee does
      not benefit the creditor, it benefits no one except the attorney. There is no law and there is
      no article which is the subject of use by mankind that is not the subject of abuse, but the
      fact that an abuse exists of anything is not an argument against its use. There is no creditor
      who is responsible and worthy and has much money to loan that wants the odious notoriety, of
      bringing suits against debtors. The largest money loaner in the county where I come from has
      never instituted but one suit in his life. The reason he gives is this: that as he makes his
      living loaning money he cannot afford to have the reputation of bringing suits needlessly. And
      so I say every responsible and reputable man feels that way. No one wants the odious
      reputation of bringing suits unnecessarily and unjustly against a debtor. In every suit that
      is brought a certain hazard is taken by the man who brings it. Every lawyer knows that there
      never was a suit instituted in any court in which there was not a possibility if not a
      probability of defeating it.
     Mr. ROBERTS: The other day when this question was under discussion I took ground in favor of
      the bill:--that the amount of the attorney's fees should be expressed in the contract. I
      believe that the whole system is pernicious. It is nothing more or less than another name for
      usage. I do not care whether it is charged up in a higher rate of interest or charged as
      attorneys' fees it increases the liability. The first recognition this principle of
      attorneys' fees received was away back in 5, 6 or 7 Indiana, in the case of Dean vs.
      Billingsly, a case from Dearborn county. From that day to this the system of collecting
      attorneys' fees by contract has been on the increase step by step, step by step, until
      to-day the form of all notes contains interest and attorneys' fees, and is as much to be
      dreaded by the debtor as the principal debt itself. Attorneys' fees in contracts and
      notes is a cunningly devised scheme of money lenders and bankers whereby in the name of the
      law they may insert the scalpel more deeply into the quivering flesh of the debtor. In my
      county we have a number of large money lenders. I know, too, that a gentleman has an agreement
      with these money lenders to this effect: The notes are drawn providing for the question in the
      courts; of these fees the attorney is to receive one-half, and the other half, in addition to
      his eight per cent., the money lender puts in his pocket. Is that a righteous transaction? If
      it be in the contract that reasonable fees shall be charged, you do not know until the verdict
      is rendered what you will have to pay. They say it will shut out foreign capital. The money
      lenders who reside in Cincinnati and Chicago are not lending money on mere slips of paper. I
      dare say that the Indianapolis agents of the New York money lenders have instructions to lend
      money only on property where they can secure the first mortgage. My friend from Marion (Mr.
      Griffiths} gives as his reason why this should not become a law that interest will become
      lower; yes and labor is lower. If the price of everything else goes down why should not
      interest go down? Attorneys' fees are but another name for usury. Tell me the difference
      between a higher per cent. of interest than the law allows and attorneys' fees? I look on
      it as a stain on the statute book and a burden to that class of men that legislation should
      protect. The law as it now stands is one of the greatest evils in our financial policy. There
      is no danger of one single dollar being shut out of the State by such 
       legislation
       legistation
      . Money in Cincinnati to-day can be obtained for three and four per cent., and will
      they hesitate to lend their  money here where they can
      get eight per cent.? It is one of the worst of arguments. I hope that the motion to strike out
      the enacting clause will not prevail.

     Mr. GARDINER: I doubt whether this proposition needs very much more discussion. Most of us
      who are practicing law can remember when contracts contained nothing of the kind, and yet I
      presume that they were as satisfactory as they are now. It grew however into the practice of
      the country, without an express condition of the Statute, to insert a provision for
      attorneys' fees, and the operation of that provision has been very much like contracting
      with a man under duress; for if any gentleman desires to borrow money or to buy property and
      is required to execute notes, he cannot have a deed unless he will sign a note with
      attorney's fees in it.
     Mr. GARRISON: I have listened with a good deal of interest to the remarks that have been
      made by the gentlemen from the learned profession of the law. They disclaim any personal or
      professional interest the question now pending, and I am willing to concede that they are
      claiming only what is true in this behalf.--Not belonging to that learned profession I desire
      to say that I am perhaps as disinterested as any attorney on the floor or as any man possibly
      can be. I do not believe that attorneys as a profession are directly interested, but I do
      believe that indirectly they are very largely interested, and it seems to me that it is very
      remarkable that the attorneys, the greater part of them, have taken the position of the money
      loaner. The gentleman from Dearborn (Mr. Roberts) made a portion of the remarks that I desired
      to make and I was in hope that he would let me speak first, but he did leave me one little
      item. It has been my observation and it is the fact in my county, that while a large amount of
      money has been loaned by foreign parties, all the domestic capital is kept in the hands of the
      debtors.-- The domestic money loaners depend upon having a good class of men upon their notes,
      but the foreign loan agents or companies depend entirely in my county upon first mortgages
      upon unencumbered real estate.--They loan money at the highest rate of interest known to the
      law, and in addition to that they bring into requisition another class of men, abstracter, and
      when a foreign loan agent is about to place a loan he first requires an abstract and the 
       debtor
       dedtor
       must pay for this abstract; then he agrees to pay the rate of interest the law
      allows and, in addition to that, where the note is made for five years or less, he must pay
      five per cent., and if it is not paid but has to be borrowed that is part of the note. If you
      want to borrow one thousand dollars and are not able to pay the per cent. you give your note
      for one thousand and fifty dollars and the rate per cent. is placed upon that amount. It seems
      to me that the debtor is left entirely out of this argument. He is compelled to borrow and he
      is compelled to take the best terms he can get, and if he cannot get favorable terms his home
      often depends upon his taking such terms as will oppress him and finally turn him out of
      doors. It seems to me that the time has come when we ought not consider the interests of the
      attorney or the foreign loan company or the domestic lender, but of the debtor. In behalf of
      that class of men who are numerous to my certain knowledge, and in their interests, I am
      opposed to the motion now pending.
     The pending motion was withdrawn, and, under the operations of the previous question, the
      bill was ordered engrossed for the third reading.
    
    
     RELIEF TO THE POOR.
     The bill [H. R. 48] concerning the township poor, was read the second time, with a majority
      committee report recommending indefinite postponement, and a favorable minority report.
     Mr. SCOTT: This bill provides that trustees of the several townships of the State shall
      whenever it is necessary under existing laws give relief and support to the poor of their
      respective townships, and they shall  make such
      provisions out of the township funds. There is, I think, a reason for the passage of this bill
      at this time. I believe that, in counties that are close politically, there is political
      abuse. I believe that trustees in hotly contested counties have abused their trust. It is
      easier to pay money out of the State than out of their county where there was great political
      abuse just previous to the election. The trustees put out large sums of money for what they
      called poor people but was really paid for votes. Under the law as it is now they draw orders
      on the county treasurer. These orders are passed on by the county commissioners, but the
      commissioners do not know whether they have power to go back of these orders and see whether
      it is necessary or not, and if they did have the power they do not have the time to do this.--
      This bill provides that they make the payment out of the township funds, which would throw the
      responsibility on the township trustee and the people would see that he did not go beyond his
      powers and duties, and they would know whether he was properly playing out this money or not.
      As it is, a great many orders get into the commissioners' hands to pass on, and they make
      their orders and then they are charged with extravagance. The people have no means by which
      they can tell whether this money was paid out corruptly or not. There is certainly need for
      reform in this direction.
     Mr. GROSE [interrupting]: I would ask if there is any funds provided to the township funds?
      It is now paid out of the general taxes and out of the county treasury. Now, if we make this
      change does the bill provide funds for the township trustees to pay this? And how about
      cities?
     Mr. SCOTT: I think perhaps under existing laws there is provision for taxation for this
      purpose. I cannot ennumerate the different purposes, but there are mentioned certain purposes
      for which tax levies shall be made, and I think there is a clause that covers existing
      emergencies. It could be provided by a special tax levy. In the cities it could be provided in
      the same way. If the bill does not already provide for a tax levy for this purpose it could be
      so amended.
     Mr. GARRISON: I think it is true that there is no fund provided by the statute at the
      present time and placed in the hands of the township trustee, and if this minority report
      should be adopted and the bill be passed they would be entirely powerless.
     The majority report was concurred in, and so the bill was indefinitely postponed.
    
    
     THE DOG TAX.
     The bill [H. R. 88] to amend the dog tax was read the second time, with a favorable
      committee report.
     Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Owen: This bill is to turn a surplus over fifty dollars collected for the
      dog fund to the road fund. I introduced a bill at the request of nearly the whole my county to
      turn this surplus into the tuition fund. I believe that surplus over fifty dollars should not
      go into a county dog fund, and I believe that the surplus over fifty dollars should be given
      to the tuition fund. 
     Mr. GORDON: I hope the committee report will not be concurred in. I would not like for the
      people to think that this House had a spite against the common schools of State. The House has
      already vote to reduce the school fund interest, and here is another bill to still further cut
      off the school fund. The fact of it is, the school fund of the State is not as large as it
      ought to be. The average length of schools in this State is not six months; it is ten months
      in Indianapolis, but in many counties it does not exceed four months.
     Mr. SHAMBAUGH: I am induced to defend this bill for the simple reason that many of the
      trustees of northern Indiana have requested that such a bill be passed. Every township has the
      benefit of the money which the citizens of the township are compelled to pay. If they suffer
      no loss and they have this money on hands, it is not
      proper that the township on the other side take the advantage of this and have the use of the
      money paid in by the citizens of the different townships. I do not know how it is in the
      southern part of the State, but I am satisfied that in our county there is a demand for an
      increase in the fund for the purpose of improving our roads, and there is seldom a surplus in
      the dog fund. The common school fund would not suffer by transferring this to the road
      fund.
     Mr. IBACH: It seems strange to me when the gentlemen want any change made, they think the
      whole State of Indiana will be destroyed unless it is made just as they think it ought to be.
      The fact is, the people of Indiana said at the last election that some of the fund that is now
      appropriated to the school fund shall be appropriated by local taxation. The people have said
      that the common school fund is growing, and I believe that there is no fund that needs the
      attention of this Legislature so much as the road fund of Indiana, to put the roads in better
      condition. And, therefore, because the people of Indiana have said that the school fund has
      increased sufficiently, I am in favor of this being appropriated for the purpose of increasing
      the road fund.
     On motion by Mr. GORDON, the bill was indefinitely postponed.
     The House adjourned.

    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.

     THURSDAY, January 27, 1887.
    
    [Omitted from page 228.]
    
     THE PROVOKE LAW.
     The bill [H. R. 92] to repeal the provoke law, was returned from the Judiciary
       Committee with a recommendation that it be indefinitely postponed.
     Mr. PATTON: I think about four years ago I introduced a bill of the same purport. There is a
      good deal to be said on the question but I do not intend to say it. I am 
       opposed
       oppossd
       to the indefinite postponement of this bill because the present law is a barrier
      shield behind which cowards skulk. Some people do not like to have the truth told. If a
      neighbor criticises their conduct the first thing they do is to prosecute him for provoke. If
      you would go a little further and make it a fine to slander a neighbor it would be all right.
      I say a man has a right to protect himself in a decent manner, and I think this report of the
      committee ought to be indefinitely postponed or laid upon the table or something of that
      kind.
     Mr. LINCK: I only have a word to say in answer to the gentleman. I think the weak ones are
      the ones that need protection.
     Mr. PATTON: I am not in favor of protecting the cowards but the weak always.
     Mr. LIN: I am in favor of protecting the cowards. I am in favor of protecting weak women and
      weak men who are not able to protect themselves against bullies. This law was passed at the
      instigation of Judge Downey when he was in the Senate in 1865, and he considered it a very
      important one after a long practice. He said it was the only protection of the weak against
      the strong. I think quarrels should be nipped in the bud. In my short practice of eighteen or
      twenty years since this law has been in force I have found it very salutary in keeping down
      trouble.
     Mr. PIERCE: I, too, have been in the practice of the law for some years,--since 1872. I have
      been in the office of prosecuting attorney for four years and know some of the workings of
      this law. I know that there is more money for the prosecuting attorney resulting from cases
      that have been brought under that section than under any other in the statute book. Men take
      advantage of it, they see the advantage and they invariably act under the law as it is
      now.--Let one seek to provoke you, you can bring him before a justice of the peace and prove
      but a solitary word--  the slightest word that is
      calculated to provoke a man--and the court convicts. The prosecuting attorney in my section of
      the country looks out for these things, he sends out subpoenas for parties and whenever he
      finds case of this kind he brings it before a justice of the peace. I have defended parties
      who have been presented under that law and there is no defence to it. Under that statute cases
      can be made where there is no intent,--that is not a necessary ingredient under this statute.
      Parties are, under that law, brought before court and compelled to pay fines and cost that
      runs from fifteen to twenty-five dollars. It is a matter that we should look into. When I ask
      for this repeal I may say to you I am working against my interest because it brings about
      litigation; but I am working for the welfare of the community in general, and I am not ashamed
      of it.
     Mr. ROBERTS: I cannot concur in the view taken by my friend from Blackford, Jay and Adams
      (Mr.Pierce) as to the question of intention in committing the offence under the provoke
      statute as it now exists. I know of no criminal statute which inflicts a penalty upon any one
      in the absence of an intention to commit the offence. The question of intention enters into
      every case under this statute as in all other criminal cases. I regard this law as a great
      public educator and teacher. It is a daily admonition to men to restrain their passions, and
      it prevents the use of abusive language and admonishes men, when engaged in heated
      conversation, from provoking breaches of the law. I ask members on this floor if they can call
      to mind a single act of blood-shed, except deliberate murder, when it was not preceded by
      insulting words and conduct? This law has a salutary effect on the evil propensities of men.
      My friend from Sullivan (Mr. Patton) has advanced the bold idea that the statute is only a
      shield for cowards. It is cowards who use such insulting language. It is cowards who provoke
      men of courage to violate the law, and when the coward has provoked the man of true courage to
      assault him for his abusive language, then it is that the coward will go before a justice of
      the peace and cause the insulted individual to be punished, while the coward will go free. I
      say this law is intended to reach the coward and punish him for his vulgar insolence, and
      hence the law ought not to be repealed. If it is repealed you unbridle every vulgar tongue in
      the land, leaving the law-abiding citizen witheout any recourse whatever.
     Mr. JEWETT offered an amendment to make the law applicable only in cases where the provoke
      causes an assault and battery.
     Mr. GORDON: That is just what I object to. If you say to me that I am a liar, and I strike
      you, then you are guilty of a misdemeanor, but if do not strike you then there is no crime.
      That is to say, that the crime of one man must depend upon the action of another.
     Mr. JEWETT: I don't think the bill ought to pass, at the same time I think that the law
      ought to be amended. That part of this law which I seek to strike out is almost alway used for
      the benefit of the justice of the peace. The law as it now stands, if construed in the way the
      gentleman from Dearborn (Mr. Roberts) says, would not be objectionable; but I say that in
      practice it is an unmitigated evil. The result is that this law has become odious in many
      communities. I don't believe that a braggart or bully ought to be allowed to address
      insulting language to another. This law has been used to drag people before the courts who, in
      the heat of discussion or argument, used words that were immediately apologised for, and then
      judgment for fines and costs are rendered against them. Usually the fine is one cent, and the
      costs amounting to about fifteen dollars. It is not good policy, I think, to continue this law
      upon the statute book. It is not properly administered. I believe an unkind word that would
      have been speedily recalled, has been perpetuated and made the basis of many a permanent
      quarrel, simply because the officers brought  the parties
      before a court, which by courtesy we call a court of justice.
     Mr. GARDINER: I have been practicing law for a great many yeare in as large a town as the
      gentleman from Floyd (Mr. Jewett), and I fail torecall a single instance where a person has
      been prosecuted for an attempt to provoke another who, after having used the language,
      apologised for it. I cannot recall a single case where the justice or the constable has caused
      the prosecution, but invariably, as far as my experience goes, it is commenced always upon the
      affidavit of the injured party or his friends. As the law would stand if amended it would
      depend upon the commission of a crime, and as suggested by one of my neighbors, in a measure
      would be a bribe to him to commit a crime. If a man has it in his mind to tell one of his
      neighbors what he thinks of him, and would say some violent things to him, or heap upon him
      approbrius epithets, he would commit the crime as described by the provoke law, but he is now
      restrained by this law. If this law is amended or repealed, he tells his neighbor what he
      thinks of him and the quarrel leads to blows. How many crimes have been prevented by this law
      holding the original offender in check we cannot tell. I know of no law on the statute books
      under which there has not grown up abuses. We cannot expect perfection upon this earth. We
      cannot frame any law that will exactly regulate human conduct but this act has been a salutary
      act and has restrained many. Therefore I am opposed to the amendment.
     Mr. GOUGH: I think the law ought to remain as it is now. Whoever by signs or words provokes
      or attempts to provoke another is guilty of a provocation. Why should a person be permitted to
      use such signs or to use such words? I hold those who do are liable for taking the first step
      preceding the crime. I consider this law an educator, a teacher. It teaches men to be
      courteous; it teaches them good manners. Without this law a great strong man like I am could
      go and curse a man, and could not be punished for cursing him. But with this law staring me in
      the face what do I do? I go around the corner and there I give him a cursing. I am opposed to
      taking this restriction off men's action. I am opposed to giving bullies the right to
      stand up and curse a man and abuse him and no punishment to be inflicted on him for doing
      so.
     Mr. KELLISON: I am never in favor of repealing a law if it is intended to subserve a good
      end. This seems to me to be a very important question. I think the law on the statute books
      was designed to prevent a very great evil and to prevent libelers and 
       blackguards
       blackgaurds
       from getting in their work. I do think from the construction that has been put on
      that law it has been made a gigantic evil. The trouble is not with the law. If it were
      possible, by any process, to inject into the head of justices of peace a little good judgment
      and common sense this would be a very good law. I have had some experience with this law, and
      I have seen something of the administration of it. I am not in favor of repealing the law,
      neither am I in favor of the proposed amendment to this bill.
     Mr. FOSTER: I hope this bill will not be indefinitely postponed. The argument of gentlemen
      is, that the law is not properly enforced, and there should be some change. I say it is a good
      thing that the laws are sometimes abused. It will teach the people to place men in office that
      will administer the laws aright. We cannot legislate here because laws are not administered
      right. If this law is good, if when it is properly administered it is all right, then let us
      get justices in the offices who will administer it right. We can find good justices all over
      our country, just as we can find good men in the Legislature. It is just like a lot of little
      road laws and township laws that are brought here by gentlemen who are trying to remedy a
      little evil in their own townships. It has perhaps worked all right everywhere else, but some
      fellow imagines that there is an infringe-  ment on his
      right and he seeks legislation for relief.
     Mr. PATTON [interrupting]: I rise to a question of order. The gentleman is discussing the
      actions of the members of this Legislature and not the merits of the bill. [Laughter.]
     The SPEAKER: The point of order is not well taken.
     On motion by Mr. KELLISON, the amendment was laid on the table.
     The report of the committee was concurred in.
    
    
     A TEMPORARY LOAN.
     The bill [H.R 189] coming up as a special order--
     Mr. CAVEN said: This is a bill introduced by a gentleman from Henry (Mr. Grose) and referred
      to the Committee on Ways and Means and reported back without amendment. The
      bill seems to dispose of very considerable sums of money, and proposes a loan of one million
      dollars, yet it does not make an indebtedness of one single dollar. The extraordinary expense
      has been about $4,400,000, for which no provision was made except partially for the building
      of this State-house. The value of our taxables has decreased. The unavoidable consequence has
      been to converge to this point: that there is a large deficiency. The Insane Hospitals are now
      in course of construction and will be, at some time during this summer, ready for occupancy.
      The commissioners have the right to discontinue this work at any time; but is this the right
      thing to do? These hospitals are now imperitively demanded for the purpose of protecting
      patients, and there are enough patients to fill these and three more like them. A large amount
      of work has been done that has not been paid for, but certificates have been issued and are
      now outstanding. These contracts have been let by former Legislatures. There is one mode by
      which we can liquidate this indebtedness: we can double our assessment. To liquidate the
      present deficiency would require it to be doubled. This would be a great hardship; and another
      objection, it would not bring in the funds in time to meet the deficit. There is another
      reason why that is not the proper course. The State of Indiana can borrow money at
      three-and-a-half per cent. To raise it by immediate taxation means not the payment of this but
      the absolute payment of the principal; calling upon the people to pay the principal of the
      debt where money is worth to them six per cent. instead of borrowing at three-and-a-half per
      cent. Another reason is, these buildings are for the future, they are not for to-day. It is
      for generations yet to come and they can well afford to contribute to the expense of their
      erection. This would leave but one or two things to do.-- Simply to repudiate the debt and
      make no provision for it, or borrow the money. The committee have come to the conclusion that
      the proper course is to borrow, and this would require the funding of about one million
      dollars. To give a little explanation why this is the amount wanted: By information obtained
      from the Auditor of State, the Governor and the State House Commissioners I find the estimated
      receipts are $1,448,025,12. It will be remembered, too, that at the last reduction there was a
      reduction of six-and-a-half per cent., making a difference of $35,000 in our income. The
      Auditor shows a deficit of $666,000. The session of 1885 made provision for the expenses of
      18885 and 1886 and duplicated the expenses for 1886 and 1887. That is provided for, and this
      general large item of $1,297,900 is for expenses from November 1st, 1887, to November 1st,
      1888, to which should be added for the additional hospitals $419,556.05. It is unexpended, but
      it has been contracted for and we are liable for it. A large amount of the work has been done
      so that it devolves upon us to provide for this item. The Auditor estimates for the completion
      of the new State-house $150,000; but the State House Commissioners inform me that it will cost
      @200,000 and then they will be within the limit. The rebuilding of the Soldiers'
      Orphans' Home is estimated at $40,000. I understand that that will probably have to be
      increased by $50,-  000. This, however, does not include
      an estimate for the maintenance and equipment of the institution. Estimated as necessary to
      complete the $107,000; that would have added to the Auditor's deficit. For repairs,
      clothing, etc., $90,000, which again would have to be added to the Auditor's deficit,
      making a difference there of $197,000. The State House Commissioners also estimate for the
      furnishing fund $70,000. A great deal of work ought to be done on the grounds and about the
      State-house, also for the care, maintenance, etc., for this year, so that would require
      $70,000 more to be added to the Auditor's deficit. In this bill is an item of $25,000 for
      printing. I am not fully prepared to explain that.--Then, should we make this loan of
      $1,000,000 at 3½ per cent., the interest will be $35,000, which is not included in the
      Auditor's estimate, making it $2,491,870, leaving a total deficit of $1,043,000.
     M. KELLISON: Has this bill been considered by the Committee on Ways and
       Means?
     The SPEAKER: By the Committee on Ways and Means.
     Mr. KELLISON: I will say that I am a member of that committee and have never had any notice
      of that committee meeting, and have never had an opportunity to meet with that committee.
     The SPEAKER: On several occasions announcement has been made of meetings of that
      committee.
     Mr. JEWETT: I belong to that committee and I have never heard of them.
     Mr. GROSE: I regret that the gentlemen were not there; I noticed that they were not there.
      This is an important bill.
     Mr. CAVEN: I can throw a little light upon this inquiry. The gentlemen are saying that they
      were not notified [reads a notice.] Among the names signed to this is Charles Kellison.
     Mr. KELLISON: Well, I want to explain: that: does not purport to be a notice of a meeting. I
      never knew whether a majority expressed a willingness to attend.
     The business of the House was suspended for--
    
    
     THE JOINT CONVENTION.
     [See page 229 of this book.]
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     Mr. GROSE: The State authorities have assisted me in getting at the facts. Balance in the
      treasury, $39,390.12; estimated to come in, 1,408,635.12. Total, 1,448,025.24. Practically
      that; it depends very largely on the collecting officers of the State. But perhaps it will,
      and I am told that the Auditor has been very careful. Estimated current expenses, $1,297,900.
      That covers the ordinary expenses of the State as now provided. Legislative expenses this
      regular session, $100,000. There has generally been appropriated $125,000, but two years ago
      it fell a little short of $100,000. The new State-house, for completion, is estimated by the
      State House Commissioners at $200,000.--New State-house furnishing and care, including water
      and lights, $70,000 that may be larger or smaller. We can't expect to see these grounds
      lying in this condition for two years. Additional hospital appropriation unused, $419,556.05.
      Appropriations for that has been made, but the money was not here to be expended. They have
      been carrying forward their work. They made the estimates monthly. There was, I will say in
      round numbers, $100,000 that was to be paid on the first day of this month. Another $100,000
      to be paid on the first day of February. They stood that way until the last few days. I am
      informed by the private secretary of the Governor that nearly $100,000, of that has been paid.
      $100,000 is due to the hospital contractors and from them to the laborers. This $419,000 that
      has been appropriated by our predecessors has been counted in the estimates and all we have to
      do is to supply the means. And the board of commissioners of the three new hospitals ask for
      $107,000,--that completes the buildings except the furniture. I have been told  since I came here that this was a useless expenditure. Four years
      ago I thought so too. I thought it was not necessary to at once create and go to such an
      expense, but as I traveled along with it I saw that I was mistaken; and so I have said to
      Senators and Representatives here. In our present Hospital there are say fifteen hundred
      inmates. The number in the poor houses two years ago was about eight or nine hundred.
      According to a report to the State Board of Health very recently made from each county of the
      State, we have of insane and idiots one thousand and thirty-nine. The calamity that comes upon
      some of them in these county poor houses is worse than any of you imagine. They ought to be
      removed at once. The whole number in the State is over thirty-five hundred, very near
      thirty-six hundred and increasing, saying nothing of the death and casualty.
     Mr. PATTON: About the number in the State?
     Mr. GROSE: Three years ago the building board of these hospitals made inquiry of the county
      auditors, and all answered but eight smart alecks. They were not important counties however.
      The large counties gave us the best estimate they could get. Their estimates showed between
      eight and nine hundred, but in the past few months the Board of Health has compiled a
      statement that showed six hundred and something, insane, and four hundred idiots.--Then they
      make an estimate of those in the counties beside that; they make that about one hundred. The
      three new hospitals are intended to accommodate and care for about eleven hundred--four
      hundred at Logansport, four hundred at Richmond and three hundred at Evansville; but through
      some of the changes made in the buildings twelve hundred can be cared for in these three
      buildings. You have nine hundred yet out.-- When I looked around and saw Michigan and Ohio,
      and other States, away in the lead of us,--largely in the advance in the taking care of these
      people, I saw it was necessary to do something. I am frequently met with the idea that it was
      a log-rolling bill and that it ought to be condemned. I don't care if it was, it was a
      necessary act of the Legislature. We only have to appropriate $107,000 in addition to what has
      already been appropriated, and then for maintenance and caring for them as we go along. For
      the next two years we have to make some additional appropriations. I will not go into that
      now; another bill comes up in which it will be more legitimate and proper. Two buildings could
      have been ready now if the money had been on hand; the main part is finished. The Logansport
      one needs a little work; the one at Richmond is in shape, and the engine is in shape for use
      now; not so at Evansville. With this these institutions can be ready for occupancy by June or
      July, and be ready to take these people out of the poor houses. The additional hospital
      appropriations unused is $419,556.05. While that has been appropriated the money is not here,
      and they have strained closely to pay every dollar that can be taken out of the treasury.
      Additional hospitals $90,000 for maintenance. Dr. Rogers is superintendent of the buildings,
      as provided by the statute. The board, with the administration, thought his help and labor was
      very essential. He was employed at a given sum of money per year. When I say to you that that
      cost is smaller than our sister States around us, I think that is a reason why we should bear
      the burden. I believe, as is generally conceded, that the larger portion of our people are of
      the debtor class, and that to press hard taxes upon them now, when we can get money at such
      low rates of interest, is wrong. We talked about that four per cent.--whether we should say
      four or some other sum. We talked with the Governor about that, and the Auditor of State very
      frequently, and we conferred with the commissioners and others, and when it was stated that we
      could just as well say three and one half as four, I believed it. But I don't conceive
      that that makes any difference. I have had  some
      information from a private source how can be obtained, and I thank our Executive has stated
      that it can be got at three-and-a-half and a premium, making it for the first year not more
      than three per cent.--Rather than raise our assessment on the debtor class of people at this
      time I prefer to borrow the money at three and-a-half per cent. The Soldiers'
      Orphans' Home building estimate here is $40,000. I say here frankly I do not see how we
      can get along with that $40,000. The Orphans' Home was burned down; they took the
      insurance money to rebuild it, and it will, perhaps, for a few months, hold those who are now
      turned out. The front of that building to the west is at the first joist, the other is at the
      foundation. There is $20,000 that has already been expended in the building as far as gone,
      and $40,000 may finish the contract for the building. I think we will have to raise that
      estimate about $10,000; that, however, is not in this bill as it was prepared some weeks ago.
      $25,000 for printing; I know nothing about that except as the clerk says so. That makes an
      outlay of $2,466,599.55. We get the estimated receipts $1,448,025.24, and you have
      $1,018,574.43 at that estimate. Now that depends upon what we do with some other institutions,
      the Normal, etc. We must raise the money to take care of the Orphans' Home or they are
      practically useless. Therefore, it looks to me that the necessity demands our action
      now.--When I look to Richmond, Logansport and Evansville, and see these men clamoring for
      their pay, I feel like doing anything to help them.
     Mr. JEWETT: Don't you think it would be better policy to incorporate in this bill
      another loan for the funding of the State debt?
     Mr. GROSE: I would not cripple this in any way.
     Mr. JEWETT: Don't you favor the refunding of the State debt?
     Mr. GROSE: I am inclined to that.
     Mr. PATTON: I will not agree with the gentleman in a very few points. I will agree with him
      that where labor has been employed it ought to be paid, but that failure to pay in the case
      referred is not the fault of the State of Indiana, that is the fault of the contractors. I
      think the Democratic party has been responsible for the state of affairs that we are now in to
      a great measure. I do not favor, and never have favored non-partisan boards. When this
      State-house was provided for, the law provided that it should be supervised by a non-partisan
      board, and ever since that time it has been impossible to bring these parties to a reckoning.
      In 1877 and 1878 building material was very high, labor was high, and iron and everything else
      was high, and upon that the estimates were made for the construction of this State-house. In
      1883 it was discovered that the contractors by their carelessness had piled stone upon stone
      and had everything so badly arranged that they could not tell head or tail about their work,
      and therefore the committee reported that there was no law except that created by their own
      carelessness. We heard nothing more about these things until this session. They passed over
      the session two years ago. You heard no voice coming up from them. I will tell you the reason
      why. They had an investigation here in the city, of Indianapolis where they got a judgment,
      and the court held that the expenses which were incurred for the construction of this
      State-house should not be charged against the $2,000,000. Two years ago I voted for the bill
      and made a fool of myself. No one here is willing to tackle this high joint commission,
      composed of non-partisans; but I propose to do it, and show what these people are doing. In
      this bill you propose to give them $200,000 for the purpose of completing this building. For a
      furnishing fund only two years ago there was $150,000 set apart.--They make a report, and what
      do they do? They tell a lie upon the face of this report! They state a falsehood when they
      state that they will complete this State-house within the limit of $2,000,000. Look at these
        columns of granite from Italy; there was $10,000 of a
      duty upon the materials. The stone and material should have been taken from Indiana if
      possible. It has gone on and on and the chairs and desks have been imported from Michigan, and
      Indiana industries given the go-by. They have not acted in good faith with the people of the
      State of Indiana. They have not honestly carried out the law passed in 1877 for the
      construction of this State-house. The architect of this building gave a bond to erect the
      same, and that the excess, if any over his estimate, should be taken out of his bond of
      $100,000; but we find that the architect, Edwin May, died, and we find that he received two
      per cent. upon the construction and another man was given one-and-a-half per cent. to carry it
      out. In 1883 they came before the Legislature for the purpose of having the contract for
      $1,509,000 set aside. The Legislature decided against them. This building ought to be erected
      for $1,509,000; but that is not all. I say that when this law was passed in 1877 it provided
      that this building was not to cost more than $2,000,000, and to-day they have the impudence to
      come and ask for additional appropriations. They have, from appropriations and sale of old
      State property, a total of $2,229,625.41, and there are three payments and two installments
      for 1877 amounting to $230,000 more. They now ask you to give them $200,000 more with $70,000
      additional to the furnishing fund, making $270,000 more. If you pass this appropriation
      to-day, that makes $529,000 more than the law ever proposed or the people expressed themselves
      willing to do. I am talking to those who have a respect for the down-trodden tax-payers, and
      to notify the people what has been done under a Democratic administration. If the Democratic
      party is responsible for these appropriations why not stop now? We have gone to the end of the
      rope. I say they should be held to their contract.--The bondsmen have substituted themselves
      as contractors. They propose to take charge of this building and go on asking appropriation
      after appropriation. These are the facts in this case, and it will cost the people over
      $500,000 more money than was ever intended to be put into this building. I say it is a nice
      building--if I can draw upon my imagination. I don't want to say anything about it. A man
      would have to go a great way off before it would strike him that it is a handsome
      building.
     Mr. GORDON: I move to recommit this bill to the Committee on Ways and
       Means, because four of that committee had no knowledge of the meeting when this
      bill was considered, and simply that they may have an opportunity to consider the bill before
      the whole committee. I think there was a controversy between the Auditor of State and the
      State-house contractors as to what amount of money had been appropriated. An appropriation of
      $200,000 was made which remained in the treasury and was not then used.-- The Auditor claimed
      that that appropriation not having used within the year had lapsed, and had passed into the
      State fund. If this is true, then the State-house commissioners are entitled to $200,000 more
      than they have got. I do not know whether this has been rectified or not. We ought to have an
      examination of the matter and of all the money that has been appropriated from first.
     Mr. KELLISON moved as a substitute that the committee report the amount of money necessary
      to meet the extraordinary expenses of the State, etc. He said: I make this motion because I
      believe that all bills of this character ought to be carefully scrutinized. I think any
      measure that comes before this House to create a debt against the State of Indiana of more
      than a million dollars ought to receive the unanimous consent of all the members of the
       Committee of Ways and Means. There are two or three members that I know
      had no opportunity of meeting with the Ways and Means Committee. I am
      willing to learn or receive information from any source that I can, but I am not willing, and
        will not vote to create an indebtedness to the amount
      named in this bill unless I am more fully satisfied. We enter into a contract with the parties
      that engaged to build this State-house to complete it for a certain amount of money. I do not
      know as to the amount of money that has been expended for that purpose, and I must have an
      opportunity to investigate all the facts from the time that contract was entered into until
      the present time before I will vote to appropriate another dollar. I think that this motion is
      not asking anything unreasonable, when it is considered that only a bare majority of the
      committee were present at the time this report was made. I know that the gentleman from Floyd
      states that he was not present, and I think the gentleman from Franklin was not present, and
      that was the case with myself.--I never had any notice of the meeting. It is true that I
      signed a paper in relation to a meeting but I thought it was only to find out if a majority of
      the members could attend at the time named. I never heard anything more about it. I do not
      know that there is anything wrong in this bill. I notice that the Governor of the State in his
      message has recommended the refunding of a large portion of the public debt of the State of
      Indiana. It struck me as a very wise suggestion, and if we are to create another debt it seems
      to me that that ought to be taken into consideration. We want to hear both sides of the case
      before voting on a bill, and therefore I hope that this motion will prevail.
     The substitute motion was passed.
    
    
     BRIBERY OF VOTES.
     The bill [H. R. 104] was returned from the Judiciary Committee with
      amendments.
     Mr. MOCK: I introduced a bill here of the same kind as this, but this covers the same
      ground. I am opposed to the insertion of the word "corruptly" as recommended by the
      committee. The object of that is to allow persons who are wealthy to hire persons to work for
      them. I say that money cannot be used in any way to secure votes or influence at elections
      unless it is used corruptly. The word "corruptly" simply destroys the law. I believe
      that any person who uses his money to hire persons to do such work for him uses his money
      "corruptly." The object of that word is to allow persons to hire other persons to
      work for them at the polls. I am not in favor of the amendment for that reason.
     Mr. ROBERTS: I regard this bill as a very important measure. It is intended to strike at the
      root of great evil. In the newspapers of the country we read that the affairs of our State are
      conducted corruptly.--One of the great evils is the corrupt practices which are inaugurated
      and brought into being in the primary elections or conventions for the purpose of determining
      who the party's candidate or representative may be. I am not charging one party with this
      practice more than another. It exists in all parties. The evil begins in our primaries. If the
      primaries are conducted corruptly; if money is used and men are nominated by the action of
      such conventions, to that extent the public interests suffer. The public suffer because the
      men are not the choice of the people. If this practice was prohibited in the primary elections
      and the primary election kept pure, then indeed would one important step be made in the
      direction of reform. Another advantage is given by this bill. It gives to men of limited
      circumstances in life an equal show with the man who may carry a well replenished pocket-book.
      As it is now, a man who has no money stands but little chance with the man who has the will
      fitted pocket-book. The committee suggests that the word "corruptly" be inserted. I
      think that that amendment ought not to be adopted. I believe it would destroy the effect of
      the bill. I believe it would lead to the improper use of money in our elections. My object in
      this bill is the purification of the primaries. A man should seek office on his merits and not
      on the size and capacity of his pocket-book. It has been said that money might be used
      legitimately. I deny it. Money can- not be legitimately
      used in such places. There is no way in which it can be used properly. I will explain why I
      did not insert a section in this bill making it a criminal offence on the part of the man who
      might receive the money. Would you punish the man who received the money equally with the man
      who tried to bribe him? The result would be that you would inspire the man who received the
      money to keep his mouth closed. It would be an injustice then to punish the man who gave the
      information concerning the man who approached him. This bill provides that the party who
      received the money or the man who is approached may testify against him. Purify your primaries
      and that will be a good start.
     Pending the discussion--
     The House adjourned.
    
   
   
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
    
     FRIDAY, January 28, 1887.

     BRIBERY OF VOTES.
     The consideration of the bill [H. R. 104] against bribery at elections was resumed.
     Mr. JEWETT: The matter under consideration was an amendment offered by the gentleman from
      Franklin (Mr. Harrell) which in effect provides penalties for falsifying the returns of
      primary elections. Personally I favor that idea, but I don't believe that this amendment
      ought to have been offered to this bill. It will destroy the harmony of the bill; it will
      introduce entirely new features. The object of the bill, as I understand it, is to prevent the
      use of money at elections for the purpose of corrupting the vote at the general election, and
      also for the purpose of preventing the use of money at primaries. In otherwords to prevent the
      debauchery of a voter's manhood. I am in favor of that bill; I believe that nine tenths
      of the men who sell their votes at election first become hardened by accepting money at the
      primary election. This amendment is objectionable for another reason. We have no law in this
      State regulating or prescribing the manner of holding primary elections. Now this provides a
      penalty for doing an act the manner of which is not prescribed by law. In the absence of
      anything of that kind it would be out of harmony.
     Mr. HARRELL: The objections of the gentleman from Floyd against the amendment are applicable
      to the whole bill. He says there is no law authorizing primary elections. It is true that
      there is no statute authorizing a primary by any party, but this is no reason for not having
      an amendment to this bill. There is no law authorizing or legalizing the action of any person
      in seeking the nomination. This amendment is on the same principle as the statutes in relation
      to disturbing a congregation. Any one who disturbs a meeting is liable to a penalty. There is
      no statute authorizing any particular assembly in any particular way, but if you disturb any
      assembly you are liable under the statute. It is not wrong for a number of persons to meet at
      a certain place and receive votes for the purpose of nominating somebody; they have a perfect
      right to do that. Having this right it seems to me it is proper and just to have a law on the
      statute book prohibiting, as this amendment intends to prohibit, anybody from making false
      returns or false counts. That is the object of this amendment, and it seems to me it should be
      adopted.
     Mr. ROBERTS: It occurs to me that my friend from Floyd (Mr. Jewett) misapprehended what
      would be the effect of this amendment. It is in precise keeping with the very first section of
      the bill, which prescribes the penalty of the improper use of money by candidates to secure
      influence in their behalf. It applies to where the candidates are elected by popular vote of
      the people. I think the amendment is a good one; it adds strength to the bill and completes it
      in all its provisions.
     Mr. REYNOLDS: I am very heartily in favor of the amendment.--There are in these primary
      elections opportunities for counting men out, and such counts have been made.  But I am more heartily in favor of the general provisions of the
      bill. There is one thing that the people of the State ought to be jealous of and that is the
      purity of the ballot: I am inclined to believe that most of the fraud of the general election
      has its origin in these primary elections.--Many men have been influenced to first vote
      corruptly in these primary elections.
     Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Owen: I am heartily in favor of this bill. In order to purify the
      elections the first step should be to purify the county and township elections. I am also
      heartily in favor of the amendment and I hope that it will pass.
     Mr. GARRISON: In my county we have never had any fraud in our election, but there have been
      several considerable frauds at our primaries. We have tried primary elections and mass
      conventions, and have rather favored mass conventions, but frauds are committed at these mass
      conventions also. I believe the amendment would fix this matter in our county.
     Mr. COX, of Miami, demanded the previous question, and under its operation the amendment was
      agreed to, and the bill ordered engrossed.
    
    
     TO DEFINE ARSON.
     The bill [H. R. 122] to amend the law defining arson was returned from the
       Judiciary Committee with a favorable report.
     Mr. ALEXANDER: Under our present law the courts have instructed juries that it made no
      difference what was in a house, the burning or attempting to burn the house was not arson
      unless the house was worth twenty-five dollars. This bill provides that the house shall be of
      the value of ten dollars. I think it is a good bill.
     Mr. FOSTER: From the reading of it and from the explanation of the gentleman from Greene
      (Mr. Alexander), it seems to me that the passage of this bill hardly warrants the
      consideration of it. It seems to me that a building worth from twenty-five down to ten dollars
      would hardly be a dwelling. The Latin maxim "Lex minimus non curat" I think applies
      here. It seems to me such a building would be a mere outhouse, pig shed or something of that
      kind, which a mischievous person might be prosecuted for arson for burning. I think the
      statute would cover every case sufficiently.
     Mr. ROBERTS: I cannot understand the reasoning of my friend.--The law, he says, does not run
      after little things. The hovel of the poor is as sacred to them as the marble palace of the
      rich, I care not if it be constructed of reeds, if it is a shelter fromh the storms of
      heaven.
     Mr.FOSTER: Where can you find a habitation that is worth less than twenty-five dollars?
     Mr. ROBERTS: There is a hundred in my own county that not a man on this floor would give
      twenty five dollars for. This is intended to protect those who through poverty are compelled
      to reside in hovels. And I think it was wisdom in the gentleman offering this bill to protect
      the hovel of the poor as well as the palatial residence of the rich.
     Mr. SCOTT: I do hope that the report of the committee will be concurred in. This bill has
      been prepared by a prosecuting attorney of long experience. It has been the experience of this
      gentleman that in a case before the court where the building that was burned was a log cabin,
      the home of a poor man, where he had all his goods,--that home was burned and the court
      decided upon the evidence that this home was not worth twenty-five dollars, therefore the
      criminal was not liable for arson under that statute. There are liable to be many such cases.
      It is evident to me that there should be an amendment to that statute, so I hope that the
      House will concur in the report of the committee; it is a unanimous report.
     Mr. VAN SLYKE: The man that steals five cents is just as mean as the man who steals five
      millions. The principle involved is the same, and the man that is mean enough to burn a home
      that is, not worth five dollars is just as mean as the man who burns the home worth
      twenty-five thousand  dollars. If the gentleman [Mr.
      Foster] will drive out he can find homes here and there and yonder and some them on the pikes
      of Madison county, that are not worth ten dollars. It seems to me that the gentleman exposes
      his ignorance of the the things in his own county.
     After amendment [see page 248] the bill was ordered engrossed.
    
    
     ATTORNEY' FEES IN NOTES.
     The bill [H. R. 195] requiring the rate per cent. for attorneys' fees to be stated in
      notes, was returned from the Judiciary Committee, the majority recommending
      passage, and minority indefinite postponement.
     Mr. MOCK: There are several reasons why this bill should become a law, according to my
      judgment. In the first place, in the absence of any law, parties can make agreements as they
      please. The law has been to restrain that right. This bill provides that the attorneys'
      fees shall not be valid unless the amount is stated in the note. There is nothing unreasonable
      in that. This bill if it becomes a law, will be a great improvement over the present law for
      this reason: in the first place the party will know what he has to pay; another reason is that
      the attorneys' fees cannot be increased. Then there is another reason why this should be
      the law. If any note is obtained by fraud or without any consideration the plaintiff has the
      opening and closing because the attorney's fees must be proven. There are these three
      reasons why this bill should pass, and I know not a single reason why the present law should
      stand. If any gentleman has any reason to give why the law should continue as it is, I hope he
      will give them for I would like to hear them. This bill intends to protect the poorer class of
      the community as against those who are able to uphold their rights.
     Mr.ROBERTS: I think this proposed law is a very good one. It has been a common thing,
      especially in the drawing of bills and notes, that there is a provision in them to the effect
      that if the party fail to pay the note the party holding the note may collect reasonable
      attorney's fees.--I am a practicing lawyer; I make my living that way, and I like
      compensation for my services, but I hope never to make my living by oppressing men where
      attorneys' fees are provided for. It is left to such proof as the plaintiff may see
      proper to submit as to the value of the attorney's fees, and it is not a very easy matter
      to determine when the testimony is altogether on one side, in favor of the attorney or in
      favor of the plaintiff.--Under the old style the defendant in a suit was at the mercy of the
      plaintiff. This bill merely provides that the parties shall agree what the attorney's
      fees shall be. I hope that this bill will pass.
     Mr. GRIFFITHS: I hope the minority report on this bill will be accepted. If the minority
      report be adopted and a man desires to agree in advance what the rate shall be, he has the
      right to do so. We all know that when a note is signed, frequently no attention is paid to the
      provisions for attorney's fees. When a man executes a note of that kind he expects to pay
      it, so he does not care what provision there is in the note in reference to attorney's
      fees. If the majority view is adopted you will find in every note ten per cent. and no five
      per cent. It seems to me you can establish no rule, as it will be more expensive in one suit
      than in another.
     Mr. BUCKLES: I regard the contract for attorney's fees as an absolute wrong to the poor
      classes in the interest of the broker and money loaner. The amount of that fee, as a general
      thing, is more than he would have to pay if he had made a contract. He can get it done for
      less money than he makes them pay. It is an outrage upon justice. It is a scheme that should
      not be insisted upon by gentlemen of the bar. You will not find a time when the condition of
      the poor man will better warrant this than to day. He moved to recommit the bill with
      instructions to strike out all reference to attorneys' fees.
     
     Mr. IBACH: I am opposed to all these laws that give attorney's fees. In the district I
      represent six thousand dollars in fees have been allowed in a ditch case. It is time that we
      as attorneys stand up against this.
     Mr. SHAMBAUGH: There is a spirit on the part of each and every one here to give attention to
      the debtor class. If a man should borrow money from me I would expect him at time when it was
      due to pay me, add if he makes default he should pay as much as I am compelled to pay to
      collect it, and if I enter suit the judge ought to say what the reasonable attorney's
      fees are. I say in justice to the man who loans the money the borrower ought to be compelled
      to pay attorney's fees if suit is brought to recover.
     Mr. GORDON: I think that motion ought not to prevail for the reason that I believe it is
      useless. If the bill is to be amended let us amend it right here in the House and be done with
      it. I see nothing in the argument of the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Buckles). I am surprised
      at such an argument. Almost all the numerous measures that have been introduced were for the
      purpose of looking to the interests of the laboring man. There have been bills for the
      soldier, and even the down-trodden farmer has been carefully looked after, and yet no member
      of this House has lifted up his voice in behalf of the poor lawyer. It is a matter of very
      small consequence to an attorney whether he gets his fee from the man who has the note or the
      man who pays money, I don't care whether it is in the note at all.
     Mr. PATTON: Four years ago, when I was practicing law, I introduced a bill to repeal this
      law. I believed it was a matter necessary for the purpose of elevating the profession. I think
      that the profession of law has been honored by any lawyer that will leave it and go to
      farming. It is one of the sure signs of progress, improvement and development. As a lawyer his
      home life is spent in settling the difficulties of others, and more than that he lives upon
      the misfortunes of others, will the farmer stands up in the legislative halls to defend the
      rights of the widow and her cow.
     The minority report was substituted for the majority report.
     Mr. Buckles' motion to recommit was then agreed to.
     The House adjourned.

    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.

     JOINT CONVENTION ROLL-CALL.
     That part of the Secretary's minutes having reference to the Joint Convention of
      yesterday, being read--
     Mr. MCDONALD: I ask that the record show I was present in the Joint
      Convention yesterday and ready to vote for Mr. Turpie. I don't want to reflect upon what
      the committee did, but desire to record the facts.
     Mr. FOWLER: I want the record to show the same for myself. I state here over Sunday that the
      record might show that I voted for a United States Senator in the convention. By some kind of
      arrangement the record shows only those were present who were selected to vote. I don't
      care to go upon record in that way. I want the record to show that I was in the Joint
      Convention; and I want it understood that I will not be bound by any agreement of that kind in
      the future. I want the record to show that I was in the Joint Convention and ready to
      vote.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair desires to call the attention of other Senators who
      have made this request to him, that the chair vigorously protested against pairs being made;
      but after so many pairs were made in the House of Representatives it seemed to be contageous
      and they could not make them too fast, and it was impossible for us to foretell, until after
      the ballot was taken, what the result would have been; and the Republicans were in the same
      condition. It was not the fault of those who stayed, but it was the fault of those who ran
      away from the Senate and from the House of Representatives.
     Mr. SELLERS: It seems to me Senators are making much ado about nothing. Everybody knows that
      the vote of yesterday was taken in the manner it was because there were so many pairs and such
      uncertainty about pairing that, as neither party desired to take an unfair advantage of the
      other, it was arranged that a certain number only should vote. No reasonable constituent of
      any member will complain of the fact that his Senator's name does not appear on the
      records. There is nothing in this objection. The truth is, there were so many away it was
      uncertain when they would return. Neither party knew the condition of the vote as it would have been without this arrangement. I see no reason
      why Senators should complain if their names were not placed upon the roll; I meant no slight
      to any one. I only selected them as I came to those I knew were not paired. Nor had we time to
      look up pairs that had been made to ascertain who were paired and with whom paired.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: I rise to a question of order; there is nothing pending before the Senate.
     Mr. FOWLER: There is something pending before the Senate, too.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The question is whether the minutes shall be approved.
     Mr. McCLURE; I look upon it as a grave matter that a Senator or
      Representative should not appear in a joint convention on such an important occasion as we had
      before us yesterday. I knew nothing about the arrangement until they refused to call my name.
      But afterwards I inquired into the nature of the circumstances by which that thing was brought
      about. I care but little about it. I never in all my services in the Legislature failed to be
      present on such an important occasion. All we require is to have something on record to show
      we were there. There ought to be some arrangement by which the absentees could be
      accommodated.--If they would put something on the journal to indicate there was some kind of
      an arrangement made by which our names were not called, that would be satisfactory.
     Mr. SEILERS: The record shows every pair, and your name does not appear among them. The
      newspaper will report it all.
     Mr. McCLURE: But when this vote goes out in the newspapers our
      constituents cannot come up here and search the records to see about these things. We are
      representing our constituents, and the record does not show we were there ready to vote; that
      is what I object to. I hope there will be no more of such kind of monkey shows as we had
      yesterday.
     Mr. FOWLER: One word farther. I feel that this is a matter of importance to myself. It is
      suggested by the Senator from White (Mr. Sellers) that the newspapers have gone all over the
      State and explained this: but that is not a record; newspapers are soon forgotten and lost.
      The record goes into every county in Indiana and the record shows there were eight or ten
      Senators there, but all the rest were absent. The fact ought to appear in the record why it is
      so. I move the record be made to show an agreement was entered into and these Senators were
      present, but under the agreement they did not vote. There ought to be something of that kind
      on the record. It is an easy matter for the Senator from White to say there is nothing in this
      matter;--that it is a tempest in a tea-pot;--it is an easy matter for a Senator whose name is
      on the record to say that.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Will the Senator from Owen permit a suggestion? What light will
      those Senators stand in who rushed away on pairs?
     Mr. FOWLER: I don't know what light they will stand in; but I know in what light I
      stand. I stayed over Sunday here for the purpose of taking no chances, in order to be here to
      vote yesterday in joint convention; as to those who went away without or with pairs I care
      nothing. I ask as far as my name is concerned that the record shall show that I was
      present.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair will appoint the Senator from Owen (Mr. Fowler) and the
      Senator from-- [A Senator addressed the Chair.] Wait a moment. The chair will talk when he
      starts to talk, if it takes all day to do it. And the Senator from Hendricks (Mr. Campbell) to
      arrange this matter so it will be agreeable to the Senators objecting, and so it will not
      affect the arrangement of yesterday.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: I suggest those Senators who were present and not voting sign a protest.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: I will appoint you from the Republican side to get up anything
      that is necessary.
     
     Mr. WEIR: I was paired with the senator from Elkhart; we are both present; I desire the
      journal to show that fact.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair will arrange that; the Secretary will call the roll of
      the Senate. There were a great many pairs made where there was no use of it. The Secretary
      will call the roll of the Senate; Senators will answer to their names.
     The roll call discovered all Senators present and answering to their names except Mr.
      Tharp.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Pairs heretofore subsisting between Senators ought to be off; or
      something done about that.
     Mr. SELLERS: I move that the record show that all pairs heretofore made be declared off. I
      want the record to show it.
     Mr. HUSTON: I want to ask if all Republican Senators have answered to roll-call?
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: All Senators are noted as present except Senator Tharp. A motion
      is made by the Senator from White that all pairs heretofore subsisting between Senators shall
      be declared off. If that be taken by common consent I won't put the motion. It is taken
      by consent; if any pairs are to be made, they must be made in the future.
     Subsequently Mr. FOWLER submitted the following: 
     
      
       
        The undersigned Senators respectfully protest against the record of the joint convention
         as made up for January 31, 1887, for the reason that it appears from said record that we
         were not present at the vote taken for United States Senator, when, in fact, we were each
         and all present and ready to vote if our names had been called, and we disapprove of the
         agreement by which our names were not called. We ask that this protest be entered upon the
         record.

     Mr. SHIVELY called for the special order for this hour, being the bill [S. 13] to regulate the practice of Dentistry.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Senator from Marion [Mr. Thompson] asked to take up his bill
      yesterday, and the chair announced it should be taken up this morning, and the chair holds his
      word good with the Senator. Read the bill.
    
    
     HENDRICKS MONUMENT.
     The bill [S. 9] > to authorize the erection in this
      city on any land owned by the State a monument to Thomas A. Hendricks, was read the second
      time.
     Mr. TRIPPETT offered an amendment limiting the operation of the bill to the Circle and
      Capitol square. There is a feeling that University park should be sold, it being a burden to
      the State. He thought the Hendricks monument should be placed in university square.
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion, declared that the park belonged to the city, and has been so
      considered by eminent lawyers.
     Mr. WINTER said the University park belonged to the State of Indiana, it being donated by
      the United States government. The State cannot sell that park nor use it for any other purpose
      than a State university. The most appropriate place for the Hendricks monument is University
      square.
     Mr. FRENCH favored the amendment. This monument should be placed in the Circle or on the
      east part of the Capitol grounds when purchased and completed.
     Mr. CAMPBELL did not wish to see the Senate go on record as prohibiting the friends of these
      deceased gentlemen from placing monuments in any grounds of the State.
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion, received intelligence for the first time from Senator Winter that
      the Hendricks monument would be placed in University square. It was the intention to locate
      this monument on the east side of the Capitol--Mrs. Hendricks having indicated a purpose to
      donate her lot on which the monument may be erected. Those most interested in raising funds
      have indicated a preference for the State-house grounds.

     
     Mr. SELLERS insisted the Senate should not say to the Odd Fellows they shall be limited as
      to where that body shall erect a monument to the memory of Schuyler Colfax, and the same
      principle should apply to the Hendricks Monument Association.--The State-house grounds would
      not be so appropriate for the monument to be erected by the Odd Fellows exclusively. He
      offered a substitute amendment (which was accepted by Mr. Trippett) to strike from the bill
      the words "University square."
     Mr. BAILEY opposed the substitute, though favoring the Capitol grounds, and thought the
      privilege should be accorded the friends of the deceased to place the monument where they
      pleased on the State grounds.
     Mr. WEIR questioned the legal authority to grant such privileges.
     Mr. BAILEY did not think monuments were of such a structure as would impair the government
      grant. The State-house grounds should embrace ground to the east and on the west far enough to
      include Military park. Monuments are usually distributed all about cities.
     Mr. MCDONALD favored the bill as introduced.
     Mr. URMSTON agreed with the view taken by Senator Winter of University park, and in addition
      questioned the right to grant monumental privileges thereon,--as being inconsistent with the
      particular purpose for which it was donated.
     Mr. HOWARD, of St. Joseph, did not believe in the proposed restrictions.
     Mr. ZIMMERMAN moved to insert the words "on any unoccupied ground on the east side of
      the State-house grounds," which was declared out of order. He desired all the State
      grounds declared free for such purposes.
     Mr. DUNCAN, of Tipton, demanded the previous question, which was seconded by the Senate, and
      under its operation the amendment was rejected.
     Mr. CAMPBELL asked but failed to obtain unanimous consent to amend by requiring that the
      monument shall not cost less than $10,000.
     The bill was ordered engrossed. The constitutional rules were set aside by a more than
      two-thirds vote, and the bill was read the third time.
     On motion by Mr. CAMPBELL, the bill was referred to a select committee of one, with
      instructions to amend so that such monument shall not cost less than $5,000, which committee
      reported at once, and the report was concurred in.
     The bill, as thus amended, was finally passed by yeas 48, nays 0.
    
    
     THE DENTISTRY BILL.
     Mr. SHIVERY again demanded the consideration of a special order for this p.m.--the bill
       [S. 13] to regulate the practice of Dentistry. It was
      read the second time.
     Mr. TRIPPETT offered an amendment to strike out of Section 3 all that part beginning at the
      word "and," in line 10, to and including the word "same," in line 13.
     Mr. SHIVELY: If the Examining Board is not invested with authority to approve or reject
      diplomas, this bill would be useless. It is for that, very object that the bill is
      created.--Suppose a certain number of individuals were to associate themselves together and
      style themselves a Dental College, but were in reality nothing but a set of schemers issuing
      and selling diplomas, should such diplomas be received as legitimate and the holders
      registered as qualified dentists? Most assuredly not.
     Mr. BAILEY: I am disposed to favor this bill, but I think it is a very dangerous thing to
      place in the hands of any five men the power to say what institutions shall grant diplomas
      that will pass muster before this board.
     Mr. SCHLOSS: This board is elected by the State Dental Association and therefore they must
      be good men.
     Mr. WEIR: A provision in the bill reads that the holder of a diploma shall furnish
      satisfactory evidence that he is duly qualified to practice dentistry; is not that sufficient
      authority for the board?
     
     Mr. SHIIVELY: I think it is not. He might contend that the board has no authority to reject
      it, and demand to be registered as a qualified dentist. I trust the authority will be left
      with the board.
     Mr. FRENCH: I have consulted the Board of Legislation sent here by the Dentistry Association
      of Indiana, an association that meets annually, and nearly all, if not quite all the reputable
      dentists of Indiana--some five hundred and fifty--are members. They meet and appoint officers
      and committees; they are men selected for their dental qualifications to fill their positions;
      and they are re-elected every year. There is no intention to discriminate against reputable
      Dental Colleges; but there are certain so-called dental colleges issuing diplomas to men who
      never saw the the inside of a Dental College.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore interrupted the proceeding by directing a roll-call of the Senate
      preparatory to the joint convention to vote for United States Senator, which discovered every
      Senator present and answering to his name.
     At noon the Senate left its chamber, returning in fifteen minutes.
     A recess was taken till 2 o'clock.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     Mr. FRENCH [resuming]: The pending amendment if adopted would take out of the bill all the
      good there is in it. The bill invests in a board of five too much authority, it is said. I do
      not believe it does. The board is to be responsible directly to the Dental Association of
      Indiana. This bill represents the desire of the Dental Association of Indiana, as expressed
      through their legislative committee appointed at their last annual meeting. It seems to me the
      bill as it stands is not unreasonable. I am informed nearly every State has a similar law in
      this respect. All these gentlemen of the Dental Association seek to do is to put this State on
      a footing equal with other States where they can protect the people. They come here in good
      faith, and for one I don't feel like striking out the vital measure in this bill, or put
      it in such a shape as to defeat it; but would rather rely upon those who are seeking the best
      interests of their profession and pass such a law as they desire. That is my general idea of
      the matter.
     Mr. MULLINIX: I would prefer to see this bill passed as presented to this body for various
      reasons. The time has come in the history of Indiana when men who pretend to practice a
      profession must be qualified. There is nothing so closely allied to the practice of medicine
      as the practice of dentistry, and every doctor knows it is essential and necessary that a man
      to practice this profession be qualified. To tell what is the matter with a tooth, sometimes,
      requires as much skill as to tell what kind of disease affects a man. Every man who undertakes
      to practice dentistry ought to be qualified, and it is nothing but reasonable and right that
      we should give these men a chance to judge the qualifications of practitioners. We have bogus
      institutions all over the country who sell men diplomas. This board should have the right to
      classify the holders of diplomas as they should be. I tell you, my friends, part of the duty
      of this board should be to pass upon and scrutinize the qualifications of individuals
      proposing to practice dentistry. I heartily endorse this bill and hope to see every measure
      endorsed by this body and see the bill passed into a law.
     Mr. TRIPPETT: Gentlemen have talked about colleges selling diplomas; if a college sells a
      diploma to any man who appears before this Board of Examiners they require him to furnish
      satisfactory evidence that he is entitled to a license. Will any man suppose for a moment that
      because he has purchased a diploma he is entitled to it, or is qualified to practice? If a man
      comes to this board with proper qualifications I say he should have a right to practice
      dentistry in the State of Indiana. As far as I am concerned I would as soon see the diploma
      business stricken out and make a man rely upon his quali-  fications, because that is the essential and the only thing we ought to look to. It is true
      if a man has a diploma from an honest college it is an evidence that he is qualified, but if a
      man can get a diploma from any reputable college he can appear before any board and stand up
      for examination and let his qualifications be established in that way. It seems to me the
      portion of this bill asked to be stricken out should be stricken out. I don't know
      whether this State Association includes a majority of the dental people of Indiana or not; I
      have no information about it. I do not know whether there are different schools in dentistry
      as there are in the practice of medicine; if there are, and this Dental Association is
      composed of one school, it would be an outrage to the others to exclude them.
     Mr. JOHNSON: I am a friend to the principle involved in this bill. I think it is right. It
      is not only just to dentists but it is necessary to put them on the same footing with dentists
      of other States; but I am unwilling any bill drawn as this is should go upon the statute
      books. These dentists desire to prohibit any man from practicing dentistry in the State unless
      he passes an examination before a board of dentists, but they desire a provision incorporated
      in the law whereby if they recognize a man as coming from a reputable college they may
      dispense with the examination, and license him upon that alone. But as there are bogus
      colleges who will for a consideration confer upon a man a diploma, they desire that such a man
      shall be required to submit to an examination. In other words: they desire authority to make
      an examination irrespective of what kind of a diploma he may have. But these kind of
      amendments will not be sufficient to put this bill in proper shape, I therefore propose, if an
      expression of opinion will warrant it, to move to recommit the bill with instructions to
      report a provision which these dentists are trying to have incorporated in it, and that is,
      that no man shall have the right to practice unless subject to an examination or have a
      reputable diploma, when they may wave an examination and license upon that.
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion: Read, line 12 where it reads: "any Dental College."
     Mr. JOHNSON: If the gentleman will take the trouble to examine he will find that the bill is
      contradictory from beginning to end, and in no instance would the object sought to be attained
      be recognized on the statute book in the form of law. The language is so ambiguous it should
      be put in proper shape before being crystalized into the form of law and put on the statute
      book. It should be plainly, succinctly and squarely expressed in order to prevent litigation
      and serve the highest interests of the people.
     Mr. URMSTON: The statements made by the Senator from Wayne (Mr. Johnson) strike me forcibly.
      If this amendment prevail the bill would be subject to more than one construction. Section one
      provides that parties having a diploma may practice without reference to an examination.
      [Reads.] If we adopt this amendment then this board has no right to take into consideration
      diplomas from regular incorporated colleges; but if we leave this language every man who
      desires to practice has to apply whether he has a diplomas or not, and then the board has the
      right to pass on the whole subject matter. I think the amendment ought not to prevail.
     Mr. WEIR : The principle sought to be reached is a correct one. The better qualification of
      any person practicing any profession, the better that profession and the better for the
      public. A good deal of legislation is sought to be obtained on this subject in various
      professions, but the Legislature should be careful in granting power to such boards--they
      should not be vested with extraordinary powers. I call attention to the bill as it would read
      if this amendment were adopted. [Reads.] The fact that this association is asking with such
      persistency this extraordinary power inclines me to refuse to grant it. It makes no difference
      whether a man  has ever seen a college or not, if he is
      qualified he is entitled to practice the profession of his choice. Another peculiar provision
      is in Section 5. [Reads.] I am in doubt about the meaning of the words: "as assistant or
      otherwise." That is a comprehensive term, and the effect of these words become important
      in considering this bill. Suppose a person has some little experience, as I construe it, he
      cannot go into a dental office and work as an assistant without making him liable to the
      punishment of the law.
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Jasper: The object is to be satisfied that the applicant is qualified to
      practice dentistry.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [interrupting]: There is something or nothing under discussion. It
      seems to the chair there is an amendment to Section 3 pending. Unless there is something
      before the Senate to amend Section 1 the discussion as to that section is out of order. The
      Secretary will read the amendment under discussion and Senators will confine themselves to the
      amendment under consideration. Any reference to other sections is out of order until the bill
      is gone through with. The senator from Jasper has the floor.
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Jasper: The amendments are intended to give the board power to examine all
      applicants. If the board determines that no examination is necessary, it only costs two
      dollars and twenty-five cents to commence the practice of dentistry. If he is compelled to
      undergo an examination then he is entitled to a license upon passing favorably and paying the
      fee of twenty-five dollars. That is the meaning of this section. This language is essential.
      The entire bill is plain and perfectly in unison one section with another.
     Mr. HUSTON: I desire to offer an amendment to Section 2 so that the board shall consist of
      five practicing dentists, one to be appointed by the governor, one by the State Board of
      Health, and three by the State Dental Association. I present this that it may be considered in
      connection with the amendment now being considered. The effect of this bill is practically
      killed unless the Board of Examiners have some power to determine whether a dental college
      issuing a diploma is one worthy to be considered as a regular institution in good standing. It
      seems to me it is time that we in this State should pass some law to encourage the practice of
      dentistry.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair desires to enquire of the author of the amendment
      whether the suggestion embodied in the amendment of the Senator from Fayette (Mr. Huston)
      relieves the bill from the difficulty? if it is as you say, the amendment offered is
      unnecessary.
     Mr. HUSTON: That is my view.
     Mr. JOHNSON moved to recommit the bill to the Committee on Public Health
      with instructions to so amend the same as to make it certain, in plain and unambiguous
      language, a provision that no person shall be permitted to practice dentistry in Indiana,
      without passing an examination before a Board, to be appointed by the State Dental
      Association, and receiving a permit from said Board so to practice; but that said Board may
      dispense with said examination if it sees proper, on the applicant presenting a diploma from a
      reputable dental college.
     On motion by Mr. CAMPBELL, the bill was recommitted without instructions.
    
    
     NATURAL GAS COMPANIES.
     Mr SELLERS introduced a bill [S. 208] to add to the
      law a provision for the organization of Natural Gas Well Companies. On his further motion it
      was pressed through the three readings and finally passed the Senate.
     Mr. DEMOTTE [S. 209]: To declare the insanity of a county, township or
      judicial officer a vacation of said office.
     The Senate adjourned.
    
   
   
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
    
     TUESDAY, February 1, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Rev. R. E. Neighbors, of the Baptist Church.
    
    
     PURDUE UNIVERSITY.
     The bill [H. R. 154] to repeal Sections 4675 and 4676, R.S., concerning the appointment of
      students to Purdue University, was the special order; the question being on concurrence in the
      report of the Committee on Education recommending the indefinite
      postponement of the bill.
     Mr. OSBORN: I appreciate the courtesy of the House in deferring final action on this matter
      in my absence. I do not understand the object of the gentleman from Sullivan (Mr. Patton) in
      introducing a bill of this kind. It has been the purpose of that gentleman ever since he has
      been a member of the House of Representatives to legislate against Purdue University. He has
      tried every way to beat down one of the grandest institutions, to my mind, in the State of
      Indiana. I am glad, however, that his purposes so far have failed, and I am led to believe
      also that they will always fail, for in my opinion the intelligence of the members of this
      General Assembly is of too high a type to ever suffer an institution of the nature of Purdue
      University to be crippled in its operations. I do not care to go into a discussion of the
      question at this time, for it will necessarily have to be discussed at some future time. The
       Committee on Education was unanimous in this report, and it did not take
      them one minute to make up their minds. If Purdue University is a State institution, and no
      one will deny it, the State ought to have the benefit of it. I would be extremely sorry to
      have the sections referred to by the gentleman from Sullivan repealed. This university was
      organized under an Act of Congress July 2, 1862. [See pages 142 and 143 Brevier Legislative
      Reports vol. XI-1869.] This act appropriated public land to aid colleges, with the money
      derived from the sale thereof, the objects of which shall be to teach branches of learning in
      relation to Agriculture and Mechanical Arts. This act provides that the State shall establish
      and maintain one college.* [Here
      he read a part of the acts on the subject.] There in an aggregate capital invested in the
      institution to the amount of $650,000. I do not believe any person on the floor of this House
      will think it would be to the interest of the people to withdraw the support of the State from
      this institution, and I hope that the report of the committee will be concurred in. Now I feel
      disposed to do a thing that I never have done on the floor of this House, and something that
      as a rule I oppose. I move the previous question.
     Mr. PATTON: I hope the gentleman will withdraw that. On Saturday when this subject was
      brought up I consented, out of courtesy to him, to allow it to be delayed until to-day, and
      now I hope he will withdraw the motion.
     Mr. OSBORN: I will withdraw the motion.
     Mr. PATTON said there was always a strong lobby here in the interest of Purdue. It was not a
      State institution, and made no report to the State of Indiana. They had tried to compel it to
      report two years ago, but had not yet received an account of the receipts and expenditures. He
      complained that the institution had received contributions from the leading citizens of the
      county and from the Government to make the teaching of agriculture a leading feature, and yet
      the poor farmers were shut out. Only two boys from any of the great big counties could be sent
      in, and all the privileges they got were light and water. He claimed that royal salaries were
      paid the Superintendent and Professors, and that even a janitor got $1,800 a year. They were
      drawing five per cent. on the $300,000 endowment fund, had got $64,000 from a Democratic
      Legislature two years ago, and had changed the name from Agricultural College to Purdue
      University. Two years ago there were only fifty students and for- *For a full and complete history of the establishment
       of Purdue University, see Brever Legislative Reports, volume XI--1869.
       ty-eight counties represented. If he could secure the
      repeal of the law he could save money for the State. He ridiculed the attempts at agricultural
      teaching at the college and gave some illustrations. He said they planted two grains of corn
      and whichever one came up right or went down--he didn't know exactly--was the best. They
      had spent a whole day with a microscope trying to determine which end of a craw-fish a boy
      should take to fish with. He wanted them to make it a State institution or stop this clamor
      for aid for a State institution.
     Mr. JEWETT: A good deal has been said about Purdue University in a general way, but it seems
      to me that the merits of Purdue University are not involved in this bill. I think it might be
      said that Purdue University, located in an intelligent and prosperous section of the State,
      presided over by a gentleman who is not only one of the most talented educators of the State
      but a man of great executive ability,--I think it might be said that Purdue University is one
      of the links, one of the brightest links in the chain of State Universities. The faith of this
      State is not only pledged to this institution but she has promised to maintain it. If this is
      not done the State, by the terms of the act of Congress, will be required to refund
      $341,000.
     Mr. PATTON: What law requires that?
     Mr. JEWETT: The act of Congress requires that the State shall account to the United States
      for all the funds received for this purpose, and I don't think the State is in a proper
      condition just now to do that. But the gentleman says that there is now but one little
      loop-hole to get into that institution for the people of the State, and that is in the very
      sections he proposes to repeal. But this discussion will more properly come up when the
      proposition is made to give it State aid; in view of this fact I demand the previous
      question.
     This demand was seconded by the House, and under its operations the report of the committee
      was concurred in, and so the bill was indefinitely postponed.
     Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Owen, entered a motion to reconsider this vote.
     The SPEAKER: The business of the House will now be suspended until after the session of the
      joint convention for the purpose of electing a United States Senator.
    
    
     THE JOINT CONVENTION.
     The Senate appearing at noon--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: The Joint Convention will come to order. The chair
      desires to announce that there are no pairs in the Senate to-day, all Senators being present.
      For the purpose of determining whether there is a quorum of both Houses present the roll will
      be called. The Secretary of the Senate will call the roll of the Senate. [After the call.]
      Senators are all present.
     The SPEAKER of the House: The Clerk will call the names of members of the House except the
      names of two: Messrs. Connely and Dickerson, they being paired. [After the call.] Ninety-eight
      members of the House answer to their names. The next thing is the reading of the proceedings
      of the two Houses in joint con- vention yesterday.
     Representative JEWETT: I move that the reading of the journal be dispensed with.
     The SPEAKER of the House: The gentleman from Floyd moves that the reading be dispensed with.
      All in favor of the motion say aye. [After the negative response. ] The ayes have it. The
      motion is agreed to. It is now in order to proceed to the selection of a Senator in the
      Congress of the United States.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: The Secretary will call the roll of the Senate. As
      each Senator's name is called he will rise in his place and announce the name of the
      person for whom he votes for Senator. [After the roll-call.] Hear the vote of the Senate: For
      David Turpie 32 votes; for Benjamin Harrison 18 votes.
     
     The SPEAKER of the House: The Clerk of the House will call the roll of the House except the
      names of the gentleman from Vigo and the gentleman from Clay. Those whose names are called
      will designate the person for whom he votes for United States Senator. Proceed with the call.
      [After the call.] Hear the result of the vote of the House: For Benjamin Harrison 52 votes;
      for David Turpie 42 votes; for J. H. Allen 4 votes.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate: Hear the vote of the joint convention: David Turpie
      74 votes; Benjamin Harrison 70 votes; J. H. Allen 4 votes. No candidate having received a
      majority of the votes in joint convention it is in order to proceed to another ballot.
     Representative STUBBLEFIELD moved that the joint convention now adjourn.
     The SPEAKER of the House put the question.
     This motion was agreed to.
     When Senators left the hall--
     On motion by Mr. CONDER, the House took a recess for dinner.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.
     The bill [H. R. 39] to improve the civil service of Indiana, came up as a special order with
      a favorable report from a majority of the Judiciary Committee; a minority
      recommending its indefinite postponement.
     Mr. GRIFFITHS said the bill is one of the most important that will come before this body. It
      does not concern any section alone, but affects all the interests in the State. The belief in
      the necessity for a civil-service reform is so deep-rooted that its defenders can no longer be
      referred to as visionary. Many men of national repute whose sincerity cannot be questioned,
      have been impelled to the advocacy of the civil-service reform by reason of the abuse of the
      spoils system. It has been taken out of the region of speculation and doubt into that of
      certainty. It has been adopted in Great Britain and most of the continental countries, notably
      France and Germany, and by our national government. No good reason can be suggested why it
      should not be applied to all appointments of the State. Men and women should be chosen for
      their personal worth and tested ability, and not as a reward for uncompromising partisanship.
      Under civil-service reform the affairs of this State would be administered most efficiently,
      and from the lowest to the highest they would feel that they were the trustees of an express
      trust according to their abilities.
     The doctrine that to the victors belong the spoils has led more to corruption than all other
      agencies combined. Until this reform is accomplished the question will be not how we shall
      carry this or that good measure, but how we shall carry this or that set of men into office.
      He had been told that not a single member of the Democratic party in this House or in the
      Senate would support the measure. If that be true so much the worse for the Democratic party.
      He did not believe it, for he had it in the solemn declarations of principles of the
      Republican and Democratic parties upon this very question. In 1872 the Democratic party
      declared in its national platform in favor of civil-service reform. In 1876 it declared that
      reform was necessary in the civil-service. Again, in 1880 and 1884 it declared in its favor.
      The question of civil-service reform should not divide itself into a party question. He
      regarded it as exceedingly significant that the minority report should be signed by every
      Democrat on the committee, and the majority report by every Republican. Civil-service reform,
      from the Democratic point of view, is "like the snow-flake on the river, for a moment
      seen then lost forever." Certainly no Republican member of this House should vote against
      this bill, for the reason that in the platform of 1876 the Republican party declared in favor
      of the reform. If we have civil service in Indiana it will never happen that a man will be
      recommended to a responsible position who has served a term in the penitentiary, and is
      indorsed by his party as a man who has always been at the
      polls early and late, and has never asked for a position before.--Probably he had never been
      out of the penitentiary long enough to do it. Mr. Grif.'s opposed the spoils system
      because the very name is odious. It pays no respect to the rights of women, much less of
      men.
     Mr. GORDON: I wish to congratulate the gentleman on his presentation of his side of the
      question, but his arguments were altogether untenable and weak and must fall to the ground. I
      want to say that I go as far as the gentleman himself in favor of civil-service reform, he
      shall not go beyond me in that respect. And farther, the Democratic party began the work of
      reforming the civil service, and has from that day to this, and is to-day its firm friend.
      That very bill itself would be a great obstruction in the way of civil-service reform. It
      comes in at a time when the Democratic party has almost accomplished the purpose which it set
      out to accomplish fifteen years ago:--the removal of those who have so long debauched and
      defiled the civil service. There is no difference of opinion about the necessity of reform in
      the civil service, but there may be some difference of opinion as to the method of reforming
      the civil service. What is meant by the spoils system understood by Democrats, is the
      unmeasured unfairness in the offices that has grown up under the administration of the
      Republican party.--They have made necessary the reform of the civil service.
     Now as to the merits of the bill before the House. It proposes a committee of four men to be
      appointed by the Governor, to be one of the two political parties. These men are to have their
      expenses paid, they are to hold their examinations and select the persons whom they can
      recommend for office. After these persons have been recommended and have been in office they
      cannot be removed except for cause. This commission is to be the judge of the qualifications
      of those who are to hold these offices and is to take away from the hands of the people the
      filling of nine hundred offices. Two-thirds of the people of the State of Indiana would
      condemn this bill. I think the doctrine, that to the victor belong the spoils, is wrong.
     Mr. FOSTER: As has been said by the gentleman from Putnam (Mr. Gordon) we are in favor of
      civil-service, if it be in the right way and in the right manner. But when a measure proposes
      to obliterate political parties I say it is dangerous. I do not believe this country will ever
      stand such a provision. I believe in political parties, I believe the Democratic party is
      right, but I love a Republican that has his convictions and stands by them. I want to say that
      this government of the United States came into birth by action of political parties. This is a
      country of political parties and it should remain so.--They say that this country has adopted
      civil-service reform. Indiana has not and are you ashamed of it? I challenge the world to find
      a country that is more economically administered than this State. It is political
      responsibility that makes purity in the service.
     Mr. STUBBLEFIELD: As stump speaking is in order I wish to speak, but I do not wish to be
      understood to say that this is not a very important question; by no means at all, for it
      certainly is one of the most important questions that has been discussed in this House during
      this session. The great principle here is the principle of civil-service reform, and every man
      in the State of Indiana who is twenty-one years of age ought to constitute himself a committee
      of one to carry out the great principle of civil-service reform. It is a great principle, and
      you might as well undertake to turn White-river up stream as to try to stop it. It is a thing
      that the people seem determined to carry into effect, and they are going to do it.
     Mr. GROSE: I am sure nobody be he Republican, Democrat, or mug-wump, should be opposed to
      having the appointments in Indiana given to men who can read and write and know north from
      south, and have not been in the penitentiary. My friend from Putnam (Mr. Gordon) derided  us for not having done this within the last twenty-five
      years, I will say to him very kindly that we had something else to do--we had another job on
      hands. The Republican party came into power in the Federal government about that time. In 1861
      was the condition of these United States and of this people? We had a bankrupt treasury and
      not a dollar in it. We had no trade at home or abroad. The bayonets of the enemy were
      glistening right in the very sight of our capitol. The Republican party and other Union people
      stemmed the current that was in their front. Our flag was in the dust, trampled under feet by
      a million of men swearing that it should never be raised again. The Union men of this country
      saw the situation and they went to work to try to save this government that was in peril and
      danger, and I am glad to know to-day that the leaders of the Republican party stood in the
      front rank. They took the first step to repel the invading enemy of the government. We went to
      work and tried our credit, and at first we had none; we had to make a substitute for money,
      but we did not make any substitute for the old flag of our fathers. We swore upon it that it
      should come up, and it did.
     Mr. IBACH: The question under discussion is not whether we are in favor of civil-service
      reform or not, but whether we are in favor of the bill that is before us. Let us examine the
      bill for a moment. Section 3 provides that if a man is educated he is capable of holding
      office. [Reads Section 4.] I want to ask my friend from Marion (Mr. Griffiths) why it is
      necessary to have such language as that on the statute book? I will say to my friends that as
      the Republican party is out of power, the reason for that kind of a statute does not now
      exist. I am opposed to this bill, but I am not opposed to civil service as I understand
      it.
     Mr. LINCK: The gentleman from Putnam (Mr. Gordon) says that the Democratic party is in favor
      of civil-service reform, and I believe that the other gentleman on that side said the same
      thing. Yes, sir, you are in favor of it in theory, but when it comes to putting it into
      practice then are not in favor of it. I hope the time will come when political parties will be
      held together by principle. It is shameful, the way our public institutions have been carried
      on. The only qualification to get position in these institutions is: What proportion of your
      money will you spend at the ballot-box? This is what the bill intends to correct. Now, sir, I
      have had some experience in politics; have started up from the ground, I have held many
      positions, and I believe I understand the workings of things. If this bill had been in force I
      imagine that the inmates of these benevolent institutions would not have been fed on rotten
      beef and rancid butter. I do not believe a man should be recommended to a position for
      favoritism, and I don't believe that a man should be appointed because of the amount of
      money he will give for political purposes. I believe he should be appointed for his
      qualifications; I believe that this will be the salvation of civil service.
     Mr. JEWETT: I am surprised at the extent and character of the debate for I regard this bill
      has having no political character, and certainly I did not catch anything from the lips of the
      gentleman from Marion (Mr. Griffiths) that would indicate any different purpose. If I regarded
      this as a political measure I would be content to vote against it without a word. This bill,
      it seems to me, is misjudged. There is nothing in it except it proposes that a board of four
      civil-service examiners shall be established in this State, to receive five dollars a day and
      expenses, and to have a secretary to be provided by the Secretary of State, and all the
      appurtenences for carrying on the board. This board is to pass simply on the qualifications of
      a few hundred insane asylum attendants whose only qualifications are strong arms and ready
      actions. This is all there is in this bill. It is not proposed in this bill to regulate the
      appointment of a single per- son whose appointment is
      vested in the Governor. And it is because the bill proposes this and nothing more that,
      although I heartily favor civil service and always have been a civil-service reformer, I shall
      vote against this bill. When I say that I am and always have been in favor of civil-service
      reform I state what I believe to be the absolute truth. When I say that I am opposed to the
      national civil-service reform law as it is now, and it is, in my opinion, so imperfect that it
      ought to subject us to the laughter of the whole intelligent world, I say what I also believe
      to be true. What does civil-service reform mean? It means that pure men should have places in
      the civil service. When the Democratic and Republican parties declared for a reform in the
      civil service they declared for a reform in the methods by which office was obtained and for a
      pure class of men to hold office. I decline to consider a clerkship in the post-office as an
      office, and I say that it was not against this class of men that the complaints were made. It
      was not out of the appointment to those positions that the clamor arose for such a law. The
      clamor of the people went out against the heads of departments, and heads of bureaus. The
      clamor went up, and it was answered by a law that is intended to apply only to common scrub
      women at Washington. It was a fraud in this respect. I favor civil-service reform in the true
      meaning of the word, but I decline to believe that if the Republicans should carry the State
      of Indiana that they would not have enough honest, capable men to fill every office. I decline
      to believe that the appointment of two Republicans and two Democrats would make a non-partizan
      board. Like other gentlemen I believe in partizanship; I believe that this country must live
      with two great political parties. I do not think that, as far as the questions involved in
      this bill is concerned, the principle meets my approval. It is to be reached not by a
      legislative enactment that should establish a board for determining the qualifications of the
      applicants. I would like to vote to abolish the abominable system which provides that the
      trustees of these benevolent institutions shall be elected by the Senate and House of
      Representatives. I am ready to vote at any time for a bill that will place in the Governor of
      Indiana the appointing of all who are not elected by the Senate, and it is the only
      practicable and 
       feasible
       feasable
       way to accomplish this thing.

    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    IN SENATE.
    
     WEDNESDAY, February 2, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Hon. J. W. Davis, a Senator from the county of
     Elkhart.
    
     STATE BOILER INSPECTOR.
     The bill [S. 1] to provide for the inspection of boilers, and the appointment of a State
      Boiler Inspector, coming up, it was read the third time.
     Mr. WEIR: It seems to me while it is proper that legislation should be had which protects
      all professions and mechanics, there seems to be a disposition here to carry this matter too
      far. This bill requires every boiler in the State to be examined once every year at a cost to
      the owner of five dollars, and all the fees are to go to these three men. There are some
      twenty thousand boilers in the State, and this bill would put into the pockets of these men
      from $75,000 to $100,000 a year. Let this bill become a law and the farmers of the State will
      be unable to thresh their wheat without incurring this enormous expense once a year. I regret
      I was not aware this bill would be coming up to-day, as I would have been glad to examine it
      in more detail. Why is there a discrimination against a certain class? and why are locomotive
      engineers exempted from its provisions? It will cost the farmer at least one cent more to
      thresh any grain, and from that to thee cents. I am decidedly opposed to the bill. I
      don't believe it has received the proper consideration. A bill that would increase the
      competency of engineers I would be in favor of.
     Mr. BAILEY: If the Senator from Laporte had examined this bill before he took the floor to
      oppose it, in my opinion he would have said no word against its passage. It is claimed the
      fees are too exorbitant. This bill has been introduced at the request of a large element of
      people who are handling engines, who are engineers, and whose property is in danger.--This
      bill was before the last session. [See Brevier Legislative Reports volume XXIII, page 87.] A
      similar one has passed in a number of the States of this Union, and in no State where the law
      is enforced are the fees less than proposed in this bill. What is it worth to thoroughly test
      a boiler? That question has been thoroughly examined. Experts state that it will take a day to
      thoroughly examine a boiler and its attachments, and the price usually runs from five to ten
      dollars; and if there are twenty thousand, or twenty times twenty thousand in the State, it
      will take so much time to examine them and it is worth 
      so much money. It would be impossible to provide a salary where the extent of the work is
      unknown. During the last session within forty days, by mere casual observation of reports in
      the newspapers, I counted up over half a million of dollars of property destroyed in this
      State, and some thirteen or fourteen lives lost. Bills are introduced for the purpose of
      protecting the professions, and it goes without saying that all departments where labor and
      skill is necessary are also entitled to just protection by law. Railroad engines are in
      constant care and they are run into round-houses at the end of each trip, and are under
      constant charge of men who understand this business. I have just been handed a note written by
      some gentleman who says that in fifteen years there have been ten men killed in Rush county
      alone by boiler explosions. Without official figures it will be impossible to tell the
      fatality and loss of property by the use of bad boilers. It is stated by well informed men
      that throughout the State there engines running our hotels that are absolutely unsafe, and
      that an examination would result in their exposure.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I believe all classes of industry should have necessary
      legal protection; but to say that a man shall be appointed to hunt up a boiler, regardless of
      its condition, and by State authority demand that it shall be examined, and take five dollars
      from the owner for such services, I think that is certainly going too far with legislation. If
      the bill were to provide for examinations under proper restrictions, I should cordially
      support it.
     Mr. JOHNSON: I am somewhat surprised that so important a bill as this should pass the second
      reading without discussion. I am not much enlightened upon the subject-matter of the bill and
      have relied upon the discussion of it to enlighted me. I confess there are some measures in it
      which meet with my hearty approval. I believe it is necessary for the preservation of the
      public that experienced men should have charge of our boilers; and it seems to me an
      arrangement which would require a careful examination of engineers would be a desirable and an
      eminently proper one. It seems to me there are other provisions of this bill that go too far.
      It seems to me that the end sought for can better be accomplished by requiring licensed
      engineers to be employed, and by compulsion require an examination of their boilers far more
      frequently than provided for in this bill; and let it be made a criminal offense to allow
      engineers to be employed before being licensed. This would do away with the extraordinary
      expense proposed in this bill. I am told that a boiler may be in first class condition one
      day, but through some mismanagement the very next day it may be dangerously out of order. If
      it be true that everything depends upon the diligence of the engineer I would like for some
      Senator to inform me how an examination once in three hundred and sixty-five days can
      accomplish what is desired? To me it seems preposterous and absurd. If this bill is in the
      interests of labor, I understand one of the primary objects is to prevent monopoly; and it
      seems to me the friends of the measure have not been able to protect it upon any enlightened
      data as to the amount of money that would be paid into the pocket of the proposed boiler
      inspector, or the number of boilers to be inspected.
     Mr. MARSHALL: The question has come to my mind whether or not this bill is introduced for
      the safety of the people, or is it not for the purpose of making somebody a good deal of
      money? Gentlemen who advocate this bill think this inspection of boilers would insure
      protection to property and there would not be so many lives lost as there is. I understand
      when a boiler explodes, it is often stated as a cause that the boiler had not sufficient water
      in it. The man who has charge of it knows that his life, in some sense, depends upon the
      condition in which he keeps it, and I don't see how one inspection in three hundred and
      sixty-five days is going  to help that man to keep his
      boiler in good condition. It seems to me we are going too far. If the boilers of this State
      have to be examined every year by a board of examiners to be appointed by the Governor, it
      seems to me that office would pay better than any office in the State of Indiana, or in the
      United States perhaps. Hundreds of men are killed in the State every year by horses running
      away; why not with just as much reason have a board to examine our horses and see that they
      are all gentle? Why is it not as sensible to pass law requiring men to go over the railroad
      tracks and see that no ties or rails are misplaced, as it would be to have a yearly inspection
      of boilers? If you will keep up the cry for license, why not license the farmer to plant corn,
      and have a license for every vocation? I would not impute any bads motives to any man, but I
      cannot see any argument for this bill.
     Mr. KENNEDY: I think I can see as far into a mill-stone as the man made it. I think it
      impossible for any man to inspect a boiler and tell whether it is safe or not. No man can say
      when there are any flaws in iron unless they can be seen. You might have an inspector examine
      a boiler one day and the next day it might explode. Now it has been said that in Rush county
      there have been ten men killed by boiler explosions in a short time. I know there has been
      some accidents happened there, but I don't believe an inspector of boilers wold have
      prevented them. I know it is right to protect the people, but this bill is asking an
      impossibility.
     Mr. DAY: I am opposed to this idea of inspecting boilers. The United States Government
      requires the inspection of boilers through agents on the Ohio and other rivers, but there is
      not one defective boiler in a thousand detected by agents or inspectors. But I do favor the
      licensing of engineers whose duty it is to see that their boilers are kept in good condition.
      As the Senator from Rush [Mr. Kennedy] says, a boiler may be in good condition to-day, but
      when fired up to-morrow may be found defective; and who discovers it? Not the boiler
      inspector, but the engineer in charge. I certainly shall oppose any bill providing for this
      kind of inspection.
     Mr.SELLERS moved to recommit the bill to a select committee of five with instructions to
      provide for the appointment of a State boiler inspector; that boilers shall be inspected
      annually, etc.
     Mr. BAILEY moved to amend by recommitting to the committee from which the bill came,
      withinstructions to amend by excluding from the operations of the bill engines under
      twenty-five-horse power, instead of ten-horse power, as now in the bill, etc., etc.
     Mr. DAY: Don't you know, as a matter of fact, the smaller the boiler the greater the
      danger?
     Mr. CAMPBELL: I am opposed to both amendments and to the bill also. If I thought this bill
      would prevent one single explosion I would give it more favorable consideration, but I
      don't believe it would. It depends upon the engineer. I think they are a class of heroes,
      and whatever I could do to protect them I would do; but this bill looks to me like an
      absurdity. One of the best boilers ever made exploded in fifteen months in the hands of one of
      the most experienced engineers; and on the other hand I know of an old boiler that was
      inspected fifteen years ago and has been used ever since without accident. I look upon this
      bill as one to create an office, or several offices, and as one that would not result in
      preventing a single accident. Here is a practical machinist [Mr. Day] who says he can't
      tell what is the cause of explosions.
     Mr. WEIR: I hope the substitute will not be passed, but I hope the motion of the Senator
      from White (Mr. Sellers) will prevail. I believe there should be a provision made for
      licensing engineers and determining their competency, and the motion of the Senator from White
      I understand is directed to that end.
     
     Mr. MCDONALD: I always like to agree with my friend from Laporte (Mr.
      Weir); but I also feel like being just. This bill is here, and the substitute motion proposes
      to send it back to its friends. I think it fair to its author that it should go to its
      friends. It we don't like it when it comes back let us kill it. If he wants to take the
      chance of letting it--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The further business of the Senate will be suspended. The
      Secretary will call the roll.
     It discovered every Senator present and answering to his name.
     The Senate at noon proceeded to the hall of the House to vote in joint convention for a
      United States Senator. When the Senate returned--
     At 12:30 o'clock--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Senator from Dubois (Mr. Trippett) moves that when the Senate
      adjourns it adjourn till to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock.
     Mr. RAHM: I would like to ask whether the Speaker on the other side--the Speaker of the
      House--has got any right to tell stories--to tell lies?
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair don't care what the Speaker on the other side
      does. The Speaker on the other side is a little off, that is all.
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion: I think the thanks of the Senate are due the President for his
      manly and gentlemanly course in the joint convention; it was a grand scene, sir. I myself gave
      way to laughter.--[Laughter.]
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Well, the question is on the motion that when the Senate adjourns
      it be till to-morrow ten o'clock.
     Mr. MCDONALD: Let me say to the Senate that we can't afford to
      adjourn till to-morrow. I move to adjourn till 2½ o'clock.
     Mr. SELLERS: That motion is out of order till the time motion is disposed of.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The question is on the motion that when the Senate adjourns it be
      till 10 o'clock to-morrow. The Senators on the other side demand the yeas and nays. The
      roll will be called.
     The motion was agreed to by yeas 25 nays 19.
     On motion by Mr. WEIR the Senate adjourned.
     Mr. RAHM, when his name was called, in explanation of his vote, said: For the sake of giving
      our Republican friends a chance to get together and ask each other how it was done, I vote
      "aye." [Laughter.]
     So the Senate adjourned till to-morrow.
    
   
   
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
    
     WEDNESDAY, February 2, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Rev. E. B. Rawls, of the Edwin Ray M. E. Church.
    
     INSANE ASYLUM INVESTIGATION.
     Mr. BROWN, by consent, offered the following:
     
      
       
        Whereas, It is charged that gross negligence, cruel and inhuman treatment,
         misappropriation of funds, mismanagement and corruption exist in the management of the
         Asylum for the Insane of this State, the Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb and in the management
         of the State Prisons at Jeffersonville and Michigan City; therefore be it
        Resolved, By the House of Representatives that the Committee on Benevolent and
          Scientific Institutions and Affairs of the State Prisons be and are hereby
         instructed to make thorough and complete investigation of all the management of said
         institutions and of all charges against the management of the same, and that such committee
         shall have power to send for and compel the attendance before them of any person to testify
         in relation to the management of said institutions, and to compel the production and
         inspection of any paper or books that they may be deemed necessary by them to be produced
         and inspected in making such investigation, and that such committee make a detailed report
         of the result of their investigation to the House at as early a period as practicable.
        
         [Signed,]
         BROWN, of Henry.
        
       
      
     
     Mr. JEWETT moved to make the resolution a concurrent one.
     On motion by Mr. VAN SLYKE, this motion was laid on the table.
     Mr. ROBERTS moved to amend by striking out the committee named and inserting in lieu these
      words: "a special committee of three."
     
     On motion by Mr. PATTON, this motion was laid on the table.
     Mr. PLEASANTS: I move as an amendment, that such a committee be required to employ a
      stenographer, and that all evidence be reported in full to the House, and that said evidence
      and the report of the committee be printed and laid upon the desks of the members before any
      action is taken by the House.
     Mr. IBACH: This resolution reads: "Whereas, it is charged," &c. Now, we are
      asked to vote for an investigation, not knowing by whom the charges are made. I ask whether it
      is right to thus charge the management of institutions of this kind with corruption and
      mismanagement without having some responsible person state to this Assembly that he knows of
      these things charged and that they ought to be investigated? Remember that if this
      investigation should fail, and the charges should be found untrue, the reputation of those
      persons will be smirched and there will be no way by which these gentlemen can place
      themselves right before the people of the State. Therefore I insist before this investigation
      is ordered that the name of some responsible person should be mentioned.
     Mr. BROWN: The gentleman from Allen and Huntington (Mr. Ibach) says that some responsible
      person ought to put a name to this resolution. I did not think it necessary in drafting that
      resolution to set out the names of a number of responsible people who will make charges
      against the management of these institutions. I have had some connection with these
      institutions. I have seen men and women who have been inhumanly treated, and if you want
      responsible persons I can take you to numerous houses in this State and show you men and women
      where the lash was put on the back of these poor human beings who were not able to protect
      themselves. The people of the State for years and years have been complaining. I think the
      resolution ought to be promptly adopted as it is.
     Mr. BEASLEY demanded the previous question.
     The House seconded the demand, and under its operations the amendment was agreed to, and the
      resolution as amended, was adopted by three successive votes--(Mr. Jewett demanding a
      division,) in three Separate parts: first, relating to the State prison north; second,
      relating to the State prison south; and third, relating to the benevolent institutions.
    
    
     CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.
     Mr. OSBORN called up the motion offered by him for a reconsideration of the vote by which
      Mr. Griffiths' bill, [H. R. 39], providing for State civil-service reform, was
      indefinitely postponed.
     The reconsideration was agreed to, and the question recurred on the substitution of the
      minority report for the majority, the latter recommending the passage of the bill. The
      minority report was rejected by yeas 44, nays 55..
     Pending the vote--
     Mr. KLEIN, when his name was called, said: I would like to explain my vote. Since the vote
      was taken yesterday I have ascertained that this civil service bill is only to concern
      benevolent institutions, I therefore vote "nay."
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the House refused to indefinitely postpone the bill.
     The majority report was concurred in.
     On motion by Mr. VAN SLYKE, the bill was amended by inserting a provision for two
      civil-service commissioners, one from each political party, to serve with the Governor.
     Mr. ROBINSON offered a further amendment that there be three commissioners, one from each of
      the three political parties casting the highest number of votes at the preceding general
      election. He said: My motive in presenting this amendment is to test the sincerity of the
      gentlemen who have introduced and supported this bill, as to whether they desire to remove it
      from political control. If that be true why is it necessary that these commissioners come only from the two political parties casting
      the highest number of votes? Why not make the board to consist of three, or more, so as to
      remove it as far as possible from political control? I am in favor of that kind of
      civil-service reform. It is not that I have a desire get some gentleman who is not a
      Republican in office, but if this is to removed from political influence I think one party
      ought to have the same right and representation as another, and if it does not extend that far
      I question the sincerity of the desire expressed to take this matter out of politics.
     Mr. GRIFFITHS: I see no objection to the amendment at all, and trust that nobody will vote
      against it. We want to make this board as non-partizan as possible. I do not think that
      questions of this sort should be considered as political questions.
     Mr. KELLISON: I am opposed to this amendment for the reason that I am opposed to the whole
      business first and last, and it seems to me that the amendment makes it more objectionable
      than it was before. I do not care to make an argument on this bill at this time, and I shall
      move to lay the amendment on the table so as to be consistent with what I shall hereafter say
      on this measure.
     This motion was rejected.
     The amendment was agreed to.
     Mr. IBACH moved an amendment that all deputies and clerks in State offices be subject to the
      examination provided for in the bill.
     On motion by Mr. VAN SLYKE, it was laid on the table.
     The bill was ordered engrossed.
    
    
     FEES AND SALARIES.
     Mr. Foster's bill [H. R. 33] to reduce fees and salaries of county officers, was
      returned from the committee with amendments.
     Mr. SCOTT moved to recommit the bill with instructions, to report not later than
      Wednesday.
     Mr. BUCKLES: I can see no valid reason why the provisions of this bill should not take
      effect and apply to those holding office now. I know it is sometimes said that it is
      unconstitutional, but my opinion is that that argument is a mere pretext. They take their
      offices knowing that the Legislature can reduce their fees and salaries. They would not
      question the constitutionality if we were to raise their salaries. You would then hear no
      complaint. I move to strike Section 8 from the bill.
     Mr. STUBBLEFIELD: We came to the conclusion that it was unfair upon the men who have been
      recently elected to reduce their fees in the way proposed by this bill. There was not a man
      who became a candidate and run for his office--there was not a man elected in the State of
      Indiana scarcely, that would have taken upon himself the labor except with the understanding
      that he was to receive the fees under the present law.
     Mr. BEASLEY: I am one who have doubts about the constitutionality of the question. He (Mr.
      Buckles) says that that argument is but a mere pretext. I think, as a lawyer, that this
      Legislature cannot, according to the Constitution, shorten the term of office of a person who
      has been elected to office. I do not believe it can take away from the man who has been
      elected under an implied contract, any part of the fees or emoluments of the office as
      provided by law at the time he was elected to office. I therefore move to lay the amendment of
      the gentleman from Delaware on the table.
     This motion was agreed to, as was also the motion (Mr. Scott's) to recommit.
    
    
     THE JOINT CONVENTION.
     The Senate appearing at 12 o'clock, meridian, on the right of the Speaker's
      chair--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate called the Joint Convention to order, and directed
      the Secretary of the Senate to call the roll of Senators.
     The roll-call discovered every Senator present and answering to his name.
     The SPEAKER of the House directed the Clerk thereof to call the roll of the House.
     
     It discovered every member of the House present and answering to his name.
     The SPEAKER of the House declared the next thing in order to be threading of the minutes of
      the proceedings in joint convention yesterday.
     On motion by Representative HOBSON, the reading was dispensed with.
     The SPEAKER of the House declared the business of the convention was to proceed in the
      matter of the election of a United States Senator.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate directed the Secretary to call the roll of the
      Senate and requested each Senator as his name was called to arise and announce the name of the
      person for whom he desired to vote. [When the roll-call was completed.] He announced the
      result, viz: For David Turpie 32 votes; for Benjamin Harrison 18 votes.
     The SPEAKER of the House directed the Clerk to call the roll of the House, and requested
      each member as his name was called to rise and announce for whom he desired to vote.
     Pending the vote--
     Representative ROBINSON, when his name was called, said: Mr. President--As a member of the
      Greenback-Labor party, I believed it to be my duty to do what I could to defeat, as I
      supposed, in good faith, the prominent gentlemen who were presented for the position of United
      States Senator from Indiana, and to act with those who were in favor of the election of one
      with views more in accord with the laboring men of this country. I felt that in the
      performance of that act I was carrying out my sworn duty. I felt it to be my duty, if
      possible, to aid in electing one of our own number to the United States Senate. I have labored
      faithfully, persistently and consistently to that end. Our expectations from both sides have
      not been fulfilled, in whole or in part, and I am constrained to believe that all the talk
      about aiding our candidate has been made an order to delay and give time to defeat him. My
      first duty is to my constituents and to my conscience. My conscience I do not propose to
      subdue, and I now return to my constituents with clean hands. Although I have been
      misrepresented and my motives misconstrued, and will be, I say before God and man, my hands
      are and will be clean, and I will act according to the dictates of my conscience. I feel that
      I owe it to my conscience at this time to cause no further delay, and to cast my vote as I
      believe my constituents--in fact, I know they want me to, and I cast my vote as I now do for
      David Turpie. [Shouts and cheers from Democratic benches.]
     When the roll-call was completed--on the sixteenth ballot--
     Representative CATES said: Mr. President--As a Republican, before I came to Indianapolis, I
      expected to vote for the Republican candidate for United States Senator, but after I came
      here, with three other gentlemen who were elected to this House, we agreed to nominate for
      that office Jason H. Allen, and to stand by him as our candidate. That act, as I understood
      it, and have ever understood it, could not be broken by a single member of our combination.
      Mr. Robinson notified me at the commencement of this roll-call that he did not mean to vote
      for our candidate to-day. I change my vote to Benjamin Harrison. [Cheers from Republican
      benches.]
     Representative GLOVER addressed the Chair.
     Representative JEWETT [interposing]: I desire to protest against any change of votes, and
      make the point of order that a vote when once cast in this convention is beyond recall.
     The SPEAKER of the House: The point of order is not well taken. The gentleman from Vigo [Mr.
      Glover] has the floor.
     Representative GLOVER: Mr. Speaker--I desired, with Mr. Cates, to keep my pledge made to
      these other gentlemen. Four of us came up here feeling that we had been placed in nomination
      by the labor interest, and three of us presented before the Republican party for its
      indorsemen for the nomination and election to the places
      we now occupy on this floor. I also claim that I stood before the people, as everybody knew,
      on the platform of labor. I made the proposition to these gentlemen that we should make a
      nomination for United States Senator, and we presented to this convention the name of Jason H.
      Allen. We did it in good faith, and in this contest, so far, we have received the warmest
      support and approbation of labor in this State and all over the country. I feel that I have
      done no wrong. I feel, with Brother Cates, that we have been unduly used by one of our
      combination. [Applause.] If I understood this combination, it was not to be broken right on
      the eve of an election.
     Representative ROBINSON: Will the gentleman [Cries of "Order," "Order,"
      amid great confusion, with the Speaker rapping continuously with his gavel.]
     The SPEAKER of the House: The gentleman from Vigo (Mr. Glover) has the floor.
     Representative GLOVER: I have only a word more to say. I feel justified in what I have done
      and in what I am about to do. I felt that we should place in nomination one of our own men,
      who would work for our cause and in the interest of the laboring people. We placed in
      nomination Jason H. Allen and tried in our honest and earnest way to stand by him and to elect
      him. But since we failed, by the combination failing to stand by him as it should, and as we
      hoped and believed it would, I must comply with the instructions I received from labor
      organizations that under all the circumstances we should take the best we can, and not take
      the worst, and for this reason, without further explanation, I cast my vote for Benjamin
      Harrison. [A renewal of cheers and shouts from the Republican benches.]
     Representative MACKEY said: As my friend across the way has seen fit to throw down the glove
      and take up the fight, by declaring our combination off, he can take the consequences, and I
      will change my vote to Benjamin Harrison. [Applause from Republican benches.]
     Senator JOHNSON said: Mr. Speaker--I now desire, on behalf of myself and colleagues upon
      this floor, and in this joint convention, to renew the objection and protest which I made on
      the first day of this joint convention, and on the first balloting for United States Senator,
      and which it was then understood should be regarded each day as being renewed without the
      formality of my rising and renewing it again. I do now, therefore, object and protest for
      myself, and in behalf of my colleagues, against the receiving--
     Representative JEWETT [interrupting]: We can stop this right now. It was clearly understood
      that the Senator might put his protest on record to appear as if made at this time. That was
      understood by everybody, and I suggest that we live up to that agreement.
     Senator JOHNSON [resuming]: If the joint convention will kindly allow me, I desire to save
      our rights. I protest against receiving or counting the votes of Francis Branaman, Isaiah B.
      McDonald and Alonzo G. Smith, in this joint convention, for the reason and on the ground that
      they are not, under the Constitution and laws of this State, members of either the Indiana
      Senate or of this joint convention, and that their votes are not entitled to be received or
      counted, nor should any result be announced, predicated upon their votes. I will reduce this
      protest to writing, together with the reasons to support it. and ask that it be spread upon
      the journals of this joint convention.
     Representative GARDINER: I move that when this joint convention adjourn, it adjourn to meet
      to-morrow at 12 o'clock.
     The SPEAKER of the House: As many as favor the motion say "aye." [Many
      members--"Yeas and nays."] The motion is adopted.
     Representative JEWETT: Let us have the result announced.
     The SPEAKER of the House: The gentleman from Daviess (Mr. Gardiner) has the floor.
     
     
       Representative
       Representatiee
       GARDINER: Before the result of the ballot is announced I desire to renew the protest
      made by members of the House against the votes being received or counted from Mr. 
       Beasley
       Besaley
      , Mr. Mock, Mr. Jewett, Mr. Harrell and Mr. Shields, and all others, if there are any
      others, against whom protests were filed on the first day of this joint convention.
     Representative JEWETT: On behalf of the Democratic side, I desire to present a protest
      against receiving or counting the votes of the gentlemen named by me on the first ballot in
      this convention--Messrs. Linck, Dickerson, Mackey--
     The SPEAKER of the House [interrupting]: Hear the result of the vote of the House: Benjamin
      Harrison, 56 votes; David Turpie, 44 votes. And in anticipation of what I think may be done in
      a moment, or claim to be done, I desire to say, as presiding officer of this convention, that
      no person has received a majority of all the legal votes cast in this convention for United
      States Senator, and no Senator has been elected. [Cheers and shouts from Republican
      benches.]
      The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate [amid noise and confusion]: As presiding officer of
      this joint convention, and having the right--
     The SPEAKER of the House: You are not presiding officer of this convention.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate [resuming]: Attend to your business. The whole
      number of votes cast is 150. Necessary to a 
       choice
       choic
      , 76. David Turpie having received a majority of all the votes cast [the noise and
      uproar drowned his voice. This vote is printed on page 141 except Cates, Mackey and Glover for
      Harrison, & Robinson for Turpie.]
     The SPEAKER of the House: I protest against this. I enter my protest against this
      declaration. The gentleman who is pretending to announce the result here is but a usurper in
      undertaking to do it. He is a usurper in fact.
     Senator WINTER: I move the joint convention adjourn till 12 o'clock to-morrow.
     The SPEAKER of the House: The Senator from Marion moves that the joint convention 
       adjourn
       adjonrn
       till 12o'clock to-morrow. As many as favor motion say "aye." The ayes
      have it and the joint convention is adjourned till noon to-morrow.
     When Senators retired--
     On motion by Mr. CONDER, the House took a recess for dinner.
     The following protest appear" the House journal of the joint convention:
     Representative PLEASANTS filed the following:
     
      
       
        REPRESENTATIVE JEWETT'S PROTEST.
        The undersigned, member of the House of Representatives from the county of Floyd, in the
         State of Indiana, does hereby protest and object to the calling of the name of Henry C.
         Dickerson as a member of the House of Representatives from the county of Vigo, in the State
         of Indiana, or as a member of this joint convention, on the grounds and for the reason that
         said Dickerson was not duly elected by the qualified voters of the said county of Vigo as a
         Representative from said county to the General Assembly of said State.
        This protestant avers that one Cornelius Meagher was duly elected by the qualified voters
         of said Vigo county, as a Representative from said county; that said Meagher is present and
         should be called as a Representative of said Vigo county, and that if called, he would vote
         and is ready to vote for said David Turpie for Senator of the Congress of the United
         States, from the State of Indiana, upon this ballot. And that the said Henry C. Dickerson
         ought not to be called, and ought not to vote upon this ballot of this joint convention,
         for the reason that the majority of the qualified voters of Vigo county, as aforesaid, did
         not cast their votes for the said Dickerson as Representative, at the election held on the
         second day of November last, in said Vigo county, for Representative to this General
         Assembly, but that the majority of qualified electors of said Vigo county voting at the
         election so holden as aforesaid, did cast their vote for Cornelius Meagher for
         Representative to this General Assembly, who was at the time eligible and qualified to the
         office of Representative to this General Assembly, and was duly elected thereto as a member
         thereof at the election held as aforesaid.
        And the protestant further avers that he protests and objects against the name of Robert
         L. Mackey being called as a member of the House of Representatives of the General Assembly,
         or as a member of the joint convention, for the reason
         that the said Mackey was not at the time of his pretended election to this General
         Assembly, to-wit: on the second day of November last, eligible to or qualified for the
         office of Representative to this General Assembly, for the reason that he had not been for
         two years immediately prior thereto a resident of the Legislative District composed of the
         counties of Knox, Gibson and Vanderburg of the State of Indiana, from which he pretends to
         have been elected.
        This protestant further avers that one John F. Pruitt was duly elected as Representative
         to this General Assembly from the Legislative District from the three counties aforesaid,
         and was eligible and qualified for the office of Representative to this General Assembly as
         aforesaid. That the said John F. Pruitt is present and that his name ought to be called as
         a member of this House of Representatives, and of this joint convention, and that if called
         he will and would vote for David Turpie for Senator in the Congress of the United States,
         from the State of Indiana, on this ballot, in this joint convention.
        All of which is respectfully submitted.
        
         [Signed,]
         CHARLES L. JEWETT, Representative from
          the county of Floyd.
        
       
      
     
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     TOWNSHIP TRUSTEES.
     The special order was the consideration of the bills [H. R. 100 and H. R. 44] relating to
      the duties of township trustees.
     Mr. FOSTER: I move to amend Section 8 by adding thereto the following: Provided, It shall be
      unlawful for any such trustee to use any of the public funds, directly or indirectly, for the
      purchase of any periodical, school journal or educational work, or for the payment of any
      subscription to the same, made for himself or any other person.
     Mr. COX, of Miami: I believe that this bill was intended to reach an evil that is supposed
      to exist. I believe, however, that the evil has been magnified. I believe that township
      trustees are as reliable and as much to be trusted as any other class of officers. I undertake
      to say of the more than one thousand trustees in this State, where has been fewer cases of
      corruption of office than has been among the ninety-two county treasurers that have served the
      people in that capacity. This bill provides a bunglesome method of doing business. Before the
      trustee can buy a pane of glass for the school house he has to go to the county commissioners.
      It is unreasonable. Now, in regard to the matter of bridges, suppose a bridge has been
      destroyed that may be repaired for ten or five dollars. The township trustee dare not spend
      that five dollars. He must go to the county-seat and notify the auditor, and the auditor must
      call the commissioners together. Their expenses and perdiem would amount to twelve dollars and
      fifty cents simply for the purpose of authorizing the township trustee to pay out five dollars
      in cash that he already has in the treasury. Is that in the interest of the people? It seems
      to me that it is not. In regard to the other bill, number 44, I think, in view of the
      corruptions there have been in the administration of the office of township trustee, that it
      would be well to return to the old plan of free trustees in this State: That in each township
      there shall be elected three trustees, one of whom is to be president of the board, another to
      be secretary and the other treasurer.--The president is to exercise about the same authority
      and perform about the same duties that devolves upon the one trustee now. No money is to be
      paid out unless these three trustees agree. Their meetings are to be public, and after their
      proceedings are over the records are public. I seems to me that this method throws all
      necessary safeguards around the office of township trustee, and it is not as bunglesome as the
      manner proposed by the gentleman from Davies (Mr. Gardiner.)
     Mr. NIBLACK: As to changing the law in relation to township trustees, I think that there is
      some necessity for it. There are some defects that this Legislature ought to remedy. But the
      great trouble is, that legislation is likely to be overdone. I believe township trustees are
      more honest in the administration of public affairs than almost any other class of officers.
      It is absolutely necessary in the administration of this office to place almost unlimited
      confidence in them and we ought not to bind them down in this way. House bill number 100, I
      think, could be amend- ed so as to conform to my idea of
      what ought to be done. I will call attention to a few objections. In the first place, the bill
      provides that the trustees cannot spend a cent of money to buy a pane of glass, or to assist
      the poor, even in case of emergency. If this bill goes into effect the board of commissioners
      will not only be in session all the time, but you might as well abolish the board of trustees
      and let the commissioners do all the work. I think it would practically abolish the trustee
      and throw their business all into the hands of the county commissioners. There is another
      objection: This bill requires that the trustee is to give a list of every article needed, even
      in the building of a school house, or the nails for fixing bridges, &c. [Reads Section 2.]
      This would be a very good thing if it could be put into practice, but it is almost contrary to
      human nature that the people shall look to the township trustee to find out these things.--
      There are a great many other objections to this bill. I do not think that either bill ought to
      become a law.
     Mr. PLEAK: I move to amend by adding to Section 1, line 15, after the word
      "respectively" the words "and a further, full and complete statement of all the
      poor persons to whom he has given aid, together with the amounts furnished such persons, and
      the names of such persons that will probably be public charges.'I think the members of
      this House well know that the demand for assistance for the poor is fast increasing in the
      several counties in Indiana. We pay out in my county from three thousand to five thousand
      dollars. We know not to whom this goes. Much of it goes to purchase those things that, I
      venture to say, one half of the members of this House do not indulge in. If there was: some
      means of making it a matter of record so we would know to whom this goes it would restrict
      that thing. I know that a good many people go to the township trustee and get something,
      simply because they can. I hope this amendment will prevail.
     Mr. GORDON: It occurs to me that out of the differences that are likely to arise we will get
      nothing. I move to recommit both bills with instructions to report a bill so that there shall
      be elected three trustees who shall hold their office one, two, and three years, at first, and
      then each hold three years, just like the board of county commissioners. One of them should
      discharge the duties now required of a township assessor; another have charge of the highways,
      and he should be the secretary board; and the other perform all the other duties now required
      of a township trustee. It will only create one additional office. And then another provision
      in the bill should be, that they should enter into all contracts for the township just like
      the county board; that they should make all allowances for the township, in reference to the
      roads, the poor, the payment of teachers; that all allowances drawn out should be made by this
      board, and that they should make the tax levies. It would require but a very brief bill to
      cover this whole subject; it could be provided for in very general terms.
     The SPEAKER: There has been delivered to the chair a memorial contesting the seat of Hon.
      Charles L. Jewett, which will be referred to the Committee on Elections
      without reading.
     Mr. JEWETT: Mr. Speaker, I would like to know by whom it was presented.
     The SPEAKER: The memorial will be referred to the committee without reading.
     Mr JEWETT: I would like to know, Mr. Speaker, what it is. It seems to me it is a
      constitutional right that I should know what the matter is.
     The SPEAKER: There is nothing before the House, except the motion of the gentleman from
      Putnam (Mr. Gordon.)
     Mr. REYNOLDS made an ineffectual motion to lay Mr. Gordon's motion to recommit on the
      table.
     Mr. THOMPSON: This is an important measure. There is more cor- ruption in the township trustee's office than in any other
      office in the State. There is to-day one million dollars laying in the hands of township
      trustees that is being used by them for their own purposes. I know trustees that have had
      money and loaned it out and taken interest on it, and leave that money of the people at
      interest for five years. That is one of the corrupt practices of the township trustees. The
      bill 44 provides for three trustees. I would be very glad if it provided for only one, but to
      correct this practice I would be in favor of three. It defines the duties of each trustee and
      says that he shall do a certain amount of work. Now the important feature is, the trustees
      gives bonds of five hundred dollars for the performance of their duties; it leaves the money
      in the county treasury, and they have no benefit if they assess more taxes than is necessary.
      I believe that the passage of this bill 44 will meet the requirements of the people of this
      State so far as the township trustee is concerned. I want to see something done in relation to
      this office of township trustee.
     Mr. BUCKLES: It occurs to me that the evils complained of are very clearly and very fully
      provided for in bill number 100; I am partial to the provisions of that bill. I am opposed to
      three trustees.
     Mr. GOUGH I think bill number 100 provides a remedy for the evils that now exist and I do
      not like to see it smothered by having it sent back to the committee. The other proposition
      is, that we shall have three trustees in place of one. Now, gentlemen, if the proposition was
      to cut down the officers to one less instead of one more I would be with you. What are the
      evils that we are trying to meet? They are to fix the accountability of the trustee;--to let
      him show to the people what he desires to buy for his township, or for the different road
      districts, or school districts; to let him simply make a list of the articles and file that
      list with the county officers so the people can inspect it. Now, what will be the effect of
      such a law as this? The trustee will go carefully over the needs of his township and make a
      list of the things needed for three month. This is simply applying to the township a rule that
      is applied to the State. If you will turn to the report of the Auditor of State you will find
      that he makes a statement of the disbursements, and an estimate for the ensuing two years; and
      he presents that statement to this Legislature.-- What for? That the Legislature may see
      whether the items are proper to be bought, in order to carry on the State government. If there
      is any item there that is wrong it may be stricken out of the appropriation bill. And so with
      these towship trustees; all this bill requires of them is to make an estimate of the articles
      needed to carry on the township, in order that the people may examine that list; in order that
      these persons who have to pay for these various articles may see whether they are necessary
      for their township or not. I am not defending township trustees. There are no trustees in my
      county that have ever crossed into the dominion of her Majesty Queen Victoria. But I say that
      the best thing to do in order to have a correct administration of any branch of the government
      is that the people may know certainly and definitely what is going on.
     Mr. GARRISON: I do not propose to espouse the cause of dishonest or corrupt trustees; I do
      not propose to say that there are no dishonest ones that have been elected to that office. We
      have two bills before us, number 100 which proposes to continue one trustee in office; the
      other proposes to substitute in his stead a board of three. I have no doubt that one somewhat
      similar to one or the other of these bills will be passed by this House. I believe that the
      unanimous voice of those who have been filling the office of trustee for a number of years
      back is, that as a matter of fact too much responsibility rests upon the office of township
      trustee to be properly and fully discharged by one man. I do not think that any honest man who
      has ever held the office of township trustee in this State, where there is considerable funds to be disbursed, will deny the
      proposition that they have always felt that counsel would be very acceptable, for they have
      often been at a loss to know what was the best thing to do under the circumstances. Before
      condemning or approving either of these bills it would be well to consider what are the duties
      of township trustee. In the first place, it is his duty to see that the road fund is properly
      expended in his township. That is an important duty and requires a good deal of educated
      judgment. We have a good deal of complaint that the roads are not in the condition that they
      should be because the money is not properly expended. It is his duty to see that the school
      houses are furnished with the proper apparatus. It is also his duty to select and employ all
      the teachers in the township, and see that they properly discharge their duties and to pay
      them. It is also his duty to settle with those parties who are so unfortunate as to have their
      sheep killed by dogs; or, in other words, to distribute the dog fund. The duties of a township
      trustee are probably more troublesome than those of any other officer in the county, and I
      believe that he has been clothed and is still clothed with more authority than any other
      officer. I believe that bill number 100 is not a bill that the people will approve. I believe
      that in the business of the township the officer should be as near to the people as possible.
      I think he should be in their midst. He perhaps, more than any other, should be the one with
      whom all the people are acquainted. I believe that under our system of education the people
      are getting to be better and better qualified to act for themselves. I do not think that bill
      number 100 creates any less offices than bill 44, for if this bill 100 should be accepted and
      become a law it virtually substitutes the board of county commissioners in place of the board
      of township trustees as contemplated in bill 44. As has been well said by my young friend from
      Knox (Mr. Niblack) bill number 100 would furnish occupation and continue the county board in
      session a good part of the time. I think it it would be burdensome and unjust to shoulder upon
      them this amount of work.
     Mr. PATTON: Everybody is driving in the same direction, to get a good bill, something that
      will be practical, something that we can work under. I think it would be nothing but proper
      and right to get these men together and let them draft a bill. Bill number 100 does not compel
      the trustees to report the outstanding indebtedness, and there is where all the trouble is.
      Restrict these trustees in their purchasing power,--in their expenses make them conform to the
      law, and then not only report the present indebtedness but all the outstanding indebtedness. I
      move to amend the motion (Mr. Gordon's) by recommitting the bills with pending amendments
      to Messrs. Gardiner, Alexander, Buckles, Gordon and Clark.
     This amendment was agreed to, and the motion as amended was adopted.
     So the bills [H. R. 44 and 100] were referred to this special committee, as was also a bill
      introduced by Mr. Cruson [H. R. 297] on the same subject.
    
    
     STATE TREASURY INVESTIGATION.
     Mr. LINOK offered the following:


     
      
       
        Whereas, In the years 1884, 1885 and 1886 there were rumors current of a serious nature
         affecting the Treasury of the State of Indiana and the Treasurer thereof; and,
        Whereas, The funds belonging to the State should be held, used and expended strictly
         according to law and not otherwise; therefore, be it

        Resolved, That the Speaker of the House be and he is hereby authorized to appoint a
         committee of five muembers who shall investigate the said Treasury and the Treasurer
         thereof for and during the years aforesaid, and report at their convenience to this House;
         and, be it
        Resolved, That the said committee shall take evidence at such time and places as they may
         deem proper, and have power to send for persons, books and papers, and employ a clerk and
         stenographer.
       
      
     
     It was adopted.
     The House adjourned.
    
   
   
   
    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    IN SENATE.
    
     THURSDAY, February 3, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by A. W. Bartlett, Adventist.
    
     JOINT CONVENTION JOURNAL.
     The reading of the Secretary's minutes of yesterday's proceedings was dispensed
      with (as usual) except that portion relating to the joint convention of the two Houses. When
      he read the following words: David Turpie having received a majority of all the votes cast, as
      presiding officer of this joint convention, I declare him duly elected a United States Senator
      in the Congress of the United States from the State of Indiana for the term of six years,
      commencing March 4, 1887.
     Mr. HUSTON [interrupting the reading] said: I understand the last reading was simply the
      utterance or declaration of the President of the Joint Convention.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: What he has read is just exactly what I said.
     Mr. HUSTON: I ask in all fairness and in all candor, and I think it but right, I think it
      but proper, and I think it but just, and I don't see that it can do the majority on this
      floor any harm to have it done, and that is that the words of the Speaker of the House of
      Representatives who was equally the presiding officer of that joint convention, shall also be
      made a part of the record.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair desires to state to the Senator from Fayette (Mr.
      Huston)--with all kindness and respect--the Senator from Fayette knows what the feeling of the
      chair is for him, and not only for the Senator from Fayette, but for all other Republican
      Senators; but the chair desires to say that the language of the Speaker of the House of
      Representatives was indecent and in violation of the agreement that was made; and it
      can't go into this record.
     Mr. HUSTON: Anything I may say is not directed towards the presiding officer individually.
      We are here having a desire to do business as a Senate. We have selected a presiding officer
      who is in one sense a servant of this body. What remarks I have to make shall not be directed
      towards him as an individual but with his official acts. The request I made was this: that the
      words spoken by the Speaker of the House of Representatives should be also made part of the
      journals of the joint convention. And I ask it for this reason, that the utterances of the
      Speaker of  the House are a reflection of the sentiment
      of the minority of the joint convention. I claim that we, though in the minority, are entitled
      to a representation--an equal voice and an equal representation as shown by the journals of
      this joint convention. I claim further that it is not in the province of the President of this
      Senate to decide whether the words uttered by the Speaker of the House of Representatives were
      indecent or in order or not. I claim as a right, and demand at the hands of the majority as a
      simple right, and simple justice, that we be represented on that journal as we should be. It
      is a right that cannot harm the majority, and at the same time will put us in our proper
      position. I trust the majority, without taking up the time of Senate to discuss it, without
      going into details, and without engendering any bad feeling, will kindly accord us that right.
      I feel that in refusing the right it is an outrage unparalleled in the history of legislation
      in Indiana.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair desires to state, and repeat with all firmness, and
      with respect to the Senator, and casting no reflection upon the Senator or his colleagues,
      that the language of the Speaker of the House of Representatives was in violation of an
      agreement made and entered into by the Senator himself, and it was cowardly, gross and
      indecent. Now, this would not have been said had this question not come up. It was both in
      violation of the agreement, I repeat, and it was gross, it was cowardly, and it was
      indecent.
     Mr. HUSTON: The Speaker of the House of Representatives has, not the right to come upon this
      floor to defend himself.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [interrupting]: I wish he had. I would like to meet him.
     Mr. HUSTON [continuing]: Otherwise, he would defend himself.--He evidenced yesterday that he
      has sand enough to take his own part. I ask that the minority shall have the right.--
     Mr. BAILEY [interposing]: There is nothing before the house.
     Mr. HUSTON: There is something before the Senate. I ask that the journal be made to read as
      it should read.
     Mr. BAILEY: How does the gentleman claim it should read? There is no correction offered.
     Mr. HUSTON: I was asking consent that the correction might be made.
     Mr. BAILEY: What correction?
     Mr. HUSTON: A correction so it will show not only what was said by the President of the
      Senate as one of the presiding officers of the joint convention, but I want the words of the
      Speaker of the House of Representatives shown, as another presiding officer of the joint
      convention.
     Mr. BAILEY: This offered correction is not presented in due form. If the Senator has a
      correction, let him offer it in due form and we will pass upon it. Clearly, as the President
      of the Senate has said, we were acting under a compact there, which particularly stipulated
      that the President of the Senate should have the privilege of announcing the vote and
      declaring the result; and under that agreement he did so. What the Speaker might have said, or
      any other member of that joint convention, should not go into this record.
     Mr. HUSTON: I would ask if it does not give the utterances of the President of the
      Senate?
     Mr. BAILEY: What was given him were his rights under the compact.
     Mr. HUSTON: Didn't it give the right to announce jointly?
     Mr. BAILEY: Certainly.
     Mr. HUSTON: Does it not specifically state what the President of the Senate shall do, and
      what the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall do?
     Mr. BAILEY: It states that the President of the Senate shall call the joint convention to
      order, that he shall announce the vote and declare the result.
     Mr. HUSTON: We ask this: first, I stated that we desired it might be allowed without
      discussion. Of course we admit that in point of numbers yesterday you had the advantage.-- There is no use of giving my views as to whether you had
      a legal majority or not, for there is no use of engendering any bad blood. We are asking that
      the words uttered by the Speaker of the House of Representatives be made part of the joint
      convention journal. I can't see where it will do any harm.
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion: I entertain high respect for the Senator. What are the words he
      wants?
     Mr. HUSTON: I will furnish the words.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: If he will write out what he wants and send it up, the Senate
      will pass on it.
     Mr. WEIR [interposing]: I would inquire of the Senator--
     Mr. HUSTON [continuing]: I will send it up, and have it read.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Read the paper. The Senator from Laporte (Mr. Weir) wants to ask
      a question.
     Mr. WEIR: If it be true that the President of the Senate was to announce the result of the
      vote in joint convention, nothing that anybody said in connection with the announcement would
      be proper to go upon the journal.
     Mr. HUSTON: The Senator's position is right, as to the announcement of the vote; by the
      terms of the compact it was his privilege; but what I was asking was this: that the words
      uttered by the Speaker of the House be also made of record as defining the position of the
      minority.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Read the paper.
     The Clerk commenced to read.
     Mr. FRENCH [interrupting]: I want to know whether this is to be read as a matter of
      information, or whether it is to go into the record. I am willing it shall be read as a matter
      of information.
     SEVERAL SENATORS addressed the Chair.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: wait a moment; the chair will see that you all have a fair show.
      The Senate will let the chair explain.--There will be no trouble about this. You shall have
      your right to protest. This paper is sent up for the purpose of bringing before the Senate
      what the Senator from Fayette desires to get into the record. It is read for the information
      of the Senate.
     The Clerk read as follows:
     I move to insert in the journal the following: The Speaker of teh House, as the presiding
      officer of the joint convention, announced that no person had received a majority of the legal
      votes cast, therefore that no person had been elected.
     Mr. HUSTON addressed the Chair.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Wait a moment; the Senator from Posey and Gibson (Mr. French) has
      the floor.
     Mr. HUSTON: I think I have a right to be heard first, following the reading of that paper. I
      move its adoption.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair didn't understand there was any resolution about
      it.
     Mr. SELLERS: I rise to a question of privilege. This offered amendment to the journals ought
      to be rejected, and I move to reject it.
     Mr. HUSTON: I hold that the motion made by the Senator from White (Mr. Sellers) is out of
      order, because the motion I made for its adoption had not been recognized. I had the floor and
      did not yield the floor.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair did not wish to take advantage of the Senator. The
      chair understands the words were to be written down for the information of the Senate. The
      chair did not understand it was a resolution; therefore, the motion of the Senator from White
      is in order. If the Senator will take his seat I will recognise each Senator.
     Mr. HUSTON: I will yield the floor provided I am accorded the floor before the vote is
      taken.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: You shall be; you shall be.
     Mr. WINTER: About the manner in which this paper was presented. I think when the facts are
      re-called the President will see that the resolution was offered properly. The Senator from
      Fayette (Mr. Huston) took  the floor and addressed the
      Chair in reference to what he claimed should be inserted in the journal. The Senator from
      Marion (Mr. Bailey) rose to a of order that there was no motion pending, whereupon I wrote out
      this motion and handed it to the Senator from Fayette and he presented it in answer to the
      point made by the Senator from Marion that there was no motion pending. It was made as a
      motion to correct the journal by inserting in it certain words. It seems to me it will not be
      said that this matter was presented for the information of the Senate. It is presented as a
      motion upon which the Senate should take proper action.
     SEVERAL SENATORS addressed the Chair.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Wait a moment. The chair had the right of this thing, and the
      manner in which this paper was presented. It was in answer to a parliamentary inquiry. This
      paper simply contains words desired to be inserted in the journal, and was read for the
      benefit of the Senate.
     Mr. SELLERS: I have treated this as a motion to amend the journal and have moved to reject
      it, and as a point of order I claim it should be decided by the Senate without debate.
     Mr. HOWARD, of Decatur: I make a point of order against the introduction of this resolution
      that it is estopped by the action of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, as the
      records show. At the termination of the roll-call on the part of the House he announced the
      vote of the House as being 44 to 56; and he afterwards assumed that vote so announced as
      illegal, or a certain proportion of it. I think that was an after-thought, and I can't
      conceive of any ground upon which the Speaker of the House or any other presiding officer can
      challenge the qualifications of a member voting; and especially after he has announced the
      vote.
     Mr. SELLERS: I make the point of order upon the Senator that this question is not debatable,
      and the motion to reject is not debatable.
     The PRESIDEDNT pro tempore: The Senator from Porter (Mr. DeMotte) has the floor to speak to
      a point of order. The Senator has been trying to get the floor and I have been accommodating
      Senators in order--
     Mr. WEIR: I hope the Senator from White will withdraw his motion.
     Mr. SELLERS: No, sir.
     Mr. WEIR: I have no doubt Senators are acting in this matter in good faith. And I have no
      doubt the moment it is admitted that the presiding officer of the Senate had the right to
      announce the vote it will be concede that no man's utterances could be properly injected
      into the journal.
     Mr. SELLERS: I made this motion not because I desired to cut off debate, and with no
      disrespect for the, rights of the minority, but because I think it is a proper motion and made
      at the proper time.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: It seems to me, thirty-three gentlemen ought not to make a
      point of order against--
     Mr. FRENCH: I rise to a point of order. The gentleman from White (Mr. Sellers) made a point
      of order on the introduction of this paper, and the Chair sustained him. Nothing is in order
      but to appeal from the decision of the Chair.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The motion to reject is before the Senate. The Senator from
      Porter (Mr. DeMotte) has the floor.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: If you will examine the records from the first days of this
      State, you will not find an instance analogous to the one presented here. At the last moment
      this record shows that the President of this Senate, with due respect to him, announces his
      identity, and his ofice.--For the first time he rises and says "I, as President,"
      etc., etc., and that is in the record. I maintain if it is in order now to insert a clause of
      that kind, it would have been in order at all times. It appears upon its face that it is an
      attempt to make for party a record. It does seem to me Senators cannot afford to do that. I
      presume that the President of the convention yesterday--
     
     Mr. SELLERS [interrupting]: I rise to a point of order. The motion to reject is not
      debatable. A motion to reject sustained by the Senate is a statement by the Senate that it
      will not consider the proposition.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: The gentleman announced a moment ago that he did not make it to cut off
      debate.
     Mr. SELLERS: I did announce that I did not make the motion to cut off the right of the
      minority, but it is a proper motion to make at all times.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: Did not the Senator say that he did not introduce it with a
      view to cut off debate?
     Mr. SELLERS: No, sir.
     Mr. WINTER: The agreement gave the Speaker of the House of Representatives the right to do
      what he did. I hold that whatever occurred there as part of the proceedings of the joint
      convention would necessarily go into the proceeding of the joint convention. What occurred
      there must go into the record or I take it the agreement is violated.-- See what it says upon
      this subject: [Reads: "Any member of the convention has the right to object"
      etc.--see page 131 of this book] Mr. Sayre (the Speaker of the House of Representatives) was a
      member of that convention. [Reads: "Any member has the right to object to the name of any
      person" etc.]
     Mr. SELLERS [interrupting]: I insist upon the point of order.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Let him read the paper.
     Mr. SELLERS: He has not stated any proposition bearing upon the point of order.
     Mr. FOWLER and other Senators addressed the Chair.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Wait a moment. Will the Senator from Owen (Mr. Fowler) wait a
      moment? Send that paper up to the Secretary and have it read in full; I want it read myself. I
      want that paper read. I know what its contents are.
     Mr. WINTER: I want it read--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [interposing]: Read what you want to and send it up and let us
      close this matter up.
     Mr. WINTER [resuming the reading]: "Or against any other act, and have his protest
      entered upon the journal of both houses," etc., etc.
     Mr. FRENCH: Does that mean that as a member of the House the Speaker has the right to
      object?
     Mr. WINTER: I don't think it makes any difference in what capacity he objects. He or
      any other member has a right to object, and has a right to have his objection entered upon the
      journals. The Speaker has a right under this agreement to protest that there was no
      election.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore[interposing]: Send the paper up and have it read. [To the reading
      clerk]: Now read that paper. Senators will please take their seats. The chair knows what is in
      that paper.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I have not resigned the floor.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Senator from Porter (Mr. DeMotte) will not be cut off in his
      youth. At any time the Senator desires the floor and he is in order he shall have it. [The
      reading clerk said the sheets of paper on which the agreement was written were not in order.]
      Can you arrange them in order, Senator (Mr. Winter), so he can read it. [Mr. Winter arranged
      the papers and the clerk read the agreement as printed on page 131 of this book.] Now, the
      chair insisted on the reading of that paper. Being a party to the arrangement, having made
      some suggestions and entered into consultations about it the chair thinks he can construe it
      quite as well as the Senator from Marion (Mr. Winter). The construction I put upon it would
      be, as far as the point raised is concerned, that the Speaker of the House of Representatives
      is a member, and like any other member, would have a right to file a protest. But the Speaker
      didn't seek to file a protest. He interrupted we by announcing that in anticipation of
      what was going to happen, "I," said he, "as presiding officer of the joint
      convention." He sought to do it as presiding officer of the joint conven-  tion, and outside of what was proper for him to state; he was going
      to declare to the effect that there was no election. Under that agreement he had no right to
      say whether there or was not an election. In fact, under the agreement and under the law the
      vote cast declares the election, and it is not absolutely necessary that the presiding officer
      should declare who was elected.
     Mr. HUSTON: Does not the presiding officer consider it necessary to show he made the
      declaration that David Turpie received a majority of the votes cast?
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: It is not absolutely necessary that the President should declare
      that "David Turpie having received a majority of all the votes cast in joint convention
      is duly elected United States Senator for a term of six years," because the vote being
      cast, and the journal record showing so many votes cast for each candidate, shows upon its
      face that he received a majority, and the result of the vote, under the operation of the law,
      declares he is elected.
     Mr. HUSTON: Then why were the words of the President of the Senate inserted in the journal
      and the words of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, who was his co-equal,
      excluded?
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Simply because the President of the Senate undertook in good
      faith to carry out the agreement that authorized me, as President of the Senate, to announce
      the result of the vote in joint convention. The Speaker of the House is not given the right
      anywhere to make that declaration.
     Mr. HUSTON: Does not that agreement give him the right to protest?
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair has stated that he has a right to protest, reduce it to
      writing and file it, but no right to get up there and declare himself the presiding officer of
      the joint convention, and declare as presiding officer that there was no election. In doing
      that he committed a wrong and violated the agreement. There are too many Senators on the
      floor.
     Mr. HUSTON: Your proposition is that he had a right to file a protest.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: He must do it in the regular way.
     Mr. HUSTON: While on the one hand you claim that it is not necessary in order to carry out
      the election of David Turpie as United States Senator that any declaration should have been
      made on your part--
     Mr. SELLERS [interrupting]: I object to the discussion of this question; the question
      pending is undebatable.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair is willing to hear and answer a question.
     Mr. HUSTON: While the President of the Senate, taking the position that he does, that in
      order legally to elect David Turpie it was not necessary he should have stated that having
      received a majority of all the votes cast he was declared elected United States Senator,--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempors [interrupting]: Wait a moment. Don't make it so long.
     Mr.HUSTON: If I am not allowed to ask a question--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: I want to answer as you go along.
     Mr. HUSTON: If he has the right to protest, I want to know why you have any greater right
      than he? If you saw fit to have entered upon the journal utterances of your own, why
      can't you accord the same to the Speaker of the House?
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Wait till I answer. Just two reasons. It has been the usage and
      custom from the time when the memory of man runneth not to the contrary, that the President of
      the Senate of the joint convention for the election of United States Senator declares the
      result and immediately announces it. And for a second reason: that, under the compact you
      entered into yourself, the President of the Senate was given the right to declare this result
      and announce who is elected. Wait a moment; and for the very same reason the other man had no
      right to do  it, and he shall not be heard here, as far
      as the chair is concerned. [Mr. HUSTON: "Mr. President."] The
      point of order is sustained. [Mr. HUSTON: "Mr. President"] If
      there is anything else before the Senate let it come. [Mr. HUSTON and Mr.
       HARNESS addressed the Chair.] Does the Senator yield the floor?
     Mr. HUSTON: I will for a moment.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: You will have to take your turn like going to the mill.
     Mr. HARNESS: Under the agreement entered into by the two political parties which has just
      been read, who was the presiding officer of that joint convention? That is the first
      question.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Well, under the agreement entered into, if the Senator had
      listened to the reading he would see that the President of the Senate was to order the
      roll-call of the Senate, and he was to announce the result of the vote of the joint
      convention, and that all other intermediate parliamentary motions were left to the Speaker of
      the House. I have carried out that part of the agreement and there has been a violation of the
      other part.
     Mr. FRENCH: I insist upon the motion before the house.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The motion before the house is to reject the paper offered. [Mr.
       HUSTON: "Mr. Pres dent, Mr. President."--Other SENATORS: "Call the roll." "Call the roll."] The chair will direct
      the calling of the roll at the right time.
     Mr. HUSTON: I understood the President to say that I will be allowed--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: You have the President's word. Proceed.
     Mr. FRENCH: The point of order is made, and I object to it.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: He asked the privilege, and the chair will hold his word
      good.
     Mr. FRENCH: I think he has had his say.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Senator is running ashore. Go ahead, Senator.
     Mr. HUSTON: I hold in my hand this compact in which it states clearly that the Speaker of
      the House shall preside over the deliberations of the joint convention. That statement says so
      in just so many words and is susceptible of but one construction. All I asked in the outset
      was that the minority be allowed by the majority of this body to put itself right before the
      people of Indiana. I claim to-day that we as a party are willing to go before the State and
      let our record be shown. What is our record? And what is the record of the majority of this
      Senate? All along, since the organization of the Senate, the minority has been stifled under
      the previous question and deprived of the right of defining or defending our position.
     Mr. FRENCH [interposing]: With all due respect to the Chair, and urgin as I do under
      parliamentary rules, I respectfully appeal from the decision of the Chair; he is not speaking
      to the question before the house.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair will say to the Senator from Fayette [Mr. Huston] that
      if he will address himself to the question he has indicated the chair will not sustain the
      point of order against him; but you are branching out a little too far.
     Mr. FRENCH: We don't understand why we should be subjected to anything of this
      kind.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: If it be insisted that the point of order shall be sustained
      against the will of the chair, the chair will grant it. The chair does not desire to cut off
      the Senator unless it is the will of the majority. The chair has desired that the Senator
      shall have his say, hoping the Senator will not occupy all the forenoon saving it.
     Mr. FRENCH: I have been listening for three-quarters of an hour to a discussion in violation
      of parliamentary law.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: This is a matter in which the chair is personally involved, and
      the chair does not desire to prevent Senators on the
      other side of the chamber from giving the fullest expression, the chair feeling that he is
      able to take care of himself.
     Mr. FRENCH: We think we have some rights that ought to be respected.
     Mr. HUSTON: I want to know if it is courtesy to members to be interrupted by a running
      conversation between members and the Chair?
     Mr. SELLERS: Do you not know that the motion made by myself cuts off all debate?
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair will cut it off. [Mr. HUSTON:
      "Mr. President."] Call the roll; the question is on the rejection of the resolution.
      [Mr. HUSTON:--"Mr. President," "Mr. President."] Call
      the roll. [The clerk called the roll and after every name, for sometime, Mr. Huston continned
      to repeat the words "Mr. President," until he said "I think it is a --------
      outrage; a ------- outrage."] Now, what does Senator Huston want?
     Mr. HUSTON: I was about uttering these words: I admit the fact that the motion from the
      Senator from White is not debatable, and it is due to the liberality of the Chair that I was
      allowed the courtesy of being heard--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [interrupting]: Call the roll. [Mr. HUSTON:
      "I think I have some rights here."] What does the Senator want? Call the roll. Mr.
      Pritchett, [the Door-keeper.] Senators take your seats. [To the Door-keeper.] Those who do
      not, you see that they do. The chair asks all Senators to take their seats.
     Mr. FOWLER: My name is called and I want to explain my vote.--When the motion was made by
      the Senator from White (Mr. Sellers) to reject this motion, there was an understanding between
      the Senator from Fayette (Mr. Huston) and the Chair that he was to have an opportunity to be
      heard, and I thought it was generally understood that it was not to cut off debate. I am yet
      in favor of his being heard and I am opposed to rejecting this motion. I vote
      "no."
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Senator Huston, pay attention! The chair intends to give to
      Senator Huston, if he desires it, after this vote is taken, on rising to a question of
      privilege he has a right to state what he desires upon this matter, provided he--
     Mr. HUSTON: What is the use of calling the roll?
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Call the roll. Call the roll, now.
     Mr. HARNESS, when his name was called, said: I vote against this motion for the reason I
      consider the motion made by the Senator from Fayette (Mr. Huston) a move to correct a record
      that is not true. I consider that it is in violation of the agreement. I consider that it is
      placing something upon the journals of this body something that is not true in fact.-- For
      these reasons: because it is in violation of the compact, and the journals will not state the
      truth, if allowed to go uncorrected, I vote "no."
     Mr. HOWARD, of Decatur: I desire to say this in explanation of my vote: that I do not choose
      to vote for anything that will make an incongruous record. It is an undertaking to introduce
      into the record a declaration of the Speaker of the House that there was illegal votes cast.
      The question occurs to me, by what authority he questions the legality of any members voting
      in that convention; and questioning any members voting whether they will be members of the
      Senate or of the House.-- The presumption is, that it was not a member of the House from the
      fact that he declared the vote of the House and it was so recorded. I therefore vote
      "aye."
     Mr. HOWARD, of St. Joseph, when his name was called, said: Individual expression should form
      no part of the journal. Desiring the opposition shall have the privilege of expressing
      themselves whenever they choose, I vote "aye."
     Mr. HUSTON: I wish to explain my vote, and in doing so I will endeavor not to take up the
      time of the Senate unnecessarily. It is not my e sir e to consume the time of the Senate and take it from business that is proper to be attended to,
      but it is my wish that the minority should be accorded at all times the right which has
      heretofore been accorded in other parliamentary bodies.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [interposing]: Especially in the House of Represenatives.
     Mr. HUSTON: There may be men who are disposed to adopt unfair resolutions; I would not
      sanction that. In regard to the rules over in the House, they are as near as proper the rules
      adopted by this Senate. I am opposed to rejecting the motion I offered because I believe that
      its rejection will make an incorrect record--will make an untrue statement of facts; and
      because the minority, in my judgment, have an equal right with the majority of defining their
      position and having that position made part of the record of the joint convention;
      consequently I vote "no."
     Mr. McCLURE, when his name was called, said: On yesterday everything in joint convention
      went on as usual until the Speaker of the House discovered that the Republican party was beat
      in their candidate for United States Senator, when he undertook to usurp authority and tried
      to break up that joint convention by an unwarrantable declaration. According to usage the
      President of the Senate got up and announced the vote of the joint convention, and it was then
      that these Republicans began to kick and raise such a hullabelloo that his voice could not be
      heard; and for that reason I vote "aye."
     Mr. MCDONALD, when his name was called, said: Everything went along in
      the best of feeling for a time yesterday in joint convention, but when the proceeding was
      interrupted by an insult to the President of the Senate, and the presiding officer of that
      convention, by the most disorderly conduct and language--language that should not be made use
      of; I say when the presiding officer was interrupted in that way, with an utter disregard for
      law and order and decency, it threw them entirely out of the compact; and now these gentlemen
      come in here and want part of that language in this record--a proceeding unwarranted and
      indecent--it is an outrage; and therefore I shall vote emphatically "aye."
     Mr. SMITH, of Wells, in explanation of his vote, said: What the Speaker of the House said in
      joint convention about the result of the final vote was not in accord with the compact, but
      was overstepping the bounds of right; therefore, I vote "aye."
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion: We have met about sixteen or seventeen times in joint convention.
      It was the duty of members of the Senate and House to assemble there as we did. Could any
      other result have been obtained than the one obtained yesterday? Robinson had to vote with one
      side or the other; if he voted with the Democrats he gave them a majority. Robinson gave the
      casting vote with the Democrats. Sayre (the Speaker) immediately became angry--the moment that
      vote was given. Under the contract he had sat and recognized from day to day the President of
      the Senate as the man to announce the result of the vote clear through. But then, he rose from
      his seat in great anger and called the President of this Senate an usurper and a pretender. I
      say that was an insult to this house.
     Mr. HUSTON: I rise to a question of privilege.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Senator is out of order.
     Mr. HUSTON: A question of privilege is always in order.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Not when a Senator is explaining his vote. It is given as a
      matter of courtesy, not as a matter of right.
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion [resuming]: It was an insult not only to the Senate but to
      respectable gentlemen who sit in this Senate on the opposite side. It was a insult to their
      judgment and their conduct here; it was an insult to Republican gentlemen here; it was an
      insult to every member of this body. Therefore, out  on
      his rights; I have no privileges to offer him. I vote in favor of rejecting this proposition.
      "Aye."
     Mr. THARP, when his name was called, said: The way I interpret that compact any declaration
      made by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, that he was not warranted in making by
      the provisions of that compact, has no more right in the journal than the declaration of any
      other Representative or any Senator on the floor of that joint convention, or any one of the
      howling mob that disgraced that joint convention. I, therefore, think the words proposed by
      this motion have no right in the journal; and I vote "aye."
     Mr. WEIR, in explaining his vote, said: I simply wish to say this: as I understand it, the
      President of Senate was to announce the result; if that be true, there is nothing anybody in
      the world could say that would be proper to insert in this journal. It is absurd on its face.
      But in this case, as in all others, I believe in a full opportunity to discuss any question. I
      think it is proper that the Senate should determine, and not the presiding officer should say
      what privileges he would give a Senator in advance. Because I think that is a matter for the
      Senate to determine and not the presiding officer, I say that without any discourtesy at all.
      While I shall vote against this motion to reject, I shall also vote against the motion to
      correct the journal. I vote "no."
     Mr. FOWLER [when the roll-all was finished]: I voted on this question with a view of giving
      the Senator from Fayette (Mr. Huston) an opportunity to make his speech, as I understood it
      was agreed that he should in entering upon the discussion of this question. He has had that
      opportunity and I now change my vote; I vote "aye."
     Mr. HUSTON: Will the Chair allow me to ask a question?
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore announced the result of the vote--yeas 31, nays l8--as
      follows:
     
      
       
        YEAS. Andrew, Bailey, Barret, Berry, Branaman, Bryant, Cox, Day, Duncan (of Brown,)
         Fowler, French, Griffith, Hale, Howard (of Decatur,) Howard (of St. Joseph),) Logsdon,
         McClure, McDonald, Mullinix, Peterson, Rahm, Schloss, Sellers, Shively, Smith (of Wells,)
         Thompson (of Marion,) Tharp, Trippet, Urmston, Zimmerman, Mr. President, 31
        NAYS. Campbell, Davis, DeMotte, Drake, Dresser, Duncan (of Tipton.) Ensley, Harness,
         Huston, Johnson, Kennedy, Macy, Marshall, Moon, Shroyer, Thompson (of Jasper.) Winter,
         Weir, 18
       
      
     
      So the motion to reject was agreed to.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [to the Secretary]: Read the journal--proceed with the reading of
      the journal.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I move to strike out a word or two there.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: This motion will be read for the information of the Senate, and
      if the chair thinks it out of order, will so rule on it.
     The Clerk read as follows:
     I move to strike out from the language used by the President of the Senate in making the
      announcement of the vote as appears in record of joint convention the words, "as
      presiding officer of the joint convention."
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I have had at least half a dozen cut and dried speeches this
      morning, but have been unable to obtain the floor to make them. Much stress has been put upon
      "the agreement," whatever that may be. Nowhere in that agreement does it appear that
      the President of the Senate is to be the presiding officer of the joint convention; on the
      contrary, it appears that the presiding officer of that convention was to be the Hon. W. G.
      Sayre, the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Therefore, the declaration of the
      President of the Senate was unwarranted in fact and contrary to the agreement.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Wait a moment.
     
     Mr. HUSTON: I wish to ask the Chair if he declares it as a principle of parliamentary law
      that the presiding officer of a deliberative body has control of its journal of proceedings,
      or whether the deliberative body itself does?
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore:If that point of order is made the chair will rule one way or the
      other.
     Mr. SELLERS: I ask that the reading of the journal be proceeded with.
     Mr. WINTER: I understand the Chair announced that the motion of the Senator from Porter (Mr.
      DeMotte) would be read for information. I want to re-call what occurred on the second day of
      the session: when the question arose as to the proper time to amend our journal it was
      insisted by the member from Hendricks county that the whole journal should be read and then
      amendments offered; but the Chair decided that the proper time for motions to amend was when
      it was being read,--and amendments were made on that day under that rule. Now, I submit if
      that is the ruling, that the Senator from Porter was exactly in order.
     Mr. SELLERS: I rise to a point of order. The President has not ruled this motion out of
      order.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair never decided.
     Mr. WINTER: I understand the motion is to strike out the words "President of the joint
      convention."
     Mr. SELLERS: There has been no motion.
     Mr. WINTER: Then I will make the motion.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: If some Senator will raise a point of order on the paper we can
      soon dispose of it.
     Mr. SELLERS: I move the previous question on the adoption of that.
     The Senate seconded this demand, and under its operation the motion (Mr. DeMotte's) was
      rejected by yeas 17, nays 32.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [to the Clerk]: Proceed with the reading of the journal.
     Mr. JOHNSON: I have reduced to writing the protest I made yesterday in joint convention
      against receiving the votes of Frank Branaman, Isaiah B. McDonald and Alonso G. Smith. I now
      move that this protest be ordered spread upon the journals of this Senate, and in that part of
      the proceedings relating to the joint convention.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair will say that no motion is necessary. The agreement is
      that it should be entered upon the journal, and that agreement shall be held in good faith.
      The journal shows that agreement and it shall not be violated. [To the Clerk]: Read that
      protest. The chair imagines the Senator has placed it in proper and appropriate language.
     The Clerk read as follows:
     
      
       
        We, the undersigned, members of the joint convention of the Fifty-fifth General Assembly
         of the State of Indiana for the election of a United States Senator for said State to the
         Congress of the United States, do hereby object to and protest against the receiving or
         counting the vote of either Frank Branaman, Isaiah B. McDonald or Alonzo G. Smith in said
         election in said joint convention, for the reason and upon the ground that neither one of
         said individuals is, under the Constitution or laws of the United States or the said State
         of Indiana, a member of the Senate of said General Assembly, or of the said joint
         convention.

     Mr. DEMOTTE: I did not hear whether the motion of Representative
      Gardiner, that when the joint convention adjourn it adjourn till today, was in the journal or
      not?
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: I don't know whether it appears or not; I don't
      remember. The motion was out of order. The Senator may examine it himself, or have the Clerk
      read it over, if he wants to.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I desire it shall go on record. The officers of the House
      have mutilated the record if it is not in it.
     
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: There is no mutilation in it.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I take it that it is the duty of the officers of the House
      to make a complete record, and they are not the judges nor is the Chair the judge of that.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair has not assumed to be the judge, but the chair would
      ask the question: can you explain what reason your colleagues over in the House have for
      refusing to make the record show that David Turpie was declared elected United States
      Senator?
     Mr. DEMOTTE: Because he was not elected.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Because the record over there don't show the fact; that is
      the reason.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I insist the officer of this Senate shall do his duty as an
      officer; and I insist he shall not have the right to say it shall not go in.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The recording officer of the Senate has not said so. The chair
      desires to state there is another motion perhaps left out. It was moved by the Senator from
      Marion (Mr. Bailey) that the convention adjourn sine die, and the chair declared the
      convention adjourned. That is not in the record.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: What Chair?
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair that faces you now--the only one that had a right to do
      it.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: He has violated his word and honor as a man.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: No, sir.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I say, sir, it has not been carried out in good faith.
     Mr. SELLERS: Call him to order.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Senator will take his seat pending the discussion of the
      point of order.
     Mr. SELLERS: My point of order is that there is nothing before the Senate.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The point of order is well taken.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I move that the record of the Senate show the motion made by
      Representative Gardiner, that when the joint convention adjourn it adjourn till to-day.
     Mr. FRENCH: I make the point of order that by operation of law when one man gained
      seventy-six votes in joint convention that puts an end to it sine die. After an election the
      joint convention would stand adjourned under the law.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair so understands it, that the convention, when the
      Senator is elected, is adjourned by operation of law. It stands adjourned under the laws of
      the Congress of the United States.-- The point of order is well taken.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I protest against the decision of the Chair.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: You ought to be thankful to have that right. [Laughter.]
     Mr. SELLERS: Now I insist that the motion shall be put to the Senate upon the approval of
      the minutes.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The question is upon the motion that the minutes as read shall be
      approved.
     It was agreed to by yeas 32, nays 17.
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Jasper, at five minutes after noon, made an ineffectual motion to
      adjourn--yeas 8, nays 30.
     Mr. JOHNSON, at twelve minutes after noon; made an ineffectual motion to adjourn--yeas 10,
      nays 30.
     At 12.30 came a recess for dinner.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     BRANAMAN AND M'DONALD CONTEST.
     Mr. DRESSER called up the special order--the consideration of the minority report in the
      contested election case of Branaman vs. McDonald [See pages 104 and 105 of this book.]
     Mr. BAILEY: I move that it be postponed until next Thursday at two o'clock.
     Mr. WINTER: That will be as much as saying that the report of the minority shall not be
      heard.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: I regard it as tacit understanding that the minority shall be beard in this
      discussion.
     Mr. FRENCH: I have a very distinct remembrance that agreemen was made, but I don't
      think it would do any more good than to give an
      opportunity for expression at this time.
     The motion was rejected by yeas 16, nays 27.
     Mr. SELLERS: I rise to a point order on the minority report: that it is out of order and
      ought not to be considered by the Senate. This minority report was not filed until after the
      Senate acted upon the majority report in unseating McDonald, and acted upon the majority
      report in seating Branaman. This minority report would amount to nothing except a
      reconsideration of the action in the Brananan case and it is not in order to reconsider.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [to the Clerk]: Read the resolutions attached to the report. [The
      Clerk reads--see page 104.]
     Mr. SELLERS: I insist that both these resolutions look to the reversal of what has been done
      by the Senate, which can only be reached by a motion to reconsider, and the time has passed
      for that.
     Mr. BAILEY: That is correct.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair understands in the case of a majority and a minority
      report, and especially in this case, the majority report being favorable to the unseating of
      McDonald, the minority report could only have been favoring his remaining in his seat. I
      don't understand how after the majority report has been passed upon and the matter once
      been determined by the seating of the contester that a minority report must be made asking
      that the contestee be unseated and the contestor seated. I noticed the character of this
      resolution when first read, and judging from its tenor it certainly is not in the nature of a
      minority report.
     Mr. BAILEY: It is predicated upon the report made by the majority and is not a minority
      report in any sense.
     Mr. SELLERS: And it was presented after the majority report was acted upon in both cases.
      This asks the Senate to reverse its decision.
     Mr. HUSTON: Even admitting that fact, as the Republican members understood it the majority
      report was made on McDonald's case in the afternoon with the understanding existing
      between the majority and the minority that the majority report would simply be submitted and
      no action taken upon it until the next morning at which time the minority report should be
      submitted and the two reports should be discussed.--That was the understanding I am informed
      by the minority, and it goes undenied as I understand by the majority. Then summary action was
      taken on the majority report, McDonald was unseated and Branaman sworn in. At the time this
      report was presented, when it was read made the special order for this afternoon, no objection
      was raised on the part of the majority to these resolutions and this time was fixed for the
      discussion when the minority might be heard upon it. I submit whether the Senate has not
      already committed itself by making it a special order?
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: If this minority report had been made when the majority report
      was, the resolutions accompanying it would not be germane to the question.
     Mr. HUSTON: Of course the majority controlled the Clerk, and of course the report of the
      majority was drawn as fast as the evidence was taken; and it is reasonable to assume they were
      prepared to submit their report long before the minority could have an opportunity to draw up
      a report. It was not chargeable to negligence or indifference on the part of the minority. At
      the time the majority report was made it was not possible to make the minority report. As I
      stated before, the tacit understanding was that no action should be taken on the majority
      report until the next morning.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: As far as the report itself is concerned--as far as the evidence
      incorporated in the report--there is no question in the mind of the chair but that the
      minority have a right to have that spread upon the journal, but that is not what the point of
      order goes to. The majority report recommended  the
      unseating of McDonald and the seating of Branaman, or the resolution offered by the majority
      was to that effect. The Senate acted upon that, operating under the previous question; after
      that a motion was made to reconsider and lay upon the table, and that was carried, which
      forever set the matter at rest and placed it beyond a reconsideration. This report proceeds
      not as a minority report, but upon the theory of independent action, to unseat Branaman as if
      there was contest for his seat. That could not have been a minority report; it could not have
      been made when the majority report was made. The resolutions accompanying this report are not
      germane to the question raised by the majority report, and the chair decides the resolutions
      out of order.
     Mr. WINTER: I appeal from the decision of the Chair. [Mr. Huston joining.]
     The decision of the Chair was sustained by yeas 30, nays 18.
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. CAMPBELL said: As a parliamentary question I believe the decision of the President of
      the Senate is right had it not been for the agreement made by the majority with the minority
      of the committee at the time of the making of the majority report. Had it not been for this
      agreement I should vote for sustaining the decision of the Chair; but believing this agreement
      ought to be carried out in good faith, and believing the decision is in gross violation of an
      agreement made in good faith, I shall vote "no."
     Mr.DEMOTTE, when his name was called, said: Believing this is another
      move on the part of the majority to face back on its own record after having turned a Senator
      out of this Senate without hearing the testimony or allowing his friends to speak for him, I
      vote, "no."
     Mr. FRENCH, in explanation of his vote, said: I know as a matter of fact the decision of the
      Chair is right, and I know further that nothing will be accomplished here by a discussion of
      this matter. I believe the political rubicon has been crossed in this contest, and it is time
      for us to go to work to accomplish the purposes for which we came here. I shall vote
      "aye."
     Mr. MULLINIX, when his name was called, said: Believing the action of the majority was just,
      I vote "aye."
     Mr. SELLERS: I desire to say in explanation, on the point of order raised by me, that I do
      not believe it is wise or right to spend the people's money and waste their time in
      discussing a question res adjudicata--settled beyond re-call, and I vote "aye."
     Mr. WINTER, in explanation of his vote, said: As far as the question raised by the Senator
      from White [Mr. Sellers] is concerned I am not prepared to say his parliamentary position is
      not right, but I say there was a positive and distinct understanding that this question was to
      be set for a special order when an hour was to be allowed the minority for discussion.--That
      has been admitted by the majority, and that being admitted, every member of the majority were
      estopped from raising a question of order to deprive us of that right. I regard the action of
      the majority in this matter as a breach of good faith, and for that reason I vote
      "no."
     Mr. BAILEY: When the motion was made by the Senator from Laporte, perhaps a week ago, to
      postpone the consideration of the minority report until to-day, there was no further agreement
      than that in that motion the time for a discussion was fixed, and it was acted upon as any
      other motion would be; but as far as being bound not to raise any parliamentary point of
      order, it seems to me the minority cannot, in any degree, raise such a point. But upon a
      discussion of this matter, while it would be a futile waste of time and money, I was willing
      and desirous of having the minority heard in this case. They had as good an opportunity when
      the majority report was adopted, as the merits of their case would warrant.
     Mr. DEMOTTE [interposing]:
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Senator cannot be interrupted.
     
     Mr. DEMOTTE: That is a protection--
     Mr. BAILEY [resuming]: I desire to state that it seems to me the minority on this floor have
      had all the time they would care or seek to get in this contest.
     Mr. HUSTON: I understood you to say the minority have had ample opportunity.
     Mr. BAILEY: They certainly have had opportunity; I may have used the word "ample."
      As a member of the Committe on Elections I have examined this case
      thoroughly and feel that the majority have as good a case as ever presented, but I was anxious
      it should be presented, and I did not expect or contemplate raising any point of order,
      although I think it is well taken, and inasmuch as the point is raised I vote
      "aye."
     Mr. JOHNSON: I want to say I think it is a very bad case--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [interposing]: Has the Senator voted?
     Mr. JOHNSON: Yes, sir.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Then you are out of order.
     The result of the vote was announced as above; so the decision of the Chair stands as the
      judgment of the Senate.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore; Wait a moment. The report is still before the Senate. The chair
      desires to ask the minority what shall be done with it?
     Mr. CAMPBELL: I move it be spread upon the journals of the Senate.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Is that taken by consent?
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I desire to amend that; and that it now be discussed for one
      hour. I want that as an amendment to Mr. Campbell's motion.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The report of the minority in the election contest between
      Branaman and McDonald will be spread upon the record.
    
    
     WEEKLY PAY OF EMPLOYES
     The bill [S.2] to require companies to pay their employes at least once a week, was read the
      third time.
     Mr. JOHNSON: When I first hear the bill read I was favorably inclined to it, but I am
      convinced the bill, although apparently in the interests of labor, is really in antagonism to
      it. I have lived in a manufacturing town for the past ten years and have talked with men who
      have been in the shops for twenty years, and from the information I have obtained I don't
      believe there is a necessity for the passage of this bill, especially that part which seeks to
      take away from men the right to contract as to the time when they shall be paid. I don't
      want to see a law passed upon any subject unless it is first demonstrated that there is a
      wrong to be remedied by it. I believe this character of legislation will necessarily result
      disastrously to the business interests of this State. Is there a man on the floor of this
      Senate who ever heard of a railroad corporation paying at the end of every two weeks? If there
      is a class of corporations that promptly pay their laborers it is railroad corporations at the
      end of each month.--Will you compel such corporations to make up their large pay roll and
      their pay car trip twice every month or adopt a system to make shorter payments? There is no
      necessity for a law of this kind. Let us see whether this bill will affect labor: Rich
      individuals engaged in business have money, and it would be no hardship to them were they
      compelled to pay every two weeks--they are doing it now. It will not impair their trade; not
      having to borrow money they would not be inconvenienced by the passage of such a law. But
      laboring men are ambitious, and inspired with emulation to better their condition in life, yet
      they will not embark in manufacturing in a small way if compelled to pay their worksmen every
      two weeks. All over this State men of moderate means are engaged in the different channels of
      trade, and to compel that class of men to pay wages to their help every two weeks would be
      throwing upon them extraordinary hardships. I know men unable to pay their hands every two
      weeks and unable to borrow money.  These men are in the
      habit of contracting for the erection of houses, and work on them sometimes three months
      before they obtain one dime or one dollar in money; but hands are satisfied to work for them.
      When the time comes that the structure is completed the owner of the property pays them their
      money and they pay their hands. Can they stand a statutory enactment like this? What
      capitalist is going to loan money to such contractors on a building where under the law the
      laborers on it have a prior lien, and where they would have to keep a constant 
       espionage
       espoinage
       to see whether the hands employed on it are paid or not? A man of moderate means is
      unable to pay his workmen every two weeks, and if required by law to do so would be compelled
      to stop his establishment and the laboring men would be thrown out of employment. The result
      is that the rich capitalist who can pay every two weeks would flourish while the poor
      manufacturer, unable to pay his workmen every two weeks, cannot carry on his business and he
      goes down, and the laboring men that would otherwise be employed go down with him. This bill
      would be hard on the poor manufacturer and hard on the common laborer. The bill is predicated
      upon a wrong theory and I am opposed to it..
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I desire to say, as far as the principle involved in this
      bill is concerned, as a general thing I can heartily endorse it, but Section 3 is too
      favorable to the operator. We have a bill now in the Senate introduced by Mr. Jewett, of the
      House, which was considered by a committee and passed the House, and which I think we can all
      heartily support; therefore I make the following motion in regard to the pending bill: I move
      that Senate Bill No. 2 be referred to a special committee of one with instructions to report
       House Bill No. 14 as a substitute therefore.
     Mr. BAILEY: Senate Bill No. 2 is one of the best bills ever introduced in this Senate or any
      other for the purpose of protecting employes against employers. It is water-tight and so
      thoroughly considered that there is no point of weakness about it. It was considered a long
      time, and ably so, not only in a committee but by this Senate section by section, and amended
      in several particulars until I think we have now a bill that ought to pass unanimously. The
      only provision assailed is the one requiring the payment of wages every two weeks, and the
      bill provides that there shall be a delay of ten days before suit shall be commenced. As far
      as that is concerned, I take it, this bill will only be resorted to in cases of emergency. If
      there be a system, conducted safe to employes, there will be no objection to that system; it
      will by commnon consent prevail in the transaction of business, as far as the payment of wages
      is concerned. House Bill No. 14 is in no particular
      germane to the bill under consideration as to the provision of wages every two weeks. That
      bill simply prohibits the payment of wages in scrip. I believe the motion is out of order
      because it seeks to substitute a bill on an entirely different subject. I make that point of
      order.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The point of order is overruled.
     Mr. BARRETT: The Senator from Wayne (Mr. Johnson) says he has consulted with half a dozen
      laboring men in the city of Richmond and learned from them that the laboring men of this
      country are not demanding any such legislation. It is not my pleasure to know who these half
      dozen laboring men are; it may be they are laborers in the same field of industry with the
      Senator from Wayne. If the Senator from Wayne will take the time to read the first plank in
      the platform of organized labor, which represents one million of laboring men in this country,
      he will find it demands that there shall be enacted legislation requiring corporations to pay
      their employes at least once in two weeks, and that same platform demands what I think is
      right, that the laboring man shall have the first lien for their labor.-- The Senator from
      Wayne objected to the passage of this bill in the inter 
      est of laboring men. Perhaps the Senator from Wayne will acquiesce in the proposed amendment
      because House Bill 14 does not apply to railroads. I do
      not know whether these gentlemen are representing railroads or not; but from their action I
      take it they have no unfriendly feeling towards railroads, and I recognize that at least
      one-half of laboring men are in one way or another employed by the great railroad companies. I
      can see no reason why railroad companies should not be compelled to pay their employes in the
      same space of time as any corporation or individual. It is said they would be compelled to run
      their pay-car oftener, and it would be so much more expense. I think instead of running the
      director's car twice a month it would be better to send out the pay-car; there is no
      justice in claiming it is more expensive than that. It safe to infer that their profits will
      justify this additional expense.
     Mr. WINTER: I desire to vote for this bill and get it in as good shape as I can. I notice
      that some of the amendments ordered to the bill on the second reading have been omitted and
      others are not correctly engrossed. [He pointed out such errors and omissions.] A provision
      should be added by which a lien given under this bill should be enforced within six months. I
      offer the following motion: [To refer to a committee of three with instructions to amend.]
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I don't think gentlemen should go so far as indicated.
      The objection made to the bill by me was to the third section; I heartily endorse nearly all
      the rest of the bill. I have tried to induce the chairman of the Labor
       Committee to see that the third section is for the benefit of the operator and
      against every other person. The man who furnished the brick and the man who carried the hod
      would be absolutely defrauded out of his labor. If you desire to give all laborers an equal
      show you will pass House Bill 14 or amend this one.
     Mr. BAILEY: The point that these suits must be brought within six months was under
      discussion before the bill was engrossed, and that was defeated; and unless the Senator from
      Marion (Mr. Winter) will leave out that part I will make a motion to amend by striking that
      out.
     Mr. WINTER: This bill imposes an extraordinary penalty for not paying every two weeks. Six
      months is a liberal allowance in view of the extraordinary remedy afforded.
     The motion (Mr. Winter's) was adopted, and the amendment as amended was agreed to. The
      Chair appointed Messrs. Winter, Bailey and Barrett said committee.
     The Senate adjourned.

     On motion by Mr. ROBERTS, the reading of the Clerk's minutes was dispensed with (as
      ussual) except the portion relating to the proceedings of the joint convention of
      yesterday.
     Mr. KELLISON moved to correct the journal, so as to make it appear that on the sixteenth
      ballot for United States Senator, Jason H. Allen received 3 votes, Benjamin Harrison 71 votes
      and David Turpie 76 votes; that Representatives Cates, Glover and Mackey had subsequently
      changed their votes, over the protest of Representative Jewett and also that the President pro
      tempore of the Senate announced the election of David Turpie.
     Mr. JEWETT: The journal states that the Speaker declared nobody was elected; it also states
      that President Smith announced that David Turpie had received 76 votes and Benjamin Harrison
      had received 74 votes. I think that the record ought to state also that President Smith of the
      Senate declared Turpie elected.
     The amendment was rejected.
     Mr. JEWETT moved to amend the journal as follows:
     
     Mr. Speaker--I move to amend the House journal of February 2, 1887, by inserting after the
      statement that 'Hon. A. G. Smith, President of the Senate, announced that David Turpie
      had received seventy-six votes and Benjamin Harrison seventy-four votes," the following:
      "And thereupon Hon. A. G. Smith, President of the Senate, declared that David Turpie had
      received a majority of all the votes cast in the joint convention for United States Senator,
      and was duly elected a Senator in the Congress of the United States from the State of
      Indiana."
     Mr. GARDINER: If that declaration had been made by the President of the Senate, there would
      be no objection on this side of the House to its insertion in the journal; but as far as I can
      find no one on this side of the House, at least, remember of any such declaration being
      made.
     Mr. JEWETT: I know that we could not hear what he said, but we know he said something. I am
      sure that the announcement was made and I move that the correction be made in the journal. I
      think it ought to be placed in the journal.
     Mr. GORDON: I hope the House will adopt that because the journal comes so nearly the exact
      truth that it ought to be amended to make it speak the whole truth. I am glad the clerks did
      see to it that the journal was so near correct. This ought to be done and I think it will make
      the journal tell the entire truth.
     Mr. HARRELL: I do not see why the majority on the other side of this House object to that
      measure. I have heard numerous persons say President Smith did make that declaration, and I
      know that I did hear the Speaker of the House say something, at that time; just what it was I
      cannot tell on account of the noise and confusion. I am of the opinion that that was said,
      from what I heard and what I have heard said.
     The SPEAKER: If you will allow, the chair will state that the present incumbent of the chair
      was quite near Mr. Smith, or President Smith, when this occurred and he has it distinct
      recollection of the Secretary of the Senate, Mr. Dixon, standing here and telling something to
      the President of the Senate, and if he said anything after that that was understood Mr. Smith
      only understood it, and what it was I do not know.
     Mr. HARREELL: Maybe the Speaker was excited. [Laughter]
     The SPEAKER: I may have been somewhat excited; at least I was somewhat interested.
     Mr. LINCK: It seems to me that it would not be proper to put this on the record, if Mr.
      Smith did say it; I think he had no right to say it, for he was not the presiding officer of
      the joint convention. By courtesy he was allowed to sit in the Speaker's stand. He was
      allowed, when the roll of the Senate was called, to announce that vote, but he was not allowed
      to announce who was elected. The Speaker of the House was the presiding officer of the
      convention and was the only one that could announce who was or was not elected.
     Mr. GOUGH: I desire that the record should speak the truth, but not having heard it, and
      gentlemen standing near the Senator from Jennings (the President pro tempore of the Senate)
      not having heard him make an such declaration, I do not think any thing like that should be
      inserted the records.
     Mr. PATTON: I was watching everything very closely and saw the set-to between the Speaker
      and the giant. I heard the Speaker very distinctly, in reference to announcing the House vote,
      but not what the Speaker said about the time that he attempted to declare David Turpie
      elected. The Speaker was facing him and greatly excited at the time; there was a great deal of
      noise on the floor of the House, and the Chairman shook his gavel at him in this manner
      [showing how it was done] and then he turned away and announced the ballot and declared David
      Turpie duly elected. This is my recollection of it. Of course I am liable to be mistaken.
     Mr. ACKMAN: It occurs to me that the hearing of the gentlemen on the west side of this floor
      was extremely good yesterday. I know that I heard no such statement. More than that, I heard a
      number of persons who were nearer to Senator Smith than I, say he did not make  the statement; they say, if Mr. Smith did so state it was not heard
      by them.
     Mr. PATTON: He is casting a reflection on gentlemen on this side of the House.
     Mr. ACKMAN: I do not think I need to cast any reflection on them; I think the facts speak
      for themselves.
     Mr. CONDER: I was standing here very attentive; I did not think that my nervous system was
      excited as much as the gentlemen on the other side of the House. The proceedings had quieted
      my nerves. I watched the President of the Senate. He announced the vote: 76 for Mr. Turpie and
      74 for Mr. Harrison, and I heard nothing further, and I was very much surprised that he did
      not announce the election of Mr. Turpie.--I did not halloo, or anything of that kind, it was
      not my hallooing time; and I am satisfied that the statement was not made.
     Mr. PARKER: The only difference between men on the east side and those of the west side was,
      that we upon the west side had our hearing strained to catch the welcome words as they fell
      from the lips of the Senator.
     Mr. STUBBLEFIELD: I think I occupied a position as near the Speaker's stand as almost
      any man in the House, and I think I was probably as much interested; and I distinctly
      understood the legal presiding officer of the convention, at that stage of the game, say there
      was no election.--That joint convention yesterday adjourned to meet to-day, and if there is
      any disagreement the misunderstanding can be corrected then.
     Mr. ROBERTS: I do not think it amounts to anything whether Mr. Smith or the Speaker of the
      House announced the vote. It is the record which shows the result, and I care not if there was
      not a word heard, either from the Speaker of this House or the presiding officer of the
      Senate. As to the result of the vote recorded the journal shows that David Turpie received a
      majority of all the votes cast, that constitutes the declaration of his election. It completes
      the whole form. I must say, as a matter of fact, that I am surprised to hear my friends over
      the way say that Turpie had received a majority of all the votes cast. I cannot be mistaken. I
      sat near, where I could listen and see, and I cannot be mistaken.--I care not whether the
      announcement was made or not, the records will show the result, and the world cannot change
      the result.
     Mr. PLEASANTS: It seems to me strange that they said he had no right to do it; and if he had
      no right do it, why did they not raise their objections every day? No objections were raised
      on any of the previous ballots; and even if not in the agreement, it was the practice and had
      passed into a custom.
     Mr. PIERCE: I think it is a duty I owe, not only to myself but to my constituents, that when
      I know a thing in their behalf it is my duty to state it. I occupy seat number eighty-one--it
      is on one of the back rows. I want to say that I was listening, giving my attention to what
      the President said when he announced the vote of the joint convention, and I want to say that
      I heard Mr. Smith say that David Turpie has received 76 votes and that he declared him elected
      Senator of the United States. I heard that from my seat here. The gentlemen on the other side
      of the House say they did not hear it. Let me say to you, you may not have heard it, but when
      a man says he heard a thing and another says he did not hear it, the positive evidence
      outweighs the negative evidence. I would rather see the United States Senatorship go where the
      woodbine twineth;--I would suffer my right arm to be severed from my side before I would state
      that which I believed was not true.
     Mr. GARDINER: I think the proposition laid down by the gentleman is not applicable to the
      case under consideration. These gentlemen sat as close as the gentlemen on the other side and
      were paying strict attention to what the Speaker said. The testimony of the Speaker himself, the gentleman who was dividing the honor of the presiding
      officer with him and whose attention seems to have been closely given to the performance, is
      that while he did declare that the Hon. David Turpie had received 76 votes, that at that time
      nothing more was heard. Now, it seems to me that the preponderence of evidence is that he said
      nothing more, and therefore we cannot well permit the journal of the House to say that.
     The motion to amend the journal of the joint convention was rejected by yeas 44, nays
      55.
     The journal as read was then approved.
    
    
     COUNTY COMMISSIONERS.
     The committee returned a substitute for Mr. Roberts' bill [H.R. 168] to provide that
      each county shall be divided into three districts--not subject to alteration oftener than
      every six years.
     Mr. ROBINSON: The law as it now exists provides that districts shall not be changed oftener
      than once in three years. This bill provides that they shall not be changed oftener than once
      in six years. The change is one I regard as of the utmost importance to the people of every
      county in the State. I think if the bill becomes a law it will work salutary reforms. The
      second change in the law which this bill proposes to make is that the County Commissioners,
      which are commonly styled the county board, shall be elected by a separate vote of the
      electors of each district. I am frank to say that I believe if this bill becomes a law it will
      result in mixed boards in perhaps sixty-five or seventy or more counties of the State. If
      there is any body of men who are to protect the people that should be non partizan, it is the
      Boards of County Commissioners of the State. Hence I believe it would be to the advantage of
      the people of the State if they had mixed boards; I believe it would work a healthy influence.
      There is another reason why I think this bill should become a law. I have yet to find a county
      in the State of Indiana where the people are not complaining of what is called Court-house
      Rings. I find the same complaint in the States of Ohio, Illinois and Kentucky. This bill, if
      it becomes a law, throws a responsibility on the people of each commissioner's district
      to select a man to suit themselves. Another thing, I have seen in my own county and have
      noticed in other counties of the State a combination of say two commissioners nominate a man
      against the will of the people. This bill will give to the people of each district the
      responsibility of choosing a man that will suit them. I believe that this bill if it becomes a
      law will remedy these evils to which I have referred. The Committee on County and
       Township Business have unanimously recommended its passage, and I am confident that
      the gentlemen have considered it carefully.
     Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Owen: I am opposed to this bill. I think it will amount to a gerrymander
      of nearly all the counties in the State of Indiana. You will find that where there is a
      majority of Democrats they will divide the districts so that they will have Democratic
      commissioners, and in Republican counties the Republicans will do the same thing.
     Mr. BUCKLES: By the terms of this bill the voters of a commissioner's district have
      thte right to elect their own man. Now a County Commissioner is essentially a county officer,
      elected for the purpose of voting upon all county matters. I am unwilling to have a man in my
      county for commissioner unless he is voted for by all the people. I think that we might as
      well district our counties so that one should elect a clerk, another an auditor, another a
      treasurer, &c.
     Mr. GOUGH: I trust that the report of this committee will be 
       concurred
       concurrsd
       in. I think there can be nothing more conducive to the interests of the county than
      that the county should be so divided into districts and each should have a man to represent it
      on the county board,--in the county legislature, as it were. At the proper time I will offer
      this amend- ment: To provide that the districts shall be
      as nearly as possible of the same population. The first district shall consist of the most
      northern counties, &c. I think this is a proper amendment, because we want no gerrymander
      of the counties. The proposition is to give the party in power in at district a representation
      on the board, and if it is not divided in that way a Democratic county will always be divided
      so that it will have Democratic commissioners and Republicans will do the same.

     Mr. FOSTER: It is impossible to hedge this thing in so that you can make it unobjectionable.
      You cannot fix it up unless you adopt the whole civil-service bill discussed the other day. I
      would like to know what is meant by a mixed board. Talk about mixing up Republicans and
      Democrats; you cannot do it. Oil and water will not mix. You cannot mix them any more than you
      can mix a woman and a secret. I am glad that the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Buckles) spoke
      on the question. His county lies next to mine and gives a great Republican majority, and my
      county gives a Democratic majority. I am satisfied that the gentleman finds, as I do, that the
      affairs of the county are carried on better without a mixed board, for there is no bickering;
      they go on with the business without anything of that kind. The gentleman has well said that
      it will result in a kind of gerrymandering. I think it would so result. There is now no
      temptation for gerrymandering, because they are elected, as I said, by all the voters. The
      Board of Commissioners is a quasi judicial board. We might as well say that the different
      Supreme Judges of the State should be elected by separate districts instead of by the State.
      They make laws for all the people of the State. I hope the report of the committee will be
      voted down.
     On motion by Mr. KELLEY, of Boone, the report of the committee was laid on the table by yeas
      51, nays 46.
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. GARRISON, when his name was called, said: I shall cast my vote for the motion to lay
      this report on the table, for the following reasons: The county which I have the honor to
      represent is Democratic by about three hundred and fifty majority. That majority is in the
      three townships. The majority in two of these townships is overcome by the Republican
      majority. My county could not be divided without making two of these Republican. The
      Democratic county by three hundred and fifty majority would be presided over by a Republican
      board, therefore I vote "no."
     The vote was then announced as above--so the substitute for the bill was laid on the
      table.
     The SPEAKER: Further business of the House will be suspended until the business of the joint
      convention be disposed of. [The Doorkeeper announced the Senate.] Admit the Senators. There
      being no Secretary of the Senate present, the Clerk of the House will call the roll of the
      Senate--call. [It discovered Senators Campbell, Davis, DeMotte, Drake, Ensley, Huston, Macy,
      Marshall, Moon and Winter present and answering to their names.] The Clerk of the House will
      call the roll of the House. [It discovered fifty-six Representatives as present and answering
      to their names.]--Call the roll of the absentees. [As the Clerk called each name:] The
      Representative is present but does not answer. Mark him as present.--Call the next. [When the
      call was concluded.] There are 100 members present; fifty-six have answered, forty-four have
      refused to answer. The joint convention is now open for business.
     On motion by Mr. GORDON, the reading of the journal of the joint convention was dispensed
      with.
     Mr. GARDINER: I move the adoption of the following resolution:
     
     
      
       
        Whereas, At the joint convention of the Senate and House of Representatives of the
         General Assembly of this State, held in this Hall yesterday, February 2, 1887, it was
         declared by the Hon. Alonzo G. Smith, a member of the Senate of said General Assembly, that
         Hon. David Turpie had received a majority of all the votes cast in said convention for a
         Senator in the Congress of the United States; and,
        Whereas, It was declared by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, presiding at
         said joint convention, that there had been no legal election of a United States Senator:
         and
        Whereas, It is believed that there were enough illegal votes cast for said Hon. David
         Turpie, at said election in said joint convention, to overcome the apparent majority of
         votes cast for him, and, therefore, that the said election was illegal; therefore,
        Resolved, That a committee of five be appointed by the Chairman to prepare the proper and
         necessary proceedings to present to the Senate of the United States the facts showing such
         illegal votes, to the end that an investigation into the declared election of said Hon.
         David Turpie to that honorable body may be had; and
        Resolved, That this convention recommend to the House of Representatives of this General
         Assembly that an investigation of alleged illegal voting at said joint convention, held on
         the 2d inst., be instituted promptly and thoroughly prosecuted, with a view of ascertaining
         whether such illegal votes were or were not cast.
       
      
     
     The resolution was adopted, and the Speaker appointed as the committee, Senators Winter and
      Huston, and Representatives Gardiner, Linck and Griffiths.
     The Joint Convention adjourned.
     The House took a recess for dinner.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     NOXIOUS WEEDS ON RAILROAD TRACKS.
     The bill [H. R. 65] for the destruction of noxious weeds on railroad tracks, coming up--
     Mr. HARRELL: This is a good bill, I think. It makes the railroad companies mow the weeds,
      thistles, docks, etc.
     Mr. PATTON: This is a useless bill; I see the drift of that kind of legislation. The
      railroads are taking care of their lands and tracks a good deal better than the farmers
      are.--There is a statute that compels them to fence their road in; and this bill seeks to
      control their premises. This idea of legislating against Canada thistles is a thing that has
      occupied the minds of the people of the northern part of the State ever since we had a
      Constitution. I would like to stop this kind of legislation; it is useless, it is
      unnecessary.
     Mr. KELLISON: I see no necessity for this legislation; on the contrary, I believe that the
      law now is better than the proposed law. Railroad companies, like other artificial persons,
      have some rights. If it is thought necessary by or through this bill to include any other
      weeds besides Canada thistles, let the act of 1885 be amended.
     Mr. GARRISON: The present law only applies to Canada thistles, and there are other weeds
      growing that are considered noxious. The author of this bill was before the
       Agricultural Committee, and is also a member of it, and he thought it
      better to have a special law relating to railroads.
     Mr. METZGER: The object of this bill is simply this: The railroads pass through our farms
      and they don't mow the sides of their tracks, and this is to make it their duty to do
      that. The object of the author of this bill was to make a special one to give that redress
      that is due to us. In the State of Michigan they have a law just like this, and up to the
      State line their tracks are clean and decent, but when you get this side of the line the weeds
      are as high as your head.
     Mr. BUCKLES: I am not the author of that bill, nor will its provisions, if it is passed,
      affect me very materially. I do believe that there is a demand for it and that that demand
      should be responded to by this House.
     Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Owen: I am in favor of this bill. I think it is a measure that is needed,
      I know it is in my part of the State, and I believe that it is all over the State.
     The bill was ordered engrossed.
    
    
     BRIBERY OF MEMBERS.
     Mr. COVERT offered the following:
     
      
       
        Whereas, It has been openly charged in the public print in the city of Indianapolis, that
         attempts have been made to bribe members of this General Assembly to influence their votes
         for United States Senator from Indiana, in the
         Congress of the United States; therefore,
        Resolved, That the Speaker of the House of Representatives, be instructed to appoint a
         committee of five, whose duty it shall be to investigate said charges, and that said
         committee be empowered to send for persons and papers and that said committee report the
         result of their investigations to this House at the earliest practicable day.
        It was adopted.
       
      
     
    
    
     STATE TREASURY INVESTIGATION.
     The Speaker announced the Treasury Investigating Committee: Messrs. Linck, Griffiths,
      Leighty, Jewett and Major; authorized on page 304.
    
    
     TOLL OF GRIST MILLS.
     The bill [H. R. 85] to regulate the toll of grist mills, coming up--
     Mr. PATTON: In 1853 the Legislature attempted to regulate the toll of water mills; and I
      believe that provided for perhaps one-eighth. The law has never been put into operation simply
      because it was a piece of legislation that nobody attempted to enforce. This is more of that
      kind of special legislation that attempts to control men's affairs. In those days water
      mills were very cheap concerns; two or three hundred dollars would construct one on a small
      stream; but you take and pass this bill to-day, and what do you do?--Why, all the tolling of
      grain goes out of existence; you make a merchant's mill, and the farmer has to go and
      sell his grain. You can't control the toll of these millers. If a man is cut down to-day
      to one-eighth, he can't grind for that; it is an utter impossibility. Go on with this
      kind of legislation and see where you will end.--You take charge of all the industries by
      legislation and you will wind them up. If corn was twenty cents a bushel it"would pay
      one-eighth, and if it was one dollar it would pay one-eighth. It costs just as much to grind a
      bushel of corm at twenty cents as at one dollar. It would be a hardship upon our custom mills,
      which are for the convenience of the community. They can't afford to grind for
      one-eighth, as they did in those days when they had water mills. It will compel them to swap.
      They will simply not be controlled by this law; you may pass the law but you can't
      enforce it.
     Mr. GARRISON: I find that ever since 1853 we have had a law upon the statute books that has
      controlled or tried to control the toll that could be taken by millers. I find that in the
      neighboring State of Ohio they have a more stringent law upon their statute books than we have
      upon ours. I suppose they have the same class of machinery there that we have here. I find
      upon their statute books a law that says that no miller shall charge a greater rate of toll
      than one-eighth except mills grinding where horses are used for power, and there they can
      charge one-sixth. I am not a constitutional lawyer, and will not attempt to stand upon this
      floor and address gentlemen upon a question of constitutional law, but I have heard it said by
      gentlemen learned in the law that it has a right under the Constitution when persons put their
      money into property that is devoted to public use where they may use it to the injury of the
      public that that public has the right to limit them in the use of that property so that it may
      not become an abuse to the public. Millers have placed their property in such a shape that it
      is entirely devoted to the public use, therefore the public has a right to regulate its use. I
      believe it has become a necessity either to abandon entirely the toll laws upon the statute
      books or extend them so as to meet the present exigencies. I do not believe it is possible now
      for a man to go to a roller mill and get his grist ground and get it from his own grain. In my
      county and in the adjoining counties that I have heard from, there is a great complaint about
      the farmers not being fairly dealt with at the mill. I have been requested to introduce a bill
      something like this. I believe that if it was formerly right that the toll be fixed by law, it
      is still right.
     Mr. GOUGH: I do not think that such a measure as this ought to be passed, until we recognize
      the right of the State to run every branch of business. There have been doubts expressed as to
      the right of the Legis- lature to pass such a law. Here
      is a law passed in 1853 to regulate water mills, and that right, I take it, was based upon the
      State's right of eminent domain. I think there can be no question that a law of this kind
      would be unconstitutional. If the Legislature has a right to regulate the charges that a steam
      mill may make, then it has a right to regulate the price that a tavern keeper shall charge,
      etc. I think there is nobody upon this floor that will claim that the Legislature has any such
      right as that.
     On motion by Mr. PATTON, the bill was indefinitely postponed.
    
    
     FOOD AND DAIRY COMMISSIONERS.
     The bill [H. R. 152] to create a Food and Dairy Commission, coming up--
     Mr. BEASLEY: I do not believe that the people of this State would want this. There is a bill
      pending to create a civil-service reform commission, another to create a live-stock sanitary
      commission and here a food and dairy commission. They have salaries of $1,500 and a deputy at
      $1,000. I believe it is unnecessary.
     Mr. METZGER: I am the author of that bill and I will give my reasons for it. In the first
      place, everything that the farmer sells is pure; everything that he buys is adulterated.--We
      have plenty of laws on the subject of adulteration but we have no means of enforcing them.
      They have a law just like this in Ohio and it is giving satisfaction. As to the expense to the
      State, the fines more than pays the commissioners. This bill, if passed, will give more relief
      to the farmers than anything else that you can pass this session.
     Mr. REYNOLDS: I am with the gentleman from Vigo (Mr. Beasley) on this question. I think that
      this Legislature wants to call a halt with regard to the appointment of State commissioners.
      If I understand it correctly, this commission is to come into every kitchen in Indiana. In my
      judgment this is a matter that can't be reached by the means afforded by this bill. It is
      simply impossible for any one man or a dozen men in Indiana to undertake a fatherly
      supervision of the food that we eat, whether it be over the butter or beef-steak or the water
      we drink, and we are undertaking to do that which is impossible and somewhat
      anti-republican.
     Mr. IBACH: Section five is unconstitutional beyond any question.--The Constitution provides
      where fines shall go. I regret that this section is in this act because I believe in the
      provisions of it.
     On motion by Mr. BEASLEY, the bill was indefinitely postponed--yeas 64, nays 22.
     The House adjourned.
    
   
   
   
    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    IN SENATE.
    
     FRIDAY, February 4, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Rev. Mr. Baltzey, of the Lutheran Church.
    
     SOLDIERS' ORPHANS' HOME.
     The committee appointed to examine the title of the Soldiers' Orphans' Home
      reported it to be perfect, and that the building contracts were in proper form.
     The bill [S. 6] to amend the act establishing the
      Soldiers' and Sailors' Orphans' Home was taken up, when Mr. Barrett withdrew
      his substitute locating the home at Fort Wayne.
     Mr. HOWARD, of St. Joseph, moved to strike out Section 22, referring to the binding out of
      the children.--He thought the provision a dangerous one, as it might bring great suffering on
      the orphans. The State should educate them until they are able to make their own living.
     Mr. DEMOTTE heartily seconded the amendment, and said that in many cases
      the child so bound out would be little better than a servant.
     Mr. FOWLER: I favor the motion to strike out. I don't believe such discretionary power
      ought to be left with any one. I think it goes for naught that this bill is prepared by the
      Grand Army of the Republic. It is not infallible.
     Mr. SMITH, of Wells: I am heartily in favor of the amendment. I am satisfied that, on second
      thought, nobody, would desire this section to remain in the bill. If this section is not
      stricken out I believe the bill ought to be defeated.
     Mr. JOHNSON: I understand this bill was drawn after consultation with the Grand Army of the
      Republic. The committee not only consulted together, but with the Grand Army men, and every
      section has been carefully scanned. Since this bill has been drawn it has been submitted to
      various posts, and the soldiers of Indian have almost unanimously recommended its passage in
      its present shape; and I think if it can pass their scrutiny, it can safely pass this body as
      presented. There has been such a thing where the binding out of a child has resulted
      disastrously, but there are good farmers who desire to take soldiers' orphans and give
      them the advantages of a liberal education; and to deny the trustees the power to make such an
      arrangement, in some 
       instances
       instancss
      , would be a great hardship. I think there are instances in which gentlemen of great
      generosity could be safely entrusted with the care of these orphan children. The section does not require, it simply gives permission, that it may
      be done. In no case would the trustees abuse that power. And it reserves to the trustees power
      to re-call and restore the to the home. It seems to me the circumstances of the case, this
      section should not be stricken out.
     Mr. KENNEDY: I see nothing wrong in this section. As I understand it, these trustees have at
      all times the control of the child, as a guardian. All benefits that accrue are to be for the
      benefit of the child; and by the time the child becomes of age, he will not only have a good
      home and be properly educated, but have something of advantage to start in the world with;
      while at the Soldiers' Home there is no such provision made. It looks like we ought not
      to strike this section out.
     Mr. MCDONALD: To strike out this section would be wrong. There is nothing
      would give some good men in Indiana more pleasure than to have one of the little girls of the
      widow of some true soldier, who sleeps the sleep of death. The trustees are not bound to make
      indentures. We ask nothing but what is right. This is one of the best sections in the bill. I
      ask you to pass this bill, and most every soldier in Indiana is asking it at your hands.
     Mr. DRAKE: This section makes it the duty of the trustees to look after the child until it
      is twenty-one years of age, and at any time the board of trustees may annul the contract and
      return the child to the home; so it is a wise provision. I hope the amendment will not
      prevail.
     Mr. WEIR: I hope the amendment will not prevail. I have received a communication from a post
      commander in Laporte who thinks this is a wise provision. I hope the bill will be passed under
      a suspension of the constitutional rules.
     Mr. HOWARD, of St. Joseph: In many cases indentured boys and girls have suffered severely.
      If this section provided for an examination by a court, it would be less objectionable. It is
      a holy and noble sentiment guard and protect these orphans.
     Mr. HUSTON: I sincerely hope the amendment will not prevail, because this bill has been
      carefully prepared by Grand Army men who as much in sympathy with soldiers' orphans as
      anyone could be; they will be satisfied if we pass this bill. As regards mistreatment, my
      experience has been that they as a rule, find good homes and receive good instruction and make
      good men and women. I don't believe there should be any serious objection to it; and I
      believe a great advantage might accrue to many by it. For instance: one of the orphans might
      intimate a desire to become a mechanic, or learn some trade, and a opportunity might be
      offered him of a home outside, under the direction of the trustees, where, under certain
      conditions, when he arrives at twenty-one years of age he would have a trade, and have the
      influence of a good home thrown around him, which we all know is far preferable to any home
      influence that could be had in any public institution. I feel sure this bill expresses the
      desire and wishes of the soldiers of Indiana, and we should pass it as it is.
     The amendment was rejected.
     On motion by Mr. HARNESS, the word "Union" was appropriately inserted in several
      places in the bill.-- He moved to reduce the salary of Superintendent from $1500 to $1200.
     Mr. WINTER: I hope this amendment will not prevail. I think there ought to be a first class
      man in that position, and $1500 is not too much for a good man.
     Mr. JOHNSON: I, too, protest against this amendment. I do not believe this office should be
      made a sinecure, but at the same time the salary should be such as to command the services of
      a capable man. The duties of the office are onerous and responsible. If we are going to be
      niggardly we had better select some other bill to incorporate such a provision in than a bill
      so important as this.
     
     Mr. FOWLER: I believe the amendment ought to prevail, for the reason that $1200 is a pretty
      good salary. That is one hundred dollars a month, and that is not all the salary connected
      with this office. As I understand it, he gets his board there, he and his family. This
      Legislature has been called upon to reduce salaries. There has been a cry all over the State
      of Indiana that salaries are too high, and we will be called upon to act upon that subject
      before the Legislature adjourns. I insist that his own living and the board of his family and
      $1200 is enough; that will be tantamount to fifteen, sixteen or seventeen hundred or two
      thousand dollars, perhaps, and that is ample and sufficient. I hope the amendment will
      prevail.
     Mr. HUSTON: I sincerely trust this amendment will not prevail. It seems to me it would be
      unwise to make the salary less, especially for the first year, when it requires executive
      skill and ability in putting this institution in good shape. I admit we can get a man for
      $1200, but we can find a much better one at $1500. I think this institution, of all our
      institutions, should be the last one where we attempt to cut down salaries and thereby have a
      lower-priced man in charge of it. I hope the Senate will not vote for this amendment, but will
      let the bill go through as prepared by the Grand Army of the Republic.
     Mr. TRIPPETT: I am opposed to this amendment. If you want a man who is capable you should
      pay him rather more than less than $1500.
     Mr. SMITH, of Wells: I am in favor of this amendment. Democrats should remember that
      Democrats are in favor of a reduction of salaries to a reasonable amount, while on the other
      hand Republicans on this floor are in favor of high salaries. [Mr. Huston and Mr. Johnson
      tried to get the floor.] Twelve hundred dollars is pretty good pay, when farmers have to work
      from early in the day till late at night and keep their families on eighteen dollars a month;
      and, some of them can do this business as well as the men who got twelve dollars a month in
      the army can take care of their comrades' orphans at one hundred dollars a
      month--hundreds of them in Indiana. I say twelve hundred dollars is enough.
     Mr. FRENCH: I am very sorry a political taint has been sought to be cast upon this
      amendment. I think this is a good compromise salary, and I hope the amendment will not
      prevail.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: It seems to me this is rather an important bill, and it is
      rather an unfortunate time to talk about politics. I stand ready to vote a reasonable salary
      to any officer. I think a salary should be given according to the ability and talent
      required.
     Mr. JOHNSON: I desire that Republican Senators be allowed to say this is not a partizan
      bill.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I would ask if a man who was expelled as a Democrat for
      mismanagement of the soldiers' orphans has not been returned as a Democratic member of
      the other House?
     Mr. JOHNSON: I am not aware of it, but I know one Democrat was promptly turned out by a
      Legislature which I understand had a preponderance of Democrats in it. But I deprecate
      politics being brought in the discussion of a bill that every man is interested in.
     Mr. KENNEDY: I feel sorry any amendments to this bill have been presented. This is certainly
      an un-partizan bill. I claim at all times to be in the interest of economy, but the office
      here is an unusual one. It requires a good moral man--a preacher--to serve these children; and
      it requires an educator--a man that scarcely can be found in every nook and corner in the
      country; and when you do find him let him have a reasonable salary. I understand it is
      difficult to find just such a man. It is necessary that these children should have placed over
      them a man of more than ordinary ability. We ought not to get down. Let us pass this
      thing.
     Mr. HARNESS: My purpose in offering this amendment was not a  political one. here is not a man on this floor who will go farther
      to pay good salaries to Union soldiers than I. I am not in favor of having men placed over
      this institution who are not capable and competent to readily transact all the business
      connected with it. I would rather have the services of good and efficient men. It is not that
      I would do aught against the Union soldier. There is no man who has a higher regard for the
      soldier than I have, but I believe there are hundreds of Union soldiers in the State of
      Indiana who would take this superintendency at $1200 a year.
     Mr. WEIR: I hope this amendment will prevail. As suggested, it is not only the salary fixed
      here he gets, but he receives the entire support of his own family, which is as good as $1800.
      There are plenty of men of the best ability who can be obtained for $1200.
     The amendment was rejected by yeas--18, nays--28.
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion, in explanation of his vote, said: Instead of bringing down
      salaries, you are proposing to have salaries raised; I am opposed to it. The benevolent
      institutions have to be carried on by borrowing money, and yet you will pass high salaries for
      the purpose of personal gratification. I don't think there is any politics in this. I
      would favor a lady being made superintendent of this institution if I had the power. I know
      there are thousands of clergymen preaching for one thousand dollars, some for five hundred
      dollars, and some even for three hundred dollars,--learned and eloquent--who would be glad to
      take such a position for twelve hundred dollars, and yet you propose to give a man fifteen
      hundred dollars and keep his family, while we go to New York and borrow money to carry on
      these institutions. I appeal to you to vote in the interests of the State. Your liberality
      appears to bad advantage when you know you have to go to New York to get the money. I vote
      "aye."
     Mr. URMSTON, when his name was called, said: My experience as a trustee of a benevolent
      institution has led me to believe the first thing in selecting a superintendent of such an
      institution is to find a man with the necessary qualifications. It is true there may be some
      willing to take it on account of circumstances at that particular time, but no one who has the
      necessary qualifications can afford to take it and stay there for any length of time for a
      trifling sum. I vote "no."
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the amendment was rejected.
     Mr. DEMOTTE made an ineffectual motion to raise the age at which children
      may be discharged from the institution from sixteen to eighteen.
     On motion by Mr. WEIR, the constitutional restriction was dispensed with by a two-thirds yea
      and nay vote, and the bill pressed to the last reading and passed the Senate by yeas 44, nays
      0.
    
    
     PAY OF EMPLOYEES.
     The bill [S. 2] to require the payment of corporation and company employes every two weeks,
      was read the third time.
     Mr. KENNEDY: It is almost impossible to make a settlement as often as is proposed in this
      bill. It is going too far. I tell you it won't do. We don't want to do the laboring
      men an injury; but the way we are working this thing we are working against the interests of
      laboring men. I asked the question direct: "Would this extra expense not have to fall
      upon the laborer?" "Yes," they said. You can't get men of capital to give
      more than they get in return. We can only go so far. I think it is to the interest of laboring
      men that this bill do not pass.
     Mr. TRIPPETT: It is possible this spokesman was an attorney, employed by the coal dealers of
      this State?
     Mr. KENNEDY: He represent the miners.
     Mr. TRIPPETT: The operators?
     Mr. KENNEDY: Yes, sir; I meant the men who owned the mines.
     Mr. TRIPPETT: That places a somewhat different phase upon it. I am surprised that the Senator from Rush (Mr. Kennedy) was convinced
      by the argument, because he is a contractor and not a farmer, as he sometimes poses on the
      Senate floor. I say this bill is eminently just to those working in the mines. You attempt to
      pass a bill in favor of the employes of a railroad company and here comes the railroad
      corporation and says: "If you do this you will hinder us; it will ruin our
      business." That is always the cry. The operators come here with a lobby, while the
      laboring men are too poor to send a representative to show how they would be affected by the
      bill. I want to say, gentlemen, whenever any man raises his voice against this bill, he is
      raising his voice against the interest of labor in this country, and if he over appears in a
      political field again he will find out--
     Mr. JOHNSON [interrupting]: I object.
     Mr. TRIPPETT: If the club is heavy those wincing under it must bear the blow.
     Mr. SEARS: In the congressional district in which I live there is produced at least ninety
      per cent. of all the coal mined in the State of Indiana. I am not here in the interest of the
      men who operate those mines, at all; nor am I here particularly in the interest of the
      laboring men in those mines, but I believe if anything is to be given either way it should be
      given in the interest of the miners.--Whenever you pass any act in this or the other branch of
      the Legislature that will array labor and capital against each other, that moment you not only
      injure the capitalist but you injure the laboring man, and far more than you injure the
      capitalist. Labor is organized systematically. They have money at their command--the President
      of their National organization, I believe, gets $5,000 a year--and there is nothing that
      prevents laboring men from appearing before this Legislature, or any other, and making their
      statement. Why they are not here I do not know. In the miners' association are some as
      intelligent men as there are in the State of Indiana. In the counties I have the honor to
      represent here, there are some seven or eight hundred miners, and they are organized and well
      posted on any subject, especially a subject that affects their rights and their interests.
      Now, if we undertake to say that employers shall pay their employes every two weeks, what will
      be the result? The men who operate these mines sell their coal on thirty, sixty and ninety
      days time, and they get no returns from their coal up to that time. They must be large
      borrower of money in order to pay their hands once a month, which they do. The margin on coal
      is very small,--there is not to exceed five cents a ton of profit. Now then, if you work a
      hardship upon these operators, you will work a hardship upon the miners. In other words, if
      you throw restrictions around the operators you will reduce the price for mining coal. The
      operators can say to the miners "We have capital; we can live without you, but you
      can't live without us." Consequently, let us do what is fair and right. Take the
      coal men in the block region of Brazil, where they employ a thousand or eighteen hundred men,
      you have no idea of the work necessary to perfect their payroll in order to make monthly
      payments to their employes. I say it would be an impossibility to pay their employes every two
      weeks. Another point: the majority of the miners make from four to five dollars a day, and
      these men have no trouble to get credit at any of the stores in our community for thirty, or
      sixty, or ninety days. They are not here asking this law to be put on our statute book. I am
      as much in favor of laboring men as any Senator upon this floor, and will go as far in my
      feeble efforts to advance their interests; but, Mr. President and Senators, it is not that
      class of miners who come here and ask this kind of legislation. It is another class, that goes
      from mine to mine and have no permanent employment; men who have not sufficient skill to keep
      employment after they get it; they are the men coming here and hounding the Legislature to
      pass such a law, that will work an injury to the
      capitalist and the community at large in this State. I am not here, as I have stated,
      advocating the interest of any corporation in this or any other State. These are the facts in
      the case, and I get my information not only from men engaged in mining, but I get my
      information from my own personal observation; and I regard it as an impossibility for these
      operators to pay their miners every two weeks, consequently I am opposed to the bill.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The bill having been read, not formally but informally, the
      Senate does not desire it read again I suppose.--This to be considered the third reading of
      the bill.
     Mr. HUSTON obtained the floor, but gave way to a recess for dinner.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     Mr HUSTON: It has been intimated on this floor that the Republican party is not the friend
      of the working man. The record of the Republican party stands as part of the history of this
      Nation. Its acts are known of all men, and by its acts I pretend to say it is the greatest
      champion of the laboring man that the world has ever produced. The Republican party needs no
      defence at my hands. I do not stand upon this floor representing any body of capitalists or
      any number of corporations. I do not believe the class of legislation, under the head of which
      comes this bill, is in the interest of laboring man, but I do believe that the laboring men of
      this country need some relief. I believe they know better what relief they need than I do.
      Believing that this bill meets with the demands they make at our hands, is the great reason
      why I give it my support; though I venture the assertion that within two years the laboring
      men will ask either its repeal or its amendment. But I believe laboring men have the right to
      come to this Assembly and ask for themselves, or in behalf of themselves, such legislation as
      they feel they need. This bill in many of its operations will work hardships, but it may have,
      among its many provisions, some that will furnish relief and be of benefit to the laboring
      classes. In the city where I live we have eight or nine large manufacturing concerns. This
      bill may not affect a single one of them. From the laboring men there--from that source comes
      no demand for the enactment of such a law, but from other parts of the State--from the mining
      districts, there seems to be a demand for some protection,--some means of relief for the
      laboring classes. In giving my support to this bill I do in it answer to, as I believe, a
      demand of the honest wage-workers of Indiana. I don't do it to make any party advantage,
      because I do not believe advantage gained by the course of a demagogue ever results in much
      good to any party. But as it has been said on this floor that Republicans would hardly support
      it, I wish to say as a Republican, I am ready and ever willing to answer the demand and meet
      the request of the honest wage-workers of this State.--For these reasons I shall give this
      bill my support.
     Mr. MCDONALD: It gives great pleasure to know that my friend from Fayette
      (Mr. Huston) proposes to favor this bill, but when he intimates that the party he represents
      has been the friend of labor in this country, I must emphatically deny the truth of the claim.
      It is a fact, well known to every man, that the Republican party has ground labor in this
      country to the dust. I appeal to the records of our country to show where that party in
      Congress has legislated in favor of labor since 1861. I speak from the record, Mr. President.
      I had hoped no politics would get into this discussion; I have not brought politics into this
      Senate, and I never will; but when the political glove is thrown down I am ready to take it
      up. I approve of a measure because I think it is just. I believe capital and labor should go
      hand in hand. For the past twenty-five years, the course of legislation in this country has
      been in the interest of monopoly. A privileged class has been fos- tered to the detriment of honest men and the true laboring men of
      this country. I know what I am talking about. The record goes to prove my assertion. The
      laboring men of this country are only asking that which is right and that which is just, and I
      say they should have it; and I am determined they shall have it.
     Mr. TARP: I believe everybody seems to be for this bill. It is important to push this
      legislation, therefore move the previous question if nobody else wants to speak.
     Mr. BARRETT: I believe it is my privilege to close the discussion. I shall not take much of
      the time of the Senate. It is conceded that this bill was introduced and should be passed
      because it is demanded by the wage-workers of this country. I was somewhat surprised at the
      arguments introduced this morning: it was urged that this bill is not the interest of laboring
      men. I believe it was stated by a gentleman who claims to represent a very large mining
      district, that it was the unanimous opinion of the owners of coal mines that this bill ought
      not to pass because it would injure their employes! I am a little surprised that the Senator
      has not suggested to these mine owners that they bring their employes here and let them be
      fairly represented before the Committee on Mines and Mining. Again, it is
      urged that these miners are not able to pay their employes oftener than once a month because
      they sell their products upon thirty, sixty and ninety days time. I confess I do not know any
      manufacturing establishments which do not sell upon time, nor do I understand there is in this
      country a greater monopoly than the coal miners, unless it be the Standard Oil Company. The
      Senator from Vermillion (Mr. Sears) also says that labor is organized and can speak through
      its organization. I know there is an organization of coal operators in the State of
      Pennsylvania, they shortened the out put recently and advanced the price of coal one dollar
      and a half per ton--having discharged their laborers for the simple purpose of putting up the
      price of coal. If there a class of people who do not deserve sympathy, either from the people
      or from voters, it is these very same coal operators. I have not heard a single laboring man
      protesting against the passage of this bill. Every one I have heard speak on the subject says
      it is demanded and does not go as far as it ought to. This measure may clearly be said to be a
      compromise, as they demand payment once a week. This measure has been demanded by the laboring
      men of the country because of the villanous operations of the corporations of the country who
      scalp their employes, and have grown rich by compelling their employe to take his wages from
      their stores. If the employe is paid every two weeks he will be able to buy for cash. I
      confess I am somewhat surprised that portions of this bill should be objected to. If this
      measure is just it ought to receive the support of every good man. Although I introduced it,
      and although if it passes I shall feel proud, yet, if this bill is wrong and will work an
      injury to the laboring man, I, for one, would vote against it. As far as the Republican party
      is concerned, it is not defenceable, in my judgment, because this demand of labor has come
      from the iniquitous measures of that party. There were no gigantic monopolies prior to the
      Republican party, and the history of that party from the day of its birth to the present day,
      has shown it is a friend to monopolies, and gigantic monopolies.
     Mr. HUSTON [interposing]: If we are going to have a general political discussion, and ample
      opportunity is given for reply, it might be all night; but the Senator, in closing this
      debate, is not now discussing the merits of the bill.
     Mr. BARRETT: I would not, personally, object to any such discussion, and would have no fear
      of the results. I am answering an argument as introduced upon this floor, by the Senator
      making this objection.
     Mr. HUSTON: The Senator from Allen (Mr. Barrett), the other, day, made allusion to the
      attitude of the political parties on this question, and
      that gave rise to the remark I made.
     Mr. BARRETT: I did not mention the name of the Republican party. I said the only opposition
      was from members of the minority, and that was the truth. I would not wound the feelings of
      any member and inasmuch as it is objectionable to the Senator from Fayette that the record of
      his party be held up as it ought to be, I will close this debate and ask that the bill be put
      on its passage.
     The bill passed the Senate by yeas 33, nays 13--as follows:
     
      
       
        YEAS. Andrew, Bailey, Barrett, Berry, Branaman, Bryant, DeMotte, Drake, Dresser, Dunon
         (of Tipton,) Ensley, Fowler, French, Griffith, Howard (of Decatur,) Howard (of St. Joseph,)
         Huston, Logsdon, Macy, Marshall, McClure, McDonald, Moon, Shively, Smith (of Wells,)
         Thompson (of Marion,) Tharp, Trippet, Urmston, Winter, Weir, Zimmerman, Mr. President.

        Nays. Cox, Davis, Day, Hale, Harness, Johnson, Kennedy, Mullinix, Peterson, Schroyer,
         Sears, Sellers, Thompson (of Jasper.) 13.
       
      
     
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. DAVIS: I will only say in explanation of my vote, that I have not consulted any of my
      colleagues on the floor of this Senate as to the propriety or as to the policy, from a
      political standpoint, of the vote I shall cast on this measure. I am opposed to this bill on
      principle. As far as I know, at least from the district I represent on this floor, there is no
      call--there is no demand made from the wage-workers of the large manufacturing interests in
      Elkhart county for the passage of this bill. There are five daily newspapers in our county,
      and twice that number of weekly papers, and I do not know how many thousand wage-workers there
      are employed in the large manufacturing establishments in that county; and I know, as far as
      the county I undertake to represent is concerned, there has been no complaint,--there has been
      no demand--organized or individual demand, to my knowledge, for a change in the law regulating
      payment of laborers by employers. On these facts in the case, without consulting with a single
      one of my colleagues as to how they will vote, and believing measures incorporated in this
      bill are likely to introduce confusion and strife where there is peace and satisfaction and
      conformity to law, I am constrained, according to the dictates of my good judgment, to oppose
      this bill. I, therefore, vote "no."
     Mr. DEMOTTE, when his name was called, said: The bill since it was
      introduced has been so changed that the author could not recognize it; and having been so
      changed, I feel that there may be something in it for the benefit of labor; and for fear that
      there may be--but having a doubt there is,--I shall give the benefit of my doubt to labor, and
      vote "aye."
     Mr. DRAKE, in explanation of his vote, said: I have been in favor of some measure of relief
      of this kind, but I must say, as a measure for the relief of the laborers of the State, that
      bill should not have passed as it came from the hands of its father; still, as it has been
      amended, and many objectionable features removed, I am inclined to vote for the bill now. I
      vote "aye."
     Mr. DRESSER: I have not been in the habit of explaining my vote, but this bill is one of
      many in which I take an interest. I endorse every feature that is calculated to ameliorate the
      condition of the working man. There are other features of the bill I do not approve, but
      believing the good features of the bill over-balance the bad features, I vote
      "aye."
     Mr. ENSLEY, when his name was called, in explaining his vote, said: As this, bill was
      originally introduced I was not in favor of its provisions, but since it has been amended
      excluding the farming community from its provisions, and many good provisions placed in the
      bill,--since the changes have been made, I will vote "aye."
     
     Mr. JOHNSON: I desire to explain my vote, and shall endeavor to brief. And I am all the more
      anxious to explain because an effort has been made to place the opponents of this bill in the
      attitude of being the opponents of organized labor. Some of the bill has my approbation,
      because I believe in a mechanic's lien and that the laborer should recover his wages, but
      there are other provisions in this bill which do not meet with my approval. I am opposed to
      that arbitrary measure which strikes at the manufacturer, who is himself a laborer, and which
      compels him to go to law. I am opposed to this bill in the interest of labor, and for the
      reason that I will not go into the dust of demagoguery to meet a party necessity. I think I
      reserve my self-respect when I vote "no."
     Mr. MULLINIX, when his name was called, said: In the discharge of my duty as a member of
      this body I feel that it is a privilege to to cast no vote against the interest of the people.
      I claim to represent on this floor a people that go down into the earth and take its wealth
      out. I also represent honest farmers; and while I represent a large mining interest and want
      to discharge my full duty to them, I, as a man, do not feel that I am called upon,--and I want
      to say to this Senate that I will not sacrifice my manhood in a vote for this bill, as I do
      not believe it is right to pay wages every two weeks when it takes fourteen days to mask the
      pay-roll out. Therefore, I say, I vote "no."
     Mr. SEARS: I, also, wish to explain my vote, but I shall be brief. I have no objection to
      that clause of this bill which gives the laboring man a first lien on all his employer has on
      earth except his wife and children; but it would be a matter of impossibility for the mine
      operators of the great State of Indiana to pay their toilers every two weeks. I feel that I
      would be false to the largest mining district in the State of Indiana, and the largest number
      of miners in any part of the State of Indiana, if I were to stand here in the capacity of a
      Senator and cast my vote for this bill, which I believe would work an injury to the
      wage-workers in the mining districts of this State. I believe time will come when the miners
      of the great commonwealth of Indiana--and it will not be a year from now unless I miss my
      guess--when the miners--I mean the men who go down into the bowels of the earth and bring up
      the black diamonds there--will be petitioning the General Assembly to repeal this law, because
      it will prove an injury to them and to their families. I am opposed to this bill in the
      interest of the wage-workers of the commonwealth of Indiana. I vote "no."
     Mr. SELLERS: I am surprised to hear Senators say they know there are vicious provisions in
      this bill but because it contains some good provisions they will vote for it, when it is just
      as easy to pass a bill from which has been eliminated the vicious provisions and thereby give
      the laboring man a perfect bill. I have two objections to this bill; one is: it should have
      been restricted as to payment every two weeks to day laborers, there being no reason why a man
      who works at piece work should be paid oftener than his contract requires. The other
      objectionable feature is where it gives to the laborer a first lien not only upon that which
      he produces, because he ought to have that, but upon the property used in the business in
      which he is employed as a laborer. The effect of that provision will be to prevent every man
      who is not rich from engaging in manufacturing business in this State, and those already
      engaged in it will be driven out of business because they cannot obtain loans of money with
      which to carry on business.--They have not money to advance for labor and the purchase of
      material without borrowing it, and the manufacturing interest of Indiana will, within two
      years, be in the hands of the immensely wealthy manufactories, and they will in time become
      greater and stronger than railroad monopolies. If these provisions were eliminated from the
      bill I would gladly vote for it, but as they are not, and  it is an easy matter to pass a law with good provisions, leaving out the bad, I vote
      "no."
     Mr. SMITH, of Wells, when his name was called, said: First place yourself in the attitude of
      an employe. I am an employe, not an employer, and the majority in my section of the country
      are wage-workers, consequently I ought to support this bill. Unfortunately many wage-workers
      are so poor their credit will not buy a loaf of bread, therefore their children must go hungry
      unless the workers are paid every two weeks. I believe labor ought to be paid as promptly as
      practicable. Therefore, placing myself in the attitude of an employe, I vote
      "aye."
     Mr. THOMPS0N, of Jasper, in explanation of his vote, said: One-fourth of the wages of school
      teachers are withheld in order to compel them to report to officers, that it may be known the
      schools are properly conducted. This bill would make all such contracts void, and repeal that
      law; and so it would be with lawyers' contracts, and doctors' contracts.--Gentlemen
      come up here and say we must pass a law especially for one class of individuals. That is not
      the policy of this country. I think this bill will help to provoke law suits, and it is to the
      interest of lawyers that men should get into law suits. [A VOICE: "Are
      you a lawyer?"] Yes, I am a lawyer, but at the same time I believe in legislating for the
      entire people. For many reasons I vote "no."
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion: I believe I am the author of the first mechanics lien bill ever
      offered in this Senate, and that was twenty-six years ago. I feel very friendly towards the
      laborer, and desire that he shall reap the fruits of his labor. For a man who depends on the
      labor of his hands to feed his little children, there is nothing so pleasant to me as to help
      him secure his rights. I was going to vote against this bill, but I am now disposed to vote
      for it, though I do so with fear and trembling. Never a man spoke to me on the subject of this
      bill; I have never seen it referred to in the papers; no petitions have come up for it, and
      how is a Senator to understand the workings of this bill? Here I am in the dark, one Senator
      saying this and another saying that. I vote "aye."
     Mr. TRIPPET, when his name was called, said: I saw this bill before it was introduced, and
      have read it carefully since amendment. The general features of the bill are the same now as
      they were before it was amended with this one exception: that weekly payments are changed to
      bi-monthly. I want to say it is simply nonsense for any man to claim that an employer cannot
      pay his men in ten days after they demand their wages. The bill declares wages shall be due in
      two weeks, and gives the employer ten days in which to pay. That is long enough for any man to
      have. If any man cannot pay his employer after demand, for ten days, he ought not to be
      permitted to employ them. I am in favor of the bill. The provisions of this bill are good and
      wholesome, therefore I vote "aye."
     Mr. URMSTON, in explaining his vote, said: When this bill was first introduced I made up my
      mind I could not support it. I am not of the opinion of the Senator who has just taken his
      seat, that there has been little or no change. I consider there has been a radical change, and
      while there are some features that meet my approbation, as was well said by the Senator from
      Jasper (Mr. Thompson) it may change the obligation of some contracts. I fear this bill may do
      that, but having doubts about that will not influence my vote. While, as has been said, this
      bill will meet a great many cases, and will do more good than it will do harm, I shall vote
      "aye."
     After the roll-call was finished--
     Mr. HARNESS said: I desire to change my vote from "aye" to "no."
     Mr. HALE said: I wish my vote recorded "no."
     The result was then announced as above recorded. So the bill passed the Senate.

    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
    
     FRIDAY, February 4, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Rev. A. W. Lamport, of the M. E. Church.
    
     JOINT CONVENTON JOUNAL.
     The reading of the Clerk's minutes was dispensed with (as usual) except the portion
      referring to a join convention on yesterday.
     Mr. KELLISON: I am informed by one of the assistant clerks that the motion I made yesterday
      morning to correct an error is not spread on the journal. I submit that we ought to have that
      motion set out at length on the journal; let the journal show the facts. It seems to me that
      it is proper and right to spread the matter on the journal of the House. Therefore, I move
      that the clerk of this House be instructed to insert at full length in the proper place in the
      journal of yesterday the motion which I made. The journal should set out in full every motion
      made by any member.
     Mr. JEWETT: I quite agree with the gentleman from Marshall (Mr. Kellison) in his conclusion.
      On yesterday the gentleman from Marshall and myself tried to amend the journal. We were trying
      to amend the journal of February 2. It was decided that we could not amend the journal of
      February 2, consequently the journal of February 2 stands approved without this amendment.
      Nothing that is done to-day can change the journal of February 2. The question, for the Chair
      is, shall the journal of yesterday show the facts that occurred here yesterday.--The minute
      clerk told me that he had left out the amendments referred to because they were defeated, and
      without suggestion from anybody.--This was a very dangerous precedent to establish. It is the
      duty of the clerks to record the motions in full, and they have no right to take upon
      themselves the authority to leave out whatever they please.
     Mr. SCOTT: I do not know that this would affect things one way or the other. I do not know
      that I care so much about it, but it seems to me that if
      this is established as a precedent it might lead to great confusion. Th resolution of the
      gentleman from Marsall was not to correct the minutes, it was a substitute for the journal.
      Now, suppose that every gentleman on that side of the House had a substitute for the journal
      of the House, it would lead to interminable confusion. It seems entirely unnecessary, and out
      of the usual form of correcting a journal.
     Mr. HARRELL: It seems to me that this would be nothing more than right, that that paper
      presented by the gentleman from Marshall should be shown on the face of the journal. Every
      lawyer in this House knows that it is important to make the record speak the truth. I
      understood the motion of the gentleman from Marshall (Mr. Kellison) on yesterday was to have a
      correction the record, as made out by him, spread on the journal of yesterday. The minority of
      this House thought the record as made by the clerk was not correct, and it was for the purpose
      of showing what we thought to be the correct proceedings of the joint convention of that day.
      The journal of the House simply shows that the gentleman from Marshall offered such a motion.
      If a member of this House offers a resolution on any subject he will find that resolution
      copied on the journal of the House, as it ought to be. We ask of the gentlemen on the other
      side of the House that this paper which was presented, be spread on the journal of the House.
      It is nothing more than what the law and the Constitution, and right and justice gives the
      minority of this House.
     Mr. GARDINER: If this was a question of former precedence I am inclined to think that the
      motion of the gentleman from Marshall (Mr. Kellison) should prevail; but we are living in a
      progressive age; former precedents are being reversed. A precedent has been recently
      established growing out of the very transaction that is sought to be reached on this motion,
      in which an ineffectual motion was made yesterday in the other branch of this General Assembly
      to substitute a part of the history that the journal of the Senate did not contain. I think
      gentlemen should be consistent. I think they take one position on one side and another on the
      other. I am inclined to hold them to a consistent course.
     Mr. KELLISON: I just want to say one word more, and beg the pardon of the House. The order
      of business at the present time is reading the journal. When that journal was read the House
      refused to read a portion of the journal, but I have stated to the House that in that portion
      of the journal there is a mistake. Now is the time to make this correction and to supply this
      omission. I am not asking the House to undo its action of yesterday, I am only asking that
      this journal shall show that I offered a certain motion to correct the journal, and that that
      motion was denied admission to the journal--it was not set out in full on the journal.
     Mr. GORDON: The gentleman from Daviess (Mr. Gardiner) insists that it is proper to spread
      the motion on the journal, but states as an excuse for not doing it, the action of the Senate
      on yesterday. I was in the Senate a short time, and know the object there was to amend the
      journal in regard to certain matter. The motion was to reject the proposition, and the
      proposition was rejected. It could not then properly go on the record. In this case the motion
      was entertained. If any member will take the journal and look over it he will see whenever a
      resolution is offered that it is entered on the journal. That motion was entertained by the
      Chair, and we think it ought to go on the journal. Unless it go on the journal there can be no
      record of it, and that is the only proper record there is of it.
     Mr. SHAMBAUGH: It seems to me to be a question whether this motion is in order or not. The
      motion is, I understand, to correct the journal that is now under consideration. I will call
      the attention of the Speaker to Section 471, R. S., which provides that when the reading of
      the  journal is to be dispensed with it shall go to a
      committee who shall inspect it. We have no such committee, so the act of dispensing with the
      reading of the journal does not dispense with correcting it.
     Mr. FLEECE: I think the amendment was to be substituted for the journal. If one gentleman
      has a right to offer a substitute for the journal, then every man has the same right, and I
      would like to know the end of this thing. I make that point, and I think the motion ought not
      to be spread on the journal.
     The SPEAKER said that what Mr. Kellison and others sought to affect related only to a matter
      of practice. It was not the custom to make the journal of the House complete by reciting
      verbatum all bills, resolutions and substitutes that were offered, and on which action was
      taken. These papers were filed among the documents of the House. He decided the motion out of
      order.
     Mr. KELLISON entered a protest against this decision of the Chair, which he subsequently
      filed, to-wit:
     
      
       
        Mr. Speaker--I most respectfully protest against the ruling and decision of the Speaker
         of this House, Hon. Warren Grover Sayre, in refusing to entertain and in ruling out of
         order a motion made by myself Friday morning, February 4, 1887, while the order of business
         was the reading, correction and approval of the journal of February 3, 1887, to direct the
         Journal Clerk to make up the journal of the House of February 3, 1887, so that it will show
         that a motion was made by myself on February 3, 1887, to amend and correct that portion of
         the House journal of February 2, 1887, relating to an election of a Senator of the United
         States so that it will read as follows:
        [After the proceedings in joint convention on the last ballot down to the close
         of the House roll-call.]
        "Upon the completion of said call, Messrs. Cates, Glover and Mackey, of the House of
         Representatives, who had voted for Jason H. Allen aforesaid, asked leave to change their
         votes, and thereupon Mr. Jewett, of the House of Representatives, objected and raised the
         point of order that the members named could not lawfully change their votes as announced
         upon the call.
        Thereupon the Speaker of the House ruled that the said objection and point of order was
         not well taken.
        Thereupon Messrs. Cates, Glover and Mackey changed their votes already given upon the
         call from Jason H. Allen, and voted for Benjamin Harrison for United States Senator in the
         Congress of the United States aforesaid, making a total number of votes cast for said
         Harrison as United States Senator in Congress as aforesaid, fifty-six (56.)
        Thereupon the Speaker of the House of Representatives announced the vote of the member of
         the House of Representatives for United States Senator in Congress aforesaid, as
         follows:
        The whole number of votes cast, one hundred (100) of which Benjamin Harrison received
         fifty-six(56)and David Turpie received forty-four (44) for United States Senator in the
         Congress of the United States aforesaid.
        And thereupon the Hon. Alonzo g. Smith, President of the Senate aforesaid, announced the
         vote of the joint convention as follows:
        The whole number of votes cast by the members of this joint convention is one hundred and
         fifty (150), of which David Turpie has received 74 votes and Benjamin Harrison has received
         74 votes; necessary to a choice, 76 votes.
        David Turpie having received a majority of all the votes cast, as presiding officer of
         this joint convention, I declare him duly elected a United States Senator in the Congress
         of the United States from the State of Indiana for the term of six years, commencing March
         4, 1887.
        And it was unanimously agreed that protests might be reduced to writing and entered upon
         the journal of the House at any time.
        Upon motion of Senator Bailey, of Marion, the joint convention then adjourned sine
         die."
        My reasons for making this protest are as follows:
        First. I believe the aforesaid amendment states the fact, and the journal should do
         show.
        Second. The journal of February 3, 1887, does not set forth the proposed amendment and
         correction to the journal of February 2, 1887.
        Third. Because I believe that the ruling of the Speaker, refusing to entertain the motion
         made February 4, 1887, to have the journal of February 3, 1887, supply the omission by
         setting forth at length the proposed amendment, was and is not sustained by any
         parliamentary authority or rule of this House.

     Mr. JEWETT, also, subsequently filed a protest against the omission of his amendment to the
      journal of Thursday, as follows:
     
      
       
        Mr. Speaker--On the 3rd day of February, 1887, I offered the following motion to amend
         the journal of February 2, 1887, I offered the following motion to amend the journal of
         February 2. 1887:
        "Mr. Speaker--I move to amend the House journal of February 2, 1887, by inserting
         after the statement that "Hon. A. G.Smith, President of the Senate, announced that
         David Turpie had received seventy-six votes and Benjamin Harrison seventy-four votes," the following: "And thereupon Hon. A. G Smith,
         President of the Senate, declared that David Turpie had received a majority of all the
         votes cast in the joint convention for United States Senator, and was duly elected a
         Senator in the Congress of the United States from the State of Indiana."
        This amendment was defeated. In making up the journal of yesterday the Clerk has entirely
         omitted this proposed amendment.
        By virtue of the Constitution of this State, as a member of this House, I rotest against
         this unwarranted and illegal omission, and ask that my protest be spread upon the journal
         of this House.
        C. L. JEWETT,
         Representative from Floyd county.
       
      
     
    
    
     RAILROAD FREIGHT CHARGES.
     The bill [H. R. 230] to regulate the transportation of property by railroads, was read the
      third time.
     Mr.HARRELL: I simply desire to state two reasons why I am in favor of this 
       bill
       bili
      . If I understand it, this bill is to require and compel railroad companies to charge
      all persons alike. I think that every farmer, and every man who has dealings with railroads,
      will be glad that such a law was placed on the statute books and thoroughly enforced. I I see
      no reason why these great railroads, these great corporations should be allowed to take
      advantage of the laboring people of the country. I never could see why they should charge more
      for a short haul than for a long one. I think that the people have been imposed on in this
      way, and I hope this bill may pass and become a law in the State of Indiana.
     Mr. IBACH: I am not a corporation lawyer and never received a fee from a railroad company in
      my life, and yet I am opposed to some of the provisions of this bill. I know it is popular to
      go before the people and cry against railroad coporations; I know it tickles the ears of the
      people, but I ask gentlemen on this floor whether it is right, if I have a horse to ship from
      Indianapolis to Cincinnati, that I ought to have that single horse shipped, which would
      require a single car, for the same price that my neighbor has to pay for shipping a carload?
      That is the effect of this bill; it is unjust. I ask you, gentlemen, is that right? I am in
      favor of the principle of the bill, but the bill is unjust and I shall vote against it.
     Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Owen: I am in favor of the principle of the bill. I think the railroads
      are working a hardship on the people and on stock dealers. I would be in favor of a more rigid
      law than this, but I will vote for everything that will relieve the people. I am in favor of
      the bill.
     Mr. PARKER: I think this bill is eminently fair in its provisions.--It costs more to ship
      grain or stock from the city of Tipton to Indianapolis than from points beyond that place. I
      know that this bill has met the approbation of every grain dealer and stock dealer in the city
      of Tipton to whom I have sent this bill. I do not think that the argument or the example
      stated by the gentleman from Huntington (Mr. Ibach) is a fair one. There ought to be some
      restriction upon these corporations.
     Mr. BEASLEY: I do not believe that the construction put on the first section of this bill by
      the gentleman from Huntington and Allen (Mr. Ibach) is a fair one. One person should not be
      compelled to pay a greater rate for the same service than another. The railroad company should
      not favor any one person. I shall vote for the bill.
     Mr. COX, of Miami: I think that the position taken on this bill by the gentleman from
      Huntigton (Mr. Ibach) is not tenable. Of course you all know that Congress recently passed
      what is known as the Inter-State Commerce Bill. While a State has no right to regulate the
      rates outside of the State, the Inter-State Commerce Bill regulates this matter throughout the
      United States. There is one feature of that bill that this bill omits. Under the bill as
      passed by Congress no person can bring a suit in any State court. If the rights of any
      individual are violated he must go to the United States Court. Under this bill, whenever the
      rights of a person are violated, he can go into the circuit court of the county. It seems to
      me that this is a very important measure.
     
     Mr.FOLEY: I have had some experience in these railroad shipments and I am in favor of the
      bill.
     Mr. WORRALL: I live in a town where we have but one railroad. We have three stone quarries
      and they ship from three to ten loads of stone daily. Now they have told me time and time
      again, and the members of the companies came up here and spoke to me about this bill, and told
      me in the name of my constituents to support and vote for this bill. These stone quarries are
      at times prohibited from meeting their contracts for the reason that this one-horse road
      charges them such exorbitant rates that they cannot compete with quarries where there are two
      or more railroads. I can submit figures if it is necessary, but I do not think it is. I wish
      to say to you that the merchants of the whole town met and passed resolutions and forwarded
      them to me asking me to support a bill of this kind. I believe it is to the interest of every
      legislator to support this measure, and if there is anything wrong in it let it be amended or
      changed hereafter.
     Mr. KELLEY, of Boone: I hope this bill will pass for the people will be benefited. I say to
      you that there is not a bill that comes before this House that has in it a better proposition
      for the people than this bill.
     Mr. BRIANT: I believe there is two sides to this question. I believe that there is not a
      farmer on this floor but will admit that the railroad in his county makes his farm worth
      twenty-five to a hundred per cent. more than it was worth before the railroad was put through
      his county. In regard to the short haul and the long haul, let every man take into
      consideration the amount of money expended for repairs, cars, tracks, &c., and then let
      him ask himself whether a railroad company can do the hauling eight or ten miles at the same
      rate that they can one hundred miles. It takes as much time to load a car for four miles as it
      does for a hundred miles. Why do so many railroads become bankrupt? Simply because there has
      not been enough support to keep them up. I contend that we should be very cautious before this
      bill is passed and study it carefully.
     Mr. METZGER: As far as the farmers are concerned I do not believe there is one out of a
      hundred that will endorse this measure. As far as the benefit to the farming community is
      concerned nobody will deny this; but because the railroad enhances the valuation of our
      property is no reason that they can be allowed to rob us. I believe the farmers of the State
      of Indiana will endorse this bill.
     Mr. REYNOLDS: I want to say that I am a friend of railroads. I am of the opinion that
      Indiana would be quite a barren country without her commerce. Understand, while I am in favor
      of railroads, I am in favor of this bill also. I think this bill attempts to regulate a long
      enduring abuse. My friend from Huntington (Mr. Briant) says that he does not think a railroad
      can afford to handle property in short haul at the same rate as the long haul. It has been
      said that this can be done. Let as try it, anyhow. I am in favor of this bill because it is
      almost identically the same bill that has passed the Congress of the United States.
     Mr. GOUGH: There are two propositions in this bill. One is, that railroad companies shall
      not be permitted to charge more for hauling a short distance than they charge for haling a
      long distance. If we have a right to make a law to regulate the railroads I think this is a
      proper thing to impose on them.
     Another proposition is, that the railroad companies shall not have pets. They shall not be
      permitted to furnish cars to one man and not furnish them for another. That they shall not
      furnish means of storage to one man and not to another. That one man, because he is acquainted
      with the President, or directors, or some of the officers of the road, shall not have any
      advantage over the man who is not on such good terms. I think this is a proper regulation for
      the State to impose on the railroads.
     
     Mr. GARRISON demanded the previous question, which was seconded by the House. Pending
      which--
     The House adjourned till Monday at eleven o'clock, a. m.
    
   
   
   
    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
    
     MONDAY, February 7, 1887.
    
    [The Senate was not in session.]
    At the request of Messrs. Jewett, Griffiths, Schley, Dunn and Fleece, (the Speaker being
     absent, at 11.30 o'clock,) the Clerk called the House to order.
    On motion by Mr. JEWETT, Mr. Gardiner was elected Speaker pro tempore.
    Then came a recess for dinner.
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     G. A. R. BADGES.
     The bill [H. R. 23] to prohibit non-members from wearing Grand Army of the Republic badges,
      was read the third time.
     Mr. PATTON: I think that that bill is imperfect, and I apprehend that there is no authority
      behind it to enforce it. There may be numerous Grand Army badges. How are we to know what a
      Grand Army badge is? This bill does not describe what a Grand Army badge is, I therefore move
      to recommit the bill with instructions that the Grand Army badge be described.
     On motion by Mr. FLEECE, this motion was laid on the table.
     Mr. FLEECE: I desire to say that the G. A. R. badge is a regulation of the Grand Army of
      Indiana and is minutely described, and every man can know just what it is. This bill is
      intended to prevent men from wearing the G. A. R. badges who are not entitled to wear them.
      Some men who are not soldiers would like to play soldier and impose themselves upon soldiers
      and upon the G. A. R., and I understand the purpose of this bill is to prevent these men from
      practicing an imposition upon the people.
     The bill passed the House by yeas 69, nays 14.
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. GARRISON, in explanation of his vote, said: I may not understand the full import of this
      bill, but I cannot see any virtue that will enure to the soldier or the G. A. R by the passage
      of this kind of a bill. I recognize it as an honor to any one to be entitled to wear a badge
      of this character,--to have been a soldier in the defence of his country,--but where the
      benefit is to enure by having this law is a different thing. Because I cannot see any virtue
      in the law I vote "no."
     Mr. PATTON, when his name was called, said: The Grand Army of the Republic is an
      organization of the brave soldiers of this country, like the Odd Fellows or any secret order. By the provisions of this bill many a brave soldier
      would be excluded from wearing a soldier's badge. I cannot see that we can legislate in
      the interest of the Grand Army of the Republic when it is nothing more than a secret
      organization for the purpose of doing good to its own people. If the Grand Army of the
      Republic cannot protect itself it has no business to ask the Legislature to do it. I vote
      "no."
     Mr. ROBERTS, in explaining his vote, said: The country is full of imposters, and it is often
      the case that persons wearing the badge of the G. A. R. without right, impose upon people by
      calling attention to their badges, and in that way, under false pretenses, frequently obtain
      assistance. I think that this bill shold become a law. I vote "aye."
     Mr. STUBBLEFIELD, in explaining his vote, said: I believe in punishing hypocrisy of every
      description.--A great many soldiers in the country don't belong to the Grand Army because
      their conduct may have been such as to debar them. The badges of the Grand Army are made from
      rebel cannon, and the boys that succeeded in capturing one of these cannon are proud of it. I
      vote "aye."
     Mr. THOMPSON, when his name was called, said: The first provision of the Constitution
      says--[Reads the provision.] Now the idea of my voting for a bill that will fine a man fifty
      dollars for wearing an Army badge, I can not do it. I vote "no."
     Mr. WEYAND in explanation of his vote, said: I understand the import of this bill is not so
      much to protect themembers of the Grand Army as it is to protect the people of the State, and
      for this reason I vote "aye."
     The vote was announced as above. So the bill passed the House.
    
    
     RAILROAD FREIGHT TRAFFIC.
     The House resumed the consideration of the bill [H. R. 230] to regulate freight
      transportation on railroads--pending at the last adjournment--Friday.
     Mr. JEWETT said that Congress had passed the Inter-State Commerce bill, but it had no
      authority to regulate the charges of railroad companies where the freight was hauled from one
      point to another in the same State. Discriminations are made between stations where there is
      and where there is not competition. They are oppressive to trade, and if, under the operation
      of the law just passed by Congress, the railroad companies should feel aggrieved, they would
      still further discriminate against persons shipping from one point to another within the same
      State unless some such act as this should be passed. It would not compel the railroads to
      carry one horse at the same rate as a car-load, but it would compel them to carry one car-load
      at the same rate as one hundred car-loads. It would compel them to give to all persons the
      same rights, and prevent any discrimination between two persons under the same circumstances.
      He had no doubt that the Inter-State Commerce bill would fall short of what was expected by
      its promoters, but he believed some good would come of it. At any rate it was the law of the
      land, and while it so remained, ordinary prudence in behalf of the people of this State
      required the enactment and observance of the law as proposed by this bill. He was by no means
      certain that great things can be accomplished through this species of legislation, but he
      thought it worthwhile to make the trial.
     The bill passed by yeas 82, nays 3.
    
    
     ENGLISH SPARROWS.
     The bill [H. R. 245] for the destruction of English sparrows, was read the second time with
      committee amendments.
     Mr.VAN SLYKE: It does not seem there is very much in that bill because it is short. If it
      had a preamble about a yard in length, and about sixteen sections, it would be of considerable
      importance, but as it is it is short, concise, and, to the point, I say to you, Mr. Speaker
      and gentlemen on this floor, that there has not been a bill introduced that was of any more
      importance than that little bill. The fact is this: these English sparrows are running out the
      blue birds,  robins, orioles, red birds, and every other
      song bird in the country. You annot wake up in the morning in any city and hear the song of
      the robin or the red bird, but you can hear these little sparrows chattering and quarreling
      and making themselves a perfect nuisance. They are found in our homes and in all public
      places.--Their introduction into this country was a nuisance; allowing them to remain is a
      still greater nuisance, and I know that the people will be glad to get rid of them.
     The committee amendments were concurred in and the bill ordered engrossed.
    
    
     BRIBERY OF MEMBERS.
     The SPEAKER announced the following committee to investigate the charge of bribery in
      connection with the election, of a United States Senator: Messrs. Covert, Griffiths,
      Kercheval, White and Pierce, as authorized by as resolution of the House--see pages 326 and
      327.
    
    
     STATE BENEVOLENT INSTITUTIONS.
     The committee thereon returned Mr. Grose's bill [H. R. 247] for the better government
      of the Benevolent Institutions of the State, with a majority report recommending its passage,
      and a minority report with sundry amendments.
     Mr. GORDON: This bill provides for eighteen trustees. It provides a compensation of two
      hundred dollars a year and traveling expenses not to exceed one hundred dollars. Supposing
      that the traveling expenses will be all used up, that will be $1800 and the salaries will be
      $3600, making a total of $5400 for the payment of these boards. Then two of the members of the
      board shall be selected from the political party casting the greatest number of votes, and one
      from the party casting the next highest number of votes. I am opposed to the provisions of
      this bill; I do not believe that these hospitals should be organized under different boards of
      government. It seems to me that they ought to be under one board.--The minority report
      proposes that the Governor shall appoint a board of five, making no requirements as to
      politics, nor requiring one of them to be a lady. It leaves it in the hands of the Governor
      subject to the approval of the Senate.
     Mr. FOSTER: Suppose the Governor is of one politics and the Senate of another and don't
      want to confirm the appointment?
     Mr. GORDON: I can only say that that would be very much like the case of the President of
      the United States and the United States Senate. These other institutions are not like the
      Institutions for the Insane and they should not have the same board.--Two years ago the
      Legislature organized a Soldiers' Orphans' Home. It has, so far as I know, worked
      well; but it has not worked better than those under political control. The management of the
      Soldiers' Orphans' Home was not for some time equal to that given to the
      Institutions for the Blind and the Deaf and Dumb, and I am not aware that they are better
      managed out there now than these others are. Leave it to the Governor to name the trustees of
      these institutions, and it is safe to say that no person whom the people will elevate to that
      office but will be careful that no man be put into that place who is without qualification or
      fitness. He will be careful to see that the persons have the proper capacity and fidelity to
      trust. And further, it is a well known to all persons who have observed the workings of these
      institutions that there will be a reluctance on the part of any Legislature to institute an
      investigation, because if anybody is struck it must be the friends of both parties.
     Mr. GROSE: I wish to say that this bill provides for a board of three for each Hospital, for
      the Deaf and Dumb Institution, and for the Blind Asylum. My friend says that if they would put
      in a non-partizan board neither party would urge an investigation of these institutions. I
      don't approve of that doctrine or theory as very substantial. Now, if the members of the
      boards were of one political party and the Legislature was of the same party, we could never
      get an investigation. Corruption might  run riot and we
      could never reach it. I admit, for the sake of argument, that he is right on that point, but
      unless there was a law restraining the Executive of the State, the gentleman well knows that
      the Executive of the State will appoint them all of his own political party, and I believe the
      gentleman's own bill does not mean anything else. It might well be said that if three or
      four years ago such a bill had been introduced as this minority bill proposes, it would not
      have been adopted by anybody on the other side. This is just what we want to break up. We want
      to make it so that the board will have no party feeling to carry out, but that these
      institutions shall be beyond all this party control. I think when we supersede the present
      board that we will have no cause to examine into the corruption that is charged to have been
      used. This is my object, to have no cause for these examinations.--Take, if you please, the
      Orphans' Home in Rush county. There is a Republican, a Democrat, and a lady whose
      politics I do not know, on the board. No Republican or Democrat has charged that board with
      corruption. My impression is, every board that is thus constructed will receive commendation.
      There is a reason why I think there should not be a large board for all these institutions
      instead of a small one for each. A good many thought we ought not to pay these boards except
      for traveling expenses. In my bill I give them a salary, though not an extravagant one. I can
      say this for smaller boards. Evansville is two hundred miles away from the capitol. If we make
      one large board they must go to each of these places. If we make three, wisdom would teach
      that they must be taken from that part of the State where these institutions are.--Now, it
      enables them to serve for this nominal sum and pays them very fairly for their services.
      Logansport is about seventy miles from here. If the board for the southern part of the State
      went there, there would be traveling and hotel expenses, &c. Taking these points, as far
      as they are from each other, my idea would leave it to the Governor to take two men out of
      each political party, and take a woman and put with them, and that three of the six women on
      the six boards shall be Republicans and three Democrats. I believe it will redound to the best
      interest the State of Indiana. I believe it will save all these charges of corruption and
      prevent all these expensive examinations. When you come talk about the Deaf and Dumb and the
      Blind Institutions it looks as if one board would do for both, but after looking over their
      reports and seeing the work there is to be done, and how far the work diverges one from
      another, I think we need three persons for each one of them to study carefully the workings of
      these institutions. That is all I see proper to say, and I hope to hear a full and free
      discussion from my friends over the way.
     Mr. ROBERTS: I very much regret to feel a sense of duty requiring me to part company with my
      friend from Putnam (Mr. Gordon). I cannot say that I am adverse to the position of electing a
      board of five trustees to take charge of the Insane Hospitals referred to in the minority
      report; as a matter of economy, I do not know but that that should be adopted. I am not
      certain that five might not manage them better than if a separate board of was elected for
      each institution. At least it would be in the line of economy to do so; but that is a matter
      secondary importance compared with the main proposition. The main proposition presented by
      these reports is, has the time come when the General Assembly of the State of Indiana is
      prepared, in harmony with the prevailing sentiment of the people; to say that these benevolent
      institution shall not be under partisan control but shall be forever divorced them from? When
      I say that I believe the people demand that these institutions should not be under partisan
      control I believe I speak the truth, for I do not think there is a county in the State where
      the majority of the peo ple do not demand it.
      [Applause.]--When we are in the presence of the afflicted of God we should not think of the
      Democratic or the Republican party but only of the dictates of humanity. [Applause.] These
      people are unable to express anything intelligibly concerning their condition, their wants, or
      what should be done for them. It is left to the sound judgment of the legislators of this
      State who are sent here by the people to devise the best method for their relief. I believe
      that I correctly represent the people of my county when I say that they demand this of this
      Legislature. Say that you adopt a system of a board of three, when you appoint one Democrat
      and one Republican and a woman of acknowledged ability, you at once say that the whole people,
      all parties, shall be held responsible--that the Democratic party and the Republican party and
      the whole people will be responsible and alike interested. The day is past when intelligent
      reason can tolerate partisan bickering in this matter.--When I was before the people for this
      election I stated that, so far as these benevolent institutions were concerned, if they
      expected me to come here and play the part of a narrow-minded partisan that I was not the man
      they wanted. [Applause.] It is singular that any man should take a contrary view to this, as
      it is in the line of higher ideas of manhood and in consonance with our holy religion. I am
      heartily in accord with that part of the majority report which, not only in the spirit but in
      the substance, declares that these institutions shall no more be under partisan
      control.--Committees have been instructed to investigate the charges against these
      institutions. Whether true or false I know not, still I say these investigations should be
      had. Let it be thorough and complete, or let us do that or a better thing--let us declare by
      solemn enactment of this General Assembly that partisans and partisan: politics shall not have
      control of these institutions longer. [Applause.]
     Mr. PATTON: I did not intend to say anything on this question. Ever since this question has
      been before the House I have not expressed myself, but I cannot sit here every day and hear
      the charges made against that institution over there reiterated. I say that these charges are
      lies as black as hell. Every charge that is made against these institutions is a falsehood. I
      know when I first came to this Legislature that I worked as hard as any man trying to change
      the control of that institution. In 1879 there was a board appointed and every one of that
      board was a Democrat. Before that time the Republicans had control, and I say that it was a
      disgrace. When the Democrats went on that board it had the best control that it ever had. When
      they took it, it was as rotten as it could be. In 1883 when I went into that institution I
      found extravagance in the institution, and it was simply a quarrel between the Republicans and
      the Democrats in the institution. It was mixed altogether, and was then under non-partisan
      control, and it was a disgrace to the State of Indiana. I worked as hard as I could, and what
      was the result? Why that board was taken out and another put in. All of these evils were
      corrected. Porter was Governor at that time. He said he would appoint a non-partisan board,
      and what did he do? He waited till the Legislature had closed and he simply selected the
      trustees for those institutions and every one of them were Republicans. They assisted in
      perpetrating the fraud of 1876. I say that that board was selected by Porter, and every single
      trustee was a Republican. There was where you had an opportunity to make a non-partisan board
      for these institutions and you failed to do it.--Now you come here when we are in power and
      you want us to divide the spoils, as you call them. You cannot have a whole loaf, and you want
      to get half a loaf. A half loaf is better than none, you think, and you are here asking for a
      non-partisan control. They appeal to the Democrats to put them in office. What do you want? I
      do not understand that you could gain anything by putting one  Democrat and one Republican together. Why put an antagonising
      element together, and then put a woman between them. They could never accomplish one single
      thing. It would be that the Democrat would side with the woman and then the Republican would
      side with woman, and the woman would be the board. I would rather have the woman alone and I
      don't know but what I would vote for such a proposition as that.--See the improvements in
      the last four years in these institutions,--see what has been done there--how they are 
       controlled
       controled
      . See the condition of these institutions to-day. Yet they come before us to-day and
      tell us that these institutions are not run in the best interest of the inmates and in the
      best interests of the people of the State of Indiana. I say whoever says that is a fool. It
      has been charged by political slander. I have gone there again and again; I have seen these
      institutions purified and cleaned up, and I have seen the improvement. Send a committee over
      there and I say that they cannot but report favorably to the institution. Men who are sent
      here to represent their constituents, I have heard stand on this floor and make charges
      against these institutions of bad management, mistreatment, &c., and I apprehend that they
      have not been there at all. Look at the conduct of this House in the last four weeks. In the
      election of United State Senator every subterfuge and cunning that man could invent has been
      used to defeat the will of the people of the State of Indiana; and they have failed, and they
      will fail again. If there is any wrong, go and investigate it; open it up and see what is at
      the bottom of it. I say that Democrats will assist you. Talk about the Democratic party being
      a spoils party. You like the loaves and fishes as well as the Democratic party. You are hungry
      now and want to get back. Yes, you are willing to take the husks from the Democratic table. I
      know there are a few Democrats in the party that will be content to take only a part of the
      loaves and fishes, but when that day comes with the party it will the millennium. The
      Repulican party has never done it and the Democratic party never will. We don't want
      non-partisan control. The Republican party is not in power to-day, and, like Lazarus, they
      pick up the crumbs from the Democratic table. I don't want to be tedious, I never am. I
      believe I have said all I want to say now.
     Mr. STUBBLEFIELD: I am astonished at the wide range of this debate, and I am astonished at
      the spirit manifested on the part of the gentleman from Sullivan (Mr. Patton). [A voice: "Louder."] Wait till I get up steam. I did not expect that
      the bill under discussion would meet with any opposition. It seems to me that it was one of
      the best bills that ever could be introduced in behalf of our unfortunate creatures. It
      provides for the selection of a Republican, a Democrat and a lady. We know the influence that
      ladies have exercised over the body politic in the last few years; we know the influence they
      have exercised over this august body in its debates; and when the bill proposes to establish a
      non-partisan Board of Commissioners to look after the welfare and interests of these
      unfortunate creatures, it is strange that any man who has sense enough to pound sand into a
      rat-hole would come here and make such a speech as the gentleman from Sullivan did. It is
      evident to every gentleman on this floor that the gentleman was loaded to overflowing. He had
      maintained his reasonable degree of integrity as long as he could before he began to vent his
      spleen and pour out his vituperation upon the Republican party. There could not have been any
      other reason, for there could not have been a better bill devised if it had come down from the
      cabinet of heaven. If there was a stranger in this Hall he would think, from the speech the
      gentleman made, that Republicans had no rights in this country of ours that were worth
      respecting, and would conclude that all the inmates of the Asylums were Democrats and no one
      had any right to do anything with them except Democrats.
      Does not the gentleman know that it is necessary to have one party to watch the other, and
      that the only use that God ever had for the Democratic party was to punch the Republican party
      under the fifth rib. I am a Republican from away back; and I am proud that I am one of the
      party that has taken care of the Democratic party when it could not take care of itself. I am
      proud that I am one that took up the rag-tag and bob-tail of the Democratic party and made it
      even 
       as
       ss
       respectable as it is. I know that the Republican party has done many things that are
      wrong, and that they have occasionally forgotten the Lord. I cannot charge the Democratic
      party as a party with that for they never knew Him. Must I portray to the minds of the members
      of this House this evening the Democratic party? There is no language equal to the task, and
      it would take from now until the time that Gabriel blows his horn to give a brief outline. God
      bless Judge Roberts, a noble, high-toned Democrat, who has the manhood to stand up for what is
      right. I do hope that he may go home all covered over with glory, and I know he will meet the
      approval of his constituents. Contrast the noble speech of this gentleman and the speech of
      the gentleman from Sullivan.
     The House adjourned.
    
   
   
   
    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    IN SENATE.
    
     TUESDAY, February 8, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Rev. W. F. Sheridan, of the M. E. Church.
    On motion the reading of the Secretary's minutes of Friday was dispensed with (as
     usual.)
    The PRESIDENT pro tempore announced the appointment of Mr. Branaman as a member of the
      Committee on County and Township Business in place of Mr. Urmston,
     resigned; on Banks in place of Mr. Griffith, resigned; on Roads in place of Mr. Andrew,
     resigned; and on Temperance in place of Mr. Logsdon, resigned.
    
     STOCK RUNNING AT LARGE.
     On motion by Mr. ENSLEY, his bill [S. 111] to amend
      Section 2639, R. S., was taken up. He said: It has reference to stock running at large.--The
      present statute authorizes any resident of a township to take up a stock at large,
      consequently the law proves to be inoperative. What seems to be everybody's business is
      no one's. This bill seeks to place this duty on the road supervisor. The reason of this
      is simple.
     Mr. WEIR: Does it deprive any citizen of the right to take up stock running at large?
     Mr. ENSLEY: Yes sir, it does. The reason of that is this: Where stock breaks out no neighbor
      desires to take up his neighbor's stock.
     Mr. WEIR: I think any citizen should have that right.
     Mr. ENSLEY: I am willing such an amendment shall go on.
     Mr. WEIR: With that amendment I would vote for the bill.
     Mr. ENSLEY: This is the law in Ohio, and it works admirably well.--I think you will find it
      is meritorious.
     Mr. WEIR: I move this bill be postponed till two o'clock this afternoon to give us time
      to look into it.
     On motion by Mr. SELLERS, it was referred to Messrs. Campbell, Weir and Ensley.
    
    
     PAY OF EMPLOYEES.
     Mr. TRIPPET called up the bill [H. R. 14] for semi-monthly pay of employes. It was read the
      third time.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     Mr. TRIPPET: There is not a provision in this bill but what is eminently necessary. A
      similar bill--Senate Bill No. 2--has been discussed here. These measures are the best things
      the Legislature ever passed in the interest of the mining and mechanical interests of the
      State.
     
     Mr. THARP: I am interested in this bill because Senate Bill 33 which I drafted, has been
      incorporated in House Bill 14. The Senate has passed
      Senate Bill 2, which is akin to this. That bill having passed the vote it did, I don't
      apprehend anybody will vote against this. I have been among the coal miners, and among the
      farmers, and among the merchants, in a town where coal mining is carried on, and where this
      check or truck system is in vogue, and I utter a truth when I say they had rather see the
      provisions of this bill become a law than anything that has been placed before this body or
      the House of Representatives this winter. The thousands of laborers in m y section of the
      State are usually paid by means of scrip, which compels them to buy goods from their
      employers. It cuts out legitimate competition and enables the men who employ these laborers to
      have a monopoly. I hope that, in so far as the action of this Senate is concerned, there might
      be a unanimity of sentiment that the people may know this great wrong will be righted.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: Are they compelled to take this scrip?
     Mr. THARP: Yes, sir. If you are a poor laboring man, and compelled to have work to support
      your wife and children, they would say if you do not take it you may go upon the highway.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: Don't they ever pay money?
     Mr. THARP: Sometimes. If you as a merchant competing with them and take their scrip to them
      they will 
       discount
       disconnt
       it for cash, paying nearly ninety per cent.
     Mr. URMSTON: I take it there is not much necessity for the passage of such a law as this.
      Senate Bill No. 2 covers all 4he ground this bill covers with one exception. There seems to be
      but one feature in this bill and that is to prevent all co-partnerships, even down to a little
      cooper-shop, making but half a dozen barrels a day, from setting up a little grocery store.
      That is about all I have heard said about this bill, which has in it the force of argument.
      Now, are we to pass a law simply to provide against such a contingency as that? I have no
      objection to allow interest on the scrip as proposed in the bill; that would be all right, but
      you put it in the power of a lot of men, whenever they find out that perhaps they have been
      paying a small fracton too much for goods, to go ahead and prosecute their employer. In my
      judgment, that is a great wrong. As far as establishing a market price is concerned, I have
      not been able to find that any town has a particular price.--It is for every aman to sell for
      the best price he can get. You could not find established prices in any town, I am sure. The
      better way is to have the law specify what is oppressive and then have the advantage in every
      particular; they may recover the money exacted from them if the goods are sold at exorbitant
      prices.
     Mr. WEIR: I don't know that anything I can say will make any difference in the opinion
      of Senators.--But, having my convictions and feeling disposed to act in harmony with them, I
      desire to refer to such objections to this bill as occur to me. As I understand, there is but
      one sound priniciple of legislation, and that is, no bill should become a law unless that bill
      is in harmony with the interests of the people. As a rule class legislation should not be
      passed, and as a rule no legislation should be passed on political anticipations.--We have
      seen a good deal of this sort of legislation. There are a large number of bills before this
      Legislature all tending in the same direction, and I stand here to say I do not think they are
      in harmony with the interests of the people. We have been simply going wild upon this
      question. I have heard Senators and members say these bills would be practically a dead
      letter. One of the most disgraceful things a Legislature can do is to pass a law that will be
      a dead letter. It teaches the people to disregard law. I agree, Mr. President and Senators,
      that the Knights of Labor--this organization of laboring men--is fully justified in asking
      reasonable legislation in favor of their  interests. They
      have my sympathy, and I stand ready to vote for any bill that will promote their interests. We
      will see that banks have a National organization. They meet once a year to promulgate what
      they think will be for the interest of the country, and they say what laws there should be on
      the question of finance. Is that done in the interest of the people or in the interest of
      bankers? Again, railroads, insurance companies, in fact every important branch of business in;
      this country, has its National organization; and the capital engaged in that business is
      harmonized in order to force the highest profit out of the consumer and the lowest price for
      labor. It is that condition of things which has brought about, in the minds of laboring men,
      the belief that there is a necessity something should be done for their protection. I say it
      is the legitimate offspring of the actions of capital, and legislation for years back. The
      laws of this country, both State and National, have been made in the interest of capital,
      overlooking the more important interest of labor. Now comes the time when we all reach this
      conclusion, and the danger is in our going too far in the other direction; and in the
      reaction, the people we ought to benefit are the people that will be injured most by a
      disturbance of the business interests of the country. Take this bill now under consideration;
      will any Senator tell me why it is not made applicable to railroads which employ more than all
      the mines combined? Why not make it so fair and square and simple that a way-faring man may
      understand it? Another objectionable feature in this bill is that men are not permitted to
      make a contract! Are not the laboring men of Indiana among our most intelligent citizens?
      Cannot they determine whether they will work by the day or by the piece? Are we to remove
      their capacity to make a contract for themselves and determine what they wish to do? I
      undertake to say that no Senator can point me to legislation where a man is deprived of the
      right to make a contract in harmony with his own interest; if anybody can I demand that he
      mention it. This bill would place men in just such a position as they would be if under
      twenty-one years of: age, and where they cannot make a contract. The whole busines methods of
      this country are to undergo a change in order to answer the demands of this bill! The Senator
      from Daviess (Mr. Tharp) remarked that a bill similar to this one had already been passed. How
      was it passed? The fact is they started it on the run, and each party was afraid the other
      might obtain some political advantage. If we go to the bottom of these measures you will find
      it is by that sort of demagoguery they are endeavoring to obtain some advantage. I know the
      laboring people of the State are intelligent, and when the time comes they can consider these
      things and see the working of such laws, and that the effect will be entirely different from
      what they expect; they you will find a re-action will take place. No member of a legislative
      body can justify any vote he gives on the ground of esteeming it a party measure. I tell you
      if they had less party, less prejudice and more love of country, it would be a grand thing for
      the people. When men get to be as honest in politics as they are in business it will be a
      political millenium. As far as I am personally concerned, I am going to vote the individual
      conviction of the Senator from Laporte, whether in harmony with political prejudices,
      political capital or not.
     I desire to call the attention of the Senate to Section 2. [Reads.] Why, Mr. President and
      fellow Senators, is it not plain to be seen that here is a provision that says to the people
      "you are incapable of managing your own affairs--incapable of making your own
      contracts?" [Mr. W. pointed out objections to other sections.] There are some good things
      in this bill--some I would be willing to vote for; but for the reasons I have stated I am
      unalterably opposed to the passage of the bill in the shape it is presented at this time.

     
     Mr. BAILEY: I am very much in favor of the passage of this bill because I believe its
      provisions are wholesome and proper. It has been said this bill contains some of the
      provisions of Senate Bill No. 2. In two or three provisions that is true. [He pointed them
      out.] It has been stated that these men ought to be permitted to make contracts. The true
      effect of a provision of that kind is this: When a poor man applies for employment he has to
      take precisely what he can get. If they hand out to him a printed contract he will have to
      sign it and bind himself to receive his wages once a month or once in six months, and thus
      annul the effects of this bill. I desire to place myself on record as being in favor of this
      bill for the reasons I have assigned. I propose to be just and fair as far as my judgment will
      let me . I am informed by the author of this bill that there was but three votes in opposition
      to it in the House.
     Mr. THARP: This bill provides that employers shall not sell goods to their employe at a
      higher rate than to a customer for cash in the locality.--I think there is unncessary alarm
      about prosecutions under this bill. If a man be guilty of violation of this section it must be
      shown by affadavit what the market value of the commodity is in the community, and that the
      man to be prosecuted had knowledge of the market value thereof, and, knowing it to be worth so
      much for cash, he sold it for a greater sum. The officers must see their way tolerably clear
      or they will not prosecute a case. I have seen, year in and year out, the practical operations
      of the evil intended to be remedied by the second section of this bill. I am not the author of
      any other section of this bill. If anybody in my district is affected by this section, they
      are men who have been my political friends. This is a House bill, and the Senate amendments
      will likely receive prompt attention there. I hope this bill will pass.
     Mr. FOWLER: Like the Senator from Laporte (Mr. Weir) I think the best guide for a legislator
      to follow is the guide of his own conscience in all acts pertaining to legislation--especially
      the passage of bills; but I do not look at the provisions of this bill like the Senator from
      Laporte and those who oppose it. I have heard nearly every coal operator in Indiana discuss
      this bill, and not a single objection was raised to it except to the provision that wages
      shall be paid every two weeks. The Senator from Laporte finds many objections that I think are
      not well founded. I think they will not operate as he suggests, and as has been suggested, by
      other Senators. I apprehend Senators know but little of the necessities of this bill. Of my
      own personal knowledge I know there has been abuses. It is right and proper that a thing
      should stop, which has been an enormous abuse of men who are mining coal.--They are, in
      effect, compelled to take these checks or compelled to quit work. It is that abuse this bill
      seek to remedy. It is said by the Senator from Laporte that it does not apply to railroads. It
      need not, for no such abuse has grown up among railroads, as I understand it. None in the
      world, as I understand it.
     Mr. WEIR: Does it not apply to the man who has his little cooper shop, as much as it does to
      the man who has a mine?
     Mr. FOWLER: Of course it does. It applies to every man and corporation and farmer who will
      establish an institution and compel his men to go there and trade. But really it applies to
      nobody except great corporations who carry on large institutions and have their establishments
      where they are operating; because they are the only corporations practicing it.
     Mr. WEIR: Has section three anything to do with others, as far as the penalty is
      concerned?
     Mr. FOWLER : Possibly not. It may not; but that does not signify the provisions of the bill
      are not salutary and ought not to become a law. Certainly not. I believe, as the Senator from
      Laporte says, we ought not to pass political legislation in matters of this character. I would
      not vote for this bill upon political grounds.--  But
      this is of that class of legislation which has been knocking at the door of the Legislature
      for years. Now there seems to be a race of diligence between the Senator from Laporte (Mr.
      Weir) and the Senator from Marion (Mr. Bailey) as to who shall pronounce the greatest eulogium
      on the Knights of Labor. I have as much respect for that class of men as anybody, but it is
      not necessary I should stand here and pass a compliment upon them. We know they are striving
      for their rights, which have been stricken down by corporations. It is enough to know they
      have been deprived of their rights, and cruelly deprived of their rights in many instances
      where this bill seeks to remedy. The Senator from Laporte says this bill is too paternal--we
      are not permitting men to make their own contracts. I ask him if he is not prevented from
      contracting for interest at more than eight per cent.?
     Mr WEIR: That is true, but it is not a parallel case.
     Mr. FOWLER: I want to know why it is not a parallel case. If I am not permitted to contract
      for more than eight per cent. interest I want to know wherein that differs from the
      proposition in this bill, wherein it says I am not to enter into any contract to nullify it?
      We have another statute on the book, Section 2201, providing what weights and measures shall
      be, and in addition to that establishing a penalty for violation or falsifying its measures.
      That is not more paternal than the measures in this bill we are seeking to pass. Yet the
      Senator thinks this is too much like placing a guardian over the citizens of Indiana. I
      don't think so.
     Mr. WEIR: I would ask the Senator if a bill could not be made to apply to mines and not
      affect other interests?
     Mr. FOWLER: It could be, but it would not be right. I believe all legislation ought to apply
      to every citizen.
     Mr. MUTLLINIX: In the locality in which I live this bill affects a great interest. It is a
      bill, too, Mr. President, that I heartily endorse, and I feel it should be passed on in
      justice to a certain class of men. We have a class of men in this country who are hardly able
      to take care of themselves, for their lives are spent from early morning till the sun goes
      down in the bowels of the earth, digging and dragging out from beneath the surface the wealth
      of the country. It is in behalf of that class of men I speak to-day. That particular class do
      not demand their pay every two weeks especially, but they want a bill so if it becomes
      necessary they may have their pay every two weeks. The wealth of this country is able to take
      care of itself. Wealth and brains go hand in hand, and it becomes the duty of legislative
      bodies to guard the interests of that class of men whose only capital is their hands. In
      justice to that class of men this bill should pass. We have men who were almost born in the
      bottom of mines, and who dig down in the center of the earth year after year until they become
      almost part of that earth.--These men should have their pay every two weeks if they want it,
      and they should have it in cash or commercial paper of the country. Legislation in this
      country should look to the interests of labor and not in favor of wealthy corporations. This
      country is being consumed by corporations. Large corporations and manufactories have been
      protected while labor has been neglected. In behalf of the honest sons of toil I ask to-day my
      brother Senators to vote for this bill. I would not vote for anything that would break down
      capital or destroy it, neither would I cast a vote that would injuriously affect the interest
      of the most humble subject of the commonwealth. I believe this bill is a step in the right
      direction; and I would say it should not be made a political question.
     Mr. HOWARD, of St. Joseph: Who has any objection to the first section of this bill requiring
      payment every two weeks? The second section is plain; it provides: [Reads.] I can't see
      how there can possibly be any objection to this section. Who can object to payment being made
      in mon- ey? The third section of the bill provides:
      [Reads.] I should like to know the objection to that provision. The fourth section provides:
      [Reads.] It does not seem there can be any valid objection to this bill. Mr. President, it
      seems to me this bill is in the interest of right and justice, and has been offered in behalf
      of those who have been deprived so 
       many
       mamy
       years of what is their honest due. It is not class legislation. It seems to me this
      measure would secure justice and right to those who are not in a position to protect
      themselves.
     Mr. WEIR: All the argument we have heard in favor of this bill is its application to mines.
      There are great interests in other sections of this State, just as important as the mining
      interests, that will be affected by this bill. It is desirable to provide a remedy for the
      abuse referred to, but I say there is no demand for this extraordinary legislation. This bill
      makes children of men; which is the principle objection I urge. I say now, of the abuses which
      have grown up in the mining regions to which Senators from that section have referred, I am
      ready to vote for any proper legislation which will protect that class of people, but I am not
      willing to run wild on that question.
     Mr. URMSTON: There is no occasion for passing this bill. If Senate Bill No. 2 becomes a law,
      we have provided all that is sufficient for the miner, and perhaps more, too.
     Mr. SELLERS: I cannot understand how any Senator can claim the provisions of this bill have
      been enacted in Senate Bill No. 2. I can't find any similarity, and there is none except
      that payment shall be made every two weeks. This bill is, in my opinion, a better bill than
      Senate Bill No. 2. [He made an ineffectual motion to have the words: "employing day
      laborers," inserted in section one.]
     The bill passed by yeas 28, nays 14.
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. CAMPBELL, when his name was called, said: I had a desire to vote against this bill, and
      also the bill which passed last Friday, but was not then present. I believe it will work to
      the disadvantage of the laboring men. I am paired on this bill, and hope the clerk will make
      the record show that I am opposed to this bill.
     Mr. DRAKE, when his name was called, said: I, also, am opposed to this bill, but am
      paired.
     Mr. ENSLEY, when his name was called, said: I am paired with Senator French.
     Mr. HARNESS, in explanation of his vote, said: Believing there is no demand for legislation
      of this kind; believing men should be permitted to make their own contracts for their labor ;
      believing such legislation would be in favor of the capitalist as against small operators;
      believing such legislation is in favor of the capitalist as against the poor, I vote
      "no."
     Mr. JOHNSON, when his name was called, said: There are some provisions in this bill I
      heartily approve. I refer to the second and third sections. I think they interfere somewhat
      with the freedom of contract, and will give some inconvenience and loss to employers and
      manufacturers, but I think that is nothing as compared with the injury which the laborer and
      employe will sustain by permitting matters to remain as they now are. There are other
      provisions in the bill which are objectionable to me. I refer to provisions contained in the
      first section. I am opposed to that portion of the bill for the reason that it arbitrarily
      interferes with the free making of contracts, and the effect of it will be to cripple and
      injure laboring men who are striving to better their condition by engaging in various
      industries with a small amount of capital and who will be utterly unable to comply with its
      provisions; whereby, not only this class of laborers, but also those laborers employed by
      them, will sustain irreparable injury. The effect of the passage of this bill will be, on
      account of the provisions of the first section, to create monopolies in the hands of rich
      corporations and manufacturers, which is the very thing labor desires to avoid. I mov-  ed, the other day when this bill was being considered, to
      strike out the first section after the enacting clause, so as to put the bill in a shape that
      would enable me to vote for it on its final passage, but my motion was voted down, and,
      consequently, I am now compelled to vote on the bill as a whole. While it contains some
      beneficial provisions for which I would very much like to vote, it also contains some
      provisions which, in my opinion, will be seriously injurious to labor; and the infirmities of
      the bill overbalance its merits; I am, therefore, constrained to vote "no."
     Mr. URMSTON, in explanation of his vote, said: I voted for Senate Bill No. 2, believing that
      this bill would be amended so [not heard by this Reporter.] I cannot separate them, and for
      these reasons I vote against the bill. "No."
     The result was announced as above.
     So the bill passed the Senate.
     The Senate adjourned.
    
   
   
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
    
     TUESDAY, February 8, 1887.
    
    The session was opened in prayer by Rev H. A. Edson of the Presbyterian Church.
    
     THE BENEVOLENT INSTITUTIONS.
     The House resumed the discussion of the bill [H. R. 247] pending at the adjournment
      yesterday.
     Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Owen: I am opposed to the majority report. I am also opposed to the
      substitution of the minority report, though I believe that the minority report comes nearer
      what should pass this House. In 1883 I worked and voted for the law we have now, giving the
      Legislature the right and power to elect the officers of the several institutions of the
      State. I thought at that time I did right; and I think now that I did right. While I am not
      opposed to the whole of the minority report, I am in favor of the people electing the officers
      of these institutions. It seems to me that one hundred and fifty representatives of the people
      could come nearer filling these offices satisfactory to the people than one man.
     Mr. JEWETT: I would not say a word in regard to this minority report except that I am firmly
      impressed the majority report ought not to pass. If I cannot secure the adoption of the
      minority report with its partisan provisions, I will join with you in making it non-partisan.
      Like the gentleman from Owen, I came into the Legislature in 1883; like him, I voted for what
      was called the "Brown bill." It was made a caucus measure. It was wrong in one
      respect. That wrong still exists, and I have sought at all times since to have it changed. It
      amounts almost to a legislative crime, that the appointment of the officers of these
      institutions should be made a legislative work, with its log-rolling schemes and combinations.
      I believe these appointments should be vested absolutely in the Governor, and that is why I
      heartily favors so much of this bill as proposes to take the appointment out of the hands of
      the Legislature and put it into the hands of the Governor. If the Governor has the appointing
      power he will be personally responsible; for the shortcomings of these men.
     As to this non-partisan feature, I will say frankly, my deliberate judgement is that there
      is nothing in that, but I am not willing to lose this great reform on that account. My
      partisanship is of a very pronounced character. I am generally found on the side of my party
      on all party matters, but I decline to get up here and make a very great fuss in regard to the
      appointment of a few officials worth three or four hundred dollars a year. I do not believe it
      is of sufficient party importance to justify the delay of public business. The gentleman from
      Dearborn says that there are scandals about these institutions. There is no surer way to
      suppress scandals on any institution than to make a non-partisan board. It is the duty of one
      party to watch the other party for the purpose of obtaining ground for accusation. While it is
      sad for the State that scandals should be about these institutions, (and I think  they are exaggerated and falsehoods,) it would be a greater
      calamity if any board could be found that would cover up these abuses. The greatest corruption
      in politics in this country arose out of a union of the two political parties. It arose in the
      State of New York under Boss Tweed, and it would have been impossible for him and his
      associates to have gone on as they did had they not been connected with men of both political
      parties.--Similar to them are the Philadelphia frauds. We all know the great legislative
      corruption of this country--the Salary Grab. Could that have been perpetrated on the people of
      this country except by a union of the two parties? And the latest, was the River and Harbor
      steal. All this was done by a combination of the two parties. I think that human nature is
      about the same whether in the Democratic or Republican party. I think that we are about the
      same kind of men, and subject to the same desires and to the same passions. If there is
      anything more in this question than the appointment of the trustees, it is not of sufficient
      importance to me to induce me to oppose either measure.
     Mr. HARRELL: I will not vote to give one half of the offices of the State to the
      Republicans. I have always found that the Republican party was just as strong in holding on to
      all they can get as the Democratic party. It is argued that because the appointing power is in
      the hands of the Legislature it tends to corruption. I have always understood it to be a
      Democratic principle that the nearer to the people we get the better we are off, and I have
      always understood it to be in direct opposition to Democratic principle to place great power
      in the hands of one man. There are one hundred of us here; we come here with honest purposes
      and honest intentions, and to assert that this House, or the members of this body, can be
      formed into rings and combinations for the purpose of electing officers of these institutions,
      I don't believe any such thing. I believe the members of this House are nearly as honest
      as the Governor of Indiana is. I am not saying anything against the great and good Governor we
      have, but I think we would come nearer to representing the people of the State than the
      Governor. If this bill is to become a law why not divide all the county offices, give half to
      the Republicans and half to the Democrats; and divide all the State offices, giving half to
      each party? It has been said that if this is placed in the hands of the Governor he will
      become responsible for the bad actions of his appointees. Do we want to get away from this
      responsibility? Should we not share that responsibility? I believe that the General Assembly
      has seen fit to elect good men to these offices. There have been scoundrels, but to have been
      taken out and good men put in their places, so that there is nothing in that argument. As we
      have tried it for sometime and find that these institutions have been managed honestly and
      well, I think we ought to let this law alone and ought not at this time to change it.
     Mr. GRIFFITHS: I remember the gentleman from Floyd (Mr. Jewett) the other day called
      attention to the fact that he advocated the Metropolitan Police bill four years ago, and he
      said the workings of that bill had been so admirable that during the present session he had
      introduced a bill to make it apply to all the cities of the State containing ten thousand
      inhabitants and over. Now, if the non-partisan police bill has produced the results claimed
      for it by the gentleman, from Floyd, the same arguments would apply to the board of trustees
      for those benevolent institutions. In reference to what was done in the cities of New York and
      Philadelphia, the River and Harbor bill matter, &c., I would call the attention of the
      gentleman to the fact that all of these operations were perpetrated by the worst element in
      both political parties, and that they were stopped by the best men in both political parties
      in these cities. It was a non-partisan action that wiped out the career of these men.
     I am in favor of the non-partisan report for one reason, and that is: it appoints a woman as a member of the board. I would call attention to
      the Woman's Reformatory. That institution has been practically under the control and
      management of women for thirteen years past. They have had the administration of that great
      institution, and I say on the floor of this House to-day there is no institution in the State
      of Indiana that is managed more honestly and more efficiently than the Female Reformatory.
      That is a strong argument in favor of the appointment of a woman on these boards. I think the
      gentleman from Dearborn (Mr. Roberts) yesterday should have voiced the sentiment of every
      member on this floor. I do not see why party lines should be drawn on this question. It might
      have been done at the beginning of the session when each party was watching the other to
      prevent any advantage to be taken, but that necessity has passed and to-day it seems to me
      that on questions of this sort we should not be divided by party lines. We should not be
      influenced by party considerations but by consideration of the interests of the people. I
      believe, like the gentleman from Floyd, that the appointment of trustees should be taken out
      of the caucus.--There should be some other appointing power. A very beautiful young lady
      would, I think, have a better chance to secure the votes of the members than one who was ugly
      and more competent. I think that it should be taken out of the hands of the Legislature. I am
      earnestly in favor of the majority report, and especially of the features that provide for the
      appointment of a woman.
     Mr. PARKER: I believe if we get away from these political questions that have been
      introduced,--if party questions will be put behind us,--then we can review this question on
      its general merits and can come to a better understanding. I think the minority report should
      be substituted for the majority for this reason: It provides a board of five for the insane
      hospitals and a board of three for the educational institutions, making eight trustees instead
      of eightteen. The expense of these eight trustees will be $2,400. The expense of the eighteen
      will be $5,400, making an annual saving of $3,000 in favor of the minority report. I am not
      able to comprehend the order of reasoning when gentlemen say that a non-partisan board is not
      as susceptible to corrupt influences as men from one party alone. It does not make any
      difference whether the members of a board are Republicans or Democrats, if those men want to
      be rascals they will be. I do not believe that the people, if they had the opportunity of
      voting on this question, would adopt a non-partisan board for these institutions. I believe
      that the partisan board is better for these various institutions for this reason: A Democratic
      board would be compelled to administer these offices so carefully that when another party came
      into power it could not find anything to take exception at, while a non-partisan board would
      not be apt to suffer any investigation.
     Mr. LINCK: In answer to the last gentleman I will say this: If we had non-partisan boards
      these boards would not pay thirty-two cts. a pound for butterine to a gentleman simply because
      he was a partisan.
     Mr. PARKER [interrupting]: Is the gentleman stating facts or only something that he has
      heard?
     Mr. LINCK: It has never been disputed. I have received a letter within aweek from a
      gentleman, who I have heard praised by gentlemen on the other side of the House, who says that
      the boards pay the highest price for the poorest products. That is another thing that a
      non-partisan board would not allow. For this reason I will support the majority report.
     The Governor, be be Democratic or Republican, would be apt to appoint men of higher
      character. In the Legislature we cannot tell who would be the best man. As the gentleman from
      Floyd (Mr. Jewett) says, they are usually selected by combinations. It is better to let the
      Governor select them than to select them by the Legislature. I move the previous question.
     
     The demand was seconded by the House, and under its operations the minority report was
      rejected by yeas 35, nays 53.
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. MAJOR, explaining his vote, said: I am opposed to the majority and minority report. I
      intend, when the majority report comes up, to vote as I do now on the minority report. I vote
      "no."
     Mr. THOMPSON. when his name was called, said: I am not in favor of the majority report. I am
      opposed also to the minority report, and if there is not some amendment I give notice that I
      shall vote against the bill. I vote "no."
     The vote was announced as above.
     The majority report was concurred in.
     After several ineffectual motions to amend the bill was ordered engrossed.
    
    
     TAX ON TELEPHONES.
     The bill [H. R. 248] to tax telephone instruments, was read the second time.
     Mr. JEWETT: I introduced this bill. It is to repeal the present telephone law, passed two
      years ago.--This is not a bill to attempt to tax the telephone companies in the State, it is
      an attempt to tax the Bell Telephone Company. Their instruments are rented to the companies
      who operate exchanges at about sixteen dollars per year. This is an attempt to put a part of
      that grab into the State treasury. It has been suggested to me that the bill proposes an
      extreme tax, but for the purpose of getting the sense of the House I will move to strike out
      "two dollars" and put in "one dollar."
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     Mr. ACKMAN: I would be willing to support the bill of the gentleman from Floyd should the
      law already on the statute books with reference to the telephone be repealed, but as we have
      that, it deprives a large part of the State of the use of the telephone altogether. I doubt
      the wisdom of passing this bill until that law has been repealed. Therefore, I shall vote
      against his bill.
     Mr. GOUGH: It seems to me to impose the tax will simply be to impose an additional burden on
      the user of the telephone. If the Bell Telephone have to pay this tax will they not make the
      charges enough larger to cover this tax? This would be a tax to make every user of the
      telephone pay one or two dollars addition for their use. If there is any good reason for a law
      of that kind I fail to see it.
     Mr. REYNOLDS: The present telephone law fixes the rate of taxation, and if a two dollar tax
      is placed on each transmitter the company will simply increase the rental of the telephone, so
      that it will drive the telephone out of the State. I shall be opposed to the amendment.
     Mr. COX, of Miami: I don't understand why it is that gentlemen of the House talk about
      this bill as abolishing the telephone law. I do not know why it is that the members of this
      House seem to think it is a foregone conclusion that the telephone law passed two years ago is
      to be repealed. As far as I am concerned, I am opposed to the repeal of that law, and I
      believe that a majority of the members of this House are opposed to the repeal of the law. But
      a number of gentlemen object to this bill because, they say, if we put a tax of two dollars on
      these telephones the telephone law is repealed and it will work a hardship to the parties
      using the telephone. I believe the sentiment that is to-day in favor of the repeal of the law
      has been worked up by the Telephone Companies. I do not believe there is any spontaneous
      sentiment from the people of this State to repeal that law. I believe in getting some tax out
      of these soulless corporations. I believe that the Telephone Companies will still do business
      in this State, and still make from twenty five to fifty per cent. on their investment.
     Mr. KELLISON demanded the previous question.
     The House seconded the demand, and under its operations the amend-  ment (Mr. Jewett's) was adopted and the bill ordered
      engrossed.
    
    
     ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS EXEMPT FROM TAXATION.
     Mr. Foley's bill [H. R. 38] to exempt from taxation one hundred dollars of personal
      property, was read the second time.
     Mr. FOLEY: It appears like this bill has been returned from the committee without
      recommendation. I presume they saw in it some merits, and not having time to consider it they
      thought it best to return it. In regard to its merits, it only asks the State to concede to
      the people a part of the rights that they have as between each other. We have in this State an
      exemption law of six hundred dollars; that is to say, a man not worth over six hundred dollars
      cannot be compelled to pay his debt, but shall have six hundred dollars for the support of
      himself and family.--The State goes on further to say, although these men may not be worth
      fifty dollars, and that in the shape of the absolute necessaries of life, they must pay taxes
      upon them or it will sell them. I do not see any consistency in a law of this kind, in which
      it robs a man on one hand, and helps him up on the other. Now then, this bill seeks for
      nothing more than what is the law in many of the States of this Union. In the State of Kansas
      there is an exemption of two hundred dollars; in Ohio, fifty dollars. I do not see why Indiana
      with her boasted freedom should not help this class of people along. We all know that we have
      in this country a class of people who are born to be hewers of wood and drawers of water, and
      that they seldom or never pay any taxes, and the collection of these taxes costs more than it
      is worth.
    
    
     SIX PER CENT. INTEREST.
     Mr. KELLISON insisted upon the special order, which was the consideration of his bill [H. R.
      43] on its third reading, to reduce the rate of interest to 6%. Upon this he spoke at length,
      saying that the money loaned upon security in this State to-day would exceed $100,000,000,
      upon which, at 8%, the people would be paying yearly $8,000,000, or about one third of the
      wheat crop, and much as the entire corn crop of the State. That 8% was more than any
      legitimate business could pay. The continuation of this rate would force a large amount of
      property to sale.--Indiana goes into the market and borrows money for 3¼ to 4%, and yet
      permits her people to charge 8%, when if she had to borrow at the same rate, it would not be
      five years until she would be bankrupt.
     Mr. DAVIS: The position which I will take on the measure now before the House may be
      somewhat unpopular, but nevertheless I believe myself upon the side of truth. It has been but
      a short time since one gentleman on the floor of this House denounced as buncombe a resolution
      offered asking Senators and Representatives in Congress from this State to vote to the widow
      of a gallant officer in the Union armies a pension. That is what I think about this
      measure--is just simply a buncombe bill. In opposing this bill I would not have it understood
      that in any way I represent the Shylocks; I would not have it understood that I am a money
      lender. I do not believe that there is another member on this floor whose financial condition
      is as bad as my own; but I oppose this bill because I believe it is a fruitless attempt to
      strike down the pillar on which the business interests of our State rest. I believe that money
      is only a commodity and its value rests on the very same principle that gives value to other
      commodities. If I have one hundred dollars and I invest it in a horse and hire that horse for
      livery purposes, I have the right to charge all I can get for it. On the other hand, suppose I
      have one hundred dollars and I have a chance to lend it at a certain rate per cent., the law
      in tones of thunder says "No, you shall not take a higher rate of interest than 8%."
      If we cannot enforce the present law how are we going to enforce a more severe law? It seems
      to me that it would be an utter failure.--This law is evaded in all ways that human ingenuity can invent. Why is that, I ask? It is simply because
      Legislature attemped to step outside of its just and proper sphere of legislation. If I borrow
      money I do it for gain to myself, and the man who lends it does it for gain to himself. If it
      was not for this, there would be no business. Suppose the law of Indiana permitted 12% or 14%
      interest, would it be possible to lend money at that rate? It would be utterly impossible. The
      reason is there is not that demand for money, and that is the reason why money cannot be
      loaned at 18%. Suppose that money would become plentiful, could any man get 8% for his money?
      Of course not, money would drop and no one could get 8%. A gentleman in this House, only a few
      hours ago, told me be knew of an amount of money, twelve hundred dollars, that had been loaned
      without security at 3%, and at the same time, the laws of the State of Indiana allow 8%. Why
      was this? Because that was all the demand there was for money in that place.--The condition of
      business must regulate this.
     I object to this bill for another reason: Suppose this bill is passed and some unforeseen
      business calamity comes, and prices should advance on all kinds of property, money with the
      rest. The law attempts to step in unjustly and say that money shall be worth 6%,--it attempts
      an impossibility. There are a number of States which have no such a thing as a usury law. I
      will have to vote against that bill because I believe it is simply a piece of foolishness;
      because it is the 
       Legislature
       Legislatnre
       attempting to step in and do what it never has done and never will do, regulate
      prices of commodities. Value is based on the law of supply and demand, and that will regulate
      everything in the channels of legitimate business.
     Mr. MOCK: We ought to look at the practical working of such a law. If this bill becomes a
      law it will be a great detriment to the people of the State of Indiana. If I thought that a
      law could cause interest to be one per cent. I would vote for it. It has been said by the
      gentleman from Marshall (Mr. Kellison) that there has been $1,000,000 loaned to the people of
      the State of Indiana. He further said that in times past some of these farms have been taken
      in by eastern capitalists. In 1871-'72-'73 money could not be borrowed in the State
      of Indiana for 9%. How is it now? I believe this will be true, that out of the millions of
      dollars loaned to farmers, if we reduce the rate to 6%, many of these farms will be taken
      in.--If this bill becomes a law I believe capital will be taken from the State, leaving
      everybody in debt. I do not believe a law should be passed to dictate to a man that, if he
      takes more than 6%, he cannot get any of it, either the principal or interest.--There is no
      law to dictate to a man what he shall sell his hogs or his grain for. I believe if the present
      law contines that the demand and supply of money will reduce the rate of interest. If the
      mortgages were off the farms to-day we could keep out the eastern money, and I would then vote
      for this bill; but this is not the case.
     Mr. VAN SLYKE: This question seems to me to be of considerable importance. The gentleman
      from Wells (Mr. Mock) has been calling our attention to the rate of interest in surrounding
      and adjoining States. I find that there are a number that he gives at 6%. It seems to me that
      that measure is proper and right. In this State we have strangled young men's ambition
      and aspirations--broad and deep, high and noble. They have struggled to get a home that they
      can call their own. They borrow money at 8%, probably with the interest payable in advance.
      These men work for one dollar and ten or one dollar and thirty-five cents per day. I say, in
      the name of justice and right, when can these men build themselves homes and pay such an
      exorbitant rate of interest? It is said that this bill will drive out foreign capital. I doubt
      it very much, but I am here to do what I think is right before God and man; it seems to me
      that this  bill is just and right, and I shall vote for
      it, and work and speak for it.
     Mr. FLEECE: I regard this as one of the most important bills. I look at this question just
      in this light: If we reduce the rate of interest from 8% to 6%, that would have a tendency to
      drive a great portion of capital from the State. Money will go where it can be invested to the
      best advantage. We must reason from cause to effet,--will that not be the natural effect?
     Another pointra great many of our people have money borrowed, and they have given a mortgage
      on their land. This bill would compel the man who loaned the money to reduce the rate to 6%,
      and the result will be that he would foreclose the mortgage. I am confident that in Hendricks
      county it would simply send them out of house and home. It is as natural for a man to seek an
      investment where he can do the best, as it is for water to run down hill.
     Mr. WHITE: I am inclined to support this bill, and the argument, so far as I have heard it,
      has only strengthened me in that resolution.--I am not very old, but I have reached that point
      where I am not very easily frightened. I remember when the last reduction in the rate of
      interest was made; (I did not then have the honor, if honor it be, of being a member of the
      the Legislature;) there were arguments made against this bill, and I was inclined to believe
      them--the arguments were plausible; but the bill passed, the reduction was made; and, so far
      as the city from which I come is concerned, none of the calamities have been the legitimate
      result of said legislation. It occurs to me that the arguments made against this bill would be
      arguments against any usury law. It has become the settled policy of the State that some law
      upon this subject shall be passed. It is said the law, as at present, is simply an invitation
      to charge a greater and a larger rate than if there was no law at all, and I believe that is
      true. It is a fact, and I suppose most gentlemen know it to be true, that large borrowers are
      enabled now to borrow money at the very rate that this bill proposes to fix as universal; but
      the men who borrow small amounts, although they may be able to give just as good security, are
      compelled to pay 8% interest, because the money-lender says to him, "that is the
      law--that is the legal rate." All this talk about money running away from the State I do
      not believe there is anything in.--Money is careful and cautious. You need never be fearful
      but that the farms of Indiana, with the soil of our State furnishing the best security upon
      earth, will always be sufficient security for such amount of money as is needed.
     Mr. GOUGH: One of the first things that I did on coming here was to write a bill on the
      subject of interest and reducing the rate to 6%. I believe that the majority of my people wish
      the rate of interest so reduced. I did not, however, put in one of the provisions,--that is,
      to make the contracts made for more than 8% void; and I cannot say that I like that amendment,
      but in order to have the interest reduced to 6% I am willing to take it with that provision
      making the entire contract void in case more than 6% is taken. I do not think that the people
      of Warrick county are sensitive in this matter, yet I believe that twenty thousand of the
      people in that county, which I represent on this floor, will not be fairly represented unless
      I vote for six per cent. I do prefer to represent the 20,000 people who work for their living,
      who toil on the farms, who work in the shops or the mines; I do prefer to represent these
      people than to represent the two thousand whose interests will be advanced by the continuation
      of interest at the eight per cent. rate. If 8% was a fair compensation for the use of money in
      1879; 6% will be a fair compensation now. I see by a table before me that in 1879 the highest
      price of wheat was $1,60 per bushel. The farmer then could pay his interest. Now, what can the
      farmer do? The highest price in 1884 was $1,05, and we all know it is much less now. So in
      1884 it took one-third more labor to pay the interest
      than it did when the law was enacted. Now, what is the condition of the lender? In 1879 he
      could buy a certain amount of products with his interest. Now, in 1887, he can buy a least
      one-third more of these products. I do not think that we can advance the interest of this
      State by granting privileges to one class of people.
     The gentleman from Hendricks (Mr. Fleece) suggests if this bill is enacted that capital will
      leave the State. He said that there would be a demand for capital in other States. It takes
      something more than demand,--it takes security. Indiana farms are the security that capital is
      seeking, and here capital will stay. There are several States of this Union where the lender
      can only secure 6% on his money, and in many of these States if he takes more than 6% he
      forfeits the entire contract. I think Indiana should not be behind these States; and in the
      interest of the whole people--in the interest of her men and women who toil--in the interest
      of men and women who are trying to secure some of the benefits and advantages of this life, I
      am willing that the men who have already secured a competency should lose some of their
      advantages in behalf of the many; and for this reason I shall vote for this bill.
     Mr. ROBINSON: I agree that the law of supply and demand has much to do with reference to
      this commodity, money, and I believe that the greatest relief that could come to the people,
      not only of Indiana but of all the States of this Union, would be to supply the people with a
      sufficient amount of money for the business of the country. It is a most important commodity
      in carrying on the business of our country, and it ought to be supplied in a volume
      commensurate with the business wants of the country.
     Mr. DAVIS: Can't any one go into the National banking business who wants to?
     Mr. ROBINSON: No, sir. The gentleman may be able to, but I am not by a large majority, and I
      further state that it is a privilege extended to a class. Now, since the scarcity of money
      makes the demand large in proportion as money is scarce, upon a principle and law of supply
      and demand, they are enabled to procure a higher rate of interest; and unless we have a law to
      step in and give protection to us, as a people, we are left entirely at the mercy of the money
      power; which ought to be otherwise.--This is why I favor a law making it otherwise. Of the
      money loaned within the State of Indiana which comes from the eastern States, very little is
      loaned at a rate above 6%, much of it at a lower rate than 6%. Hence the claim by some
      gentlemen that this bill if enacted as a law will drive from Indiana foreign money, does not
      hold. The money loaned within the State of Indiana at 8%, or at any rate above 6%, is loaned
      mostly by Indiana capitalists. The rate of interest ought to be reduced because many of our
      citizens are now involved, or mortgages are upon their little homes and farms, and they are
      discouraged. Many of them have given up the fight after spending the best efforts of their
      lives to accumulate a little property of their own.
     If I understand the constituency that I represent, and I think I do to some extent, my
      people are not alarmed at any measure of this kind.
     Pending the discussion--
    
    
     LOANS BY COUNTIES.
     The SPEAKER, by unanimous consent--Mr. Kellison in the chair--introduced a bill [H. R. 298]
      to allow the County Commissioners, in counties having an assessed valuation of property of
      $10,000,000, to loan not more than $10,000 to agricultural societies, the amount loaned not to
      exceed one-half of the value of property owned by the society. On his further motion, the bill
      finally passed the House under a suspension of the constitutional restriction.
     The House adjourned.
    
   
   
   
    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    IN SENATE.
    
     WEDNESDAY, February 9, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Hon. W. J. Davis, a Senator from the county of
     Elkhart.
    
     SURETIES' RELIEF.
     Mr. Howard's (of St. Joseph) bill [S. 5] for
      relief of the sureties of W. McKee Merrifield, a former trustee of Penn township, St. Joseph
      county, was read the third time.
     Mr. JOHNSON: Every session of the Legislature sees an increased number of applications of
      this kind for relief. I am aware this bill does not propose to relieve the principal, but it
      seems to me it is going entirely too far. The court held them to a liability, and why should
      the Legislature seek to overturn the judgment of the court? It is said that some citizens
      interested have petitioned for it; but we all know that men who have gone security for other
      men can go to the people and get them, with or without thought or reflection, to sign such a
      petition. We should act under a high sense of public duty; and it seems to me the public
      interests involved are jeopardized by this class of legislation. It is asking too much that
      the Legislature should relieve men from the effect of their own negligence. I desire to place
      myself, here and new, as being opposed to the principles involved in this bill.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: We are not asked to remit the penalty or any part of it, but
      simply an incident of the penalty. The people of that county have received every cent of the
      principal, and now the Senator from that district, who is supposed to represent, the will of
      the people there, presents a petition from a large number of citizens asking us to remit not
      the penalty but simply an incident of that penalty. I think it is our duty to pass this
      bill.
     Mr. McDONALD: The people up there got every cent of the principal and
      they think the securities should be relieved from paying interest. I fully agree with the
      Senator from Wayne (Mr. Johnson) about the principle involved, but the State of Indiana does
      not propose to reap any advantage out of this little thing.
     Mr. JOHNSON: The State should enforce a high standard of 
       official
       officia
       honor.
     Mr. McDONALD: Certainly.
     Mr. HOWARD, of St. Joseph: The principal surety had an understanding that he could pay from
      time to time as he was able, and he has paid from year to year some thirteen pay- ments, ranging from eight hundred dollars down to fifty dollars, as
      fast he could, out of his income. That income has disappeared now; he is an old gentleman; at
      one time a member of this Legislature. This old gentleman is now at the end of life, or nearly
      so, and is unable to pay more. The citizens there have petition after petition here for this
      bill. A township trustee sent me an additional two hundred and fifty names, and he stated that
      he could obtain every man in the county to sign it if necessary.
     The bill passed by yeas 35, nays 7.
     Mr. DRESSER, explaining, said: In view of the fact that a majority of the tax-payers of the
      township petition for the passage of this bill, I vote "aye."
    
    
     THE DEATH PENALTY.
     Mr. Johnson's bill [S. 26] prescribing the place
      and manner of public executions, was read the third time.
     Mr.JOHNSON: The obect and purpose of this bill is the interest of public morals, to secure
      economy and make public executions more effective. An execution costs from three hundred
      dollars up; I am told of one that cost one thousand dollars; and it is well known, because of
      the inexperience of sheriffs, there have been bungling; I have heard of the condemned falling
      from the gallows on two or three occasions, and one was most horrifying. It is better to have
      one executioner in the State than ninety-two.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: While I would not, by anything I might say or do, imperil
      the passage of this bill, yet in obedience to the manner in which I have been taught I desire
      to offer the following:
     Mr. President:--I move to refer the bill to a committee of one, with instructions to strike
      out all after the enacting clause, and insert in lieu thereof the following: "That the
      death penalty as a punishment for crime in this State is hereby abolished."
     Section 2. All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this act are hereby repealed.
     I and amazed that the Senator from Wayne (Mr. Johnson), representing as he does a peaceable
      constituency, should advocate a relic of barbarism--the last connecting link which has been
      handed down from a different age. No wonder he desires to hide it. But he suggests that would
      be more likely to deter others from crime. If there is any terror in the death penalty it
      should be made public. I simply ask that a vote be had on this amendment.
     It was rejected by yeas 10, nays 37.
     Pending the, roll-call--
     Mr. CAMPBELL said: I vote "no"; but it calls for a word of explanation. I would
      not have done so twenty years ago, but as I grow older I have come to the conclusion that
      there are some men you cannot dispose of so well as to hang them. Although I have a large
      class among my constituents opposed to the death penalty--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [interrupting]: Does the Senator think some of his constituents
      ought to be hanged?
     Mr. CAMPBELL: No sir, but from what I have heard there are some over in Jennings county.
      [Laughter.]
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: That leaves me a little to the left.
     Mr. DRESSER, when his name was called, said: Like the Senator from Hendricks (Mr. Campbell)
      I was for many years opposed to capital punishment, but circumstances which have occurred in
      the last few years convinces me that some people are better dead than alive. I vote
      "no."
     Mr. SHIVELY: I desire to say that away back in the year 1839, I believe it was, when the
      question of abolishing capital punishment was a question in your Legislature, I was an humble
      member of that body and I voted to abolish capital punishment. I have been a member of the
      Legislature several sessions since, but I have regarded that vote as the brightest vote I ever
      gave in a legislative body. I vote to abolish capital punishment; I vote "aye."
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the substitute amendment was rejected.
     Those voting in the affirmative were: Senators Andrews, Branaman, DeMotte, Griffith, Howard
      of St. Jo- seph, Macy, Schroyer, Shively, Urmston and the
      President.
     The bill passed by yeas 43, naye 2.
    
    
     COAL MINING.
     Mr. Sears' bill [S. 29] to regulate the mining of coal, was read the third time.
     Mr. THARP: With the main features in this bill I concur most heartily; but I think this bill
      ought to have a provision in it relating to the kind of screenings; otherwise employers might
      take advantage of miners and miners of employers. The rule is, to some extent, imperfect. In
      some States there is a law prescribing the kind of screen. I think this bill ought to pass
      with some amendment to that effect. Miners ought to receive pay for such screenings as is
      marketed, a price commensurate with what that kind of coal sells for in the market.
     Mr. SEARS: This bill was handed to me by miners from my county with a request that I present
      it to the Senate. There is a difference between slack and nut coal. About every fifth car they
      mine is composed of nut coal for which the operator receives quite a considerable amount of
      money.--The miners get nothing for that nut coal they mine, and that is the reason they ask
      that this bill be passed. I understand this is the law in Missouri and has worked well in that
      State. I have said if this bill passes and becomes a law it will work a hardship to the
      miners. So I said on the passage of House Bill 14 and
      Senate Bill No. 2. I said these bills would work an injury to miners, the very persons sought
      to be benefitted by the passage of these bills. But they have said to me this bill should
      become a law--they ask its passage by this General Assembly--consequently I shall vote for the
      passage of this bill, and if it works an injury to them I have done my duty and my skirts are
      clear, for upon them rests the responsibility of the injury, and they will have to bear the
      burden. I presume they ought to know what they desire, and as a representative of their
      interests I ask the passage of this bill.
     Mr. DAVIS: In my opinion this bill ought not to pass. It seems to me the passage of this
      bill would enable class of people to take advantage of what may be a great wrong. I understand
      from information given, to the Committee on Mining, that the whole business
      of mining coal is conducted in the States of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, under a
      kind of arrangement between the miners and owners; and that the miners are paid a certain rate
      per ton or bushel for mining screened coal. It is a question of diligence as to how much their
      wages shall be. Now this bill proposes there shall be a new arrangement which will affect the
      present arrangement. This bill deserves some consideration. I am informed by the author of the
      bill he will consent that it be referred to a committee which may obviate some objections.
      With that understanding I yield the floor.
     On motion by Mr. SEARS, the bill was recommitted to the Committee on Mines and
       Mining.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     TEACHERS' TOWNSHIP INSTITUTES.
     Mr. Sellers' bill [S. 88] that one Saturday in each month shall be devoted to township
      institutes, was read the third time.
     Mr. DUNCAN, of Tipton: We have a good many teachers who are conscientiously opposed to
      laboring on the seventh day of the week, and we should allow County Boards to arrange
      institutes so the teachers may not be compelled to violate their consciences. I know capable
      teachers who would forfeit their pay rather than violate their conscience in this respect.
      Then the bill should provide these institutes be held in the first of the school term. It is
      hard work for teachers in the country to attend the last of the school term.--[He offered an
      amendment embracing these suggestions.]
     Mr. McDONALD: I don't agree that these institutes should be held on
      any other day than Saturday. I think, sir, that has become almost a common law amongst school
      teach- ers. If held on any other day the children would
      lose an entire school day.
     Mr. FOWLER: I am opposed to the amendment and opposed to the bill in toto. I think it is all
      wrong in principle. It is paying these teachers to do what they are employed to do--to perfect
      themselves to follow their profession. You might as well propose to pay the legal fraternity,
      the medical fraternity, or the ministerial fraternity to qualify themselves to follow their
      professions. Now I am in favor of holding these institutes on Saturday. I don't think the
      school week ought to be broken into. And I am in favor of teachers attending these institutes
      free of charge. I don't think there are many teachers in Indiana who have conscientious
      scruples about working on Saturday. I have not heard anything of that kind our way.
     Mr. SELLERS: After having reflected upon the matter I do not think this amendment will do
      munch harm, because in nearly every part of the State institutes will be held on Saturday;
      teachers will insist upon that, because it will enable them to earn one more day's wages.
      As to the other amendment I am inclined to think it should be made. I only want teachers to
      receive compensation for the time they spend in the public service. The Bill of Rights says
      that property--and their time is their property--shall not be taken without just compensation;
      nor shall any man's time be taken by the State without just compensation being given. He
      ought to be paid for the time he spends in the public service, no matter if he is benefitted.
      That time ought not to be taken from any man unless he receives wages such as he receives for
      teaching during the rest of the week. As it is now, teachers go to these institutes simply
      from compulsion; and in many districts the trustees do not insist upon their going, and
      therefore in one-half the counties there has not been an institute held during the entire
      school year. So the law, as it now stands, is inoperative.
     The amendments (Mr. Duncan's, of Tipton,) were agreed to, and the bill passed the
      Senate by yeas 42, nays 3.
    
    
     PAY OF EMPLOYEES.
     Mr. BARRETT: I move to take up the motion made to reconsider the vote by which Senate Bill
      No. 2 was passed; and I move to lay that motion on the table.
     Mr. WINTER: The Senator from Laporte may desire to be heard on his motion.
     Mr. WEIR: I am not here to beg any favors. I understand there are Senators who desire to be
      heard.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Will the Senator from Allen withdraw his motion and let the
      Senator from Laporte be heard?
     Mr. WEIR: I do not desire that the motion be withdrawn on that plea.
     The motion was rejected by yeas 17, nays 27.
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. CAMPBELL said: Unfortunately not being present to go on record as voting against this
      bill, I now cheerfully vote "no."
     Mr. MCDONALD, when his name was called, said: I voted for this bill
      before and intend to vote for it again, but I am in favor of fairness and don't propose
      to cut Senators off from discussing a measure of so much importance. I vote
      "no."
     Mr. THARP, in explanation of his vote, said: I am unwilling to cut off gentlemen from
      discussing measures, but this bill has been agitating the Senate for two or three days during
      which it has been thoroughly discussed, and I am of opinion if discussed for a week no votes
      would be changed, and in order to get shed of it I vote "aye."
     Mr. WINTER: As Senators desire to discuss this motion to reconsider I vote
      "aye."
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the motion was rejected.
     Mr. WEIR: I am opposed to the passage of this bill in its present form for the reason that I
      believe there is no demand for any such legislation. I believe such legislation is perni-cious. I believe if Senators will carefully examine this
      bill, and see its defects and the effect it will have upon the business interests of the
      State, they will be able to discover that it will not accomplish the purpose or end in view by
      the Senator who introduced the bill. I intend to confine my remarks at this time to some
      suggestions in relation to section three. You will find the lien persons would have, by this
      section, upon the property of their employers is very general and sweeping in its provisions.
      I will read that section.--[Reads.] Now, this lien not only applies to that class of property
      which the employe has, by his labor, contributed in making, but it also applies to all
      property used in or about the business. Take a manufacturer on a small scale who employs but
      few, or, if you see fit, a large number of hands, and it becomes necessary for him to borrow
      money, will any Senator tell me how he will be able to do so by mortgaging the property he
      uses in business? It will be practically impossible to do so. What has he to give as security
      if he has nothing else but the property engaged in his business? He is told by the
      money-lender: "I have no way of knowing the amount of these liens; if I loan you money I
      will have no means of determining what your liabilities will be, and I am likely to lose the
      debt."--The result will be, all the smaller manufactories will be absorbed by the larger
      ones. It would be more appropriate to entitle this bill "a bill to do away with the
      smaller industries of the State."
     A further objection to this bill is, that persons who are competent and well qualified to
      judge as to contracts they make, are prohibited, by the terms of this bill, from making
      contracts. In the history of legislation no such measure as this can be pointed out in this
      State or any other.--These are, very briefly, the reasons I desire a reconsideration of the
      vote.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Does this close the debate?
     Mr. FOWLER: It seems so. Question.
     Mr. BARRETT: I thought the other day this bill received a full and fair consideration; and
      the majority given it, when it passed the Senate, confirmed me in the opinion that a large
      majority were its real friends. Now, the Senator from Laporte tells us there is no demand for
      this kind of legislation. As I said the other day, the first plank in the platform of
      organized labor demands just such legislation as this, and it is because I believe the demand
      is right and just that I have introduced this bill in the Senate, and advocate its
      passage.--And not only that, but almost every laboring man in the country outside of organized
      labor is demanding this kind of legislation. It is not on behalf of small employers that
      objection is made to this bill. The small sum of money necessary to pay their men is not a
      sufficient inducement for them to withhold it a month. The objection comes from large
      corporations, especially railroads, and why? Because these large corporations find the
      interest on the large sum of money necessary to pay their employes is a sufficient inducement
      to withhold their rightful dues from the laboring men. I have no doubt this bill is altogether
      objectionable to the railroad companies, because I heard a representative of one of them say
      they paid out $180,000 a month. The interest on $180,000 for a month, and multiplied by twelve
      each year, makes quite an inducement for them to withhold the just demands from laboring men.
      I fail to see why it is any greater hardship to compel railroad companies, which employ
      one-half the wage-workers of this State, to pay their employes twice every month, than it is
      to compel an individual firm or small corporation to do so.
     Much has been said against that clause which prohibits a contract. That amendment was
      introduced by the distinguished Senator from Marion, Mr. Winter, who has offered some good
      amendments which it has been my pleasure to accept, because it was to the interest of the
      laboring man, in whose interest the bill was introduced. Without that provision  every employer can compel his employe to sign a contract that he
      will not demand his money except at such times as his employer chooses to pay. It is idle to
      talk about men standing on an equality in making a contract. A man supporting his family by
      his daily labor, with starvation staring him in the face, standing against a mans with
      thousands in his pockets; there is no equality there.--And any law that does not seek to
      protect the poor man against such inequality is a fraud.
     The Senator from Laporte has suggested that he would be in favor of some kind of a lien, but
      he has failed to inform the Senate what kind. He is opposed to a lien upon property, because
      they can't borrow money; but he is not opposed to the money-lender coming in and securing
      his loan. If the Senator could suggest an equitable and just lien to protect these men, I, for
      one, was willing to accept it; but I have heard no such suggestion, and I think it fair to as
      to assume the the opponents of this bill are opposed to any kind of lien. I hope this bill
      will stand as it has been fairly passed by the Senate.
     Mr. KENNEDY: I voted against this bill because I thought it was against the laboring man. I
      am not opposed to the laborer having a lien upon all property; it is the other provisions of
      the bill I am opposed to.--I think there is a great deal of humbuggery in this bill, anyhow. I
      am wholly in the interests of the laboring man without any humbuggery about it.
     Mr. JOHNSON: The arguments advanced on this floor in opposition to this bill have at no time
      been answered. I have heard gentlemen talk about what is due organized labor; and I have heard
      talk, designed to reach the ears of the gallery, about men who delve in mines and work in
      shops; and I have heard it said we would hear from the people in the future. I am one of those
      who are not afraid to hear from the people. The moment you enact such legislation as this,
      that moment you cripple and bring disaster upon those who work. The principle involved in the
      question of mechanics lien has been looked upon suspiciously by eminent lawyers. What is urged
      in this bill is not necessary for the protection of labor. It is unexampled in the laws of the
      State. It has been fairly demonstrated here that men of moderate means, without money to pay
      their laborers every two weeks, by this bill would be turned out upon the country without an
      opportunity to compete with others more favored; and the effect will be that those
      corporations which possess money, and can pay without trouble, will get complete and thorough
      monopoly of manufacturing. This bill would enable them to crush labor under their feet.
     Mr TRIPPET: There has been a good deal said in this discussion about the lien provided for
      in this bill. The lien provided for in this bill is as just as any lien ever given to any man
      or to any company. You examine the statutes of the State and you will find the man who
      furnishes material that goes into a building is secured by his lien; the man who works upon
      the building, the carpenter, the mason, the plumber, the man who hauls and the man who carries
      the hod, in the construction of the building, is entitled to his lien, and these men are
      secured under a lien. But there is a great class of labor in this country which is not
      secured--the laborers in the mines and in the machine shops have no remedy, and if their
      company fails they lose their money. This bill provides nothing unreasonable. If any man
      desires to loan a manufacturing company money, all he has to do is to see that the company
      complies with this law. Wherever that is done the mortgage is in no danger. I hope, gentleman,
      this bill will not be reconsidered. It is a demand from the laboring people of this country
      that ought to be answered fairly and honestly.
     Mr. HUSTON: When this bill was under consideration I voted for it, but said at the time I
      was disinclined to do it because I felt a proper consideration had not been given to it; still
      I felt constrained, feeling kindly to-  wards
      wage-workers, to do what could be done for them. I believe now, having considered the matter
      more fully, that the enactment of such a law as this, instead of being for the benefit of
      wage-workers, will work a positive injury to them. Believing that, I cannot vote otherwise
      than to reconsider the vote on the passage of the bill. And I am ready to say this: If this
      motion to reconsider prevails--if gentlemen who have been pushing forward this bill simply to
      do that which will prove beneficial to the wage-worker, I will join hands with them--let the
      objectionable features be taken from the bill, and I will vote in support of the measure when
      it comes to the final issue. The bill requires what I regard as an impossibility. I feel
      assured there are railroad companies in Indiana which cannot make out their pay-rolls fourteen
      days; so, even if they had the information, they could not employ sufficient force of clerks
      to keep up their pay-roll in proper shape to pay every two weeks. Of course the question is on
      reconsideration. It cannot be said that I represent any large corporation; it, cannot be said
      the position I take is because of any connection I have with any large corporation; it cannot
      be said on account of any selfish interest I have, but it is simply in the interest of
      wage-workers themselves.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: I have not heard of any demand for this bill. I am not speaking of demands by
      resolutions, or by organized bodies, but I am speaking of actual demand based on the charge
      that laborers have not received pay for their labor heretofore. Here is a bill that proposes
      to require pay for labor every two weeks. As far as my knowledge goes, in thirty-five years
      there is not a man who has not received full pay for his labor in any kind of employment. Now,
      if any Senator will state any large body of men who are not being paid for their labor, some
      legislation might be needed. As far as I know there is no demand for this bill.
     Mr. BARRETT: In what better way can we learn of a demand for legislation than by large
      bodies of passing resolutions?
     Mr. CAMPBELL: The resolution means nothing. The point I that the men who want employ if the
      evil exists, should make the demand, and not those who pass resolutions on the subject. I
      claim to be one myself. I like to see an honest man employed and get his pay promptly. You are
      making a great mistake. What an honest laboring man wants is to find an employer, and, I take
      it, he is not very particular whether he gets his pay once in two weeks or once a month, so he
      gets his money. He says, "I want work." You say in this bill to an employer "If
      you are not prepared to pay money at the end of two weeks, you shan't employ labor."
      I say the advocacy of this bill is in the in interest of capitalists. The fact of the business
      is, the whole system of legislation in this class of bills is absolutely vicious,--against the
      policy of the Government; is wrong, and will prove disastrous. I believe, if this bill passes,
      it will be a dead letter.--I am glad the motion to reconsider has been made, it will give me a
      chance to vote against it. I will take the risk of the future cool, dispassionate judgment of
      laboring men. You mistake when you think the laboring men of this country are not thinking
      men. A laboring man knows you can't pass a law that will reverse whole plan of public
      business. A laboring man is not a baby, either, to require the protection of the benevolent
      legislation this bill proposes.--They have got fair horse-sense, and we want to let them alone
      as to making their own contracts.
     Mr. BAILEY: This measure was fairly discussed, and upon the final vote received thirty-five,
      I think, against thirteen. Why this sudden change of sentiment is coming over the body, is
      something very surprising indeed. It has been asked, is there a demand for this legislation?
      It seems to me there is a very widespread and very universal demand throughout the State for
      it. What does this bill propose to do? It sim- ply makes
      the laboring men preferred creditors over and above all other creditors except those who hold
      purchase-money mortgages. If a railroad cannot afford to pay the men who produce its profits,
      it ought not to be in business. I believe in encouraging small institutions, but they ought to
      grow gradually and take such responsibilities as they can meet. They should not desire to live
      and flourish on the losses of men who depend upon daily labor for bread--I can see no reason
      why any gentleman who voted for this bill on its final passage should change his vote now.
     Mr. SMITH, of Wells: I believe it proper and right to advocate whatever will benefit the
      majority of the people, although it may be detrimental to the minority, and I will give my
      doubts in favor of the laborer.--There are a great many poor men who cannot afford to do
      without the money they earn as long as four weeks. I think this bill is for the purpose of
      protecting men who labor; I believe such a law would benefit a majority of laborers in
      Indiana, and therefore I am in favor of the bill.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Senator from Laporte has the floor to close the debate.
     Mr. WEIR: I frankly said, when I voted for the passage of this bill, that I would move a
      reconsideration. I did that in the utmost good faith. It is frequently done. All legislation
      should be thoroughly and carefully considered. I think I am justified in saying that no
      legislation of this kind can be found in the history of this State, or in any other; it is
      entirely unknown, and something that has never heretofore been attempted. I believe this bill
      to be one of the most pernicious measures ever presented to a legislative body, and I believe
      it will prove injurious to the very class those who advocate it claim it is intended to
      benefit. I defy any person to point me to a single instance where laboring men have asked this
      Legislature to say to them "You are not sufficiently intelligent to make your own
      contract, and you must be put in tutelage, and the Legislature must say you are not fit to
      make a contract in relation to your own affairs."
     The motion to reconsider was rejected by yeas 17, nays 29.
     Mr. WEIR introduced a bill [S. 235] concerning representations in contracts for life
      insurance.
     The Senate adjourned.
    
   
   
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
    
     WEDNESDAY, February 9, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Hon. Wm. M. Van Slyke, a Representative from the
     counties of Elkhart, Noble and DeKalb.
    
     SIX PER CENT. INTEREST.
     The discussion of Mr. Kellison's interest bill [H. R. 43] was resumed.
     Mr. BEASLEY: I believe that the subject under consideration is one worthy the careful
      attention of the members of the General Assembly. I expect to vote for the bill, but I do so
      with trembling and fear as to its effect on the people. The purpose of the bill is to protect
      those who cannot protect themselves--the small farmer and the poor man and the laborer. It has
      been said in reference to this matter that if this bill becomes a law every man will be able
      to borrow money alike; that the poor man who wants to borrow ten or fifty or a hundred
      dollars, can get it at the rate of six per cent. If I wished to borrow five thousand dollars
      and could give real estate security I could get it for six per cent., but if I wished to
      borrow fifty dollars for thirty days I could not get it for six per cent. The man who will be
      able to solve the great question that is now agitating the minds of the people will be looked
      on as a great man. I believe there are some features of this bill that are objectionable and
      that will not be satisfactory to the people, but as it has come to us in this way I shall be
      compelled to vote for it in its present shape.
     Mr. KELLISON: I desire, in concluding the debate on this bill, to answer some arguments that
      have been sprung since the adjournment last eve- ning. I
      do not believe that anything has been urged against the bill that requires an answer at my
      hands at this time except that argument that this bill will have the effect to repeal the law
      in reference to building and loan associations. In the first place I am not prepared to admit
      that this bill will have any such effect as has been stated. I had not studied its effect on
      building and loan associations when I framed the bill, but have since spent some moments in
      studying it and am now prepared to give the House my conclusions in question. It was not the
      intention of this bill to repeal that law. If that stands in the way of needed reform, I say
      wipe it out. I would ask gentlemen who it was that created these corporations--these building
      and loan associations? It was the law-making power of the State of Indiana. They are the
      creatures of the statute. I want to know whether the creature--the child of the State of
      Indiana--is to control the creator and the parent? That is the question. Whether a few puny
      corporations created under the laws passed by the Legislature--whether they are going to
      control their creator? Has it come to that pass, that corporations and associations created
      under the laws of the State of Indiana are going to assert their right against the State
      Legislature and dictate what the Legislature of the State shall or shall not do? Has the
      law-making power brought into being a power--a monster, that is going to dictate to it? If I
      remember, the first act that authorized these associations was passed in 1875. It was amended
      in 1881. In 1883 the Legislature enacted a law that repealed the old laws and gave a new
      statute. The capitalists, by investing their money in the stoke of these associations, are
      receiving from fifteen to eighteen per cent. on their investment, and they are receiving it at
      the expense of members who have forfeited their right by the non-payment of dues--the poor men
      that fell by the wayside in attempting to get themselves homes. One of the greatest sources of
      revenue is the money that has been put in there by honest laboring men who could not meet
      their payment on their stock. They charge eight per cent. on every dollar they loan in these
      associations, and they make a man pay a premium for getting a loan. I do not care what the
      effect of this bill is, whether it wipes this law from the statute book or not. I wish it
      would wipe it off the book. I regard them as nothing more than a financial grave-yard. No
      gentleman on this floor will dare meet these arguments. The poor men in these associations
      have to drop out at the way-side and lose their money. That is the operation of that law, and
      I do not care how soon it is wiped out from the statute book. We had two or three of these
      associations in my city and they became bankrupt, and no man ever got a home under those
      associations that could not have gotten it one-half easier in some other way. How can a bill
      that is going to reduce the interest in the State of Indiana hurt these associations if they
      are doing an honest business?
     Mr. KERCHEVAL demanded the previous question on the passage of the bill.
     The demand was seconded by the House, and under its operations the bill failed to pass--yeas
      41, nays 54.
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. BARNES, in explanation of his vote, said: Because I do not believe that it will have the
      effect which the friends of this measure claim for it--to reduce the price of interest on the
      loan of money; and because I believe that it will raise the price of money, and that it will
      be a hardship to the small borrower; and because I believe that the present law of supply and
      demand always has, does now, and always will regulate the price of commodities and their
      value; therefore I vote "no."
     Mr. GRIFFITHS, when his name was called, said: Believing, as I do, that the passage of this
      bill will have an injurious effect on the building and loan associations, and knowing as I do
      that there are fifty-five of these association in the city of Indi-  anapolis, and that five-sixths of the small homes that have
      recently been built here were built by the aid of these associations; and knowing that these
      associations are the very best safe-guards the State can have against anarchy and socialism, I
      vote "no."
     Mr. HARRELL, in explanation, said: I want to say that while I am in favor of reducing the
      rate of interest, the provisions of this bill are such that I cannot vote for it. The first
      reason is that, under a provision in this bill, no man who will loan his money would be safe
      in doing so. A man loans one thousand dollars to a person. It would only take a preponderence
      of evidence to show that the lender received usurious interest. He would then forfeit the
      entire contract and lose his one thousand dollars. I think that that would be very dangerous
      to the capital of the country, therefore I vote "no."
     Mr. IBACH, when his name was called, said: From my experience with building and loan
      associations I know that this bill will not affect these institution, therefore I vote
      "aye."
     Mr. JEWETT (explaining) said: I do not believe that this bill affects building and loan
      associations except as to the rate of interest to be charged, but I will not vote for it
      because I hold some fundamental views and this violates one of them. I do not believe that the
      private acts of men can be changed by legislation. I do not believe we can make money cheaper
      by making it scarcer, and for these reasons I vote "no."
     Mr. LINCK (in explanation): I cannot afford to support this bill because I believe it will
      drive capital from the State. Already several thousand dollars have left my city and been
      invested in Iowa, Kansas, Texas and other States, and it is very difficult to borrow money. I
      do not believe that poor men will be enabled to borrow small sums, because men cannot afford
      to lend small sums for such a low rate of interest; therefore I vote "no."
     Mr. MAJOR, in explanation of his vote, said: Believing that if this bill becomes a law that
      a poor man who wants to borrow a small sum of money can never procure a loan; believing that
      this bill will repeal the law relative to building and loan associations; believing that they
      are the best associations in the State of Indiana and are doing more to benefit the poor man
      man than all other institutions put together; believing that in my town no interest stands
      higher in the love of the people than the building and loan association, I vote
      "no."
     Mr. METZGER, when his name was called, said: Representing a farming community where the
      State Grange passed the following resolution: [Reads a resolution favoring the rate of
      interest at six per cent.] I vote "aye."
     Mr. MILLER, in explaining his vote, said: It is not because I am opposed to six per cent. as
      the law of the State, but it is because of the unwise provision in this bill, that whoever is
      so fortunate as to have a little money to loan, if it is loaned at more than six per cent.
      interest, not only loses the interest but the principal also, that I vote "no."
     Mr. MORSE, when his name was called, said: I am in favor of reducing the rate of interest to
      six per cent., but believing as I do that this will affect building and loan associations
      injuriously, and as these are popular institutions among working men, I vote
      "no."
     Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Owen, (in explanation) said: Believing that the best interests of the
      State of Indiana demand this legislation; believing, also, that the depreciation in real
      estate of the State of Indiana comes largely from the high rate of interest that is charged, I
      am constrained to vote as I do. While I am a member of quite a number of building and loan
      associations, yet I believe that such legislation is right, and I think we ought at all times
      to do right, therefore I vote "aye."
     Mr. NIBLACK, explaining his vote, said: I do not believe any good can result from the
      passage of this bill; and for the further reason that I know in my own county there is many
      and  many a farmer who has mortgages on his farm on which
      he is paying eight per cent., and knowing he cannot pay these mortgages when they become
      due,and they will be foreclosed because the lenders will not lend money at six per cent., and
      will take their loans to other States; I say, believing it will be a hardship to those who
      have to borrow money I vote "no."
     Mr. PATTON, in explaining, said: Believing that six per cent. interest is all that is justly
      charged; believing that cheap money makes plenty of money; believing that a larger rate of
      interest will drive out the industries which have grown up in this country; believing it to be
      a fact that where there is a high rate of interest charged that property is dead, or nearly
      so; believing that the rate of interest is fixed by the confidence of the security and the
      time it shall run; believing that the time has arrived when the rate of interest is too high;
      believing that it will be conducive to the best interest of the business of Indiana; and also
      believing that capital will not be driven out but will be invited to come into this State.
      Believing all these things to be true, I vote "aye."
     Mr. REYNOLDS, exlaining his vote, said: Believing that experience in the subject of a low
      rate of interest justifies the rate to be established by this bill; believing that it will
      have a tendency to make money more free; believing it will enable a large class of men to
      borrow money that are not able to borrow it at the present time, and believing it will work
      beneficially, I vote "aye."
     Mr. ROBERTS, when his name was called, said: Believing this bill will result in one of the
      most salutary reforms, I vote "aye."
     Mr. SCHLEY, in explanation of his vote, said: Because I know that from five hundred to seven
      hundred small residences for working people have been erected in this city during the last two
      years that would never have been erected without the assistance of these building and loan
      associations, and because I believe this bill will injuriously affect these associations I
      vote "no."
     Mr. SHAMRAUGH, explaining his vote, said: Believing, as I do, that men who have accumulated
      fortunes are entitled to some rights as well as other people, I vote "no."
     Mr. THOMPSON, when his name was called, said: I have a recollection of this question being
      before the Legislature heretofore. The same arguments used now were used then, but the law was
      passed and capital was not driven out. Believing that this country demands a reduction of
      interest I vote "aye."
     Mr. WEYAND (explaining): We have a great many small borrowers in my part of the country,
      where the country is only partly developed, and the money is used improving the land. If the
      interest is reduced to a rate that capitalists will not loan their money we could not get
      money. I think the tendency of this bill will be to keep money in the hands of the
      capitalists. For this reson, I vote "no."
     The vote was then announced as above.
     So the bill failed to pass.
    
    
     A MILLION LOAN BILL.
     On motion by Mr. CAVEN, the House resolved iself into a Committee of the
       Whole (Mr. Gardiner in the chair) to consider the bill [H. R. 286] which provides
      for securing a loan of $1,000,000 at a rate of interest not greater than four per cent.
     Mr. CAVEN: I will endeavor, briefly, to explain the objects of this bill. Some days ago the
       Committee on Ways and Means reported on a bill providing for a loan of one
      million dollars and appropriations of very considerable sums of money. That bill and the
      report were sent back to the committee. We now report again on the bill. It is purely and
      simply a loan bill,--authorizing a loan of $1,000,000, on bonds running not less than ten nor
      more than twenty years, at a rate of interest not to exceed 4%. The question may arise, what
      is the necessity for the bill and what has led the committee to fix the amount? I would state
      something which I pre- sume you all already know: the
      treasury of Indiana is entirely exhausted, or at least will be in a few days. Warrants will
      have to be endorsed, "Not paid for want of funds." This bill does not contemplate
      nor does it create one single dollar of indebtedness. It is only undertaking to provide the
      means for indebtedness already created, appropriations already made, contracts entered into,
      work done and the money owing on contracts now in process of completion; one being this
      State-house, and the others being the three additional hospitals for the insane. The funds to
      meet this extraordinary expense must be had or the State must temporarily repudiate its
      obligations. [Mr. C. made statements concerning the necessities for a loan similar in
      character to those he makes on pages 269 and 270 of this book.]
     Mr. MAJOR: I believe if we provide in this bill that the rate shall be 4%, the money lenders
      will exact and demand that rate of interest, but if it is put beyond the power of the officers
      of this State to borrow money at a greater rate of interest than 3½%, then they will get the
      money at that rate without any difficulty. [He offered an amendment to insert "3½"
      instead of "4."]
     Mr. GORDON: It seems to me that motion ought not to prevail.--The bill passed two years ago
      provided for a maximum rate of 4% and the money was obtained for a little less than 3½%. I
      believe that these State officers will do the very best they can for the State.
     Mr. GROSE: The amendment is not very material; but there is no use for the amendment, none
      on earth. The bills of later years have always, put a maximum amount above the usual amount
      that was paid. Nobody expects but that the State authorities can obtain it, at least at
      3½%.
     The amendment was lost.
     Mr. PATTON moved that this committee recommend the indefinite postponement of the bill. He
      said: I do not propose to put my hand in the tax-payers' pockets without knowing what
      for. What is the necessity for appropriating a million dollars? No such a bill as this can
      have my sanction or my vote. The gentleman knows, if he can cast up a column of figures, that
      there is only $33,000, to make up the limit of $2,000,000, to complete the State-house. I do
      not think the gentleman understands the tenor of this House when he makes a statement, that we
      have any use for this money. We passed a law two years ago appropriating money to erect these
      Insane Hospitals, and what has become of the money? I must say there has been non-partisan
      management, and the result is, it has cost more than it would if we had an honest Republican
      or Democratic board to control the erection of these buildings. What necessity for
      appropriating any money for these Insane Asylums? During the last campaign they said there was
      no necessity. Before the law of 1883 was passed it was understood, and the Legislature
      intended it to be so, that neither of these institutions should cost more than $200,000.
     On motion, the committee rose, reported progress, and asked and obtained leave to sit again
      at 2 o'clock, p.m.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     The House resolved itself it Committee of the Whole (M. Gardiner in the
      chair) and resumed consideration of the loan bill.
     Mr. GORDON: I do think that this motion of the gentleman from Sullivan (Mr. Patton) ought
      not to prevail, [and presented reasons therefor.]
     Mr. GOUGH: The simple question is: shall the General Assembly authorize these State officers
      to borrows $1,000,000? Now, I do not think that the gentleman from Sullivan (Mr. Patton) has
      stated any reason why that should not be done, but I do think that the authorized officers of
      the State and the committees of this House have presented a reason, and a good reason, why
      this should be done. As a matter of course, there should be no money borrowed, unless it is
      actually needed.
     
     Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Owen: I believe if a bill of this character should pass the House it
      would be a little premature, before the general appropriation bill has been introduced and
      passed. I am in favor of the motion.
     Mr. VAN SLYKE: It seems to me that this is a mere matter of dollars and cents, and a matter
      that can be very easily computed and counted without any discrepancies. There has been a
      committee appointed by the Speaker of this House to investigate the State treasury. That
      committee will make its report to this House sooner or later, and that committee ought to be
      able to report the amount of money in the treasury of the State; or, if a deficit, the amount
      of that deficit. Then we can tell to a single cent just exactly what is needed.
     Mr. REYNOLDS: When the committee gives us an itemized statement of what this money is to be
      used for, I am willing to vote for a loan bill.--This Ways and Means
       Committee is provided for the purpose of going to the very bed-rock of this
      question, so that we can vote intelligently. In the report of the Governor and Auditor of
      State there are these itemized statements, but it may be possible that some of them are not
      necessary. The State, to-day, is in debt and running in debt all the time; taxes are piling
      up; and we should look closely and carefully at all measures of this kind. I am in favor of
      recommitting this bill to the committee with instructions that they give us an itemized
      account.
     Mr. HARRELL: The original contract was $2,000,000 for the construction of this building,
      that and no more.
     Mr. KELLISON: While I am a member of the Ways and Means Committee I am
      not ready at this time to vote to authorize the borrowing of $1,000,000, but I am prepared at
      any time to vote for a bill to borrow any sum that is necessary to meet the expenses of the
      State Government. I know that the Governor of the State has recommended the borrowing of money
      to meet extraordinary expenses of the State Government, and yet I have not see the facts and
      figures presented in such a concise and authoritative manner that would authorize me at this
      time in casting my vote to borrow $1,000,000.
     Mr. PATTON withdrew his motion for the indefinite postponement of the bill to allow Mr.
      KELLY to move that the Committee of the Whole report in favor of the
      recommittal of the bill, without instructions.
     Mr. BEASLEY made an ineffectual motion to reduce the loan to $600,000.
     The motion [Mr. Kelly's] was agreed to.
     Accordingly, the chairman of the Committee of the Whole made such a
      report to the House, and it was concurred in; so the bill was recommitted to the
       Committee on Ways and Means.
    
    
     STATE-HOUSE CONTRACTORS.
     The SPEAKER presented a memorial from Wm. B. Howard, for relief for losses incurred in the
      construction of the State-house, and asking the appointment of a special committee "to
      inquire into the premises and report by bill or otherwise."
     Mr. DAVIS moved to refer it to a special committee of five.
     Mr. GORDON: Look at the report of the State-house Commissioners and you will find that the
      original construction contract was for $1,500,000. That contract was prosecuted for two or
      three years. This man Howard is nothing more than a bondsman of the original contractors. This
      means simply that there ought to be a sum of money appropriated him for the losses sustained
      in building this State house. It will necessitate an examination into its construction from
      the time the contract was made up to this present time. I do not believe that the General
      Assembly can afford to go into that examination. I believe that when this State-House is
      completed and turned over to the State of Indiana that that ought to be an end of all
      this.
     Mr. IBACH: I do not believe that the great State of Indiana can afford to be penurious. I
      believe this question ought to go to this committee and
      that the committee ought to be allowed to make an investigation.--We ought to do what is
      right. This is a question that comes to us as a question of courtesy. I am opposed to shoving
      this question away.
     Mr. JEWETT said that the memorial should be treated decently, and moved that it be referred
      to the Committee on Public Expenditures.
     Mr. MOCK: During the session of 1883 it was claimed that there had been a loss of, I
      believe, $150,000, and that it was impossible to proceed with the work unless there was a new
      contract made. There was a special committee appointed and they took evidence for several
      weeks. While the committee reported that there had been a loss of $150,000, the minority
      reported that they had not lost more than $30,000. Since that time it is claimed that they
      have lost by the advance in prices of material and labor. The price has gone down, so that now
      there is no necessity for any further consideration of this question. I hope that this matter
      will be indefinitely postponed.
     Mr. KELLISON: An investigation of this kind would require an expenditure of one thousand
      dollars, and when we got through with that investigation the members would never know any more
      than they do now. I am not in favor of wasting one minute's time of this Legislature in
      this way. I will never vote to give any additional sum to these contractors. I move to lay the
      motion of the gentleman from Floyd (Mr. Jewett) on the table.
     This motion was rejected by yeas 41, nays 44.
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. HARRELL [explaining]: I vote as I do because I believe that every citizen of Indiana who
      comes before this General Assembly ought to be heard. I think it is part of our duty;
      therefore I vote "no."
     Mr. JEWETT, when his name was called, said: When a memorial comes in here I am in favor of
      referring it to some committee. The gentlemen who built this State-house have acted in great
      kindness in allowing us to occupy this State-house at this time, therefore I vote
      "no."
     The SPEAKER: I desire to say, in explaining my vote, that I believe firmly in the right of
      petitions; and because I believe in the right to be heard I vote "no."
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the motion was rejected.
    
    
     SOLDIERS' ORPHANS' HOME.
     On motion by Mr. GARDINER, the bill [S. 6] to
      maintain the Soldiers' and Sailors' Orphans' Home, was read three times under a
      dispensation of the constitutional rules--yeas 67, nays 21.
     The bill finally passed House by yeas 77, nays 6.
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. PATTON, when his name was called, said: I was a soldier myself. Having been there, and
      having had some slight acquaintance with these institutions over there, I do not believe there
      is any necessity for interrupting the management, therefore I vote "no."
     Mr. ROBERTS, in explanation of his vote, said: Knowing that the bill is right on general
      principles; knowing, also, that it provides for a non-partisan board in the management of
      these institutions, I vote "aye."
     Mr. WHITE, when his name was called, said: For the reason that the majority of the members
      on this floor have placed me in a position where I am compelled to vote for or against bills I
      do not understand, and do not know the provisions of--a bill that consumed a half an hour in
      the reading; and for the additional reason, I might say, that some parties have objected to it
      on the ground that there is no emergency or necessity for it, I desire to say, that on this
      bill and on all other bills that I am compelled to vote, where I cannot vote intelligently, I
      vote "no" as I now vote on this bill.
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the bill finally passed.
    
    
    
     BRIBERY IN THE ELECTION OF UNITED STATES SENATOR.
     The SPEAKER appointed Mr. Gardiner on the committee to investigate the alleged charges of
      corruption in connection with the election of United States Senator, in place of Mr.
      Griffiths, resigned, in consequence of being a member of the committee to investigate the
      management of the benevolent institutions.
     The House adjourned.
    
   
   
   
    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    IN SENATE.
    
     FRIDAY, February 11, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Hon. J. H. C. Smith, a Senator from the counties of
     Wells and Huntington.
    
     BENEVOLENT INSTITUTIONS INVESTIGATION.
     Mr. SHIVELEY offered the following:
     
      
       
        Resolved, That a select committee of five be appointed, whose duty it shall be to make an
         immediate investigation as to the control and management of the benevolent institutions of
         this State; that is to say, the Hospital for the Insane, the Deaf and Dumb Asylum, the
         Blind Asylum, all of which benevolent institutions are located in this city, or immediate
         vicinity.--Said investigation shall especially be conducted to ascertain whether the
         inmates are supplied and fed with good and wholesome food: whether the sanitary regulations
         are of the best and most approved character, and whether the management and control of the
         said institutions by those in charte of the same are conducted in a prudent and humane
         manner, and said committee shall have full power to inquire into and investigate all
         purchases or contracts made or entered into by the Superintendant or other persons for the
         purpose of provisions, fuel, or other articles for the use and benefit of the inmates of
         said benevolent institutions, and shall have full power to send for persons to appear
         before the said committee as witnesses, and for papers necessary to enable the committee to
         make a full and searching investigation as to the management of said institutions, and the
         Chairman of the committee is hereby authorized to administer the necessary oath, or
         affirmation, to witnesses to qualify them to testify before the said committee, and report
         the result of such an examination to this Senate.
       
      
     
     Mr. MCDONALD hoped the resolution would pass and that the President of
      the Senate would appoint a committee that will go to the bottom of the matter; for the reason
      that we want to know the truth, and for another reason, that there may be a stop put to the
      lying that has been indulged in about the management of these institutions.
     Mr. HUSTON stated that no one would more heartily indorse the statements of the Senator from
      Whitley (Mr. McDonald) than himself.--He was exceedingly anxious to find out who has been
      lying in this matter.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair thought the Senator knew.
     Mr. HUSTON: I think I know.
     Mr. FOWLER: I am in favor of the resolution; not to know so much who has been lying, but to
      know whether anybody has been lying about the matter. It is due to ourselves and to the public
      to make a thorough examination of all the matters connected with these institutions, and
      ascertain whether or not they are conducted in such a
      manner as they ought to be.
     Mr. THARP: Somebody has been lying about the conduct of these institutions. I understand
      there is a committee in the other end of the capitol engaged in investigating these
      institutions, and I am heartily in favor of an investigation by a Senate committee, also, to
      see that the other end of the capitol make a correct report.
     Mr. RAHM: As chairman of the Senate Committee on Benevolent Institutions,
      I would state that I have had the committee come together at different times and suggested the
      idea that we should go to work and make a searching investigation of any charges that would be
      brought against any of these institutions, or the charges that have appeared in the public
      prints; but no member of the committee, either Republican or Democrat, has seen fit to pay any
      attention to my suggestion. They claim they had not the time, and that is the reason the
      committee has never done anything.
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion: Are there any charges?
     Mr. RAHM: There are no charges to my knowledge, unless we take it for granted that the
      charges which appeared in the papers during the last political campaign are well founded, but
      I am glad to say the Chairman of the State Central Republican
      Committee--
     Mr. HUSTON, [Chairman of the Republican State Central Committee,
      [interposing]: I think those matters published in the Cincinnati Commercial-Gazette were true,
      and that is one reason I want this investigation, because I expect it to show every statement
      in the Commercial-Gazette is true and founded on facts.
     Mr. BAILEY: Prima facie evidence?
     Mr. HUSTON: Prima facie evidence.
     Mr. RAHM: As far as that article in the Cincinnati Commercial is concerned, I certainly
      wouldn't pay any attention to that at all. It is part of the plan of campaign of the
      Republicans to bring a lot of charges against the different institutions. If they have been
      guilty, I for one want that matter to appear. But the Republican members of the committee
      will, bear me out in the assertion that I have insisted we should investigate, and they
      themselves said they didn't see there was anything to be investigated. Whether their plan
      was to let us sit still and let the House come in with a one-sided report or not, I don't
      know.
     Mr. WEIR: I desire to offer the following amendment: "That any person or persons having
      any knowledge of abuses are invited to appear before such committee; and that the Door-keeper
      be instructed to provide a room for the meeting of said committee."
     Mr SHIVELY: I accept that amendment.
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion: Before the Senate starts out in this I think it ought to consider
      that we have had investigation farces many times since I took a seat on this floor--perhaps
      twenty years since--and I never saw any of these investigations amount to much. If there were
      any specific charges made it is the duty of the Senate to examine them to the bottom, but to
      attempt to bring forward what has appeared in a political paper and make that the ground-work,
      is not a safe plan of action.--The charges during the last campaign were similar, and to my
      knowledge not one of them were proven. I never would predicate an investigation upon charges
      in the public prints; but if any man in this State or elsewhere knows of any charges against
      these benevolent institutions let him make those charges to the chairman of the
       Committee on Benevolent Institutions and let them be investigated. I never
      will vote for the appointment of a committee organized with a view of investigating charges of
      this kind. There is no member of this Senate who will go farther than, I in investigating any
      specific charge, but I think the Senate is throwing itself on a wild and reckless scheme  when it goes out after such charges as these.
     Mr. MCDONALD: It has been intimated by the chairmanm of the
       Republican State Central Committee [Mr. Huston] that the charges published
      in the Commercial-Gazette are true.
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion: Why does not the Senator make these charges and hand them to the
      chairman of the Committee on Benevolent Institutions?
     Mr. WEIR: This invitation will give them an opportunity to do that--just the opportunity
      they ought to have. The are invited to make known the charges.
     Mr. WINTER: Did not the officers of the Civil Service Association of Indiana hand the
      charges to the Attorney General?
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion: I was not aware of such charges; and if so, the officer didn't
      do his duty.
     Mr. MCDONALD: I think we owe it to ourselves to have a full investigation
      of these charges and a most liberal construction of the testimony. I do hope there will not be
      a vote against the resolution. For one I am prepared to meet it, and if there is anybody in
      the wrong let them go down. We want to protect the tax-payers of Indiana. I hope there is
      nothing wrong, and I believe there is nothing wrong, yet I am not willing to pass my judgment
      without the testimony. I never defend anything unless I know it is right. I hope this
      resolution will pass.
     Mr. FRENCH: I understand there is at the present time a very able committee made up of both
      Republicans and Democrats in the other House, and it seems to me this ought to be in the shape
      of a joint resolution. I know these investigations are very costly, but if there is anything
      wrong we ought to ferret it out without stopping to think what it costs. Still I don' t
      know why we wait until that committee has been appointed in the House and got well along with
      its work, and now appoint a distinct committee to do exactly the same thing, unless it be the
      fact that this is a Democratic body and the other a Republican body. If the truth is to be
      had, and nothing else, I don't know why we should authorize this committee, inasmuch as
      there is a committee already appointed.
     Mr. KENNEDY: It would be a good thing to do like what has been done heretofore--appoint a
      committee to investigate the need for a committee to investigate.
     Mr. MCCLURE: In view of these charges having been winded through this
      State until the winds have grown sick of them, I think it very appropriate to have a competent
      committee appointed to investigate the conduct of these institutions--a committee that will do
      its duty in every particular in reference to these charges, that the people of the State may
      know how much truth there is in reference to this matter. And I think it would be very
      appropriate for that truth to come from the venerable Senator who presented this resolution. I
      had believed that these benevolent institutions have been conducted as properly and honorably
      as possible for finite capacity, but I may be mistaken. If I am mistaken, I for one would like
      to be informed in reference thereto. I feel it is the duty of the party that has charge of
      these institutions to have the control of the investigation in reference to the facts which
      have been charged. I have not read the article referred to in the Cincinnati Commercial, but I
      have heard enough of these charges to know very nearly what they amount to.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [Mr. Cox in the chair]: Mr. President--You will pardon me for
      saying, on the adoption of this resolution--
     Mr. DEMOTTE [interrupting]: Will the gentleman allow me--?
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: What gentleman?
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I came in late, and ask you to state what the resolution
      is.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: To investigate some supposed charges against the Insane Hospital.
      Now, if Senators will pardon me, I think just such a committee as is proposed by  this resolution ought to be appointed, and it ought to be empowered
      with all the facilities necessary to a thorough and decent investigation. It ought to be done,
      not only in self-defense of the Democratic party, but it ought to be done in justification of
      the management of these institutions. The Democratic party is not a party to condone fraud,
      crime or wrong any where. It has never feared an investigation; while that cannot be said of
      the Republican party. It is true that a so-called civil-service commission--God only knows who
      created it, and God cares less about that than I do--went out to the Insane Asylum and made
      some kind of an examination into its management, and made a report for the especial purpose of
      assisting the Republican party in the last political campaign. The head of that commission was
      an ex-member of this body, William D. Foulke, a man of great ability, a man of great cunning,
      a man of great wealth. While claiming not to be a partisan, he is one of the bitterest enemies
      the Democratic party ever had in the State. He and his co-workers wenat out to the Insane
      Hospital in the interest of Benjamin Harrison, who was canvassing the State for United States
      Senator, and made a partisan report. In my opinion, nearly every proposition in that report
      was based upon a false premise, if not upon a direct or implied falsehood. There were some
      very grave charges made; one was that a trustee in that hospital has misappropriated a check,
      or draft, or some kind of voucher to the amount of sixty-five dollars. If I remember right,
      another was that cholera hogs had been killed and fed to patients; another, that maggotty
      butter had been bought and fed to patients, and various charges of that kind; and among
      others, cruel treatment of patients. Any man of common sense knows that offenses will creep
      into the management of such an enormous institution which he would not allow in his own
      family. But from personal investigation I assert on this Senate floor that the Indiana
      Hospital for the Insane is the best managed institution of its kind on God's green earth.
      The Republican party, by their management, dragged it to disgrace. The Democratic party has
      brought it out of its infamy--has raised it up and placed it among the best of any institution
      of its kind the world. After this report was made, Senator Benjamin Harrison went all over the
      State reiterating and reaffirming the charges made in the Foulke report; that patients were
      fed maggotty butter, cholera meat, and were misused and abused, and he assured the people,
      upon his great character and great prominence in the Nation, that the charges were true. I
      never believed them to be true, for I knew they were false; I knew they were made for
      political and party purposes--for the purpose of knifing the Democratic party, because the
      Democratic party is responsible for the control and management of this institution.--Why,
      Senator Harrison made the statement in his speech in my town that it was a race of diligence
      between the cholera and the knife as to which would kill the hog first for food at the Insane
      Hospital. There is no doubt that is not true. I have been assured by Dr. Fletcher himself (the
      Superintendent of the institution) that no such thing ever happened there, but that the meat
      killed was inspected by himself personally, and that he applied all his skill as a physician
      to determine whether the meat was fit to be killed. The same is true with reference to the
      butter, the mistreatment of patients and the misappropriation of funds; and yet this report
      was made in the face of the fact that the evidence shows that the Insane Hospital has been
      managed more economically than it ever was managed before. Still for partisan purposes and
      partisan purposes alone, we were told that we were managing the institution in the most
      disgraceful and dishonorable manner.
     Now, over in the other end of this capitol a committee has been raised for what purpose? For
      the purpose of making a partisan report, and for no other purpose. If the Republi-cans of this General Assembly desire to have a report made that
      would speak the truth, that would be fair upon its face, that would give the right knowledge
      to the people of Indiana upon these grave charges against this institution, why did they not
      offer a concurrent resolution to raise a committee composed of Republicans and Democrats from
      both Houses of this General Assembly?--But they did't want that kind of a committee. They
      would not to-day agree to that kind of a committee. That Republican majority in the other end
      of this capitol are going to work upon a partisan basis and a partisan plan. The Democratic
      party can only defend itself in this General Assembly through the Democratic majority in the
      Senate. The Democrats in the other end of the capitol are stifled on any question of a
      political character.
     Mr. HUSTON: I think the Senator is certainly mistaken as to the privileges accorded
      Democratic members in the other House; I think they have been accorded greater privileges by
      far than the minority in this end of the capitol. I will refer to one thing:--in regard to the
      consideration of contested election cases. [He contrasted the action of the two houses.]
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [Mr. Cox in the chair]: Yes; the Senator, who is my personal
      friend, need not claim that the Republican minority here had the indecent political treatment
      that the Democratic minority were shown in the other branch of this Assembly. It cannot be
      truthfully said that the Republicans have received such treatment on the floor of this Senate
      as the Democrats received on the floor of the House. [He also contrasted the action of the two
      houses in the contested election cases--Mr. Huston occasionally interposing.]
     Mr. HUSTON: In the McDonald contest the majority of the committee agreed that the majority
      report should not be considered until the minority had sufficient time to submit theirs.
     Mr. BAILEY [interrupting]: That is not true, at all.
     Mr. HUSTON: If it is not true I want it denied on the floor of the Senate, as there are
      members of the committee who say it is true.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: I have been authorized by the Democratic members of the
      committee, but never had an opportunity till now, to say that statement is not true. Mr Bailey
      (chairman of the committee) state to the attorneys for McDonald that they could make a report
      at any time, but he proposed to present the majority report.
     Mr. HUSTON: I will ask the chairman of the Committee on Elections if it
      was not tacitly understood that the report of the majority was not--
     The PRESIDING OFFICER [Mr. Cox in the chair--interrupting]: Do that afterwards. One on the
      floor at a time.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [resuming]: I have stated this much in answer to the Senator from
      Fayette [Mr. Huston]. I think the Senator believes, as far as decent treatment is concerned,
      outside of political matters, that the Republicans in this Senate have received as much fair
      treatment as Democrats. It has be my endeavor and desire to treat every Republican with the
      same kind of treatment I would expect for myself had I been upon the floor. If I have made
      mistakes it is of the head and not of the heart.
     Going back to the resolution, I would like to inquire of the Senator from Fayette, who is
      the distinguished leader of the Republican party not only upon this floor but in the other end
      of the capitol as well, why it was when they offered the resolution over there to investigate
      the Insane Hospital they didn't, make it a concurrent resolution and let the Senate have
      something to say about it? Will you answer?
     Mr. HUSTON: I will answer in this way: It is my understanding the custom has existed for
      many years that each body adopts its own plan for investigations, and acts indepen-  dent of the other House. And it has been a rare occurrence,
      as you will find by reviewing the history of past legislation, for an investigation to be made
      by a joint committee of the two houses. I expect one reason was this: the charges of
      mismanagement were made against Democrats, and it is but right that the Democratic party, if
      it can, should defend itself.--That defence should come from the branch where it had a
      majority. I suppose the House, believing an investigation ought to be made, thought if the
      Democrats would not they would.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: You proceeded upon the campaign lies in the country, and tried to
      gain the case by a picked jury?
     Mr. HUSTON: Not at all.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: You desire the Democratic party shall have odium attached to it
      by the Foulke report and by a partisan committee of the House of Representatives, appointed by
      a man whose partisan zeal runs away with his better judgment, as if in fact he has any
      judgment at all.
     Mr. HUSTON: The committee in the House is composed of three Republicans and two
      Democrats.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Certainly, and you made a choice of the Democrats on that
      committee. You did not allow the Democratic minority to say who should be on that committee.
      Whenever it was necessary to investigate any institution of the State it has been done by
      concurrent resolution. You cannot point your finger to a place where one branch of the General
      Assembly have taken such responsibility independent of the other. [He referred to
      investigations last session--of the Institution of the Feeble-minded, and of the Treasurer of
      State; during which Mr. JOHNSON raised a point of order against being an
      "acrimonious political debate being inflicted upon the Senate." Subsequently, Mr.
       WEIR made a point of order that "nothing except the question under
      discussion shall be discussed."]
     I am sorrry to disturb the placid temper of the Senator from Laporte, and the fiery, untamed
      character of the Senator from Wayne; and will return to the question: shall we appoint a
      committee? Not a committee to whitewash somebody; not a committee to help patch up the broken
      and rent fortunes of the Senator from Fayette; not a committee for the purpose of helping him
      out of a bad hole he accidentally fell into in the last election; not a committee to help
      smear over the broken places in the Republican party which finally resulted in a failure to
      elect a Republican United States Senator; but a committee that will go forth representing the
      people of Indiana, for the purpose of making an investigation that will speak the truth,
      fearing no one, caring for no favorites, daring to do what is right, and that will place upon
      the records of this Senate, which has hitherto been so honorable, a report which will show
      that the Insane Hospital is an honorably conducted institution or that it has been
      dishonorably conducted. That is the kind of committee we want. That is the kind of committee
      we will have. If the appointing power is left with me I intend to place the Senator from
      Fayette on that committee, and he shall be responsible for the truth or falsity of the report
      he has to make when that report is made, in order that the people of this great and glorious
      State shall know the truth they cannot get through the other end of the capitol. Here is the
      only place the people can look to for decent, honorable, reliable information, and when they
      read the information this body places upon its records--that this body promulgates to the
      people of the State--then they will be satisfied with whatever that report says; and they
      never will be satisfied until that report is made. Does the Senator from Fayette not know that
      their committee was a caucus arrangement? that it is intended to make a party report that
      would catch the Democrats in the Senate napping? Did you not agree upon that in caucus? Did
      you not make a caucus  measure of it? Why don't you
      answer?
     Mr. HUSTON: As far as my knowledge extends there was no caucus action taken on the matter
      whatever. If the gentleman pretends to say our caucus in the House considered the matter of
      investigating the Insane Asylum, or took caucus action thereon, he evidently knows more about
      what the caucus done than I do, because I deny all knowledge of the caucus ever having
      considered it.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Senator saw the committee off, but he was a little beside
      himself when the great avalanche came down the hill-side. It is a caucus arrangement--
     Mr. HUSTON: I have a generally good reputation for truth and veracity, and I say, as far as
      I know, our caucus took no action on the matter.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: I am not disputing that the Senator tells the truth, for I
      believe him to be a truthful gentleman. But I say here, as a Senator on this floor, that the
      investigation started in the other end of the capitol was a caucus measure. That is the way it
      started, and there are caucus men upon it.
     Mr. HUSTON: The Senator states that as a fact; I want his authority.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: It is in accordance with a caucus action; whether a general
      caucus or an inside caucus I do not know. That is my information. Do not the facts in the case
      warrant the assertion?--Have you done anything over there you have not caucused for, when you
      get all your men together? Sometimes you can't get them all, and sometimes they kick.
     Mr. HUSTON: You have had difficulty in getting your's together.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Now, in view of the fact that this is a caucus measure, intended
      to smirch the Democratic party; in view of that being the case, why object to go into this
      arrangement and make the report of that committee sink into everlasting infamy? [He referred
      again to the State Treasury investigation of last session; and the history of the Republican
      party for the past twenty-five years--at considerable length--and dwelled for sometime on the
      last canvass and its results.] I want this committee appointed because it will be the means,
      when its report is made, of furnishing a club with which, two years from now, we can hammer
      the brains, figuratively speaking, out of the Republican State Central
       Committee, Benjamin Harrison, and the balance. Now, Mr. President, if there is
      anything in this resolution that ought to be changed, it is that it ought to state these
      charges were made by an irresponsible civil-service campaign commission, unworthy the respect
      of decent people. When we go into court for the purpose of trying a criminal, we make the
      indictment speak the facts; and I would like to see this resolution in the shape of an
      indictment charging Wm. D. Foulke with being the author of these charges, and the Cincinnati
      Gazette as reiterating them; hear the evidence; have the argument made; the instructions of
      the court given; and hear the verdict of the jury--the people of the State of
      Indiana--denouncing them as falsehoods and lies; and let it stand in golden letters that will
      never die out that these men to get votes and carry the General Assembly. Now, Mr. President,
      I want the committee appointed. Let every nook and corner of this grand Benevolent Institution
      of our State be inquired into. If there is any wrong or any mismanagement to be found, let the
      head of the guilty ones drop into the basket. If there is a bad man there let him go, for God
      knows I don't want to associate with him. My associates in the past have been among good
      and honest people I don't want to join hands with any other kind.
     Mr. HUSTON: I have been as greatly amazed as the average member upon the floor of the Senate
      at the tirade of abuse to which we have listened for the last hour. It has indeed been a
      spectacle that I think stands without parallel in the history of Indiana, when the presiding
      offi-  cer comes upon the floor of the Senate and
      indulges in personal allusions, threats and charges, and makes as bitter a partisan speech as
      he did. I do not propose to adopt this line in what little I have to say. The resolution under
      discussion is one which I am heartily in sympathy. It is one that should have been introduced
      by the majority upon this floor, if possible, to clear their skirts of the most damnable and
      infamous charges that went unrefuted in the campaign of 1886. It has been said that they want
      the verdict of this committee to use as a club to beat out the brains of Senator Harrison and
      other Republican leaders, figuratively speaking. Let this investigation go on; let the facts
      be learned, and if it can be found that the charges are false, no man will more gladly make
      report of the fact than I. [Applause.] We have heard a great deal of talk about hog cholera,
      and the knife running a race with it to see which would get the hog first. I don't
      believe that stuff has anything to do with the resolution under consideration. I want to refer
      briefly to a statement which was made that investigating committees amount to nothing. [He
      spoke of the Soldiers' Orphans' Home investigation in 1881.]
     The Senator refers to the civil-service commission as being in harmony with the Republican
      party organization last fall. I want to say this: That civil-service commission is composed of
      men who are the equals socially, intellectually and morally with any member upon the floor of
      this Senate. They are honest men; they have the conviction of their own consciences; they
      believed they were doing right; they made their report, and I know they believed it; and I
      believe the facts ascertained in this investigation will support the report thus made.
     Mr. FRENCH: Granting that these civil-service men are as honest as a member of the General
      Assembly, I will ask the chairman of the Republican State Central Committee
      why that commission made that important investigation just in time for its report to be
      injected into the campaign?
     Mr. HUSTON: They paid for its publication themselves; the State Central
       Committee had nothing whatever to do with it. I think it was one of many lucky
      coincidences.
     Mr. BAILEY: Is it not true that the chairman of this civil-service commission stumped the
      State in behalf of Benjamin Harrison?
     Mr. HUSTON: It is true ex-Senator Foulke, a man of great ability, did make for the
       Republican State Central Committee eight or ten speeches. It has been
      charged that this civil-service commission was working in the interest of the Republican
      party, but I don't believe that charge can be sustained. It is all very well for men with
      bluster, thunder and noise to get up and make charges, but--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Dose the Senator have reference to the Senator from Wayne?
     Mr. HUSTON: None whatever. The charges made against Mr. Foulke and his comrades are
      unwarranted and exceedingly unkind. As regards the Insane Asylum, charges of the gravest
      possible character were made against the President of the Board of Trustees. He lives in
      Indiana and has the opportunity of denying these charges or of prosecuting for libel the men
      who utter them, but he never has exhibited the vim or determination to deny the charges made
      in the Commercial-Gazette against him.
     Mr. BAILEY: Don't you know he did deny these charges over his own signature in the
      public prints?
     Mr. HUSTON: How long after?
     Mr. BAILEY: Immediately after.
     Mr. HUSTON: I do not believe Senator Harrison ever uttered a greater truth than when he said
      it was a race of diligence between the knife and the cholera as to which would catch the hog.
      [The speaker referred to the State Treasury investigation in 1886, and "the Democratic
      majority stealing the Legislature by its gerrymander."] I might go on with answers to
      assertions made upon this floor on the other side, but the time of this Senate is too precious
      to indulge in anything of that kind. I am heartily in
      favor of this resolution, and I hope when this committee is appointed it will go to work
      earnestly, and zealously endeavor to ascertain the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the
      truth.
     Mr. FRENCH: I think we have had this question discussed as fully as it ought to be, and in
      order that we may proceed to business I move the previous question.
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion: I was not aware that there were any specific charges made against
      any of these institutions until Judge Winter assured me of the fact. I now heartily support
      this resolution.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: If the previous question is to be sprung, I want to insist upon it now.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I desire to ask a question.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair will hear you if you wait till we get around to
      you.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: As this glove has been thrown down--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Which glove? Did you lose one?
     Mr. DEMOTTE: No; but you--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [interrupting]: I don't understand that you have taken it up.
      It is too large for you.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: He has thrown down the glove,--he has shied his castor in
      the ring--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: This is not a ring in which light weights are allowed.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: As the Senator from Jennings (the President pro tempore) has
      publicly stated--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair would like the Senator to make his speech, but the
      previous question has been demanded. You wanted to ask a question, but you were going on to
      make a speech. The 
       Chair
       thair
       don't like to see you go head-long into something you can't get out
      of.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I desire to--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: It is not the fault of the chair. If the Senator does not kill
      himself before noon it will not be his own fault.--The chair desires to preserve his life, but
      still he is going on as if he wanted to kill himself. The question is, will the Senate second
      the demand for the previous question? [After calling a vote.] The ayes seem to have it.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: "Division." "Division."
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Wait a moment; you shall have anything you want.
     The demand for the previous question was rejected upon a division--affirmative 19, negative
      19.
     Mr. JOHNSON: I am not one who will sit silently on the floor of the Senate chamber and have
      gentlemen challenge me to a joint discussion, without accepting the challenge; therefore I
      gird on my armor, take down my lance, mount my charger, and ride into the fray. The same
      feeling that inspires me to face my foe, induces me to attack him with logic or decency, but
      considering the character of the address made, I have concluded to descend to the level of my
      opponent and lay aside the Senatorial toga in order to exclaim from the depths of my soul:
      "Rats! rats!! rats!!!"
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: That is altogether how a man is raised as to how he looks at
      it.
     Mr. JOHNSON: That is all of my speech, and I desire it to be put in print.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: It is so ordered.
     Mr. DRESSER: It seems to me this political discussion is untimely. If this investigation is
      to be made, it should not be for the purpose of vindicating any political party, but it should
      be made in the interest of humanity. If the charges which have been made against the
      management of this institution are true, then the unfortunate inmates should be properly cared
      for. If the charges are not true then the managers should be vindicated by the report of this
      committee. As far as the committee on the other side of this building is concerned, I
      don't think it is proper for  us to stand here and
      question the integrity of those who raised that committee. I know it has never been discussed
      in a joint caucus of the Republican party. As presiding officer of the joint caucus I can say
      upon the floor of this Senate that the matter has never been brought up in any joint caucus of
      the Republican party.
     Mr. BAILEY: I would like to inquire whether an inside caucus held at the Denison House
      didn't consider it?
     Mr. DRESSER: I am not on the inside. I am president of the joint caucus of the House and
      Senate. I am not here to state whether I believe these charges to be true or false, but it
      seems to me when an inmate of one of these institutions can escape at noon-day, and her
      absence be discovered in an hour, and no trace of the inmate can ever be found,--[see page 199
      of this book,]--it seems to me there is something radically wrong, and which demands an
      investigation not only at the hands of this Senate but by the whole General Assembly. As I
      have stated, I do not think this investigation should be made for the purpose of manufacturing
      any political capital but in the interests of humanity, and if in the interest of humanity I
      am in favor of it.
     Mr. FOWLER: Do you understand there is any Senator objecting to that resolution?
     Mr. DRESSER: If there is no gentleman objecting why these political harangues taking up a
      half day's session of the Senate? We had better spend our time in doing the work we were
      sent here to do.
     Mr. FRENCH: The opposition has had three speeches to our one, and I think that ought to
      satisfy them. In all seriousness I demand the previous question.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Does any Republican desire to make a speech?
     Mr. DEMOTTE addressed the Chair.
     Mr. WINTER: I move the Senate adjourn.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Senate will adjourn pending the demand for the previous
      question.
     Mr. HUSTON: The Senator from Porter (Mr. DeMotte) has been recognized.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Yes sir, he said he wanted five minutes. I think he is entitled
      to it. He shall have the floor for five minutes, or ten, as far as the chair is concerned, if
      he wants.
     The Senate took a recess.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     THURSDAY, February 11, 1887.
     Mr. BAILEY offered the following preamble to the pending resolution:
     
      
       
        Whereas, William D. Foulke, heading an alleged civil service reform committee, did, on
         the eve of the campaign of 1886, make certain charges against the management of the Indiana
         Hospital for the Insane; and,
        Whereas, The people and taxpayers of Indiana are entitled to a fair and true investation
         of said charges, to the end that they may know whether he same are founded on truth or made
         for partisan and corupt purposes; and,
        Whereas, Certain Republican papers in this and other States have joined the Republican
         leaders in promulgating to the world the result of said invesigation as a true and
         impartial report; therefore, be it
        Mr. MCDONALD: I offer this to go with that:
        Be it further moved that, to the end that said investigation may be thorough and
         complete, said committee is hereby empowered to employ sufficient clerical and shorthand
         force to take down, for preservation, the evidence taken before said committee, and to
         further employ, if deemed necessary, sufficient legal talent to direct and conduct the
         examinations before the same.
       
      
     
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I cannot see the propriety of the amendment just introduced
      by the gentleman from Marion (Mr. Bailey). There is but one way, in my judgment, to approach a
      subject of this kind, and that was the way taken by the Senator from Jennings (the President
      pro tempore)--to take the responsibility and the courage he had and look this thing right in
      the face. This second thought of a few in this house is to prepare, by placing a preamble to
      this resolution, a soft cushion upon which they may sit down. The Senator from Jennings is the
      leader of that party, and in my opinion he deserves the position, for he has shown himself to
      be the Napoleon of this seige, and, as yet, has met no
      Waterloo. What the future may have in store for him I do not know. The Senator from Jennings
      placed this matter before the house and the country just where it is. While other Senators
      have shirked behind the previous question--while other Senators have hidden behind party
      tactics, the Senator from Jennings never has. The Senator from Jennings has been equal to
      every emergency his party has put upon him, and has never been afraid. He came on the floor
      this morning and stated here in a straightforward manner that this investigation is a
      necessary thing for the Democratic party. It is a necessary thing for the Democratic party
      that it should be vindicated, if it can be vindicated. The emergency is just here: It needs
      that vindication. The Senator from Jennings well knew that. We are informed that there will be
      a joint convention to elect the officers of these various asylum and prison directors. Now,
      the Senator from Jennings knew well enough--
     Mr. BAILEY [interposing]: What is the source of your information on that subject? How do you
      know there is to be a joint convention?
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I did not say I knew it. I am so informed. The public prints
      so announced it, and no Democratic Senator or newspaper has denied it. The Senator from
      Jennings knew the Democratic party could not go before the country, without white-washing,
      hence this question has been sprung, and he has shown us the only sentiment that has been
      manifested by them this winter: They must not be out-witted; because, if these prison
      directors are left over they will elect another warden for a four years term. It won't do
      just now to go into an election of the officers of these benevolent institutions, and in order
      that the party may not be injured it must be white-washed--so the Senator states here, in that
      many words. I have no doubt he believes he can procure a committee which will do as he has
      asked: Write a report in advance of hearing the facts, and report it without bringing in any
      testimony contradicting it. I think he can do that. Then it is necessary to have a club to
      mash the brains of the Republicans in another campaign. That is another good arrangement. And
      it must be a very large and heavy club, at that, for there are some brains in the Republican
      party, if it is sometimes a little short in the way of voters. This is the whole plan laid
      open. I didn't take up the glove in defence of the Republican party, because it does not
      need any defence. [He spoke of its record for twenty-five years, and referred to the
      Indianapolis tally-sheet forgeries as committed by Democrats.] Now, I think this resolution
      ought to be adopted. If ever there was a necessity for it, it is right now. I consider the
      President's address the ablest effort, from a Democratic stand-point, that has been made
      on this floor; and I would not have him spare us, for at the time I noticed the Brevier
      Reporter was taking him down--"there's a chile amang ye takin' notes"--and
      we will have it for the next campaign.
     Mr. SHIVELY: without casting any personal reflection I desire to say that the Senator from
      Jennings (the President pro tempore) and the Senator from Porter (Mr. DEMotte) remind me of a couplet about two members of a brass band:
     "The man who blows the cornet thinks he's some,
     But, Lord, he aint a patchin' to the man who beats the drum."
     (Laughter.] Mr. President: I desire to say that I had the honor of introducinag the
      resolution before the Senate. I done so from a desire that we might have a fair and impartial
      investigation of the way and manner in which our benevolent institutions were being managed
      and conducted. I cannot see that an investigation of this kind has anything to do with
      politics. Mr. President: It is said that there are books in running brooks, sermons in stones,
      and good in everything; but if any good can result from this political crimination and
      recrimination upon this floor, my intellect is too obtuse to see it. Mr. President: I have sat
      in my seat and from  the commencement of this session
      heard denunciation and abuse heaped upon the Democratic party of this country, and I had
      resolved in my mind that I would make no reply; but from what I have heard to-day I feel that
      it is a duty to the constituency I represent upon this floor to at least make one word of
      reply. [He made reference to the Presidential campaign of 1876; to the last State election,
      and to the contested election cases in the Legislature.
     Mr. MCDONALD: I had no disposition to enter into this discussion, but
      when the Senator from Porter wants to include the Democratic party with watered whiskey and
      treason, I propose to say on this floor, if that is intended, I have the courage to hurl it
      back as false in fact and malicious in spirit.
     Mr. FOWLER: I did not understand the Senator to make such a statement.
     Mr. MCDONALD: I understand just what the import was, and I am here to say
      that if the gentleman from Porter desires to stigmatize the Democratic party as treasonable, I
      hurl it back as false in fact. I believe that Democrats and Republicans both went out together
      to defend the flag of the country and should have equal and alike credit, and I want no man to
      characterize the Democratic party as being treasonable.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: The gentleman assumes to be the entire Democratic party.
     Mr. MCDONALD: No, sir. If you want to thus characterize the Democratic
      part, I want you to define you position.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I said the Democratic party has taken everything in the last
      fifty years, from abettors of treason and tally-sheet forgers down to tub-whiskey and fraud,
      and I say so yet.
     Mr. MCDONALD: I regard the declaration as to the Democratic party taking
      in abettors of treason as being on the other foot, and I pronounce it malicious and unfair. In
      conclusion, I have nothing to say as to this investigation. I do not know who is guilty or who
      is innocent. I hope there are none guilty, but if guilty let the people know it, or if
      innocent let the people know it. Let there be a most searching investigation. I any one has
      misstated facts, let that come out. This matter should be sifted to the bottom.
     Mr. KENNEDY: I think this resolution is right, and think it ought to pass, and I believe it
      is the disposition of the Senate that it shall pass. This discussion has gotten considerably
      away from the subject under consideration. But when there are scandalous reports about any set
      of officers who are serving the public, it is due to the public and to the officers to have
      them investigated and see whether the charges are true or false. If true they ought to be
      turned out, but if these men prove themselves to be right and honest it will redound to their
      credit.
     I want to reply to some things said by the Senator from Jennings (the President pro
      tempore), and also my old friend over there (Mr. Shively.) [He referred to Gen. Jackson's
      days; to frauds attributed to Democrats in New York City and elsewhere; to Knights of the
      Golden Circle; to ex-convicts being appointed to office by Democrats, and to the last
      election.]
     Mr. JOHNSON: I do not desire to protract this debate, but now that it has been forced upon
      the Senate I would be direlect to duty as a Republican Senator, representing an intelligent
      constituency, if I sat still and not enter a protest against this effort that has been made to
      bring into condemnation a patriotic people, and help to bury it so deep that it nebver ought
      to raise its head again in this Senate chamber. [He referred to the resolutions of 1792; the
      nullification act; the history of "bleeding Kansas," and of the Republican party in
      "wiping out the iniquitous system of slavery;" the Presidential canvass of 1876;
      civil-service reform; the State election; election contests this session; the Soldiers'
      Orphans' Home' investigation; the last Democratic State Treasurer, and the surplus
      in the National Treasury.] What does  this resolution
      mean? The Senator from Jackson and Jennings [the President pro tempore] who is entitled to no
      higher position in this Senate, has sounded the key-note; and I commend his frankness when he
      says it is necessary to white-wash the Democratic party.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Does the Senator say I said it was necessary to white-wash the
      Democratic party?
     Mr. JOHNSON: I surely did say you thought it necessary to protect the Democratic party.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Do you say that I said it is necessary to white-wash the
      Democratic party?
     Mr. JOHNSON: You said it was neessary for the purpose of protecting the Democratic
      party.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: I said it was necessary for the purpose of bringing out the
      truth.
     Mr. JOHNSON: I beg pardon, but I appeal to Senators upon this floor if I am not right. The
      words are written in the memory of more than one man, and they cannot be revoked by the denial
      of the Senator from Jennings and Jackson (the President pro Tempore.) Why this political
      harangue this morning to divert the attention and mind of Senators? This investigation is
      desired not for the purpose of arriving at the truth; not for the purpose of unearthing
      something wrong in the management of the benevolent institutions; not for the purpose of
      purifying and placing on a higher plane the management of these institutions; but for the
      purpose of providing for the necessities of a party election, and for the purpose of
      protecting the great Democratic party. Now then, I say there is a higher purpose to be
      attained than mere protection of the Democratic party. I never will stand by party when I
      believe it to be guilty. I care not whether it uncovers Democratic or Republican fraud the
      investigation should be honestly conducted.
     It is claimed that it has been the custom to make such investigations by a joint committee.
      Why was it that the Democratic minority on the floor of the House failed to move that the
      resolution there be made a concurrent one? I am not aware that the Democratic members of the
      House committee are weak, or do not properly represent the intelligence of the Democratic
      party. If that is true, is there anything partisan in the appointment of that committee? Why
      don't you pass this resolution without a political debate? Was it concocted in advance?
      Was it designed to allow some gentleman to blow off some steam and attempt to humiliate,
      brow-beat and bulldoze Republicans on this floor? Do you want an investigation to be made? Do
      you intend to put mediocre Senators on that committee, or do you mean in good faith it shall
      be carried out? If so, why go on with a debate that is exasperating? I warn you, if there be
      anything rotten, and human ingenuity and skill can ferret it out, the Republican minority will
      do its best to make this investigation an experiment in favor of right. The question is
      whether this resolution is intended simply to protect the Democratic party instead of in good
      faith ferretng out real abuses. I trust the resolution will be adopted and that the committee
      will report the exact facts regardless of whether they injure the fortunes of the Democratic
      party or prove a stumbling-block to the great party with which I am proud to act.
     Mr. SMITH, of Wells: Th character of one of my constituents, Col. Milligan, has been brought
      into this debate. As I represent the county in which he lives I want to say that Col. Milligan
      is highly respected as one of the best citizens of Huntington county. Some of his warmest
      friends are Republicans. He is one of the leading lawyers of the State, and his family is a
      credit to the State. I say this because I believe it is due to Col. Milligan. He is over
      seventy years of age, and is respected by everybody who knows him.
     Mr. SHIVELY: I accept the amendments.
     Mr. WINTER: I offer the following amendment: Insert after the  word "food" the words: "whether or not there has
      been any cruelty or negligence in the care of patients."
     Mr. SHIVELY: All right.
     The resolution was adopted, with the preamble and amendments accepted by the author.

     BRIBERY IN THE ELECTION OF UNITED STATES SENATOR.
     Mr. COVERT, from the special committee thereon, offered the following:
     
      
       
        Whereas, Your committee, appointed to investigate the charges of bribery in the
         Senatorial vote of this body, finds that the evidence promises to be voluminous and
         tedious, and believing that the utmost care should characterize a vigorous, thorough and
         correct investigation: therefore,
        Resolved, That said committee be furnished a stenographer and sergeant-at-arms, and that
         said committee be granted a leave of absence from the regular sessions whenever the
         business of the committee requires it.
       
      
     
     It was adopted.
    
    
    
     LIQUOR LICENSE BILLS.
     The majority of the Committee on Temperance returned Mr.Fleece's
      bill [H. R. 20] with amendments. It provides for an election on the license question in each
      township and county upon petition of one-tenth of the voters. If the decision is against the
      sale of liquors, no license shall be issued under any circumstances. If it is for the sale,
      the license fee is fixed at five hundred dollars annually.
     Mr. FLEECE moved to temporarily set aside the consideration of Mr. Foster's fee and
      salary bill [H. R. 33] and consider the temperance bill [H. R. 20] which was made the special
      order for ten o'clock.
     The motion was agreed to--yeas 51, nays 42.
     Mr. IBACH, from the Temperance Committee, made a minority report, and explained that the
      minority merely changes the law as it now stands by making the license two hundred dollars, to
      be paid every person who handles intoxicating liquors and sells for the purpose of gain. As to
      vinous and malt liquors the law is left as it now stands. He said: I want this remembered, so
      that in the discussion of this question we will understand it. In the first place, the fee is
      two hundred dollars. Second, a license of fifty dollars for vinous and malt liquors. The next
      change in the old law is, that one hundred dollars of the two hundred goes to the school fund;
      the other one hundred dollars, if the licensee lives in a city or town, shall be paid into the
      treasury of the city or town for improvemnent of streets; if the licensee lives in the
      township, it shall be paid to the township trustee to be applied for improvement of the
      highways. I do hope that you will give the provisions of this bill your careful consideration.
      I believe it is a bill that can be enforced in the State of Indiana, and I do not believe that
      any other local option law will produce better results.
     Mr. PLEASANTS: I favor the adoption of the minority report. I would call the attention of
      the House to the old law. Section 5312 is one of the sections to be amended by this minority
      report. It leaves out the words "in a less quantity than a quart at a time." Another
      change is, leaving out "nor shall any person without having first procured such license,
      sell or barter any intoxicating liquor to be drank, or suffered to be drank, in his his house,
      out house, yard, garden or appurtenances thereto belonging." Section 5318 is amended by
      leaving out the words "in less quantities than a quart at a time, with the privilege of
      permitting the same to be drank on the premises as stated in the aforesaid notice." In
      Section 5320 it leaves out the words "in less quantities than a quart at a time, or who
      shall sell or barter any spiritous, vinous or malt liquors, to be drank or suffered to be
      drank in his house, out house, yard, garden or appurtenances thereto belonging."
     The effect of these amendments will be, to require every person who deals in liquors,
      whether he be brewer, wholesaler, retailer or druggist, to pay the same license. It is a fact
      that in some counties, and, I believe, in every county, a great many so-called stores are
      nothing more than saloons in disguise. I believe it is such a measure as can be passed by this
      General Assembly and become a law, but I do not believe that the local option bill passed by
      the majority of this committee stands a possible chance of becoming a law.
     Mr. MAJOR: One of the first things to be looked at in the enactment of a law for the
      government of the people is, whether that law can be enforced or not. We have under discussion
      one of the greatest and most important subjects that the Legislature of the State of Indiana,
      in the present session, will pass upon. Two-thirds of the whiskey that is sold in my town is
      sold by drug stores. It seems to me that the bill proposed by a majority of this committee
      does not touch that at all. The law that we now have is not enforced. If we cannot enforce the
      present law, how are we going to enforce a more stringent law. We have a class of places that
      are saloons but are not called sa-  loons; they call
      themselves wholesale liquor houses. They cannot be, and are not, reached by our law as it now
      is. A law that cannot be enacted ought to be repealed. The law we now have on the statute book
      is not enforced and we had better substitute something in its place. I think that the
      saloon-keeper has some rights. A man that writes "Saloon" over his door pays a sum
      into the State treasury, but a man that writes "Drug Store" over his door and has a
      saloon in the back room pays nothing. Another thing to be considered in this matter is, that
      the friends of temperance sometimes demand more than can be conceded. It is a dangerous plan
      to be ahead of public opinion; it is as dangerous as to be behind public opinion. I believe
      the bill that the minority recommend will go a long way toward abating this evil. I hope this
      minority report will be adopted.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     On motion by Mr. BROWN, the minority report was laid on the table by yeas 55, nays 37--as
      follows:
     
      
       
        YEAS. Ackman, Alexander, Barnard, Briant, Brown, Buckles, Carrick, Cates, Catey, Caven,
         Commons, Conder, Conger, Davis, Dickerson, Dunn, Fleece, Friend, Gardiner, Glover, Gough,
         Green, Griffiths, Grose, Groves, Harley, Hobson, Howard, Kelley (of Boone,) Kelly (of
         Lagrange,) Kercheval, Leighty, Linck, Little, Loop, McCray, Mackey, Miller, Morse,
         Montgomery (of Gibson,) Niblack, Nolin, Osborn, Oursler, Patton, Pleak, Reynolds, Robinson,
         Scott, Sinclair, Stubblefield, Thompson, Trout, VanSlyke, Mr. Speaker. 55
        NAYS. Askren, Barnes, Beasley, Bertram, Blinks, Buskirk, Clarke, Connely, Cox (of Cass
         and Miami,) Cox (of Miami,) Cruson, Cushman, Custer, Foley, Foster, Gordon, Harrell,

         Pleasants, Roberts, Schley, Selvey, Shambaugh, Shields, Stull, Weyand, White, Whitworth,
         Worrall. 37.
       
      
     
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. JEWETT, when his name was called, said: The Democratic party pledged to the people
      Indiana to effect a reasonable increase in the license, and believing this minority report
      affords the only opportunity of redeeming that pledge, the minority in this House seek thereby
      to redeem that pledge, therefore I vote "no."
     Mr. PATTON, in explation of vote, said: Believing this minority report is simply
      manufactured for political dodgery, and believing in right of the people to express themselves
      on all occasions; and believing it is my duty, on all questions of a moral nature that are
      presented, to place myself on the side of morality, I therefore vote "aye."
     The vote was announced, as above.
     So the minority report was laid on the table.
     Mr. JEWETT demanded the previous question on concurrence in the majority report. The demand
      was seconded by the House, and under its operations the majority report was adopted.
     Mr. REYNOLDS moved that the bill be ordered engrossed, and on this motion demanded the
      previous question, which was seconded by the House, and under its operations the motion was
      agreed to by yeas 50, nays 43--as follows:
     
      
       
        YEAS. Ackman, Alexander, Barnard, Briant, Brown, Buckles, Carrick, Cates, Catey, Caven,
         Commons, Conder, Conger, Davis, Dickerson, Dunn, Fleece, Friend, Gardiner, Glover, Gough,
         Green, Griffiths, Grose, Harley, Hobson, Howard, Kelley (of Boone,) Kelly (of Lagrange,)
         Kercheval, Leighty, Little, Loop, McCray, Mackey, Miller, Montgomery (of Gibson,) Nolin,
         Osborn, Oursler, Patton, Pleak, Reynolds, Scott, Sinclair, Stubblefield, Thompson, Trout,
         VanSlyke, Mr. Speaker. 50
        NAYS. Askren, Barnes, Beasley, Bertram, Blinks, Buskirk, Clarke, Connely, Covert, Cox (of
         Cass and Miami,) Cox (of Miami) Cruson, Cushman, Custer, Darroch, Foley, Foster,  Gordon, Harrell, Jewett, Kellison, Klein, Linck, Majr,
         Metzger, Mock, Morse, Montgomery (of Owen,) Niblack, Parker, Pierce, Pleasants, Roberts,

         43
       
      
     
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. GORDON, when his name was called, said: I vote simply as I believe the peple I represent
      would have me vote; and being one of those who believe that if you wish to relieve the people
      from an evil you should not do it by a local application, and believing that this bill does
      not reach the heart of the evil, I vote "no."
     Mr. LINCK (explaining his vote) said: Having an amendment that I desired to make, and I
      believe I ought to have been allowed to offer it, I have the courage of my convictions and I
      vote "no."
     Mr. MORSE, when his name was called, said: I am not in favor of the bill as it stands at the
      present time, but I am in favor of the bill that the gentleman from Jefferson (Mr. Linck) had
      and wanted to offer, therefore I vote "no."
     Mr. ROBINSON, in explanation of his vote, said: Because I think the bill might be improved
      by amendment, and it being a important measure, I therefore vote "no."
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the bill was ordered engrossed.
    
    
     FEES AND SALARIES.
     The special order [Mr. Foster's fee and salary bill H. R. 33] coming up--
     Mr. FOSTER: It has been said of many bills, that they are of greater importance than any
      other bills. I feel like saying that of this bill. I will not, however. But I will venture the
      assertion that no bill has been presented in this House that has elicited more attention; no
      bill has occupied more space in the newspapers in the various counties, and it has been the
      anxious concern of the people in the country, the farmers, and even the lawyers, physicians
      and professional men of various vocations; and that being so, I think it is due that we give
      this bill a thorough and candid consideration this day. I wish to say here, the assertion that
      this bill has been introduced from political or personal feelings is wholly unwarranted. I
      will call the attention of the House to the provisions of the bill as reported by the
      committee.--There is no man or no committee in this House, or in any other House, who could
      prepare a bill to which you might not have objections; therefore I wish to plead here for a
      little indulgence. The question is, whether we are goingg to have a fee and salary bill at
      all, or, whether we shall continue on the old line. It is not as to the details, as the
      Indianapolis Journal well said the other day, but it is whether a fee and salary bill is to be
      passed. I will say in the first place, it is provided that officers' salaries shall be
      paid in quarterly payments out of the county treasury, and that they shall have none of these
      fees until an amount equal to their salary shall have been collected. It will have the effect
      to stimulate the officers to collect the fees that come into the offices. There are very few
      officers in the State who will not bring in the amount of their salaries. I will say, as to
      the details of the fees, that in the clerk's office they are cut down on the whole about
      twenty per cent. And when under a salary bill the officers are compelled to collect enough to
      make their salaries they will make the fees as reasonable as possible.--As the bill originally
      stood this bill applied from the time that this law went into force. But the committee have
      seen fit to exclude from the provisions all officers now holding office. That was not my wish,
      but I believe that the bill will be a great advantage even with that in, and I leave it to the
      House to say whether it shall remain there or not. It will be nearly two years before the bill
      commences taking effect, but that will be a great step in the right direction. It has been
      objected that such a provision would not be constitutional. I do not believe in that doctrine.
      I believe that the Legislature has the constitutional and moral power to regulate  fees and salaries whether the men are in or out of office. The
      Democracy of this country will fix the responsibility where it belongs if the Democrats of
      this House fail to support such a measure.
     Now, Mr. Speaker, as to the lobby which is always here to defeat such a bill. I say that I
      do not believe that the county officers have a right to come up here and empoly their
      Representatives to support their interests. It is wrong. We are sent here as Representatives
      to represent the whole people. The time was when our county offices were looked upon as being
      most honorable positions, but that was at a time when they did not hold them as a matter of
      speculation. Most of them are regarded now as an investment. The argument has been made that
      they have a good deal of benevolence to attend to, and that they must keep up the organization
      of their party in the county. The people do not wish to foist upon themselves a class of
      officers to keep up these organizations. This should be left to the people, and the money
      which is not required for the work necessary to be done should be allowed to remain in the
      hands of the people. I believe that this very matter of corruption in county offices and these
      wrongs have done more to corrupt politics than any other one thing. I think that we can run
      the organization of our political parties without giving these men large salaries. I wish to
      say here, too, that one of the great objections to this bill is, that the fee system is the
      most fair. I admit that there is some argument in this. The system as originally intended was
      the fairest system. I think that we have tried the fee system in this country until we have
      found that it will not do. We have got to fix the salaries of men in public offices.
     Mr. MOCK: I am in favor of the reduction of these amounts. I will go as far as any man in
      the House in that direction, but I do not believe this bill meets the demand. I have several
      objections. In the first place the fees are not reduced very much. The change is, that the
      fees go to some other place and not to the county officers. In some places the fees have been
      increased. About the only reduction that has been made is, reducing the copying or writing
      from ten cents to eight cents per folio. I believe we ought to have a fixed salary for the
      Treasurer and Auditor.--If this bill becomes a law it will take a pretty smart lawyer to tell
      what the salaries are. I want to have all the fees and salaries put in one law. I want a fee
      bill that will cover the whole thing in one law. [He submitted a motion to recommit the bill
      with instructions to amend as he indicated.]
     Mr. BEASLEY moved to recommit with instructions to substitute the bill H. R. 378.
     Mr. THOMPSON moved ineffectually--yeas 42, nays 46--to lay this motion on the table.
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. KELLISON (explaining his vote) said: I vote as I do because I believe there is a demand
      on the part of the people of the State of Indiana for reform in reference to the question of
      fees and salaries; because I believe this bill proposes a system of reform in fees and
      salaries that will meet the approval of the people; because I believe the motion of the
      gentleman from Wells (Mr. Mock) and the gentleman from Vermillion, Vigo and Sullivan (Mr.
      Beasley) should not prevail; because I believe the report of the committee ought to be
      concurred in; because I believe we ought to take this bill up and amend it right here and make
      some disposition of this question, therefore I vote "aye."
     Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Owen, when his name was called, said: I think this measure will be
      treated fairly on this floor and I do not think it should be referred back to the committee at
      this time, therefore I vote "aye."
     Mr. PARKER, in explanation of his vote, said: Because I believe that a reform of the fees
      and 
       salaries
       salarie
       is demanded by the people of th State, and because I believe this 
       bill
       bi
      
       if it is passed will produce more civil service reform
      than any bill before the House, I vote "aye"
     Mr. PATTON, in explanation, said: Believing that a reform in the service should be by
      cutting down the fees, and as the bill proposed by Mr. Beasley"s motion makes a reduction
      in the fees which will benefit the litigants, and also makes a reduction in the salaries which
      will benefit the tax-payers, I am in favor of it, therefore I vote "no"
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the motion was not tabled, but was rejected by yeas 24, nays 63.
     Mr. FOSTER, explaining his vote, said: For the reason that the committee has had Bill 33
      under consideration for three or four weeks and have given it all the time that they desire to
      put on it, and every member, with the exception perhaps of one, is fully satisfied with it;
      and the chairman is satisfied with it; and for the reason that they had this bill, which was
      hatched up in the night, before them, and the committee has taken a vote on it; for the reason
      that bill is nothing but the old fee bill which has been in force so long, and for the reason
      that I believe men here have been influenced by personal solicitations, I vote
      "no."
     Mr. Mock's motion was also rejected.
     Mr. KELLISON moved to amend the bill by grading the populations of the counties and making
      the salaries range from $1,200 to $2,500.
     On motion by Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Owen, this was laid on the table by yeas 49, nays 41.
     Mr. LINCK moved to change the classification of counties--the salaries to range from $1,500
      to $3,000, and fixing those of the deputies at $600, $900 and $1,200.
     Mr. GORDON made an ineffectual motion to lay this amendment on the table. He then demanded
      the previous question, which was seconded by the House, and under its operations Mr.
      Linck's amendment was adopted.
     A motion by Mr. BUCKLES, to strike out section seven, was laid on 
       the
       e
       table by yeas 80, nays 13.
     Mr. GARDINER moved to amend so that this bill shall take effect January 1, 1888. He said: If
      this bill should become a law I do not see why it should not be made applicable to those who
      have been elected to offices and that it should apply at once to those in office. I can see no
      argument against that unless it be the one that members are desirous of awarding them the
      money they have expended in corruption of voters.
     Mr. GORDON: It may be that some men have obtained office without corruption. I think it is
      but fair that men who have been elected to office should receive the fees they anticipated
      when they were elected to office. I do not think this amendment ought to prevail. I move to
      lay it on the table.
     This motion was rejected by yeas 77, nays 12.
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. KELLISON, in explanation of his vote, said: Because I believe we sat down on this
      amendment once, and because I do not want this amendment or any other amendment to make this
      applicable to officers now elected, I therefore vote "aye."
     Mr. REYNOLDS, when his name was called, said: In view of the fact that the Constitution
      prohibits decreasing salaries after officers are elected, I vote "aye."
     Mr. ROBERTS, in explanation, said: I believe the General Assembly is omnipotent, and that
      whenever the General Assembly sees proper to decrease fees and salaries, it is right to do so,
      therefore I vote "no."
     The vote was announced as above.
     The motion was rejected.
     The bill was ordered engrossed under the operations of the previous question demanded by Mr.
      Scott.
    
    
     STATE VETERINARIAN.
     On emotion by Mr. GORDON, Mr. Buckles' bill [H. R. 109] to provide for a Live Stock
      Sanitary Commission and a State Veterinarian, was read the third time.
     Mr. BUCKLES: The importance of this measure has been recognized by everybody who has any
      connection with stock of any kind. We have no  statute
      authorizing a quarantine in any way. A car-load of diseased cattle may come here at any time
      and there is no authority for quarantine. I submit that the time is passed when can afford to
      sacrifice the live tock interests of Indiana any longer. It is worth protecting. You strike
      down the live stock interest of Indiana and you strike down prosperity, and you strike down
      the means we have to pay our taxes and to pay our debts. The raising of grain is a failure on
      account of the high rates of freight. Were it not for this live stock interest we would not be
      able to borrow $1,000,000 and promise to pay it in ten years. This great interest is one in
      which every man, woman and child in Indiana is interested. Every man that owns a cow, every
      man that eats a pound of beef, or that eats a pound of butter, is interested in this. I submit
      that there is a necessity for a measure of this and if there is a necessity for it the next
      question is, will this bill afford the desired protection. I want to say this: I had a
      consultation with prominent stock men, and after a careful examination the substance of this
      bill was agreed on and I was asked to present it.
     The bill passed by yeas 82, nays 3.
     Mr. GOUGH [explaining his negative vote]: I am opposed to it because this bill provides an
      additional expense to the State when the State is $600,000 in debt, and because it creates a
      roving commission and provides for a veterinary surgeon and makes an additional expense of
      $5,000 a year, and it may be more; and because I do not think that a State that is much in
      debt can afford to enjoy the luxury of this commission.
     The House adjourned.

     PAY OF EMPLOYEES.
     On motion by Mr. JEWETT, the Senate amendments to his bill [H. R. 14] were taken up. He said: Two of the principal amendments are, that the
      payment of wages is changed from weekly payments to fortnightly payments, and a ten days grace
      is allowed after the demand of the wages before penalty. The bill in some respects is
      weakened, but I believe, unless this House concurs in these amendments, that this bill will
      never become a law, and I insist that this House take my judgment on this matter. I desire
      this House to accept this bill as amended, though it is not the bill that it should be. The
      laboring men who want this legislation are willing, for the time being, to rest on this bill,
      therefore its friends ought to support it.
     
     Mr. BRIANT: I believe I will go as far as any gentleman on this floor or in the State of
      Indiana to protect the laboring men of Indiana, but I am strictly opposed to class
      legislation. If this bill would protect the employer as well as the employe I would vote for
      it most cheerfully, but I will say this: not one man--either farmer or manufacturer--out of
      one hundred in the northern part of the State pays his men in checks. In regard to the farmers
      or manufacturers paying their men every two weeks, there are scarcely any of them that are
      able to do it, and especially at this season of the year. I have been in the habit of paying
      my men every week, but I do not wish to legislate so that any man or any set of men can break
      a contract and turn around and effectually break up a man who is giving honest employment to
      the laboring men.
     Mr. JEWETT demanded the previous question on his motion to concur in the Senate amendments.
      The House seconded the demand, and under its operations the motion was agreed to by yeas 74,
      nays 10.
     The House adjourned.
    
   
   
   
    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    IN SENATE.
    
     SATURDAY, February 12, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Rev. C. H. McDowell, of the Baptist Church.
    
     TOLL ROAD TARIFF.
     On motion by Mr. DUNCAN, of Brown, his bill [S. 99] to regulate the tariff of toll on gravel
      and other public toll roads, was taken up and read the second time with a favorable committee
      report. He explained it provides for a reduction of the rates some fifty per cent. throughout
      the whole schedule and said: The present rate was established more than thirty years ago,
      while the traffic is perhaps three times as much now as then. These tolls are exorbitant and a
      burden upon the community. Rates of transportation on railroads within that time have been
      reduced fully one-half; and now the farmer pays as much per mile for traveling over a toll
      road as he is required to pay for travel upon a railroad where rolling stock is furnished.
      While the statjute says these roads shall not take more than eight per cent., the Legislature
      has been permitting these toll roads to make thirty or forty per cent. on their money by
      extortion from an unwilling public. The owners of turn-pikes have a complete monopoly in their
      branch of business. Under their charters they have profitable investment which runs from year
      to year and, under the present condition of things, it may run for one thousand years. It is a
      rule of business that where persons have capital invested in a safe and secure way, they need
      not expect to realize more than four to six per cent., but in the case of toll roads they
      realize from thirty to forty per cent. on their investment. The present law is unjust, because
      rates of toll are too high. Something has been said on the floor of this Senate about relief
      from the burdens of taxation for the purpose of carrying on the government. That class of
      community which are most deserving and most in need of relief at the hands of the Legislature,
      is the farming class. The farmers are most in need of relief from the burdens of taxation of
      every kind and character. They unite in themselves the elements of both labor and
      capital.--Perhaps three-fourths of the constituents of every Senator is engaged in
      agricultural pursuits. I hope the Senate will concur in the report of the committee and that
      the bill will pass.
     Mr. HUSTON: The Senator speaks of the great profits made. I would like for him to tell how
      many turn- pike companies in this State, within the last
      ten years, have declared a dividend. I am frank to state there is not one in my county that
      has ever declared a dividend.
     Mr. DUNCAN, of Brown: I speak largely of the knowledge I have of local turnpikes and gravel
      roads in my own county. The law requires information to be filed in the office of the
      Secretary of State, embracing a statement of the number of miles of each road and the cost of
      costruction; but we fnd very few of these corporations have filed these statements.
     Mr. HUSTON: Don't you know it to be a fact that gravel roads are built by the farmers
      along the roads--they subscribe for stock simply to get the road? The receipts, except in a
      few instances, are barely suffient to keep the turnpikes in order; and instead of lessening
      the rates of toll, it would be to the farmers' benefit, and to give them good roads, I
      would favor an increase of toll rather than a lessening.
     Mr. DUNCAN, of Brown: I know these roads are built by assessments on adjoining tracts of
      land, and after these assessments have been paid and the roads built they have passed into the
      hands of receivers and men who bought up the stock and virtually pay little or nothing for the
      roads which the people, by assessment, have built; and they collect nearly double the capital
      stock from the gross receipts of the roads.
     Mr. MACY: I hope this bill will not become a law. During the last ten years I find there has
      been but one solitary company which has paid a dividend. I think a law such as this would put
      every road back to a mud road, and for that reason I hope this bill will not pass.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: These roads have to be kept in repair. If the men who wear them out do not pay
      for it somebody else has to. If the man who runs over these roads occasionally does not pay
      his share, somebody else must. The question is, who is to do it? If I was to consult my
      private feelings I would vote to take away every toll gate, for if there is anything I despice
      it is to be stopped at a toll gate. But we must be fair and just. I don't think the
      owners are making fortunes out of their roads. I do not know of more than one road that makes
      it pay; but know several that barely keep themselves in repair and pay gate keepers. I
      don't think there has been a bill introduced into this Senate that deserves defeat more
      than this.
     Mr.JOHNSON: We must not legislate for a few selfish people. I suppose there are some
      contemptible and mean enough to want to ride free on a gravel road, the expenses of which are
      kept up by others. We know these roads should be kept in good repair--they are worn out in
      many ways; they must be repaired with gravel and plank, and that costs money. In Wayne and
      adjoining counties a gravel road pays but a poor return for the amount of money expended on
      it. The passage of such a law as this would prevent the owners from keeping their roads in
      proper repair, and would swamp every man who puts his money in them. I think they have some
      rights which the Legislature is bound to respect. I think it would be unjust and improper to
      pass this bill. I am in favor of free pikes where they can be properly established, but am
      unwilling to use this insidious method to force and compel their owners to sell out to the
      public whether they desire to do so or not.
     Mr. MCDONALD: I am opposed to this bill. I know the owners of the roads
      in my district are barely getting enough to pay the gate keepers and keep the roads in good
      repair. I never heard a man complain of the toll; not one. I don't think the law should
      be changed at all. I farm a little, myself, at home; and I have to haul my grain nine miles. I
      like to look at these matters in a practical way.
     Mr. KENNEDY: I think it would be wrong to pass this bill. We have three of these roads in
      Rush county; one of them, I think, pays tolerably well. The owners invested their money in
      good faith and are charging only a reasonable toll. I don't be-  lieve the present tariff pays them too much. It aint right that we
      should shut down these roads; we just as well pass a law saying they must give them up. This
      would be hiding behind a reduction of toll; but that is the same as saying they must give them
      up.
     Mr. SMITH, of Wells: This bill would not affect my county, nor Huntington county, that I
      know of. It might work a hardship to some companies, but it would have a tendency to make
      themn petition the County Commissioners to purchase the roads. I think a poor road into a
      county seat is not very profitable to the county seat. We would like more turnpike roads in
      our county. I believe in all turnpike roads being made free, where the counties can support
      them. I do not know whether the rate is too high or too low, as at present. This measure might
      make the road owners sell at a reasonable price, and at what they are probably worth.
     Mr. FOWLER: This bill does not affect any part of my district, because we haven't got a
      toll road in the district. But I received a letter a few days ago from a citizen in Senator
      Duncan's district, setting forth the facts as stated by other Senators. He lives in
      Columbus; I expect the Senator knows to whom I refer. If these facts are true, and they seem
      not to be controverted, this bill ought not to pass, because it will amount to a confiscation
      of these roads. That is just what it will amount to. I don't think it right to reduce the
      toll on roads in order to compel these corporations to sell out. When men invest money in
      property, they have a right to control it. I hope this report will not be concurred in, and in
      order to get the matter before the Senate I move that the report be indefinitely
      postponed.
     Mr. WINTER: The fact stated by the author of this bill as the strongest argument in its
      favor, is the strongest argument against it. He stated that the rates of toll were fixed
      thirty years ago and never changed since. For thirty years the people have paid the rates of
      toll then established, and from that time until now they have never discovered that they were
      suffering any serious hardship. During all these thirty year no amendent to this law has been
      made. I take that fact as conclusive upon the proposition that the rates of toll presented in
      1855 are not regarded by the people as too great. People are not in the habit of suffering
      without making complaint, especially if they can readily relieve themselves. I want to call
      attention to another thing.--This bill proposes a reduction of one half, and makes no
      discriminaton; it applies to roads that have run thirty years at a liberal profit, and it
      equally to roads recently built, which have had no time to receive a return for the outlay.
      That is not the way to legislate intelligently. The statement has been made that these roads
      are earning thirty or forty per cent. on their investments, but there is no evidence here to
      prove it. It has not been the general opinion that toll roads are profitable
      investments.--These facts go to convince me that there is no necessity for a measure of this
      kind. It would have the effect of destroying the profits in the business and compel the owners
      of these roads to sell them out to the counties at less than they are worth. This Senate
      cannot afford to be dishonest in dealing with gravel road companies.
     Mr. GRIFFITH: The discussion so far has been conducted by gentlemen representing counties
      that are level. The district I represent is hilly, and it is quite a different thing to build
      road there from what it is on a level. The building of the pikes I am familiar with costs
      $2,700 per mile. One with which I am connected received $1,243, and expended over $1,100 for
      repairs. In that section of 
       country
       oountry
       the crossing of many streams are e xpensive, and land-slides require vast sums of
      money. We have a road nine miles in length that crosses Indian Creek three times, and in one
      night, less than a year ago, these three bridges were washed away in one freshet, and it cost
      over $3,300 to rebuild them. This bill is not applicable to a section of country like that.
        In our section of the country we have a hard time to
      maintain our roads under the present toll rate. I do not know any tax that is paid more
      cheerfully than the toll that is paid down thre. I don't think I would be doing right to
      the people down there to favor the passage of a bill that would reduce the rate of toll.
     Mr. DUNCAN, of Brown: I know there has been a number of letters written to many members of
      this Legislature in regard to this proposed reduction in the rates of toll. Those who have
      interests involved are always on the watch for any danger; they are quick to respond and to
      make the impression upon members of the Legislature that the proposed bill would be the
      destruction of their interests and their property. I am not here asking the confiscation of
      anybody's property. If the proposition contained in this bill is a more sweeping
      reduction than is authorized by the facts in different parts of the State, if gentlemen are
      sincere, let them offer propositions to amend the bill instead of making motions to
      indefinitely postpone. I know Mr. Irvin, a citizen of the county of Bartholomew, a gentleman
      of the very highest character, and one for whom I have a high regard;--our personal relations
      have always been friendly. This gentleman owns about twelve miles of pike in different
      directions. This pike cost Mr. Irvin as much as seven hundred or eight hundred dollars per
      mile, on an average. I have before me a report of some of the roads of Bartholomew county,
      filed under the statute of the State, which requires such roads to make annual statements of
      the gross receipts and expenditures, and these lines of pikes owned by Mr. Irvin in 1883,
      according to his own report, netted $6,680 of gross receipts, while the actual expenditures
      amounted to about $1,500. So I say that Mr. Irvin is making forty or fifty per cent. on his
      envestment every year.
     Mr. WINTER: Was it not a fact that these roads, during the winter, were almost impossible to
      pass?
     Mr. DUNCAN, of Brown: There is no question about the value of these roads. But is that any
      reason why a man should make, every year, from four to five hundred dollars on every mile of
      road on an investment of only seven or eight hundred dollars per mile?
     Mr. JOHNSON: Suppose everything he says is true, is that any justification for the sweeping
      application of this bill all over the State?
     Mr. DUNCAN, of Brown: There is a statute providing for the purchase of toll roads, and yet I
      have not heard of the purchase of any pike under that statute. As long as these men make ten
      times as much money on their investment they are not going to sell them to the counties.
     Mr. FOWLER withdrew his motion to indefinitely postpone.
     Mr. SELLERS renewed it.
     Mr. DUNCAN, of Brown, demanded the yeas and nays.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Senator from Brown does that in the face of the fact that
      there is no quorum present.
     Mr. BAILEY: I am opposed to this motion, without particular regard to the merits of the
      bill. I think it has some merits and might be amended and printed. It seems to me this motion
      to indefinitely postpone is too severe and unreasonable.
     Mr. SELLERS: If the Senator from Brown will consent that this bill be made a special order I
      am willing to withdraw my motion.
     Mr. DUNCAN, of Brown: I will agree to make it a special order for Wednesday at ten
      oclock.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The agreement is that the bill shall be made a special order for
      Wednesday at 10½ o'clock.
    
    
     ONE MILLION DOLLARS LOAN BILL.
     Mr. BAILEY: I ask for consent to introduce a loan bill. There seems to be some delay in the
      other House about this matter.
     Mr. FOWLER, and MANY SENATORS: "I object!"
      "I object!"
     Mr. BAILEY: I move that leave be granted.
     
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Does the Senator from Owen object? Read the bill the first time
      by title.
     The Secretary read "A bill [S. 286] to authorize a debt to be contracted on behalf of
      the State of Indiana by making a loan of money."
     Mr. FOWLER: Was there a motion made and put that this bill might be introduced?
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair distinctly asked the Senator from Owen if he had any
      objection.
     Mr. FOWLER: I didn't hear the question. I did have objections.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Then the chair directed the Senator (Mr. Bailey) to send his bill
      up and have it read.
    
    
     INSANE ASYLUM INVESTIGATION.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore announced the Committee to investigate the management of
       the Benevolent Institutions of the State, authorized by the resolution printed on
      page 381 of this book, namely: Messrs. Shively, Bailey, Griffith, Huston and Sears.
    
    
     LOST HOSPITAL PATIENT.
     Mr. DRAKE: Pertinent to that resolution there was one I introduced [see page 199 of this
      book] which was referred to the Committee on Benevolent Institutions. I
      understand the committee has done nothing with that resolution, and in order to save an
      investigation by two committees, I move that resolution be ordered returned and placed in the
      hands of this committee.
     Mr. RAHM [chairman of the Commitee on Benevolent Institutions]: I want to
      explain. That resolution has never been sent to myself or to the committee. I have asked the
      Secretary for the resolution. The committee is ready to investigate; we are ready to attend to
      that business as soon as the resolution reaches us.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: When the resolution goes to the committee the committee can
      report.
     Mr. DRAKE: There is a family in our county very 
       anxious
       anxions
       to know the facts concerning the lady. No trace of her has been discovered.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: There is a committee appointed which the chair thinks will make a
      proper exposition of the whole matter.
     Mr. RAHM: I want to know if that takes it out of the committee's hands?
     PRESIDENT pro tempore: It has never been in the committee's hands, if the Senator
      states correctly.
     Mr. DRAKE: if the Clerk will say the resolution is lost I will furnish a substitute for
      it.
     The PRESIDNET pro tempore: This Select Committee is appointed especially to make an
      investigation into the management. What the Senator wants is to return the resolution that it
      may be referred to this committee for its investigation.
     The Senate adjourned.
    
   
   
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
    
     SATURDAY, February 12, 1887.
    
    
     SUPREME COURT RECORDS.
     Mr. GRIFFITHS, from the Special Committee thereon, reported them
      "nearly all, excepting the papers in pending cases, in a filthy condition and a chaotic
      state." Also, a bill [S. 412] for indexing the records and papers in the Clerk's
      office of the Supreme Court.
    
    
     INTEREST ON SCHOOL FUNDS.
     The bill [H. R. 10] to fix the rate of interest on school fund loans at six per cent.; was
      read the third time and passed by yeas 73, nays 8.
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. GORDON [explaining his vote] said: The bill, if it becomes a law, will reduce the length
      of the school term or increase the taxation of the people. The average length of the common
      schools in the country townships will not amount to one hundred days in the year. It has been
      stated that the money cannot be loaned.--That may be true in some cases, but I am of the
      opinion that there ought to be a law authorizing the loaning of these funds in adjoining
      counties. The trouble is not from the rate at which the
      monies are loaned but is from the method of loaning them. The fundamental object of this
      school money is for the benefit of the schools, and it ought to be made to benefit the
      schools. If it could be loaned at ten per cent. it ought to be done. Believing this bill ought
      not to prevail I vote "no."
     Mr. GOUGH, when his name was called, said: For the reason that I believe the common schools
      should be supported by general taxation and not by taxation on those who procure money from
      the State, I vote "aye."
     Mr. HARRELL, in explanation of his vote, said: I am inclined to think that this interest
      ought to be reduced, for I believe it will benefit the people who need these funds and cannot
      afford to pay a higher rate of interest. I do not think it will seriously affect the school
      funds. I know the people in my county are in favor of the reduction of the interest on the
      school funds, therefore I vote "aye."
     Mr. HOWARD, when his name was called, said: For the reason that the funds regulate the rate
      on other loans in my county, and for the reason in the same county the borrowers are mostly
      poor men, and for the reason I believe that the people of the State should educate the
      children of the State, I vote "aye."
     Mr. KELLISON [in explanation]: For the reason that I believe that the State of Indiana ought
      not to expect to loan its funds to its citizens and expect them to pay more than for other
      loans; and because I believe this bill, if it becomes a law, will have the effect to compel
      the reduction of interest on private loans, and will compel the passage of a law forbidding a
      higher rate of interest than six per cent.; and because I believe that time has come, and
      because I believe it ought to be the policy of the State in loaning school funds to get its
      money back and to have its funds in the form of money instead of foreclosing its mortgages and
      burdening itself with lands. For these and other reasons, I vote "aye."
     Mr. MOCK, when his name was called, said: Because I believe that the school fund should be
      kept as a sacred fund for the education of the children of the State; and because I know that
      in the northern part of the State it can be loaned for eight per cent., I vote
      "no."
     Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Owen [in explanation of his vote]: The gentleman from Wells (Mr. Mock)
      says that we can loan school monies for eight per cent. We might loan it for fifteen per
      cent., but I don't believe it would be right. I will vote for this reduction because I
      believe it is right. I vote "aye."
     Mr. ROBERTS [explaining] said: I will vote for this bill because I do not believe that
      mnoney is worth more six per cent. If we could get twenty-five per cent. for this money I do
      not think the State would be justified in taking it. I think the State should allow the people
      to have the use of the funds at a reasonable rate. I vote "aye."
     Mr. WEYAND, when his name was called, said: I am not entirely in favor of this bill for I
      think it is too sweeping in its provisions. Seven per cent. would suit me better. From a
      business stand-point I would be compelled to vote against this bill, but as the school fund of
      my county is borrowed by poor people and this bill is to reduce the rate from eight to six per
      cent. I vote "aye."
     The SPEAKER, in explanation of his vote, said: I desire to say, because this House has
      refused to reduce the rate of interest to six per cent. generally; because I believe the
      school fund is worth as much interest as any other money; and because the difference in rate
      will cause the county officers to loan this money to their friends at the lower rate of
      interest, I vote "no."
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the bill passed the House.
    
    
     LEGISLATIVE APPORTIONMENT.
     Mr. KERCHEVAL offered the following:
     
      
       
        Whereas, The General, Assembly of the State of Indiana, at its session of 1885, passed
         Congressional and Legislative ap- portionment bills,
         the effect of which was to practically disfranchise at least one-fourth of the voters of
         the State; and,
        Whereas, Such bills were grossly unfair to the people and in direct violation of the
         Constitutional provision that such apportionment shall be made "among the several
         counties according to the number of male inhabitants above twenty-one years of age in
         each;" and,
        Whereas, Such apportionment bills were intended to so distribute the representation in
         the lower House of the National Congress and the number of Senators and Representatives in
         the General Assembly of the State among the people of the several counties as to give one
         political party an undue and unfair advantage; and,
        Whereas, Such purpose was freely expressed by one of the Senators from this State in the
         Congress of the United States, having, as it has been reported, without denial, publicly
         declared that "he would feel personally disgraced unless the next (meaning the
         present) General Assembly should have at least sixty Democratic on joint ballot;"
         and,
        Whereas, The majority of the people of the State of Indiana, irrespective of the partisan
         considerations involved, did, in the general election held in November last, condemn the
         said unfair apportionment by electing a majority of the Congressmen, and returning to the
         Legslature a majority of all the members voted for in political opposition to the party
         responsible for said bills, and by giving a majority of 8,500 in the popular vote in favor
         of the legislative candidates of the party in such political opposition; and,
        Whereas, the said apportionment bills are, for the reasons stated, unjust,
         unconstitutional, and should be speedily reformed in harmony with the views of the people
         so expressed at such general election; therefore, be it
        Resoved, by the House of Representatives, the Senate concurring, That a joint committee
         of the two houses be constituted, to consists of an equal number from each of the two great
         political parties, who shall examine into the question and report to said houses at their
         earliest convenience what measures, if any, should be taken to correct and reform the
         existing Congressional and Legislative apportionments of the State.
       
      
     
     He moved its reference to the Committee on Elections and demanded the
      previous question thereon.
     The House seconded the demand, and under its operations the motion to refer was agreed to by
      yeas 51, nays 34.
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. GORDON, when his name was called, said: Because I believe this is a reflection on the
      last General Assembly, and I believe that all the recitements in this resolution are wholly
      false, I vote "no."
     Mr. GRIFFITHS [explaining] said: For the reason that, in my judgement, no possible
      reflection could be made on the last General Assembly; and for the further reason that the
      people of the State have cast that reflection, if any reflection could be cast, and as that
      apportionment was manifestly unjust and unfair, I vote "aye."
     Mr. IBACH [in explanation of his vote]: Believing that the resolution does not speak the
      truth; and believing that there never was a fairer apportionment bill passed than the present
      one, I vote "no."
     Mr. JEWETT [explaining]: I believe the preamble is not true. I was a member of the last
      General Assembly, and at that time I had some misgivings about the fairness of the legislative
      apportionment, but whatever misgivings I had were quieted by the election. The former
      apportionment I believed to be unfair, and the present law was passed to even the inequalities
      of 1879. On the apportionment of 1879 the Democrats elected in 1884 a majority of more than
      forty members of the General Assembly. I believed that that was unfair; I thought the parties
      were more evenly balanced than this. Experience, and the vote of the people, have now shown
      that this later apportionment was fair. I am opposed to this resolution and I vote
      "no."
     Mr. PATTON [explaining his vote]: For the reason that I was the chairman of the House
      committee on apportionment two years ago; and for the reason that, two years before, the
      Democrats were enabled to carry eleven of the Republican districts in the State and gave us a
      majority in the lower House; and for the reason that, the people of the State characterized it
      as a political matter, and have never attempted to examine it and its merits; and for the
      reason that, in the last General Assembly there was a measure introduced by the Republicans to
      reduce the representation of the State of Indiana from fifty to twenty-three in the Senate,
      and from one hundred to sixty in the House; for the 
      reason that they voted for it unanimously, to perpetrate the greatest outrage and fraud that
      was ever attempted, I vote "aye." [Cries of "order," "order."]
      [Cheers from Republican benches] I vote "no."
     Mr. ROBERTS [in explanation]: I think that we should not engage in any political
      controversies on this floor, but we ought to get down to the work which we were sent here by
      the people to transact, and let party controversies alone, and further the business of the
      General Assembly, therefore I vote "no."
     Mr. STUBBLEFIELD [in explanation]: For the reason that the apportionment made by the
      gentlemen in the last General Assembly in effect disfranchises about 25,000 of the voters of
      the State of Indiana; and because of the fact that two hundred old line Democrats in Pike
      county looked on that gerrymander as outrageous and voted for the gentleman from Pike; and
      because I wish a more thorough investigation of their great crime against the people of
      Indiana, therefore I vote "aye."
     Mr. ROBINSON, when his name was called, said: For the reason that I regard this resolution
      at this time as buncomb, which will not have any effect to change the law as it now is;
      because the Constitution provides that every six years this change shall be made; because our
      time is limited and should not be used for buncomb; and because the law as it now stands is
      very acceptable to the Greenback element of my district; and because of that the Greenback
      party has in this Assembly to-day at least two representatives; for these and other reasons I
      vote "aye."
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the motion to refer was agreed to.
     Mr. Roberts introduced a bill [H. R. 413] to authorize cities to construct, repair and
      maintain levees.

    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    IN SENATE.
    
     MONDAY, February 14, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Rev. C. T. White, of the Presbyterian Church, of
     Portland, Ind.
    
     BENEVOLENT INSTITUTIONS INVESTIGATION.
     Mr. SHIVELY asked and obtained release from service on the Special
       Committee appointed to investigate the Benevolent Institutions. He said his
      delicate health would not permit him to undertake the labor.
     Mr. HUSTON offered the following:
     
      
       
        Whereas, The Senate provided by resolution for an investigation of our State benevolent
         institutions, and appointed the committee for such investigation; and,
        Whereas, The extent of said investigation is not clearly defined by said resolution;
         therefore, be it
        Resolved, That this committee be instructed to make a most searching inquiry regarding
         the business management of the various benevolent institutions, and especially to inquire
         into and report as to the moral character, business capacity and special fitness of those
         placed in charge of said institutions; also, that the minority shall be authorized to
         employ for their use in this investigation both an attorney and stenographer.
       
      
     
     Mr. MCDONALD: The employment of an attorney and stenographer is provided
      for in the original resolution.
     Mr. HUSTON: The minority would have no voice in the selection of either. The majority of the
      committee would arrange that.
     Mr. BAILEY [chairman of said committee]: The Senate has authorized the committee to select a
      stenographer and such legal talent as may be necessary to take up this investigation and
      pursue it with absolute thoroughness. If the Senator from Fayette (Mr. Huston) assumes that
      the majority is going to have a stenographer who shall take down that alone which will save
      their side, from a political stand-point, he colors his idea from the minority view of it.--We
      wish the investigaton to be thorough and searching, and to keep and preserve a full report.
      This investigation is not for the purpose of making a report that shall sustain the majority,
      or sustain either side.
     Mr. HUSTON: Does the Senator pretend to say that in the selection of an attorney the
      minority will have any voice? Will not the majority determine who the attorney shall be?
     Mr. BAILEY: The majority are greater in number by one, any it is our purpose to select an
      attorney, honest and efficient, who shall pursue the investigation to the end that the truth
      and the whole truth, shall ap-  pear.If the Republican
      party want to employ an attorney to make a Republican report, that is not, our intention.
     Mr. HUSTON: If it is not the intention of the majority to make a partisan report why do they
      object to the minority having an equal opportunity of making this investigation with majority
      of the committee? I can see no reason why they claim for themselves the right and privilege to
      appoint an attorney, and then any deny us the same privilege and right.
     Mr. BAILEY: You are simply assuming from the out-set that the majority of this committee are
      to make a partisan report, when we disclaim any such intention.
     Mr. HUSTON: I hope this resolution will pass. I believe the time has come when we want a
      thorough investigation of the benevolent institutions of the State. I believe in asking for
      our party no more than is just and right, and it is for that majority here to say whether they
      will accord us the same privileges and rights they claim for themselves.
     Mr. BAILEY: Do you undertake to say that if we employ a stenographer, who will be competent
      and thorough in his profession, that he would draft such a report upon the evidence and
      testimony coming before the committee, as would not be in full accord with the facts?
     Mr. HUSTON: No, by no means. Stenographers, as far as I have come in contact with them, are
      honest men. What gave rise to the introduction of this resolution was this: When the evidence
      in the McDonald contested case was taken before the Committee on Elections
      the stenographer was under the control absolutely of the majority of the committee. He had the
      evidence taken before the committee and he wrote it out and prepared the majority report, and
      the minority were excluded from his notes and could not make a report with the majority of the
      committee.
     Mr. BAILEY: The minority were permitted to get such evidence and such full and complete
      report as they desired, and when the committee was in session they were present and had as
      complete access to--
     Mr. HUSTON: Who wrote out the report for the majority?
     Mr. BAILEY: The evidence was written by the stenographer; who wrote it out for the minority,
      also.
     Mr. HUSTON: Three or four weeks after.
     Mr. RAHM: I don't see the necessity of having an attorney for either side. I venture to
      say that if the regular Committee of this Senate on Benevolent and Reformatory
       Institutions had been authorized to investigate the Insane Asylum, or any other
      asylum, we could have done it most thoroughly without a lawyer on either side. I for one, give
      notice that I will not vote for an attorney for either of these gentlemen. This special
      committee has able men on it, and what do they want with an attorney? It is right enough to
      get a stenographer so as to get the questions and answers down properly, but what do they want
      with a lawyer? It is entirely unnecessary. I move that the resolution be laid on the
      table.
     Mr. SELLERS: I am opposed to this resolution because, in the first place, it is a reflection
      upon those who may constitute a majority of the committee; and I am opposed to it because it
      is not a proper thing to be considered by this body. A committee is a unit. You cannot call
      upon a majority or a minority to do anything; but the committee does it. I therefore raise the
      point of order that this resolution is out of order in that it cannot treat a committee as two
      separate bodies.
     Mr. TRIPPET: There are twenty-one lawyers on this floor and it is a reflection upon that
      class in this Senate to ask that they hire another lawyer to help them.
     Mr. JOHNSON: I regard this as a work of supererogation and unnecessary. I did not catch the
      full import of the resolution till I read it the second time. It strikes me as a waste of time
      and expenditure of the public money to have a separate and distinct committee, to do the same
      work and cover the same ground that the House committee
      will. As far as the pending resolution is concerned the majority can take the responsibility
      of refusing the minority a fair representation. I think the minority ought to be heard, and
      this committee ought to be satisfactorily made up. We are wishing to look forward to a record
      that will enlighten us, and show the true condition of these asylums. It has been stated on
      this floor that this committee was to vindicate the Democratic party, and in the constitution
      of this committee the Senator from Marion (Mr. Bailey) who is a violent partisan, has been
      given a prominent position; and judging from the investigation in the Election Committee it so
      not to be supposed that the rights of the minority will be more respected than the majority
      see fit.
     [A conversational debate between Messrs. Johnson, Trippet and DeMotte was not distinctly
      heard by this reporter.]
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Senator from Wayne will take his seat. The Doorkeeper will
      put Senators in their seats. The Senator from Porter (Mr. DeMotte) will take his seat.
     Mr. DEMOTTE [as his chair overturned and he fell to the floor]: The Chair
      will see with what alacrity I obey. [Laughter.]
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Senators will see their disorderly conduct is not commendable,
      and the necessity, when the chair is rapping for order, that Senators take their seats. The
      chair desires to pass upon the point of order. If any Senator desires to speak to the point of
      order the chair will recognize him.
     Mr. SHIVELY: If any Senator entertains the idea that the resolution was gotten up for
      political purposes he is mistaken.
     Mr. SELLERS: I am sorry to interrupt the Senator from Grant but beg leave to interrupt any
      Senator who speaks to anything but the point of order.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Senator from Grant speaks in a low tone. If Senators will
      listen I am certain he will not trespass upon the rules of order. He seldom takes the
      floor.
     Mr. SHIVELY: I say, upon my reputation as a Senator, I conceived in my own mind and got up
      that resolution for the purpose of obtaining a complete investigation. I consulted with no
      man, and with no Senator upon this floor as to the propriety of introducing a resolution of
      this kind. It is a thing of my own conceiving and for no political purpose. Politics had
      nothing to do with it in my mind.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I do not question the sincerity of the Senator who has just
      spoken; but the Senate will remember at the time this resolution was introduced the only
      speech made in its favor declared it was on purpose to get a club with which to beat out the
      brains of the Republican party; and that being the only official declaration as to its object,
      naturally led me to suspicion--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [interrupting]: The Senator ought to speak to the question of
      order.
     Mr. HUSTON: I am willing the part referring to an attorney and stenographer shall be
      stricken out.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Senator from Wayne [Mr. Johnson] has on several occasions
      misrepresented the chair; and I know he does it unintentionally. I do not think the Senator
      desires to mis-state the Senator from Jackson (the speaker) but when the Senator from
      Wayneways that he Senator from Jennings (the speaker) said that this committee was appointed
      for the purpose of white-washing the Democratic party, it was a mis-statement. The Senator
      from Jennings said that a committee was raised in the other end of the capitol for the purpose
      of blacking the character of the Demoratic party and the only way to have a fair and honorable
      report made, which would do justice to the examination and vindicate the Democratic party, was
      to have the truth shown through a committee raised in this body.
     Mr. BAILEY: I object to the withdrawal of any part of the resolution.
     Mr. HUSTON: I claim I have the right during the pendency of the res- olution to withdraw any part of it or consent to an amendment.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair don't understand how anybody can know whether
      there is going to be a minority of that committee or not.
     Mr. HUSTON: The resolution as it now is makes no reference to a majority or a minority.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair don't wnat to describe it as being introduced for
      political effect. The resolution is just exactly, almost in words and sentiment, the
      resolution passed the other day. I think the whole resolution out of order.--The author having
      withdrawn the obnoxious part there is nothing left of it.
     Mr. HUSTON: May I be allowed the privilege of giving the reasons for introducing that
      resolution?
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Undoubtedly. The chair understood you did.
     Mr. BAILEY: I object. He is--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Wait a momesit. Let the Senator explain himself.
     Mr. BAILEY: He is going to talk to a resolution declared out of order--a resolution which I
      believe has been introduced for buncomb and for political effect.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The point of order is well taken, for the reason there is nothing
      before the Senate.
     Mr. HUSTON: I rise to a question of privilege. With all due respect to the Chair, and
      acknowledging the courtesy extended in appointing me on that committee, I decline to serve,
      and will give my reasons therefor. I introdued this resolution in good faith. I asserted on
      the floor of the Senate last Friday that, if I was a member of it, it should be my earnest
      endeavor to make a most thorough and searching investigation, let the chips fall where they.
      might, and to let no man go unsmirched if found guilty. I introduced this resolution in order
      that the investigation might be more thorough than provided for in the resolution passed here
      last Friday, and because I believe it would bring forth what the people of Indiana want to
      know. That resolution authorizes and instructs the committee to inquire into the moral
      character and business capacity and fitness of those holding places in the benevolent
      institutions of the State. I pretend to say that charges of the most infamous and damnable
      character have been made against men who by the mnajority here are kept in control and in
      charge of our benevolent institutions.
     Mr. BAILEY: I rise to a point of order; the same I raised before: that the Senator is going
      outside of any question of privilege and discussing a resolution that has been declared out of
      order.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Senator from Fayette rises to a question of personal
      privilege. The chair is not going to attempt to restrain him unless he goes far beyond the
      limits. I know he is loaded and wants to relieve himself of a little responsibility in getting
      off the committee.
     Mr. HUSTON: The question has been urged: in what respect this resolution would increase the
      efficiency of the committee over the resolution passed last Friday. Although the Senator from
      Marion (Mr. Bailey) stated emphatically all the points covered in the resolution of Friday, I
      take notice he is strenuously opposed to the passage of this resolution. There must be somne
      reason for his opposition. This resolution would instruct the committee to inquire into the
      moral character of some men who are moral lepers, and so regarded throughout the State. I want
      this investigation, not to defend and protect any one, but to show the facts as they exist. If
      this resolution had been adopted I would have consented to serve on the committee, but front
      what has been said by the presiding officer of this body when that resolution was under
      consideration, and believing that the investigation is to be made only with a purpose and
      desire to counteract what may be reported by the investigating committee of the  House of Representatives, and believing that the minority of the
      committee will not receive right and justice at the hands of the majority, for these reasons I
      respectfully decline to serve.
     Mr. JOHNSON: I rise to a question of privilege. I desire to refer to what the Honorable
      Chairman (the President pro tempore) stated in debate last Friday. I believe the Chair stated
      that he did not believe I intend to misrepresent him. I certainly do not. It becomes simply a
      question of recollection between the Chair and Senators. I distinctly understood the Chair to
      say that the Democratic party were not guilty of these charges: for instance, what Gen.
      Harrison said about the mal-administration of affairs in the benevolent institutions of the
      State. I understood the Chair to deny these things and say they were not true, and I
      distinctly understood the Chair to say that it was necessary for the vindication of the
      Democratic party that this committee should be appointed; that a committee was appointed in
      the other end of the capitol for the purpose of smirching the Democratic party and this
      committee was necessary for its vindication; and you also used the term for the protection of
      the Democratic party. I used the word "white- wash." I believe there are a great
      many things the Senator said on that ocasion he is unable to go back and state just exactly
      what he did say.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [Mr. Cox in the chair]: I have been misrepresented by the Senator
      from Wayne (Mr. Johnson) on more than one occasion, but being in the chair could not resent
      them, and do not desire to do so now. The Senator from Wayne speaks of me as the Senator from
      Jackson and Jennings, so-called. TheSenator from Wayne does not desire, in my judgment, to
      misrepresent me, but he is a very impulsive speaker, and just as impulsive a listener. He
      listens by impulse as well as speaks by impulse. I know he did not understand me aright. What
      the chair said on that occasion was substantially this: In the other end of the capitol a
      partisan committee had been raised; that committee had been appointed in the judgment of the
      Speaker of the House, if indeed he had any judgment, for partisan purposes; and the object of
      it was to investigate the managemnent of the Insane Hospital. The object of investigating the
      Insane Hospital is to sustain a report made by a so-called civil-service commission; the
      committee in the other end of the capitol was raised to blacken the name of the Democratic
      party, that is what it is raised for. I said it was the object and purpose and intention of
      that committee to do so. I said then, believing it, and I say now, believing it, that the
      whole management and machinery was and is for partisan purposes; and I said the Democratic
      Senate should adopt this resolution; and it was afterward adopted, in self-defence; to the end
      now that a fair and honorable and searching investigation should be made into the affairs of
      the Insane Htospital;--to the end that no whitewashing should be done. It is unfair, and
      absolutely beyond the bounds of right to investigate such an institution of charity by a
      partisan committee appointed for a partisan purpose. I said that it was my object and my
      desire to have the people look to this Senate for a fair report, and to make such an
      investigation and place it uon the pages of our records as would shine out in future years to
      glorify and vindicate the Democratic party in its management of the charitable and benevolent
      institutions of the State.
     Mr. JOHNSON [in his seat]: There is no doubt in your speech--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: There is no doubt if there is a short-hand, reporter who will
      take it down but that it will be read to the satisfaction of the Senator from Wayne.
     Mr. JOHNSON: I will ask if this was not the language of the Senator last Friday: that the
      whole purpose of the investigation in the other side of the capitol was to smirch the
      Democratic party, and that this committee was necessary for the purpose of  defending and vindicating the Democratic party?

     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: I said that this committee was organized for the purpose and
      object of writing upon the tables of its record that which every Senator on the floor knows to
      be true, as a vindication of the party in power that is managing the benevolent institutions
      of the State.
     Mr. JOHNSON: That is just exactly what I said.
     Mr. HUSTON: If the purpose of this committee is to ascertain the truth, the whole truth, and
      nothing but the truth, why did the Democratic majority here refuse to adopt the resolution
      that proposed this investigation shall go deeper, and be more thorough, and shall enquire into
      the moral character of men in charge of these institutions, and especially so when charges of
      gross immorality stand undenied, and have for the past year?
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Senate has not refused to adopt a resolution upon this
      subject that will lead the committee up to a point of a most searching investigation.
     Mr. HUSTON: But it refused--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Wait a moment. The Senator from Fayette sat in his seat the other
      day and refused to offer an amendment to the resolution, to make it more specific in its
      terms, if it was necessary to make it more specific. I say now, upon the reading of that
      resolution, everything that could be proven under the resolution the Senator offered this
      morning can be proven under the resolution adopted the other day. If the Senator from Fayette
      is so willing to have these things investigated; is so willing to have a fair report, and if
      he believes, as he professes to, that there is moral leprosy in the management; that
      everything is rotten; that men's hands there are unclean and reeking in filth and
      dishonor, why does he decline to serve on that committee? You are a leader in the Republican
      party, and to go on that committee and report the truth, if the truth is as you say, would be
      to vindicate your party and yourself upon the criminal charges you made in the last campaign
      concerning the management of this institution.--Why do you back down? Why do you shrink from
      that responsibility which belongs to every honest man? Now, for the first time in the history
      of one of the greatest charities of the State, a charge has been made on the floor of the
      Senate by a distinguished leader of the Republican party, who declines to assist in an
      investigation of its management, which, if true, ought to sink its management into everlasting
      shame and disgrace.
     Mr. HUSTON: I am individually and personally responsible for the statements I make, here or
      elsewhere.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: You are individually responsible to say what you please and we
      are individually responsible to believe what we please. These same statements were preached
      from every stump in the last campaign. It was on these statements you sought to raise a
      furore, and when election day came, from behind the dust and smoke you would stand with two
      dollar bills, saying, "take this and vote the Republican ticket."
     Mr. HUSTON: He makes the direct charge that we bought votes. I want to know if he makes that
      charge on this floor against me as an individual?
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: No, not as an individual, but as chairman of the
       Republican State Central Committee you were engaged in the business. It is
      time these things should be talked about on the floor of this Senate. It is time the people
      should know where this responsibility rests. It is time these charges against the management
      of this institution should be shown to be true, or he who brought the charge should branded
      before the people as a falsifier. If they are true, for one I want to know it. If false, I
      want to know it. When you reply, tell us what kind of management there was before Dr. Rogers
      was superintendent. That Insane Hospital was run as a house of prostitution. It reached a
      politi- cal management such as would disgrace the devil
      and his hosts. It was run for partisan and political purposes, and for nothing else; and
      honor, honesty, decency and virtue slunk away in a corner and hid. I dare you deny it.
     When he concluded--
     Mr. HUSTON: Is it understood that at the convening of the session this afternoon we are to
      be heard?
     VOICES--"Yes." "Yes."
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     Mr. FRENCH: My purpose is to have this matter referred to the regular Committee on
       the Benevolent and Reformatory Institutions of the State. I believe that committee
      is competent for the purposes for which it was appointed. I believe it is competent to make
      this investigation and do it fairly. The appointment of a special committee has led to a great
      deal of discussion and not a little dissatisfaction. One of its members on the Democratic side
      has been excused;--as he says himself he shrinks from the duties. One distinguished member on
      the Republican side has also declined to serve on that committee; and I believe, in the
      interest of justice and harmony and the vast amount work before this body, the best thing we
      can do is to reconsider the vote and assign this important work to the regular
       Committee on Benevolent Institutions. I don't care to take the time
      of the Senate in discussing this motion, for I believe it will commend itself to the sound
      judgment of both sides of this body.
     Mr. HUSTON: I will say at the out-set that I don't propose to take up much of the time
      of the Senate--
     Mr. SELLERS [interposing]: I rise to a point of order. A motion has been made to
      reconsider.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: the Senator will write the motion out and send it up, it will be
      acted upon at some future day. The Senator from Fayette (Mr. Huston) is entitled to the floor
      on a privileged question.
     Mr. SELLERS: He has not asked the floor for a privileged question.
     Mr. HUSTON: I asked for the floor before noon.
     Mr. SELLERS: No person has any right to control the time of the Senate. The time of the
      Senate is within the control of the Senate. If any arbitrary ruling of that kind is made, I
      will appeal to the Senate.
     Mr. HUSTON: If the Senate desires to cut off debate, and wishes it to go forth to the world
      that I shall not be heard, after unlimited time was given your side this morning, then let the
      record be so made.
     Mr. SELLERS: The Senator understands, as well as I do, that when the motion comes up
      to-morrow, or some future day, the Senator will be entitled to a hearing upon it.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Will it suit the Senator from Fayette to make his speech
      to-morrow, on the motion to reconsider? The chair is not inclined to cut the Senator from
      Fayette off.
     Mr. HUSTON: If I am allowed full time I am willing.
     Mr. JOHNSON: I want to say to the Senator from White (Mr. Sellers) that I have not shown a
      disposition to rush into a political debate, though I have been blamed by my political party
      friends for not taking a part. I have endeavored to be conservative, recognizing the fact that
      there is a political party on the other side.--This political debate was not commenced by the
      Republicans. The occupant of the chair commenced it. It would not have occurred but by the
      fault of the gentleman occupying the chair.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair wants to say this to the gentleman from Wayne: the
      chair has no apology to make to the Senator from Wayne or to any other Senator for speaking on
      the floor of the Senate.
     Mr. JOHNSON: I don't suppose there ever was a time in the life of the Senator from
      Jennings that he did anything he would apologize for.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Senator from White seems to have provoked the Senator from
      Wayne.
     
     Mr. FRENCH: I insist on the point of order.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The point of order is sustained.
     Mr. JOHNSON: This point of order should not be made for the purpose of preventing a reply to
      the political harangue this morning. I want to be heard now and am choked off. You are
      unwilling for the Republican party to be heard.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [using the gavel while Mr. JOHNSON spoke of
      "arbitrary ruling;" "the Chair can give commands to the Doorkeeper;"
      "and assail Senators on this floor," etc., etc.]: The Senator is out of order. The
      chair don't intend to be interrupted. You have been declared out of order two or three
      times and refused to take your seat. When the chair raps you out of order it is your business
      to take your seat or the chair will make you. The Doorkeeper will put the Senator in his seat
      and if necessary he will keep him there. Keep him down in his seat. Don't be mild about
      it. Stay by him. Stay right there. If he rises again put him down. Stay there right by him. If
      he gets up put him in his seat. The chair has been trying to be friendly to the Senator. The
      Senate will take up the special order for this hour.
    
    
     THE INTIMIDATION ACTS.
     The bill [S. 7] to repeal Sections 2126 and 2127, R. S., was read the second time.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: I don't think these clauses have injured any honest man in Indiana. I
      move this bill be indefinitely postponed.
     Mr. LOGSDON: During the debates that have taken place on this floor I have remained a silent
      and attentive listener but now I desire to be heard for a few moments upon the question under
      consideration. I regard this measure, Mr. President, as one of the most important that has yet
      been presented in this body. It is one of more importance, perhaps, than the majority of
      Senators are disposed to regard it. I am most earnestly in favor of this bill offered by the
      Senator from Vanderburg (Mr. Rahm.) It is a fact repeatedly announced on the floor of this
      chamber--a fact no one can successfully contradict--that the tendency of legislation in this
      country for years past been in the interests of the few as against the many--in the interest
      of the rich as against the poor. It has been legislation tending to the building up and
      establishing of monopolies and corporations, and the concentration of power and wealth, and to
      the impoverishing of the masses, and especially of those who are comparatively living by the
      sweat of their brows. Step by step, degree by degree, have these monopolies and corporations
      advanced their interests through legislation, and otherwise, until their influence has become
      a most irresistable. They enter halls of legislation, both State and National, and by
      arrogance, only exceeded by their cupidity, insist upon what laws shall be repealed and what
      enacted. Already they have captured, soul and body, one of the branches of our National
      Government, and to-day in the Senate of the United States, composed as it is and controlled is
      by corporations and representatives of monopolies, a poor man has no longer the shadow of
      consideration--he has there absolutely no chance. The day was, Mr. President, when the
      province of law was to prevent the encroachments of the strong upon the weak, but these
      corporations have changed that. They continually, demand the enactment of laws that will
      further their own ends and advance their own cause, whether it impoverishes the great laboring
      masses or not. Take that unjust high protective tariff law that has been maintained through
      the influence of these corporations. For years past the law gives to them the exclusive
      market, and forbids importation of foreign manufactured goods to come into competition with
      their goods.--Under it they are permitted to associate together and regulate prices, and to
      regulate as well the wages of their employes. Although under that law importation of foreign
      goods is forbidden, and their profits are increased thereby, when an unfortunate  employe appeals to them in pitiful tones in behalf of his starving
      and half-clad family, whose pay is insufficient to meet his wants, they say "we will
      reduce your wages; if you can't stay and work for what we are willing pay you, we will
      scour European countries and import the pauper labor of foreign countries to take your
      place." And they do it, for there is no law to prevent the importation of labor. Thus it
      is in this country that strikes occur. Thus it is that these unfortunate laborers are
      determined to associate themselves into organized bodies for the purpose of defending their
      own interests and their own rights against the encroachment of capital. But when they
      strike--when they threaten these manufacturers to stop the wheels of their machinery, they are
      going beyond what the law justifies. They are going beyond the point I could justify and
      aprove of, but I appeal to you if this condition of things is not due to the class of
      legislation I refer to. I appeal to you if this condition of things is not brought about by
      manufacturers and corporations themselves.--Now they come into the halls of legislation of
      Indiana, as they did a few years ago, when they got a law that can be used on their part as a
      legalized weapon of intimidation and threat to compel these men, in sum and substance, to
      accept wages they are disposed to pay them, though these wages are insufficient to properly
      care and provide for their families. With this legalized weapon of intimidation which the
      State of Indiana through the Legislature has placed in their hands, they stand over these men
      and they cower beneath the lash. They say yon must put up with this condition of things
      because the law says you shall.
     Mr. President, there should be no possible necessity for the enactment a law of this kind
      from any standpoint. There are laws upon the statute books sufficient to provide for the
      punishment of any offense that may arise out of the unlawful use of force; so I say from that
      stand-point there can be no reason for this law to remain upon the statute books. I am in
      favor of its repeal for the reasons I have given. I am in favor of its repeal because it
      points out and stigmatizes laborers as a set of law-breakers, as a set of scoundrels, and a
      set of people upon whom has been placed a mark of suspicion. I am in favor of the repeal of
      these laws because they are unjust, iniquitous and cruel.
     Mr. JOHNSON: I rise to a question of privilege. It has been decided by a majority upon this
      floor that they do not desire to hear my speech in reply to the harangue of the presiding
      officer. There is, therefore, no danger of my attempting to excoriate--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: To reply to a harangue, you say?
     Mr. JOHNSON: I so characterized it.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Wait a moment. If you choose to designate the speech of the chair
      as a harangue, sir, the responsibility rests with you, sir. Wait a moment.--Whenever you
      desire to speak in order here, sir, you can do so; but whenever you treat the chair with
      disrespect and use language you have used, the chair will put you in your seat.
     Mr. JOHNSON: That is about the strength of the Chair on this floor. I desire to say it is
      not consistent with the dignity of any Senator to be watched by a Doorkeeper; the brute force
      of the Chair--
     Mr. MCDONALD [interposing]:--This is out of order. I hope it will be
      stopped.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Both Senators take their seats. The chair desires to say by way
      of personal explanation that for the Senator from Wayne (Mr. Johnson) the chair entertains the
      kindliest feelings. He has partaken of his friendship and has returned it, and has at all
      times desired to recognize him when he is on the floor. The chair entertains no unfriendly
      feeling and does not desire to do so. While the Senator may not intend it to be offensive or
      insulting, his conduct on one or more occasions has not only been offensive and in-  sulting but indecent. The chair has not had his language
      taken down because of his kind feeling for the Senator from Wayne. If he desires to make a
      speech the chair will take pleasure in recognizing him, but if the Senator attempts to make
      another assault on the chair he will not only put him in his seat but if necessary to maintain
      the dignity of the Senate he will put him off the floor of the Senate.
     Mr. WINTER: I would ask whether it is within the province of a chairman to expel a
      member?
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: You can put your own construction upon it.
     Mr. WINTER: I protest against any such language, whether from a President of Senator.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair cares nothing for your protest.
     Mr. JOHNSON: The Chair is--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Wait a moment. The Senator from Wayne claims that he rises to a
      question of personal privilege. The chair has been upon the most intimate and friendly
      relations with him.
     Mr. JOHNSON: The Doorkeeper is a pleasant gentleman and I do not care for a trial of
      physical strength with him. I never traveled on my muscle. I never claimed to be a fit
      exponent of the prize ring. But I suggest the propriety of an order that the Doorkeeper retire
      from my place.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair was not noticing the Doorkeeper there. The Doorkeeper
      need not remain there to control the Senator; but the chair will not endure any more
      insults.
     Mr. MULLINIX: I object to this way of transacting business. We are not here to fight
      political fights--
     Mr. WINTER [interrupting]: I ask if the point of order cannot be maintained on the other
      side of the house?
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Wait a moment. Better order will be maintained.
     Mr. WINTER: The Chair is not--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: When you say that, you are out of order, sir, you will say it in
      the proper way. The Senator from Greene (Mr. Mullinix) will be kind enough to wait.
     Mr. MULLINIX: No sir, I will not yield anything to any man. I want to talk about repealing
      these two sections, and, sir, I demand the right of a representative in this body but the
      gentleman from Marion (Mr. Winter) calls me to order.
     Mr. WINTER: I did not understand you were going to speak to the bill under
      consideration.
     Mr. MULLINIX: No sir, you don't understand anything but what is in the interest of the
      Republican party.
     Mr. WINTER: There is one thing I don't understand and that is blackguarding on the
      floor of the Senate.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: I want it understood all such talk has come from your side of the
      chamber.
     Mr. MULLINIX: I am opposed to repealing this section, upon principle. I am here in the
      interest of the people of Indiana. I believe the seCtions ought to be kept on the statute
      books. When you repeal these sections you invite crime in the State of Indiana, and I never
      will give my vote for that.
     Mr. KENNEDY: There are hundreds and thousands of men who are satisfied and contented with
      their homes and their labor, and with their wages, but you repeal this law and you open the
      door and say that they may gather in gangs and go and stop laboring men from laboring to
      support their families. I speak in the interest of laboring men. When men come up here and ask
      to repeal a law which restricts such gatherings it indicates that they want to do something of
      that kind. This law has been enforced for six years and what harm has it done to any man or
      set of men? None at all; and now to come up here and ask to repeal these laws, not speaking
      disrespectful of a man's motives, it looks to mre the most unreasonable thing I have seen
      since I have been in this Senate. I am heartily opposed to it on the ground that it is an
      injustice to the laboring men.
     
     Mr. BAILEY: These two sections are special legislation, and ought to be declared
      unconstitutional. There is no reason why railroads should ask for special legislation to
      protect them against any particular class of people. Section 2127 is unconstitutional because
      of its extreme severity. It is undue and improper punishment for a mere threat or
      contemplation of the offence described. I believe these laws ought to be stricken from the
      statute books. I hope no member of the Senate will vote for the indefinite postponement of
      this bill.
     Mr. HOWARD, of St. Joseph: I am opposed to the motion under discussion, and in favor of the
      repeal of these two sections. These sections have been well named the intimidation laws. These
      laws were passed when the true objects of labor organizations were not as well known as now.
      The people have learned to know in the last few years the true principles of the organizations
      of labor. We should have laws not for a single class but for all classes of people. The
      command should be to all persons to do right and avoid wrong.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: In what respect is it class legislation?
     Mr. HOWARD, of St. Joseph: I understand the wording of the law is general enough, but it is
      not necessary to go to the law books to understand this law is aimed specifically against a
      certain class. If there is anything to be found in these two sections which is not punished by
      other laws I would be glad to have it pointed out. I am opposed to this law remaining in any
      manner upon our statute books. I think it is directed against a special class and all laws
      should be general.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: If there is anything in these acts which prevents a man from
      laboring, I am ready for their repeal; but all they do, and all they have done, is to prevent
      a man from preventing another man's working. Now that is all there is of it. No man
      questions the right of a workman to say "I will work for these wages." Nobody
      questions his right to walk out of the shop and make a demand upon his employer for more
      wages. The law does not infringe upon that one hair's breadth, but it does say, when he
      says "I cannot and will not work for these wages," he shall not say his neighbor
      shall not work; and that is all. It is the intent of this legislation to prevent them from
      interfering with others. I will vote to give no man the right to say another shall not work
      when he wants to. I think, in place of moving to indefinitely postpone it, we had better take
      the ayes and noes upon the main question and be done with it.
     Mr. MCDONALD: I am opposed to the last section (2127) for I think it is
      in direct conflict with Section 16, Chapter V, of the bill of rights.--[Reads.]
     Mr. CAMPBELL: Has not the effect of this section been to suppress riot?
     Mr. MCDONALD: That is not the question. I am in favor of nothing less
      than the greatest good to the greatest number. It is excessive punishment. It is in direct
      conflict with the Constitution, therefore it is a question of law with me; it is a question of
      right with me. It is not a question as to the laboring man or as to corporations, but it is a
      question to me as a citizen: shall I vote to keep on the statute book a law in conflict with
      the Constitution? I am willing to see Section 2121 stand, but the last section I desire to see
      stricken out. I have no right to say to another he shan't work. If I want two dollars and
      my neighbor is willing to work for one dollar and a half, that is his business and not mine. I
      am of the laboring class, and my sympathies are with them.
     Mr. MARSHALL: The Senator says this law ought to be repealed because of its excessive
      penalty. The law says not less than fifty dollars; and I want to appeal to the judgment of the
      Senate whether fifty dollars is too excessive to be inflicted upon a person who will interfere
      or attempt to interfere with railroad men; or if a man undertakes to rob a train or to
      interfere with it in any manner, is fif-  ty dollars an
      excessive fine? I think every sensible man will say it is not. If a man interferes with a
      train loaded with passengers or express matter is the fine excessive?
     Mr. RAHM: I will leave it to every lawyer on this floor if there are not other laws that
      cover everything in these two sections. Turn to Section 1960, read it over carefully, and if
      you can't come to that conclusion by reading it once, read it half a dozen times. I did
      not expect any Senator would be so discourteous as to make a motion to indefinitely postpone
      this bill. Why not let a fair vote be taken?
     Mr. CAMPBELL: A motion to indefinitely postpone any measure is parliameitary. I had no
      intention of being discourteous, but I am opposed to this bill. The first objection made to
      the repeal of these sections is that they are class legislation. That is no more class
      legislation than any other law. They begin with the word "whoever." It applies to
      any person. It is not made for law-abiding, it is made for the lawless. It don't affect
      any' honest man in Indiana. Ought a man to interfere with others in the performance of
      honestlabor in a lawless manner? I say it is neither class legislation, nor is it wrong in
      principle. I am in favor of men who labor with their muscle and brains. It is claimed that the
      punishment is excessive. In one instance the fine may not be less than twenty dollars. Is that
      excessive? As a political measure I would like to see my Democratic friends put themselves on
      record to bring on strikes again in this State. If you repeal these laws you open the door to
      Chicago anarchists to incite riots in this State that they may commit depredations. You open
      the door to every lawless class and say they may come here. I say these laws have brought
      peace and quiet; they have not disturbed any lawful man, and have been a bar to the lawless
      class. This motion is intended to end this question. If a majority is opposed to the repeal of
      these laws we can get rid of it.
     Mr. THARP: I think this motion ought to be defeated. One of these sections ought to be
      repealed and the other ought not.
     The motion to postpone indefinitely was agreed to by yeas 23, nays 20--as follows:

     SOLDIERS' MONUMENT.
     Mr. SEARS: I have asked no favor of the Senate, but I ask that this soldiers' bill be
      taken up now and made a special order for to-morrow. [He referred to Mr. Andrew's bill
       (S. 3) for the erection of a State soldiers' and
      sailors' monument.]
     Mr. THARP: I think the Senate: should go slow in this matter. As we are out of money and
      deeply in debt I dare say, in face of the popular feeling, that the people will not approve of
      going down into the treasury and taking therefrom $200,000 to erect a memorial shaft. We have
      a depleted State treasury and will have to borrow a million dollars, and the great masses of
      the people who pay the taxes and will be taxed to pay the interest on these bonds, are opposed
      to this measure. Whether I will oppose it on its final passage or not, I am opposed to taking
      it up in the place of other measures of more public importance.
     
     Mr. BAILEY: I have been in receipt of a large number of resolutions from Grand Army posts,
      as I suppose other member has, and every one of the resolutions received by me point to the
      erection of a memorial hall instead of a monument. I believe the masses would prefer a
      memorial hall where mementoes of the war could be preserved and the living soldiers might
      assemble, and I think action on this bill ought not to be hasty. I am opposed to taking it up
      uot of its regular order for the reasons I have assigned.
     On motion by Mr. MCDONALD, the order of business was suspended by yeas
      30, nays 18.
     Mr. SELLERS moved to refer the bill to the Military Committee with
      instructions to report a substitute appropriating not exceeding $200,000 for a home for
      Indiana soldiers.
     Mr. BAILEY moved to amend by adding "or a memorial hall in Circle Park."
     Mr. MULLINIX: I object to any such change. The soldiers ask for a monument, and not a hall.
      Nothing short of a monument will satisfy us. We ask it as soldiers and as members of the Grand
      Army of the Republic. We should build a shaft, planted on the firm rock, and towering into
      ether so high that, standing upon its summit, you can see into the golden country beyond. The
      man that turns his back upon the soldiers of this country, will find their backs turned upon
      him, it matters not whether he aspires to a high place or a low place. We fought the battles
      and are entitled to something in this country, and we ask you to build a monument to Indiana
      soldiers and pay that respect to those who sleep the sleep of death.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: If there is any one thing well settled in the minds of the
      people of this State now, it is that there should be a soldiers monument erected. Our desks
      are filled with petitions in favor of the erection of a monument, while I have heard of but
      one for a soldiers' home. The Nation already provided a home for soliers. The citizens of
      the counties I have the honor to represent almost unanimously unite in petitions to the
      Legislature for the erection of a soldiers monument. I am at a loss to know what the object of
      a reference of this bill can be unless it is to kill the project of erecting a monumtent to
      the soldiers. If such a thing had been demanded by any considerable number, I think I could
      say the would be something less in it.
     Pending this discussion--
    
    
     BENEVOLENT INSTITUTIONS INVESTIGATION.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore announced the appointment of Mr. French as chairman of the special
      commnittee to investigate the management of the State Benevolent Institutions authorized by
      the resolution printed on page 381 of this book, in place of Mr. Shively, resigned; also Mr.
      Winter in place of Mr. Huston, resigned.
     Mr. WINTER: I respectfully decline to serve on that committee. If I believed the committee
      would make an honest and fair examination I would consent to serve on it.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempoere: The Senator has no right to impugn the motives of the committee.
      As far as the chair has any power the chair intends to see this examination go on.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: The President appointed this committee, and the chairman declines; I contend
      that unless the Senate accepts the resignation he should serve.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: I think the Senator is right. The chair will put the question to
      the Senate. First: will the Senate accept the resignation of the Senator from Grant (Mr.
      Shively) for the reason he has given? [After a vote.] The Senator is excused. The question is:
      will the Senate excuse the Senator from Fayette? (Mr. Huston.) [After a vote.] The Senator is
      not excused. He will serve on the committee.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I ask to be excused from service on the commitee to which
      was referred the memorial of Wm. B. Howard.
     
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: [After a vote.] The noes seem to have it.
     Mr. HUSTON: I desire to be excused from serving on the same committee.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: [After a vote.] The noes have it.
    
    
     BILLS FOR ACTS WERE INTRODUCED BY

    The House met at 2 o'clock, p. m. The session was opened with prayer by J. M. Canfield,
     of the Sixth Christian Church.
    Mr. STUBBLEFIELD offered a resolution urging the Indiana Congressmen to aid in the passage of
     the dependent parents' pension bill over the President's veto.
    It was adopted by yeas 70, nays 10.
    
     FARM INSURANCE COMPANIES.
     Mr. Niblack's bill [H. R. 30] amending Section 3774 of the Revised Statutes of 1881,
      relating to the organization of farmers' insurance companies, by striking out the clause
      "such property being upon farms as farm property," was reported back with an
      amendment limiting its operation to six counties.
     Mr. ROBINSON: Four years ago the farmers, in their Grange organization, petitioned the
      Legislature to remove that restrictive limit, and it is now the desire of the farmers that the
      limit part of that act be removed from the law. The report of the committee is to limit them
      to six counties, therefore I am opposed to the amendment as suggested by the committee.
     Mr. NIBLACK: This bill makes only two changes in the law as it now is. The first change is,
      allowing insurance companies that are organized, in different parts of the State to insure
      city property as well as farm property. The law as it now is confines companies to farm
      property.--The other change is this: the law as it now is limits them to three counties, my
      change limits them to no counties. I cannot say that I am favor of the amendment by the
      committee. I believe that the bill ought to pass. It cannot do any harm and will be a great
      benefit.
     Mr. PATTON: The farmers' insurance companies are limited to farm property and make a
      cheap rate.--There is no great risk in insuring farm property, but if we adopt this amendment
      it will increase the risk. It simply puts them on the same footing with all other companies. I
      do not believe it would be proper and right to do that. If we are going to giver .the farmer
      any insurance, let it be on his property and that alone.
     Mr. REYNOLDS moved that the bill be ordered engrossed.
     On motion by Mr. PATTON, this motion was laid on the table.
     Mr. GARDINER moved to reconsider the last vote.
     On motion by Mr. PATTON, the motion to reconsider was laid on the table by yeas 51, nays

     SOLDIERS' MONUMENT.
     The Senate resumed the consideration of the soldiers' monument bill [S. 3] pending at the adjourment.
     Mr. SEARS: The remarks I shall make this morning will be simply dircted to the part the
      soldiers from this commonwealth took in the crushing of the mightiest rebellion known in
      modern times. The men whose I memories we propose to perpetuate by the passage of this bill
      composed a part of the great army that went forth from our own beloved State.--From the first
      campaign in Western Virginia to the campaign which resulted so gloriously in the surrender of
      the armies of Lee and Johnson the flag of Indiana was borne with gallant hearts and stout arms
      to triumph and to victory. No important achievement was made by our armies during the whole
      war in which the State did not bear a noble and conspicuous part. Wherever, in fact, history
      has been written in blood, there could be found the bleeding forms of Indianians. Although the
      population of Indiana thirty years ago was a little over 400,000, it furnished 208,367 troops
      to aid in suppressing the rebellion, composed of 176,775 infantry, 21,605 cavalry and 10,986
      artillery, an army larger than the duke of Wellington commanded in the Peninsular war. These
      troops participated in more than three hundred engagements, battles and skirmishes during the
      war, of which ninety were fought in Virginia, fifty-one in Tennessee, forty-one in Georgia,
      twenty-four in Mississippi, nineteen in Arkansas, eighteen in Alabama, sixteen in Kentucky,
      fifteen in Louisiana, nine in Missouri, eight in North Carolina, seven in Maryland, three in
      Texas, two in South Carolina and one in Pennsylvania. Three of our regiments took part in the
      first battle of the war, while another in view of the Rio Grande fought its very last battle.
      The first regiment, under Butler, to land at the wharf in New Orleans was the 21st Indiana.
      The first flag over the bloody parapet of Fort Wagoner in front of Charleston was that of the
      13th Indiana; and the first to show their stars from the embattled crest of Mission Ridge were
      those of the 79th and 86th Indiana. Two of our regiments helped storm Fort McAllister away
      down by Savannah; another was among the first in the 
      assaulting line at Fort Fisher. Another, converted into engineers, built all of Sherman's
      bridges from Chatanooga to Atlanta, and from Atlanta to the sea, and from the sea northward.
      Another in line of battle on the beach at Hampton Roads saw the frigate Cumberland sink to the
      harbor's bed rather than strike their flag; and, looking from the same place the next
      day, cheered as never men cheered at the sight of the same Merrimac beaten by a single gun in
      the turret of Worden's Little Monitor. Others aided in the overthrow of the savage red
      cross rebels at Pea Ridge, Missouri. Three from Washington, across the peninsular within sight
      of Richmond, evacuated to Harrison's Landing, followed McClellan to his fathomless fall.
      Five were engaged in the salvation of Washington at Antietam. Four were with Burnside at
      Fredericksburg, where some of the old 14th Indiana, known all over the Army of the Potomac as
      Kimball's Hoosiers, were picked up, lying nearer than all others to the lines of the
      enemy. Five were at Chancellorsville, where Stone-Wall Jackson took victory out of
      Hooker's hands and carried it with him to his grave. Six were almost annihilated at
      Gettysburg; one, an infantry regiment, marched nearly ten thousand miles, literally twice
      around the rebellion, fighting as it went. Four were part of the beasom with which Sheridan
      swept the Shenandoah Valley. Finally, when Grant superceded Halleck, transferred his
      headquarters to the East and began his last grand march against Richmond, four of our
      regiments, joined soon after by another, followed him faithfully, leaving their dead all along
      the way in the Wilderness, at Laurel Hill, at Spottsylvania, at Po River, at North Anna River,
      at Bethsadie Church, at Cold Habor, in front of Petersburg, down to Clover Hill, and down to
      the final halt in which Lee yielded up the sword of the rebellion. Mr. President, I will not
      say that Indiana's contribution to the cause was indispensable to its final
      success,--that would be unjust to States more populus and wealthy and equally devoted,--but I
      will say that Indiana's quot precipitated the result. How stands the record? At Shiloh
      Indiana had thirteen regiments, at Vicksburg she had twenty-four, at Stone River twenty-five,
      at Chickamauga twenty-seven, at Mission Ridge twenty, in the advance from Chattanooga to
      Atlanta fifty. At Atlanta Sherman divided them so that twenty-five went with him down to the
      sea, while twenty-five marched back with grand, glorious old Pap Thomas, and were at the
      annihilation of Hood at Nashville.
     What a glorious record is here presented! Who amongst us to-day does not take pride in such
      a record? It is a glorious record, and when in after times it shall come to be read by our
      posterity they can exult with pride at the loyalty of their fathers. And when we add to this
      the other interesting fact that during the war the people of Indiana contributed $15,462,876
      to the payment of bounties to soldiers, $456,000 for the relief of families of soldiers, and
      nearly $200,000 to miscellaneous military purposes, making a grand total of over $20,000,000,
      the glory of our grand old commonwealth is complete.
     Now, Mr. President, in view of these facts, in view of the history our commonwealth has made
      in this war, I ask on behalf of the soldiers of Indiana that the rules be suspended in order
      that this bill may be read a second time by title, a third time by sections, and placed on its
      passage now. Pass this bill, appropriate the money to erect this monument, plant its base
      broad and deep, let it tower toward heaven, and on its summit plant the old flag these men
      loved so well in their life-time, and inscribe upon it in letters of living light:--"This
      is done by the grateful people of the grand old Commonwealth of Indiana, to commemorate the
      sacrifices and death of her sons that the Nation might live."
     Mr. BARRETT moved to postpone further consideration of this bill till Friday at ten
      o'clock.


     
     Mr. SELLERS: I cannot vote aginst this bill, but desire an amendment.
     Mr. MCDONALD: This bill has been drafted after the plan of the
      State-house bill. It is just as well guarded as that bill was. The bill is of that character
      that the Board of Commissioners are to be two Republicans and two Democrats--they to build
      either a monument or a memorial hall, or combine the two. This bill has been on our tables for
      fifteen days, and I am opposed to postponing it. Let us do what we are going to do.
     Mr. MARSHALL: It seems to me this bill has been drawn very carefully, and if there should be
      discovered anything essentially wrong it can be unanimously amended after it is engrossed. I
      think we might as well dote now on the engrossment of the bill as at any other time.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair would say to the Senator from Fountain (Mr. Marshall)
      he ought to have made his objections to this motion before the Senator from Allen (Mr.
      Barrett) left. The chair is friendly to the bill, too.
     Mr. WEIR: I also favor the bill but it is due Senators that this request be granted. I hope
      the motion to postpone will prevail.
     Mr. FRENCH: I am not unfriendly to the bill. There are members desiring to address the
      Senate on this subject who are away in the discharge of official duties and have asked that
      the bill be postponed, and I think it proper and right. I shall vote to postpone the bill till
      they return.
     The motion was agreed to by yeas 26, nays 16.
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. DRESSER, when his name was called, said: I would like to see this bill taken up and
      passed this morning, but as Senators are called away on public business I am in favor of the
      postponement until their return, hoping the bill will be surely taken up and passed at that
      time without further delay. I vote "aye."
     Mr. JOHNSON [in explanation]: There is no desire on my part to prevent any member being
      present and presenting any amendment he may see fit, but this bill is an important one, and
      there are lots of other important bills before the Senate. I think this bill ought to pass,
      and for that reason I vote "no."
     Mr. MACY, explaining his vote, said: Believing as I do that the postponing of this bill but
      a short time will result in its defeat, I vote "no."
     Mr. MCDONALD, when his name was called, said: I am satisfied our friends
      are not going to defeat this bill. I am anxious it should pass, but I am inclined to be
      courteous to them and therefore vote "aye."
     Mr. MULLINIX, in explanation of his vote, said: This is one of the first bills introduced in
      the Senate. I am opposed to this way of monkeying with this bill. If these Senators are
      opposed to it, as I believed they are, they ought to have stayed here this morning. I am
      opposed to postponement. I vote "no."
     Mr. RAHM, when his name was called, said: For the reason that I am in favor of the bill if
      properly amended, I shall vote for its postponement. I think the bill is a good bill and ought
      to pass, but the amount, in my opinion, is a little too high. We haven't got $200,000 to
      spare. I believe I would favor a memorial hall, and by postponing it till next Friday we can
      hear from Grand Army posts on that question. There has not been a single Grand Army man spoken
      to me about this bill, not a single one, asking that we should spend $200,000, and I would
      like to know whether they prefer a grand monument or a memorial hall, therefore I vote
      "aye.'
     Mr. SELLERS: We have barely a Democratic majority in this General Assembly, and we are
      exceedingly anxious to retain it, but I am satisfied if this bill is hurried through the
      Senator from Greene (Mr. Mullinix) will attempt to jump from the cap stone over in the New
      Jerusalem, and we shall lose our Democratic majority. [Laughter--see Mr. Mullinix's
      remarks on page 425]. I vote "aye."
     Mr. SMITH, of Wells, in explanation of his vote, said: I do not be-  lieve those Senators in favor of postponement are against the bill.
      I believe it will pass the Senate and House without any doubt whatever; but because it is fair
      and right to let those called away on an investigation make speeches on the bill--in order to
      give them that right, I shall vote "aye."
     Mr. URMSTON, when his name was called, said: I am informed that the old soldiers will meet
      perhaps to-morrow. This is a matter that greatly interests them, and if we have a postponement
      till Friday we may have an expression from them, either that they want a memorial hall or a
      monument. Therefore, I vote "aye."
     Mr. DRESSER [when the roll-call was completed]: Since I voted I have been informed that this
      question was discussed at a time when I was absent and it was made a special order for this
      time, and that some of the Senatars who are absent made their speech, and as they have had
      their opportunity and day upon this floor I desire to change my vote to "no."
     The result was announced as above.
     So the motion to postpone was agreed to.
    
    
     SOUTHERN PRISON INVESTIGATION.
     Mr. BARRETT, from the Committee on State Prisons, submitted a long report
      as to the condition of the Southern Penitentiary, setting forth many instances of
      maladministration and recommending suggestions where improvement can be made. In conclusion,
      the report says: "The filthy condition of the prison, the method of management, and the
      inexcusably negligent manner of keeping the accounts merit the discontinuance in office of
      persons who are responsible therefor."
     Mr. HUSTON: There is a statement made by a convict which is part of the report. I would like
      to have it read.
     Mr. BARRETT: The testimony was taken by a stenographer and will be given to the Senate as
      soon as transcribed.
     Mr. HUSTON: As a member of the minority of this Senate it is exceedingly gratifying to me
      that a committee of this Senate should have visited the Southern Prison and so far forgotten
      party feeling as to make report they have. It is certainly commendable. It is personally
      gratifying to me to feel that there are men who will make an investigation and will go against
      their own party to make a truthful report.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: I suppose that covers a multitude of: sins of the Senate.
     Mr. BARRETT: I don't think the committee deserve any special commendation. I think I
      can speak for our members when I say there was no party feeling or spirit in the
      investigation. We felt bound to perform our duty in the investigation without regard to party.
      It was not a question of party, but of individual responsibility. And I will say on behalf of
      the minority of the committee that in their investigation there was no attempt on their part
      to make it a party question, or to hold a party responsible, for if there were a party
      responsibility it would attach to both.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: I move that one thousand copies be printed.
     Mr. BARRETT: The Northern Prison is to be visited and I suggest both reports be printed
      together.--The committee think it proper to give the absent Southern Prison directors an
      opportunity to appear before the committee and make such statements as they choose for their
      justification and the committee desire to make a further report after hearing such statement.
      I move the report be laid on the table till Friday.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair hears no objection.
    
    
     BENEVOLENT INSTITUTIONS INVESTIGATION.
     Mr. HUSTON: I move to take up the motion to reconsider the vote adopting the resolution to
      investigate the management of the benevolent institutions of the State.
     Mr. FRENCH: After further consideration of the matter I have concluded to withdraw that
      motion.
     Mr. WEIR: Can that be done without consent of the Senate?
     
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: It can't be done unless the Senate consents.
     Mr. WEIR: I object.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Then the motion will lie over. The Senator from Fayette is
      entitled to the floor on a question of personal privilege. Is not that the understanding?
     Mr. HUSTON: In what I say in reply to the speech of the Senator from Jackson and Jennings
      (the President pro tempore) made yesterday, I do not wish to indulge in any personalities or
      to wound the feelings of any one, but simply to defend myself against the charges which are
      wholly without foundation, that he saw fit to make against one. We had a spectacle yesterday
      on this floor such as no man will deny was entirely new and novel in the history of a great
      State. We had on last Friday a like demonstration. My experience in legislative bodies extends
      from 1881, but I confess frankly that no presiding officer within my knowledge has ever so far
      forgotten the propriety attached to his office as to leave his exalted seat and come upon the
      floor of the Senate and make a personal attack upon a member of the Senate, and a bitter
      partisan speech, and that, too, then we had under consideration a question freighted with such
      importance as matter pertaining to our Benevolent Institutions. Yesterday morning I introduced
      a resolution to amend the resolution passed by the Senate last Friday, so as to require the
      committee to inquire into the moral character, business capacity end special qualifications of
      the men, mho are in charge of the Benevolent Institutions of the State; but it was voted
      down.
     Mr. FRENCH [Chairman of the Committee]: I say to you, you shall have full scope in that
      direction.
     Mr. HUSTON: That was said upon the floor of the Senate yesterday, but if it was intended
      that the moral character of the man who I claim is a leper upon the body politic, should be
      examined into, why refuse to pass the resolution instructing the committee to do that very
      thing?
     Mr. FRENCH: Because you came in with a little buncomb resolution while the resolution of the
      Senator from Grant [see page 381) covers the whole ground.
     Mr. HUSTON: I have made statements on this floor, and I have said I am individually
      responsible for them. They are statements I believe to be true. Another thing: the statement
      has been made, upon this floor that an investigating committee has been appointed in the other
      end of this capitol that was partisan, and was purely for partisan purposes. It has been
      stated that that committee would bring in a partisan and an untrue report. It has been stated
      that it was necessary to vindicate the great Democratic party that an investigation should be
      had also in this end of the capitol. Now I want to say in answer: that when the charge is made
      that a partisan committee was appointed in the House for that purpose, the statement is
      untrue. The committee having in charge the investigation of the Insane Asylum is the regular
      committee appointed at the beginning of the session upon Scientific and Benevolent
      Institutions. It has also been said that that committee was organized of the weak element upon
      the Democratic side. I want also to deny that charge. Upon the Democratic side of that
      commmittee is Mr. Gordon, Mr. Pierce, Judge Roberts, and another whose name I cannot mention
      now--four as able, as fair and as true men as the Democratic minority in the House can
      present. So that charge, made in the manner it was, stands disproved and it cannot be
      sustained. It has also been said that that committee propose in its investigations and is
      endeavoring to find facts to support the labors of what? of the civil service commission. I
      hold in my hand now a copy of that civil service commission investigation, and I want to say
      this: that the Hon. W. D. Foulke, and his associates on that commission, who have been
      villified and abused upon this floor, are the equals  of
      any member of this body. They made that investigation; they made it honest; they done their
      whole duty. And another thing: it has been charged that they were acting in concert with and
      under instructions from the Republican State Central Committee. I want to
      deny that. I want to brand it as another of the malicious lies stated upon this floor against
      me. It is well enough to charge me with this, and charge them with that, but it is a different
      thing to prove it. It was stated on the floor of the Senate that I was chairman of the
       Republican State Central Committee. I guess that fact is pretty well known
      to the Senate now, because the presiding officer has endeavored to drill it into you on every
      opportunity. It is unbecoming in the Senator from Jackson and Jennings, (the President pro
      tempore) to come upon this floor and charge me, as chairman of the committee, saying, however,
      that personally I was honest and all right, but politically I was wrong; but he made the
      charge that two dollar bills had been used to buy Democratic voters. Great God, what an
      acknowledgment for a man to make. Would I stand here on the floor of the Indiana Senate and
      admit that my Republican colleagues could be induced to vote against their principles for a
      two dollar bill? Those counties can be bought cheap if that is all they cost in Jackson and
      Jennings.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: Allow me to suggest that the Democrats in Jackson and
      Jennings are not of the character of Democrats of Porter and Lake.
     Mr. HUSTON: It costs more to get them in Eastern Indiana--in the old Burnt District--than
      the gentleman practically admitted they cost in Jackson and Jennings. Who precipitated this
      political discussion? Who is responsible for it? Is it the Republican minority? Not by any
      means. The majority, through their presiding officer, is chargeable with this waste of time
      and the bad blood that has been engendered. [He referred to the last State election; why an
      investigation was demanded by the people; to the recent ballots for United States Senator; to
      the unseating of Mr. McDonald; to the disappearance of Eliza Dallas from the Insane Hospital,
      and who has not been found up to this day; and to the treatment of Lieut. Governor-elect
      Robertson].
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     The bill [S. 18] to pay Baker, Smith & Co.'s claim of $5,256, including interest at
      six per cent., for a steam-heating apparatuts for the female department of the Insane Asylum
      was taken up on a favorable committee report. The report was concurred in, the rules suspended
      and the bill finally passed the Senate.
    
    
     BEAVER LAKE LANDS.
     The bill [S. 77] for the sale of Beaver Lake lands was called up as the special order for
      the hour. The bill was read the second time and a favorable committee report was discussed
      during the remainder of the afternoon.
    
   
   
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
    
     TUESDAY, February 15, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Hon. Wiley F. Ackman, a Representative from the county
     of Hancock.
    
     THE TELEPHONE LAW.
     On motion by Mr. CONGER, to bill [H. R. 162] to repeal the telephone law was read the third
      time.
     Mr. COX, of Miami: I am opposed to the passage of this bill. I doubt not that many members
      of this House have been receiving letters from people who have telephones in use. They come
      only from theose using transmitters, and they are influenced by the telephone company. If this
      law is all bad it ought to be all repealed, but if it is only partly bad it ought to be
      amended and not repealed. I believe that fifteen cents is enough for sending a message, and I
      believe that portion of the law ought not to be repealed. Now, what evidence have we that the
      law as it stands to-day is oppressive or unjust? I have talked with agents of the telephone
      company; they came to the hotel and wanted to present a
      statement to show why the law is unjust to the corporation. I said that I was ready to listen.
      They said: we are losing money and we must lose money until this law is repealed. I said: this
      is a general statement, that anyone can make, what I want is the figures and upon that I can
      determine. How many transmitters have you in use to-day? Seven hundred. Two years ago?
      Seventeen hundred. I asked, why is it? He said, because our service is so bad that people
      won't use them. Why is this service bad? They have gone to work to run down their
      business so that they can come before this Legislature to have us repeal this law.
     Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Owen: I am on the committee which investigated this bill, and made, I
      believe, a unanimous report in favor of the repeal of it. I desire to say in reply to the
      gentleman from Miami (Mr. Cox) we gathered our information not from corporations but from the
      people of the State of Indiana who use the instruments. When this law was passed in 1885, it
      was thought to be for the best. For the last two years it has been a hardship to the people
      who use telephones. I think, in the interest of the people of State of Indiana, the law should
      be repealed, and I hope the report of the committee will be sustained.
     Mr. GARDINER: It was said by the gentleman from Miami (Mr. Cox) that the people of this
      State have been induced to sign petitions to the members of the Legislature for the repeal of
      this law. I have in my desk quite an extensive petition asking me to vote for the repeal of
      this law. These petitions do not ask for any amendment at all, but they demand its absolute
      repeal. They are the cream of the business men where I have the honor to reside, and they know
      what they want. They ask me to vote in this direction, and I will certainly obey them. I
      believe, as far as the principle is concerned or established, that the Legislature has the
      right to control and regulate the affairs of corporations,--it has been crystalized by a
      Supreme Court decision. I understand that this law was enacted with a view to reach the Bell
      Telephone Company, and if it had that effect I should not have anything to say on this
      occasion, but instead of reaching thte parties it intended to reach it is placing burdens on
      the people who use telephones. It has been said by the gentleman (Mr. Cox) that the agents of
      this company have been there in the House to induce members to vote for this law. I have never
      seen one of them here. I do not know that there is an agent of the Bell Telephone Company in
      the city, or that there ever has been one here. I believe that the repeal of this law is
      demanded by the people of INdiana, and therefore I shall unhesitatingly vote for the repeal of
      the law.
     Mr. FOSTER: I believe the people who are trying to repeal this law are in good faith;
      nevertheless, I believe it is not necessary in order to conserve the interests of the people
      of Indiana to repeal It. But it is true, as has been said by the gentleman from Miami (Mr.
      Cox) that those who are interested in this corporation have worked this business up. Ever
      since this law has been upon the statute books this telehone company has done everything in
      its power to break down the service of the telephone. I will tell you one reason why the
      telephone service has run down. It is because the novelty has worn off. Almost all the better
      lawyers and physicians and business men in our town, when these telephones first came there,
      said they must have a box in their offices.--Now, after so many years, and after the price has
      been put down from four dollars to three dollars, they don't have it. It is because the
      novelty has worn off and they don't want it. It is so in the city of Indianapolis and
      Evansville. It is no great detriment if they should take their telephones out. But the Bell
      Telephone Company will never let them go out while it is filching fourteen dollars a year from
      the gentlemen who use its instruments.
     
     Mr. REYNOLDS: Having introduced this bill, I want to say it has been insinuated by gentlemen
      that the officers of this corporation have brought about the introduction of this bill through
      sinister motives. I want to say that, so far as I am concerned, I introduced this bill at the
      request of almost every telephone operator in my county. I have in my desk here a letter from
      nearly every individual that employs a telephone in my county and some from other counties
      asking the repeal of this law. If any agent of the Bell Telephone Company or any other, has
      been soliciting the passage of this bill I do not know it. I have no personal interest in this
      bill and did not come here with any intention of introducing it. I want to say this: as the
      gentleman from Daviess (Mr. Gardiner) well said, it is an easy matter to hurl opposition again
      corporations. They talk about the Bell Telephone being a monopoly and being expensive. It is
      not half as expensive as the Telegraph Company. A man pays forty-eight dollars a year and he
      can talk just as much as he pleases. If he puts a telegraph instrument in his house he must
      hire a skilled mechanic to operate it. I can go to the telephone box at any time and for
      twenty-five cents I can talk for five minutes. I cannot see why gentlemen will come in, and
      with hands up, cry out against the iniquity of the Bell Telephone Company and have nothing to
      say against the monopoly of the telegraph in this country.
     Mr. STUBBLEFIELD: Knowing as I do the hardship which this law works to the people, and that
      it has almost entirely destroyed the telephone interest in the southern part of Indiana, I
      know that the repeal of this law will be a benefit to the people of that part of the State. I
      don't know why it is that men will oppose the repeal of this law. It is no expense to me
      unless I use the telephone. Now, if I don't want to pay twenty-five cents for the use of
      a telephone it is simply a matter between myself and the company.
     Mr. SCOTT demanded the previous question which was seconded by the House, and under its
      operations the bill passed by yeas 69, nays 29.
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. ACKMAN, in explanation of his vote, said: We have been, in my town, entirely deprived of
      the telephone for more than a year. Before the telephone was taken away we had the privilege
      of sending a message and getting an answer for twenty-five cents. Since the instrument has
      been taken out we have to pay twenty-five cents for the message and if we have an answer we
      have to pay the same for the answer;--making double the expense and no better the service. I
      vote "aye."
     Mr. BEASLEY, when his name was called, said: I had made up my mind to vote for repeal of
      this law, but as I believe gentlemen should be allowed to present their views on this subject,
      I vote 'no."
     Mr. BROWN [in explanation]: Believing as I do that communication by the telephone is the
      best and most convenient and cheapest, and from the fact that nearly all the small towns in my
      county have appealed to me to vote for the repeal of the telephone law, I therefore vote
      "aye."
     Mr. COMMONS, explaining vote, said: Having been a user the telephone and knowing that law
      has almost entirely destroyed the service, I would not properly represent my constituents
      without voting for this bill, and I vote "aye."
     Mr. FOLEY [explaining]: I can vote for the bill but I would like to do it on the condition
      that a law be enacted restraining these people from making an exorbitant charge after the
      repeal of the law. I have been solicited by people who are using telephones to vote for this
      bill; and for this reason I vote "aye."
     Mr. GARRISON, when his name was called, said: Because I have been solicited by my
      constituentse who are using the telephone, and because I am not interested personally in its
      use, therefore I vote "no."
     Mr. GORDON, explaining his vote, said: I do not believe the bad tele-  phone service is owing altogether to the law. I would join in
      amending it to make it just, but I shall be compelled to vote against its repeal, for when it
      is once repealed there would be no such a thing as a law to regulate the telephone passed, and
      the companies will do the very thing they have done in the past. I believe this is at the
      dictation of the telephone companies, and I shall be compelled to vote "no."
     Mr. GREEN, when his name was called, said: I know in the place where I live that the
      telephone company have deliberately put down the service without making a corresponding
      reduction, and I believe if this law is left they will proceed to build up their service, as
      they can well afford to do. I vote "no."
     Mr. HOBSON, in explanation of his vote, said: This is a matter in which I have no personal
      interest but I know the people in my county are in favor of the repeal of this law and see no
      reason why I shold vote against it, therefore I vote "aye."
     Mr. KELLEY, of Boone [explaining]: From the fact that I am ignorant as to the feelings of my
      people about the bill; and from the fact that I understand there is a company already willing
      to take hold of this matter if this company wishes to go out of this State, I vote
      "no."
     Mr. KELLISON [in explanation]: Because I believe if the State of Indiana at this time bows
      down to the dictation of the Bell Telephone Company and takes this law from the statute book,
      it will be absolutely humiliating to the people of this State; because I believe the best men
      in the State are not demanding its repeal; because I believe the telephone companies can do a
      prosperous business, and I am not in favor of legislating so companies can make large
      dividends on watered stock; because I believe the stock of this company has been watered six,
      eight or ten times; and because I believe they can make twenty-five or thirty per cent. on
      their stock under the present law, I therefore vote "no."
     Mr. MCALLUM, when his name was called, said: Believing that the interest
      of the people would be advanced by the repeal of the law I vote "aye."
     Mr. MACKEY, when called upon to vote, said: I asked my constituents in Evansville how they
      wished me to vote on telephone law, and I have received a letter in which they have instructed
      me in a mass meeting of the laboring men to vote against the repeal of the telephone law,
      therefore I vote "no."
     Mr. MAJOR, in explanation of vote, said: Believing the first duty of the Representative is
      to represent the will of his people, and knowing that the larger portion of my constituents
      who use the telephone are restricted in its use, and they have asked me to vote for the repeal
      of this law, I shall be constrained to vote accordingly; therefore, I vote
      "aye."
     Mr. MOCK, when called upon to vote, said: As a member of the Committee on Rights
       and Privileges of the last General Assembly, from representations made to me, I was
      induced to believe the bill for the present act was for the best, and signed the report
      recommending its passage on the floor of the House I was induced to vote for that law. I have
      investigated the subject since, and I believe the people whs the telephone demand its repeal,
      therefore I vote "aye."
     Mr. OSBORN [in explanation]:--The gentleman from Putnam (Mr. Gordon) explained my vote; but
      I will say, because my people are in favor of fighting it out on this line if it takes all
      summer, I vote "no."
     Mr. PARKER, in explanation of his vote, said: I believe that the granting of an unlimited
      franchise is a dangerous thing, I therefore vote "no."
     Mr. PLEASANTS, when his name was called, said: I voted for the enactment of this law two
      years ago because I believed it was right. I believe all this is the result of a conspiracy on
      the part of the telephone company, and my interviews with the  members of the telephone company strengthens this belief. I vote
      "no."
     Mr. ROBERTS [explaining] said: I have never given the subject that consideration which it
      merits, but believing it is the duty of every Representatve to voice the sentiments of the
      people; as the business men and business interests of my county, without a single exception,
      have instructed me and earnestly requested that I should vote for the repeal of this law, I
      vote "aye."
     Mr. ROBINSON, when called upon to vote, said: For the reason that I believe the trouble of
      the present time is not the result of the law but the fault of the companies, and for the
      purpose of getting this law repealed and preventing the enactment of similar law in other
      States, I therefore vote "no."
     Mr. WEYAND, explaining his vote, said: My county has not a telephone in it. Being in doubt
      in regard to the effect of the repeal of the law, I will vote "no."
     Mr. WHITE [explaining]: I do not believe the Telephone Company has ever in good faith
      attempted to obey this law. I believe if this law should be repealed we would find that it was
      a bad precedent to set. For these reasons I vote "no."
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the bill passed the House.
    
    
     HIGH LICENSE--LOCAL OPTION.
     The bill [H. R. 20] to regulate the sale of intoxicating liquors, was read the third
      time.
     Mr. FLEECE: I wish to call attention to two or three of the leading features of the bill.
      First, local option: the people in my county, or any township that desires, can vote upon this
      question as to whether or not liquor shall be sold. This is in harmony with, and will commend
      itself to every man who is in favor of, a republican form of government. This government is
      built upon the principle that the majority shall rule, and when the majority say by their
      votes and by their acts that they want a certain principle incorporated in our law that
      principle should be incorporated. If the people desire a reform upon this question they have
      the undoubted right to make that reform. And we believe that, by the application of that
      principle, the numnber of saloons in the State and the amount of intoxicating liquors sold and
      drank will be greatly lessened. We believe there are a great many counties, in the State where
      whiskey is sold, where, if the people had a chance to vote, they would say they did not want
      it sold. I think the sale of intoxicating liquors is a crime, is a great evil, and the
      greatest evil that we have to contend with in this age. I cannot see wherein the use of
      intoxicating liquor is of benefit to anyone.
     The high license feature of the bill aids in raising of the revenue. (I don't take much
      stock in that.) A man will not apply for license in any small town. Why? Simply because he
      could not afford to pay five hundred dollars, and this would curtail to a great extent the
      amount of whiskey sold. We want the people, the mass of the people, the ladies and all, to
      take an interest in this mnatter when there is no political question pending so we can get the
      true sentiments of the people.
     Mr. HARRELL: We have had a law--a Democratic measure, the license system--on the statute
      books for many years. I believe it to be the true doctrine of every free government that you
      have no right to pass a law legislating in such a manner as to say what I shall eat or wear or
      drink. All these subjects ought to be left open to the judgment of every man. In the last
      campaign it was doubted by both parties whether the plank in the Republican platform meant
      local option, high license or prohibition. I shall not enter into a political discussion of
      this question at this time, but simply confine myself to the merits of the bill before the
      House. In the first place, as I understand the provisions of this bill, Section 2 is an
      attempt to make it a local option bill. That is, that no man shall hate a right to sell
      whiskey in a township where he lives unless the voice of the people of that township says that
      it shall be sold. If you will notice this bill reads not
      as the old license law, it is not that it hall be sold in a less quantity than a quart at a
      time, but it includes all classes of sellers where liquor is sold for a beverage. That is: if
      a brewery or a still-house is located in Marion county, that still-house, or wholesale liquor
      house, or beer house, cannot sell any of these intoxicants for a beverage without a permit.
      This is a strike at wholesale liquor dealers, brewers and distillers. That would be, it seems
      to me, a very great wrong to the people of the State of Indiana. You all know by the
      statistics of the State of Indiana that there are millions of dollars invested in that
      interest. In the brewing interest I believe nearly two millions of dollars. Now take this bill
      as it stands, and if it should become a law, it is a direct attack upon and strikes at these
      various interests. Suppose in the county of Dearborn, where I understand there are a great
      many distilleries, the people should say intoxicating liquors shall not be sold; it would
      compel these institutions to close up the doors of their establishments. They could not sell
      unless they sold for medical, or other purposes except a beverage. They could not sell for the
      purpose of having it drank as a beverage. Then again we find that the second section of the
      law is entirely different from the old law. It provides that after the election has been held,
      any person may take out a permit from the board of county commissioners. There is no provision
      in the law that a remonstrance may be filed, therefore all that you have to do is to go before
      the commissioners and possibly bring in one witness. You take the city of Indialliapolis; a
      man here can afford to pay a license of five hundred dollars, while you go out to the little
      towns and no man can afford to pay five hundred dollars, hence it does not operate equally and
      justly and fairly upon all the citizens of the State. This is, in one sense, class
      legislation. The rich man can afford to pay five hundred dollars, or if a man has a saloon on
      the corner of Illinois and Washington streets he can afford to pay five hundred dollars, while
      a man a long way out could not afford to pay it. If the object is to drive out of the State of
      Indiana the sale of intoxicating liquors, it would be more proper to introduce a bill for
      prohibition and nothing else. If this bill should become a law I think it would be manifestly
      unjust and unequal and would work a hardship, and I believe that the law as it now stands,
      and, as Democrats have said in their platforms, a license law, is the best system.
     Mr. BEASLEY: There are some features of this bill that are a little peculiar, a little bit
      funny and rahter remarkable. First, to have a special election to elect saloon keepers. I
      believe that this feature of the bill is giving the saloon keeper too much prominence. In this
      bill there is no requirement anywhere that any applicant shall describe the premises wherein
      or whereon he desires to sell liquors, except that he shall name the township, where outside
      of an incorporated town or city, and the street or number where in a city. I undertake to say,
      under the provisions of this act he could go anywhere in the township and build a little shed
      and sell liquor and be protected. As to the petition, the only requirement is that he shall
      file his petition; the bill does not require that he shall make any publication. There is no
      provision for any contest before the board of commsioners, they are compelled to take his
      primæ facie statement and grant him a license.
     Mr. LINCK: Was there ever any application- for license resisted in your county?
     Mr. BEASLEY: Yes sir, many of them.
     Mr. LINCK: There never have been in my county.
     Mr. BEASLEY: The eighth section provides that the laws and parts of laws in conflict with
      the provisions of this act are hereby repealed. This being the last expression of the will of
      the law making power, or the later expression, there is no doubt in my mind but that the
      courts will be com-  pelled to say that it destroys the
      effects of the seventh section. So, under this bill we would have no law in this State in
      regard to minors, or on any holiday, or to a man in a state of intoxication. I believe if this
      bill should become a law that the people would condemn it. No one, the liquor men nor the
      temperance people, would be satisfied with it. In my district we have a good many temperance
      people, and some in favor of local option, but we have a good many who think that a man should
      have a right to eat and drink and wear what he pleases.
     Mr. IBACH: The objection I have to this bill is, it legalizes the saloon system in its worst
      form. The bill that was before this House several days ago on the minority report of the
      committee was not assailed with that objection. I am surprised that any men who profess to be
      lovers of morality, and lovers of the community in which they live, should vote to legalize
      the sale of intoxicating liquors as a beverage. [Reads Section 7.] The injecting of that
      provision into this bill is for the purpose of capturing the liquor element of the State of
      Indiana. The bill that we presented to this House was not subject to that objection. I am
      willing to go before the people of Indiana and discuss the provisions in these two bills, and
      I am satisfied that when the temperance people examine them they will come to the same
      conclusion that I have. I cannot see any consistency in a law of this kind. I am satisfied
      that it is only legalizing the saloon system in its worst element.--There are a great many
      questions that we would not submit to the people to vote upon. Suppose we submitted the
      question of obscene literature. There are some places where the vote would carry, so that the
      traffic would be maintained. Suppose we would submit the question whether our public schools
      would be sustained. Are there not localities where there are denominational schools that would
      vote down the public school system?
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     Mr. PATTON: I have listened very attentively to the speeches, and I must say that in the
      discussion this morning it did appear to me like a political tinge colored the expressions of
      gentlemen. I am a Democrat, elected upon a Democratic ticket, after the Democratic party had
      in its platform resolved that they were in favor of additional legislation for the control of
      this traffic; that they were in favor of high license; and I don't believe anybody on the
      floor of this House or in the State of Indiana has ever questioned but what the Democratic
      platform was in favor of high license. We find that the first part of this bill is in favor of
      high license,--to increase the license from two hundred to five hundred dollars,--therefore no 
       gentleman
       gentlman
       on the Democratic side of the House can consistently oppose that part of the bill.
      And the other proposition is simply and solely to place that matter in the hands of the people
      to decide whether or not they will sanction the sale of intoxicating liquors within their
      townships. And I say now that the man that disregards the voice of the people, and will not
      concede to them the right to express themselves upon this proposition, or anythinig else, is
      certainly not in a condition to stand upon the floor of this House to make laws in the best
      interest of the people or to protect their morals. I will say that four years ago this
      question was before the people upon the proposition of submitting an amendment to the
      Constitution permitting the prohibiting of the sale of intoxicating liquors within the State
      of Indiana. Two years before that time the man who represented my county voted for this
      resolution to submit this amendment to the people for ratification. Two years afterward I had
      the honor to represent her with three other counties. Without the people asking me I pledged
      myself to these constitutional amendments to give the people the right to pass upon these
      questions. I am Democrat enough to believe that the people have a right to pass upon every question of morals and every question of interest to
      themselves. I believe they know better what is to their interest than any delegated power that
      can be conceived of. Four and six years ago it was a Democratic House that voted to submit
      these constitutional amendments to the people, and I find but twenty members belonging to the
      Democratic party elected upon that proposition. Why? Simply because within the two years after
      that had been submitted, I find there was an organization known and denominated the Whiskey
      League. They went to work to put a saloon in every little town, village and hamlet in the
      State of Indiana for the purpose of manufacturing political influence among the people. They
      used their influence, and it was backed up by money contributed by distilleries; and what was
      the result? Why they made warfare upon every man who dared to vote to submit this proposition
      to these people, and thereby they secured a majority of the nominees on the Democratic ticket
      to the General Assembly, and--that is the history of this question of submission. After that
      what did they do? They went to work to control the Democratic party and also to control the
      Republican party. They have already proposed to themselves to control the majority in the
      Legislature of the State of In- diana, be that Democratic or Republican, and they intend to
      control the Legislature. The majority in this House have arrived at the forks of the road
      to-day and their way is clearly indicated. What is the action, and should be the action of the
      Democratic party on the floor of the House today? I say that the Democratic party being
      pledged to one half of the proposition, it is the duty of every member upon the floor of this
      House to stand up and place himself upon the side of good morals. [Applause.]
     The policy four years ago was to defeat this constitutional amendment simply because they
      said the constitutional lawyers were consulted, and the leading Democrats were consulted, and
      they all passed upon the constitutionality of submitting this question to the Legislature.
      They attempted to assume juridiction, and they decided that they could not be submitted. That
      was the decision of the leaders in the Democratic party and where are they to-day? There is
      not one single one of them who offered that advice to the people who has not been condemned by
      the people. There is not one of them to-day who is any longer a leader in the ranks of the
      Democratic party, because it was an attempt to strangle the voice of people. Whenever a man
      attempts to take away the rights of the people he must go down, and surely he ought to go
      down; because the rights of the people, by no chicanery, by no scheming, should be taken away
      from them.
     This is a question of the greatest importance to the people of Indiana. It has been coming
      along down and it has swept on and on, like a mighty river, until it has carried almost the
      foundation away from our public schools. Do you expect to educate the people in a good and
      moral government if you build a school house and then a saloon in opposition to it? Do you
      expect to educate the young people and improve the morals of our people by this system of
      establishing saloons;--not only in our cities and our incorporated towns, where they are under
      police regulations, but you have by the Legislature of the State of Indiana permitted them to
      establish saloons where they could not be placed under any restrictions, where there is no
      police regulation;--out in the country where the people have never been corrupted. And I will
      tell you what kind of institutions they are. They are institutions for the education of
      drunkards and gamblers and thieves. You have put a blot on every township, on every village
      and on every hamlet. That is what you have done by legislation; you have opened these as
      schools for the education of our children in vice, and who shall be the preceptor in these
      schools of hell and infamy, is the question? shall it be the leaders of the Democratic party
      or of the Re-  publican party? No sir, we will put this
      in the hands of the people and make them their own school masters, to choose whether or not
      these things shall still exist; and I believe you will decide that question simply by voting
      to give them the right to say whether this evil shall be maintained among them or be
      eradicated. When I go among members to visit (and I expect I am just as guilty as others), it
      is, "Jim, let's go and take something to drink." I say the influence that
      surrounds the young men is what makes them drunkards. It is creating in him a desire to visit
      these places. He meets his jolly boon companions and go to these places of resort, instead of
      occupying his time at home among his books, and making his home what it ought to be. And when
      he goes from it, who is it that follows him to the door? It is his old mother. And his father,
      where is he? Perhaps he is there, and John follows in the footsteps of the father; if he is in
      there he says "Why, John, I am astonished at you, I thought you had more manhood. I
      don't intend to carry on in this line very far for I intend to quit it." He quits it
      just like you do. Every time you take a drink it is the last one, but you go on and on until a
      habit 
       is
       ir
       created for it, and what is the result? Why the result of it is, there becomes a
      firm and fixed habit, and it goes on and on until it cannot be controlled, and then comes
      along the politician and his work is all done for him. He says to this half demented young
      man: some one wants to take away your rights. He said it was taking the liberties away from a
      man,--liberties away from him to get beastly drunk. That man talks about his liberty and his
      manhood. His manhood has been crushed out of him long ago, and his liberty is in the hands of
      the politicians and is to be used to keep a party in power. Any party that places itself
      squarely and fairly in opposition to these great moral questions has got to go down. You have
      got to eliminate this influence from your politics. It has been tied on to the Democratic
      party like the tail to a kite; and the party, like the kite, has been overloaded, and the time
      has come when the kite or the tail must go down. Selling whiskey is a business, and whenever
      it instigates its members to vote for this interest it is against the interest of the State of
      Indiana. Every man has a right to be a Democrat or a Repulican, or belong to whatever party he
      pleases; that is one of the rights given to him by the Constitution, but no saloon
      organization, no saloon keeper, and no man that drinks whiskey has a right to control
      legislation or dictate what kind of legislation shall be made in reference to the morals of
      the community. When he sells intoxicating liquor he sells poison and he should be restricted.
      They have their rights; and have a right to belong to any party they please, but they have no
      right, that God or man should respect, to take away the lives of their fellow men; to put a
      thief into his brain to steal away his senses. This is a question of good government and we
      have a right to protect ourselves by any legislation that we see fit to enact. Talk about
      their property! What kind of property have they that can be destroyed? You take the burglar
      who breaks into your office, and do you suppose you have got to respect his jimmny and his
      tools? You catch the foot-pad in the road, and you take away his arms and his wepons.--What
      right has he to that property?
     You men who have families, you men who have sons, you know that when you go along the street
      and dodge into a saloon, if your little boy is with you you don't go in, for you have
      some respect for that little fellow toddling along by your side. If you have a boon companion
      you go in, but still you are ashamed of it. Gentlemen, you know this matter is creating
      drunkards every year. It is no longer simply confined to the sale of intoxicating liquors, but
      it is question to-day whether it shall control the legislation of the State of Indiana. It is
      not a question of selling so much and making so much out of it. But it is meeting its
      opposition. There is rising a little band of patri-  ots,
      a little bad of mothers in this land known as the Women's Christian Temperance Union,
      like the little cloud that rose in the west. I say, from their beginning may they go on and
      on, like the cloud, spreading over the whole land and regenerate society and put it on that
      high plane that is to drive the saloons out of this land. I do not care how much you say about
      it, they will go on and they will find men to join them and they will not be considered cranks
      or crazy. I am opposed to the sale of intoxicating liquor or the drinking of it, as a
      beverage. I know every times I do it I feel like these other gentlemen, we won't take
      much, and we understand that and have understood that all the time; but it is a growing evil,
      it is multiplying. If you will restrict this sale by a license of five hundred dollars each,
      that will drive these little low doggeries out of existence, and what will be the result? You
      will have in our towns a few saloons. As you restrict these saloons you restrict the
      opportunity to drink. It is the farmers' boys that come to town in squads of a half a
      dozen and go into these saloons and there they spend what little change they have in their
      pockets. They never touch it by themselves. It is these resorts, these pool tables, where the
      cards and gambling are going on, that is the head-center of all the vice in the country. The
      black-legs stop there. This bill will wipe out of the country every saloon in it. When you do
      that you will do a great work.
     The next thing is to rise up in a mighty army, everybody that loves good government, when
      this special election comes around, and vote it down, and you can do it every time. I believe
      it will be like the times in Kansas. They had a local option law; it went on for a few years;
      it was not sufficient, but you know what it did; it made two armies--the one in favor of good
      government and the other opposed to it, and it went on until the people demanded prohibition,
      and they got it. They kept up the fight; they kept on, and on, and on, winnng victory after
      victory until to-day they have a total prohibition law in Kansas. And I want to say to the
      advocates of this bill, this bill don't deprive you of the right to go and take a drink
      whenever you want to. Here is a township that has two saloons and another that has none. What
      of that? You are rid of the saloons in one whole townhaip. This bond of $5000, with good
      security, will enforce the law; will see to it that whiskey is not sold in violation of law.
      You would have people respect the law? I say this is the only way you can do it; by passing
      this bill and making it a law. And then you have carried out the Democratic platform and also
      the Republicam platform. I do not see any necessity for a division here to-day. The
      proposition is: whether or not you will submit it to your honest constituency. You ought to
      have respect for them; you trusted to their majority to send you here, and I say it is nothing
      but your duty and your right to say to them that they shall have the right to pass upon this
      great question. And I believe, when you do that, no party that will attempt to hold you
      responsible for it can live, any more than a boat with no bottom in it can float. If you
      decide in favor of this bill you will be deciding in favor of right against wrong. It will put
      sunshine in the homes where there has been nothing but gloom for years. It will put the smile
      on the, mother's face; it will put the sunshine in the faces of the children.--And when
      you go into our mining communities where men are laboring every day and then go and spend
      their hard earnings in these saloons, it will put money into their pockets; it will put
      sunshine around their hearths, hope into the bosoms of their wives, and provisions into their
      houses. You may talk about the tax-ridden people and all that kind of thing, but if you will
      put this matter into the hands of the people you will remedy all these evils and millions and
      millions of dollars that are spent in buying intoxicating liquors will be saved. You have the
      opportunity to declare in favor of good government 
      to-day. And I defy any man to come up before me and say I did wrong to vote for this bill. My
      life is not worth very much, but I would just as soon lay it down here as a sacrifice as
      anywhere else, and what it is worth I will place in the interests of good government.

     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. BEASLEY, in explaining his vote, said: Not because I am opposed to temperance but
      because I am opposed to this bill, as I do not believe it is a proper bill; and because I
      believe it will leave the statutes in a worse fix than they are now on this question, I vote
      "no."
     Mr. COX, of Miami: I am in favor of temperance legislation. I believe the laws we have now
      on the statute book, if properly enforced, would be effective; and I am in favor of even more
      stringent legislation than we have now, but I am not in favor of this bill, because, with all
      due deference to the gentlemen who have been active in defending it, I believe it to be a
      foolish measure. As the law now is applicants have to give notice they are going to make an
      application, and parties disposed to do so can combat their right to obtain license. For these
      reasons I am opposed to the bill. I vote "no."
     Mr. DICKERSON, when his name was called, said: I am one of those who believe that the
      majority should rule, and that one section of the county or State should not dictate to
      another section what evils they should endure. I am a true Democrat in that respect, but not
      like the Democrat on this side of the House who would deny the right of the majority to rule,
      from the election of a Lieutenant-Governor, down to the right of a majority in a township to
      say if they want a saloon or not. I pledged my word to my constituents that I would support
      all measures that would insure to the public good. I have tried to make good that pledge. I am
      here to represent the wish of that large and better proportion of our population who have no
      voice on the floor of this House--the women of Indiana--and not only the women, but the
      orphans who have become so through the traffic in intoxicating liquors. When I go home and my
      wife or my boys ask me, "Pa, how did you vote on the liquor question?" how could I
      look them in the face and say I voted as the liquor interest desired? I will not; I will vote
      according to the dictates of my conscience. And now, in behalf of the women, who constitute
      the fairest and best portion of our community; in behalf of the orphans, and of the boys and
      girls of Indiana, who ask and demand a higher and better citizenship; I, as their
      representative on the floor of this House, vote "aye."
     Mr. FOSTER, in explanation of his vote, said: For the reason that the  majority, no matter how large, has no right to dictate to me what I
      shall drink or wear, I am a stronger prohibitionist than almost anyone on this floor. I
      believe not only that drinking is wrong, but I believe the use of tobacco is wrong. For these
      reasons, send for the reason that I am in favor of what the people will stand on this subject;
      and for the reason that it is foolish to enact laws on any subject that the people are not
      willing to have;--for these reasons I vote on his question "no."
     Mr. GARRISON, when called upon to vote, said: I believe the cause of intemperance is located
      in the human appetite and not in the saloon or the whiskey bottle. Because I believe the moral
      standard of the community will not enforce the laws now on the statute book, and they will not
      enforce more stringent laws; and because I believe the best method of decreasing intemperance
      is by education, and this law will not have that effect, I vote "no."
     Mr. GORDON [explaining]: While this bill is said not to be a political measure yet I believe
      it is in obedience to a party requirement, and in obedience, to some extent, to a political
      demand. While I think this bill was drawn with the expectation that it would not pass this
      Legislature, and was very imperfectly drawn; while I have not been instructed by my
      constituency on this question, yet knowing that in my own county the question of temperence is
      not a political one, and knowing also that there are many Democrats in my county who are in
      favor of high license and local option, many believing in prohibition and having no great
      political ambition, but believing that the bill will have some moral effect, I feel myself
      compelled to vote "aye" on this question.
     Mr. GOUGH [in explanation]: I have the honor to represent on this floor one of the
      strongholds of the Democracy. The county of Warrick usually gives the Democratic candidate
      about four hundred majority and I feel it incumbent on me to vote on this bill as I feel the
      people would vote if they were voting for themselves. I find the Democratic party in their
      platform determined that it would be the policy of their party to increase the license for the
      sale of intoxicating liquors. The only question remaining is, to determine what amount is a
      reasonable license. I think the people of Warrick county will stand by me in voting for this.
      Another question remains and that is the question of local option. I think the Democratic
      principle is that the people are sovereign. That is the principle of this bill. I think I will
      be repesenting the great Democratic majority of Warrick county by voting for this bill as I
      do. I vote, "aye."
     Mr. GROSE, when his name was called, said: I am heartily in favor, soul and body, of leaving
      this matter to the people themselves. I vote "aye."
     Mr. KELLISON [explaining]: I vote as I do on this question partly because it does not
      prohibit the sale of liquor except as a beverage, under any circumnstances; and according to
      the provisions of this bill it leaves the power to determine whther liquor sold shall be a
      beverage or shall be sold as a medicine. In my opinion that construction on this law will
      simply open the doors of legislation to free whiskey--absolutely untrammeled traffic in this
      article: and I believe if that is the construction put on this bill it will be the most deadly
      blow against temperance and sobriety in the State. I believe there would be more sick men who
      would want to take a little for their stomach's sake than ever before. I believe this law
      can be entirely evaded. For these reasons, and many others which I will not take the time to
      give, I vote "no."
     Mr. MILLER, when called upon to vote, said: Because I represent every element in this State
      except the liquor element, I vote "aye."
     Mr. MORSE [explaining his vote]: There is a point in this bill that did not meet my
      approbation, but as this is the only bill that I expect will 
       come
       ome
       up before this body that gives  the people a
      chance to say what they will or will not have, I vote "aye."
     Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Owen [in explanation]: The Democratic party declared in favor of an
      increase of license in their platform. I think I have cleared my conscience. I promised in my
      county that I would vote for an increase of the license. The other day there was a minority
      report offered which, I said, presented just what I believed. This bill provides a higher
      license than I want; I therefore vote "no."
     Mr. PARKER [explaining]: Because I believe this bill, if it should become a law, would not
      be as effective in suppressing saloons as the present law if enforced; because I am inclined
      to resent some of the insinuations cast on the Democratic party, and believing that the
      principle of the Democratic party is for higher and not high license; believing further this
      bill is one species of prohibition, and my experience in two States where prohibition is said
      to exist showed me that it could not be enforced; believing that no majority has the right to
      say to me what I shall eat, drink or wear; and believing further that this principle
      introduced into this bill, if passed, would have a tendency to make the people hypocrites and
      not temperance people and believing that if the present liquor law of the State of Indiana was
      enforced it would be more effective than this bill, and knowing that it is not enforced
      because the people are not educated up to that point; and knowing that this bill could not be
      enforced, I vote "no."
     Mr. PATTON said he was paired with Mr. Jewett. The latter would vote no, he presumed, and he
      wished as to be recorded as favoring this bill.
     Mr. PIERCE [in explanation]: I want to say that I represent the Democratic constituency of
      the counties of Adams, Jay and Blackford. It has been said that on election day I voted with
      the whiskey party. I do not so regard it. I do not think the question of temperance has
      anything to do with politics. It is a question that each and every man should decide for
      himself . Feeling that way I have the manhood to stand up here to-day and show on which side
      of this question I stand. No party lash shall lash me on this occasion. When I came here my
      people asked me in reference to this question. I said this is question that belongs to me, and
      when I go to the Legislature if I see fit to vote for temperance I shall do it; I stand here
      to-day on the side of temperance, and if I had it in my power I would say that the man who
      manufactures whiskey shall be buried so deep that he could never be found. I have a practice
      that I can make my living from, and I shall return to my home with this satisfaction, that I
      cast my vote with the right side. I therefore, say "aye."
     Mr. ROBINSON, in explanation his vote, said: Because the constituency whom I represent have
      declared as a party of prohibition, and because my Greenback constituency are temperance men,
      and because my Democratic constituency have declared for a higher license; believing also in
      the sovereignty of the people that they ought to have a right to pass on this great moral
      question, having implicit confidence in the people of the State of Indiana to govern
      themselves locally. Some of my constituents are very strongly in favor of personal liberty; so
      am I, but where public reform begins at the expense of personal liberty, personal liberty
      ends. I have examined closely this bill and find that it does not in the least infringe on the
      personal liberty of the press of the State of Indiana or of the blue (gold) room at the Bates
      House. I vote "aye."
     Mr. SHAMBAUGH [explaining his vote]: Believing that the bill that is now under discussion is
      largely for political purposes; and believing that the gentlemen on the other side of the
      chamber never thought it would pass and become a law; and believing that the people ought to
      determine for themselves what they are to eat, drink and wear; and believing if the law that
      is now on our statute book should be enforced it would be more effective to the temperance  cause; believing these things, I vote "no."
     Mr. VAN SLYKE, when his name was called, said: It has been said by the gentlemen on the
      other side of this House that they did not propose to be bound by anything that dictated what
      a man should, eat, drink or wear, and yet they are living exactly under just such a sumptuary
      law, but the reason assigned by some for not voting for this is the reason named. I want it
      distinctly understood that I am a temperance man and believe in the protection of our
      sovereign community. For these reasons I vote "aye."
     Mr. WORRALL, when called upon to vote, said: Representing as I do a Democratic and a
      Republican county,and knowing that there is a great diversity of sentiment among the people of
      my district, I feel it my duty on this occasion to state briefly why I vote as I do. In the
      last campaign I took a decided stand and talked against prohibition and local option. I
      believe this is why I not only carried the county of Brown but also the county of Monroe, and
      I am satisfied that if the people had not been on my side of the question they would have
      defeated me. I desire to say that I am here to represent the position I took at that time, and
      I therefore shall vote "no."
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the bill passed the House.
    
    
     ASYLUM FOR THE FEEBLE-MINDED.
     Mr. Grose's bill [H. R. 114] to establish the Indiana School for Feeble-minded Youth,
      was returned from the committee thereon. The majority recommended the indefinite postponement
      of the bill and the minority recommended that it pass.
     Mr. GROSE: Senate Bill 108 proposed to take this
      institution to Fort Wayne and buy a piece of land for $10,000. It also proposes an
      appropriation of $40,000 for a building. I want to say to the House that all these
      feeble-minded children--the report shows there were fifty-eight in October after it burned
      down--are without homes. The land is to be bought and the building built, which, in all human
      probability, will take the entire year. This bill, of which I am the author, proposes to buy
      what is known as the Morrison property in Knightstown, about six acres of land and a building
      amply sufficient to turn these children in to-morrow, or as soon as it is bought. That
      property is offered to the State at $8,000. Its cost, as Mr. Ferguson shows, was $25,000. I
      look upon it as very important that we shall provide a home for these children at once.
     Mr. BEASLEY I desire to ask, what is the state of preservation?
     Mr. GROSE: The house is in a good state of preservation; in good condition; large stone were
      used in its construction. The house is heated by a furnace. We give $3,000 for additional
      improvements, and $3,000 for current expenses, making a total expense of $14,000. The Fort
      Wayne bill says $10,000 for land, $40,000 for building, that is $50,000; then it also puts in
      $3,000 for current expenses, making $53,000. You have no building at Fort Wayne; you have no
      preparation for these children, and when will you get a home for them? I think it will be
      impossible to do it before autumn next. We should not take that course with these children.
      These fifty-eight have vacillated from seventy-five to forty, and now they are standing at
      fifty-eight to be cared for.
     Mr. GORDON: I do note believe the bill ought to prevail for the reason I think, first, that
      it would be bad economy for this State to give $8,000 for that piece of property, anid then
      spend $3,000 to $6,000 to overhaul it. While it is true it might be a home for these
      fifty-eight children, what are you going to do for the four or five thousand that we are to
      provide for? This mansion cannot provide for one tenth of these. It will not do to provide for
      fifty-eight of these children and leave all the others in this State unprovided for.
     Mr. BROWN: I do not believe that the Senate bill proposing to establish this institution at
      Fort Wayne  ought to pass by any means, but the bill
      proposing to establish it at Knightstown is, in my judgment, one of much more economy and
      would afford as much relief as has ever been required for these children. You claim that there
      is a large number now in the State; that there is a thousand of them or more, that need a home
      of this kind. The right to go into this home was given to them in 1879 and the books of that
      institution to-day will show that at no time has it exceeded one hundred, or applications for
      more than that number to go into the home.
     There is another home down there, the Soldiers' Orphans' Home, that in a very few
      years will be vacant. In twelve or fourteen, or fifteen years at the outside, there will not
      be a soldier's orphan in the State of Indiana to occupy it. It is quite an item that
      those who seek a place in this institution should not be compelled to go to the farthest
      corner of the State of Indiana to get into it. It would be be better to establish all such
      homes as near the center of the State as possible. These children may live in the southern
      part of the State, and their parents being poor and there being no provision for taking them
      there, it would be a hardship upon them.--This Knightstown property is a property of eight
      acres and a large stone and brick building of twenty commodious rooms. It is well drained, and
      it will accommodate, with a little additional expense, all that will ever be required in this
      State.
     Mr. IBACH: I am astonished that any gentbleman should assert on this floor that there are
      not one thousand feeble-minded children in the State of Indiana. According to the census of
      the United States there are 4,724 feeble-minded persons in the State of Indiana. The ratio is
      that more than one half of them are children. If more than one half of them are children we
      have in the State of Indiana 2,362 feeble-minded children who ought to be provided for. But I
      do not propose to discuss the merits of the education of feeble-minded children at this time.
      The proposition now before this House is to purchase a home and eight acres of ground. If the
      State of Indiana is going around begging I have as good a building in the city of Huntington
      and seventy acres of land they can have for $7,500. I say the citizens of Fort Wayne are
      willing to rent a large property free of charge; and are willing to take these children there
      and provide for the until they can be provided for. I want to say that this house is not any
      sense fitted for an asylum for feeble-minded children. The expense of turning the old property
      into such an institution would cost more than to erect a building from the foundation. When
      the question was before the committee the committee was told that the furnaces did not heat
      that buildinig during the winter time. The dormitories are nothing but fire traps. I hope that
      we will not take this step which will only add an expense with out any profit.
     On motion by Mr. GORDON, the minority report was laid on the table.
     Mr. IBACH demanded the previous question.
     Which was seconded by the House and under its operations the majority report was concurred
      in by yeas 58, nays 32.
     So, the bill was inidefinitely postponed.
     The bill [S. 108] to establish a school for
      feeble-minded children being read the second time--
     Mr. LINCK moved to recommit, with instructions to report a bill to appoint a commission of
      five to select a site for this home, taking into consideration any donations offered by any
      city or county.
     Mr. SHAMBAUGH: When the Senate passed the feeble-minded children's bill and the
      soldiers' orphans' bill the leaders of this House promised the friends of the
      feeble-minded children they would stand by this bill. The city of Fort Wayne has asked this at
      the hands of the State Legislature, not from political reasons. It will depend entirely upon
      where these persons on the commission are from as to where this institution will be located.
      If they should  be from the southern part of the State
      every member of the House knows where it would go. The city of Fort Wayne is entitled to it
      upon merit. There are two lines through the State of Indiana dividing it into four parts. The
      southeastern part of the State, the southwestern part of the State and the northwestern part
      of the State have their institutions, but the northeastern part has never had a dollar of
      appropriations. I say to you that the State of India is no beggar, and it is not necessary
      when a small appropriation of $50,000 is to be made that a commission shall be sent out to see
      who will give two or three thousand dollars. Evansville never paid one single dollar for that
      Insane Asylum although when it is completed it will cost $400,000. Kokomo is only a short
      distance from Logansport, and she promises twenty-five acres of land and a gas well. The city
      of Fort Wayne being the third largest city in the State, and being the most beautifully
      located, makes it the most available place in the State of Indiana.
     Mr. LINCK: If nothing else but the speech of the gentleman from Allen (Mr. Shambaugh) would
      satisfy me, that would convince me that the proposition I have made should pass. He says there
      was an agreement made. I am surprised that such an acknowledgment should come from the
      gentleman. If that agreement was made it was bribery, as much as if a gentleman should come in
      here and offer so much for a vote. There is nothing to show that Fort Wayne is the cheapest
      place. A commission can find out, and they can come back and report to this House.
     Mr. SHAMBAUGH made an ineffectual motion--yeas 40, nays 51--to lay the motion on the
      table.
     Mr. LINCK demanded the previous question.
     Which was seconded by the House, and under its operation the motion to recommit was agreed
      to by yeas 44, nays 41.
     The House adjourned.
    
   
   
   
    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    IN SENATE.
    
     WEDNESDAY, February 15, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Rev. Mr. Duncan, of the M. E. Church.
    
     TO PREVENT IMPIRICISM.
     The bill [S. 220--Mr. DeMotte's] to amend the Medical-Practice Act, was read the second
      time.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: The only changes are that a physician having gained a
      license in one county need not obtain it in another; and the State Board of Health is to
      determine what is a reputable medical college.
     Mr. THARP: I am glad this amendment is proposed to the law, that a license may be good
      anywhere in the State. Physicians in my section of the State have desired this change; and I
      am very glad to have an opportunity to vote for a bill that will correct that very grave error
      in the present law.
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion: I think there is no physician in the State but what is in favor of
      this bill. The State Board of Health is supposed to be composed of intelligent gentlemen who
      know much more about medical colleges than the clerks of the courts. The State Board know the
      respectable colleges of the land, and has too much self-respect to expunge from the list any
      honorable institution whatever. In reference to the issuing of certificates from the various
      counties in which a physician may practice, this bill will remedy at evil. There are surgeons
      who are very much embarrassed in going to different counties on account of the law requiring
      them to take out a license in every county in which they practice. I think this bill is well
      guarded and hope it will pass.
     Mr. JOHNSON: It seems to me this is a proper bill and ought to pass. I know of no more
      appropriate body to which the proposed power should be given than the State Board of Health,
      composed as it is of gentlemen eminent in their profession. I don't think they would
      refuse to place on the list of reputable colleges any institution simply because it is of a
      different school. There was a time in the medical history of this country when it might have
      been so, but that period has passed. I sincerely hope the bill will pass.
     Mr. FOWLER: I think if the applicant has been practicing medicine anywhere for three years,
      and can make that manifest to this board, he ought to have a license. He made an ineffectual
      motion--affirmative 12, negative 15--to so amend.
     
     Mr. SELLERS moved to amend so the license shall be recorded in every county where the holder
      pratices.
     Mr. KENNEDY: There is a physician living near the edge of my county who tells me he would
      lose a least a hundred dollars by not having a license in the adjoining county. It is a
      hardship for physicians to be compelled to take a license out in every county in which they
      practice. Doctors have hardships enough now. When they walk about town they look like any
      other gentlemen; when they come to relieve distress they are like angels of mercy; but when
      they come for their pay, to the recipient of their kind attention, they look like the devil.
      [Laughter.]
     Mr. CAMPBELL: I voted against the bill two years ago for the reason I thought it favored the
      clerks, and added nothing to the efficiency of physicians.
     Mr. THARP offered an amendment, which was adopted, requiring "all the various schools
      of medicine now recognized and practising in the State" to be given full recognition.
     Mr. WEIR demanded the previous question.
     The Senate seconded the demand, and under its operations the bill passed by yeas 32, nays
      4.
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. BAILEY said: If there is anything on earth about medicine physicians can agree upon, no
      one should object to it, and as the physicians on this floor agree upon this bill, therefore I
      vote "aye."
     Mr. FOWLER, when called upon to vote, said: I regard some of the provisions of this bill as
      very arbitrary, and I believe it ought not to become a law, therefore I vote
      "no."
     Mr. ZIMMERMAN, when his name was called, said: Two years ago I voted against the law this
      bill seeks to amend because it required physicians to take out license in every county in
      which they practised. I ought to have the privilege to call to my house any physician I
      please. This bill takes that privilege away, and I don't think we ought to pass such
      laws. I think they are vicious. I vote "no."
     Mr. HARNESS, in explanation of his vote, after the roll-call was completed, said: I desire
      to vote for this bill because I think it is a law in the interest of humanity. I vote
      "aye."
     The result was announced as above.
     So the bill passed the Senate.
    
    
     VISIT OF THE G. A. R.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The business of the Senate will be suspended for a few moments.
      Senators will please rise.
     Mr. MCDONALD [of the Reception Committee]: Attention, Comrades! Parade
      dress. Mr. President and Senators: I have the pleasure of introducing General Bennett and
      members of the Grand Army of the Republic of the State of Indiana. [Applause.]
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: General Bennett will take the stand.
     Gen. TOM W. BENNETT [Department Commander]: Mr.
      President and Gentlemen of the Senate: In compliance with your invitation the Grand Army of
      the Republic, Department of Indiana, are here to-day for the purpose of presenting to you a
      memorial, after thanking you very kindly for what you have already done for us in the passage
      of the Soldiers' Orphans' Home bill. We present you this memorial which covers the
      ground better than anything I might say. The G. A. R. of Indiana is composed exclusively of
      soldiers; we represent five hundred posts, and a membership of over twenty thousand; and we
      come to you with this memorial which was passed about half an hour ago in our Annual
      Encampment at Tomlinson Hall by a unanimous vote--not a single member voting against it.
      [Reads: to pass the pending bill for a $200,000 soldiers', monument in this city.] We
      submit this to you, Gentlemen of the Senate, in the hope that it will receive your patriotic
      and favorable consideration.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Gentlemen of the Grand Army of the Republic: As the presiding
      officer of the Senate of the Fifty-fifth General 
      Assembly of the State of Indiana, I welcome you most cordially to the floor of this Senate. To
      the men who went forth at the Nation's call, in the darkest hours of the Nation's
      need, to defend the Nation's cause, too much honor cannot be given and too much courtesy
      cannot be shown. Without partisan feeling and without reference to divisions that separate us
      on polital grounds, I may say that the soldiers of Indiana have built an imperishable monument
      for themselves, far grander and nobler and higher and more enduring than the General Assembly
      can build by any law. They have built for themselves a monument that will shine brighter and
      grow in grandeur as the pages of history grow older. I am pleased to welcome you on this
      occasion, and, if need be, the Senate will stand adjourned at the pleasure of the brave
      defenders of the Nation's cause.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: I move that the Senate adjourn at the pleasure of the Grand Army of the
      Republic.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: It is so ordered. The Grand Army has the liberty of the floor of
      the Senate.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     BEAVER LAKE LANDS.
     The bill [S. 77] in relation to Beaver Lake lands, came up as being unfinished business, the
      question being on Mr. Sellers' motion to require the Committee on Swamp
       Lands to inquire into the value.
     Mr. WINTER thought the State should be made whole on account of expense incurred. He
      submitted instructions to that end, which were adopted.
     The motion to refer was agreed to.
    
    
     WOMAN SUFFRAGE.
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion, called up his bill [S. 162] to allow women to vote at municipal
      elections,--the majority report from the committee favorable; the minority recommending
      indefinite postponement.
     Mr. JOHNSON made a long speech favoring the bill. When he concluded--
     Mr. SELLERS moved to refer the bill to the Committee on the Judiciary,
      with instructions to report on its constitutionality, and on that motion demanded the previous
      question.
     The Senate seconded the demand for the previous question, and under its operations the
      motion was agreed to, by yeas 19, nays 14, as follows:
     
      
       
        YEAS. Andrew, Bailey, Berry, Branaman, Cox, Day, Duncan (of Brown,) Fowler, Hale, Howard
         (of Decatur,) Logsdon, McClure, Rahm, Schloss, Sellers, Shively, Smith (of Wells,) Urmston,
         Mr. President. 19.
        NAYS. Campbell, Davis, Drake, Dresser, Ensley, Harness, Johnson, Kennedy, Macy, Marshall,
         Thompson (of Marion,) Winter, Weir, Zimmerman. 14.
       
      
     
     So the bill was referred--
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion, saying: The only objecton I have to this reference is, I think you
      are consigning this bill to its grave.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Does the Senator with to intimate that the Judiciary
       Committee is a grave yard?
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion: It will be in this case, I think.
    
    
     GREEN RIVER ISLAND.
     Mr. WINTER, from the special committee on a Governor's message [see page 227 of this
      book] introduced a bill [S. 292] in relation to Green River Island. He said: The only thing of
      any practicable importance is to get this matter before the Supreme Court of the United
      States. The committee are clearly of the opinion that this island belongs to Indiana. It lies
      on this side of the center of the Ohio River. The sum the bill appropriates [$5,000] includes
      the payment of attorney's fees as well as other expenses. There is no question about the
      title of the land; the land belongs to the people on the island. It is only the question of
      jurisdiction that is in controversy--whether they pay taxes to the State of Kentucky or to the
      State of Indiana. The island embraces about 18,000
      acres. In order that the bill may get through the House it ought to be passed by now.
     On motion by Mr. THARP, the bill was pressed to its final reading, under a dispensation of
      the constitutional restriction, and passed the Senate by yeas 36, nays 0.
    
    
     COMMITTEEMEN RESIGNATIONS.
     Mr. RAHM presented the following:
     
      
       
         Mr. President--The undersigned members of the Standing Committee on Benevolent
          Institutions respectfully ask to be excused from further service upon said
         committee: J. F. Cox; William Rahmn, jr.; F. M. Howard; J. M. Dresser.
       
      
     
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion: I regret this. I think the Senate is satisfied with that committee.
      I would regard myself as being very much honored to be on it. If these gentlemen will vote for
      the woman's bill when it comes up again they will do well.
     Mr. RAHM: With regard to the last statement I can assure the Senator I will never vote for
      the woman's bill.
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion:--Why?
     Mr. RAHM: Because I believe they would mob me after I went home; they don't believe in
      such sickly sentimentality. With regard to his other statement, I don't believe with the
      Senator from Marion that the Senate is satisfied with the committee. I claim that the Senate
      is not satisfied with it, and consequently we resign because we don't expect to be made
      the tools and to be kicked about by anybody.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: What will the Senate do with the resignations?
     Mr. THARP: I move they be accepted.
     Mr. SELLERS: I move to lay the motion to accept on the table.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: What will that do with the resignations?
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Lay them on the table.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: What will it do with the committee?
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The committee will be on.
     Mr. RAHM: There is no intention for us to leave the Senate and run away. You can lead horses
      to water, but you can't make them drink.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair didn't understand there were any horses on the
      committee.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: When members of a committee ask us at this late day in the session to accept
      their resignations, they ought to give some good reason for it. I want them to work out their
      time unless they give some good reason why they resign.
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion: I think there is no man in this Senate who has more heartfelt
      respect for the chairman of this committee than I; and I believe that feeling is universal in
      the Senate. There is the utmost confidence reposed in the Senator from Evansville. I hope and
      trust the Senate will not excuse him.
     Mr. DRESSER: As a member of that committee I desire to say this: The reason of the
      resignation of four members of the committee is put upon this ground: we feel that our
      usefulness on that committee has bee destroyed; that there is no further reason for us to
      serve on that committee. This Senate has taken upon itself to appoint a special committee to
      do a large part of the work which was the special office of this permanent committee. By that
      appointment the Senate expressed the opinion either that it had no faith in the honesty and
      integrity of that committee, or that it had no faith in its ability to do the work. That is
      the reason which actuated the four members who have signed this paper and tendered their
      resignations. We were honestly endeavoring to press an investigation of the benevolent
      institutions when this question was sprung upon the Senate. The labor which should belong
      properly to this committee has been taken from it, and we feel there is no further need of the
      committee itself. And it had as well  be discharged at
      this time as any other.
     Mr. SHIVELY: I desire to state when I introduced the resolution to appoint a select
      committee [see page 381] to investigate the management of the benevolent institutions, I did
      not intend any reflection upon the president of the standing committee on that subject or any
      of its members. I did not understand then, neither do I understand now, Mr. President, that it
      is the especial business of that standing committee to make such a thorough and sweeping
      investigation as is intended and as is contemplated by that resolution; consequently, I
      supposed it was more proper for a select committee to make that investigation than it would be
      for a standing committee unless it was specially instructed. Now let me say to members of that
      standing committee that there was no intention to cast any reflection upon any Senator upon
      that committee. I will further state, Mr. President, that I consulted no Senator upon this
      floor, nor no person outside of this chamber. I conceived the idea that it was necessary to
      make a thorough and sweeping investigation, and that was the cause of my introducing that
      resolution.
     Mr.DRESSER: The regular committee consists of seven members; two of the members of the
      regular committee were selected to serve on this special committee. Had the selection of the
      special committee been from outside of the regular commitee we would not have felt the stigma
      as we do.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Since the Senator from Tippecanoe [Mr. Dresser] has mentioned
      that matter, it is a reflection upon the chair. The chair appointed the special committee, and
      at the time he done so he did not remember or know, or attempt to find out, whether a single
      member appointed was on the standing committee on benevolent institutions
      or not. He appointed those he thought ought to be appointed. And I will state now: the chair
      in appointing that special committee attempted to select every member who he put upon it from
      lawyers on the floor of the Senate, except in the case of Senator Huston, and the chair made
      the promise of his appointment upon that committee in the debate that the Senator from
      Jennings [the President pro tem.] had with the Senator from Fayette (Mr. Huston) which was
      entirely friendly, and the chair is entirely satisfied with the Senator from Fayette, although
      he is not a lawyer. The reason why the chair selected the other Senators was simply because he
      knew them to be lawyers of ability, able and willing to go into the investigation. The
      presumption is always in favor of good faith, sir.
     Mr. DRESSER: We supposed of course the chairman knows who was appointed on the standing
      committees. We understand the chairman, who had the appointment of the permanent committees,
      knew who were on them, and we felt it not fair nor just to the rest of us to select two; not
      that we desired to serve on an investigation, but it has gone out over the State that the
      President of this Senate didn't have faith that the regular committee would honestly,
      fairly and squarely investigate the reports.
     Mr. HOWARD, of Decatur: In addition to this grievance there is no precedent for the action.
      I think it stands alone--the action of calling this special committee to invetigate an
      institution of the State where there was a standing committee that exercised supervision over
      that institution.
     Mr. FOWLER: It is not without precedent, by any means,--the action of appointing a special
      committee to investigate this Insane Asylum. I remember in 1879 when I was a member of this
      Senate, and in the capacity now occupied by the Senator from Vanderburg, that it became
      necessary to institute an examination into the condition of the Insane Asylum, and on that
      occasion there was a special committee created to do that thing. And I didn't for one
      moment take it as any offence to the committee, nor did any other member of the standing
      committee. These Senators  not now to resign their
      positions. The committee has work before it, no doubt, which they ought to perform, and no
      other committee could do so thoroughly and satisfactory. I hope the chairman and other members
      of the committee will not take it as any offense whatever in creating this special committee,
      and I feel it is the desire of every member on this floor that they should reconsider the
      matter and not now disorrganize this committee at this late day in the session.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: It does seem to me the purpose of a standing committee on benevolent
      institutions is that it shall so far investigate the condition of these institutions as to
      make such an intelligent report to the General Assembly as that the Assembly can act on that
      report. There seems to be no occasion for a special committee. The regular committee can
      furnish a report that will cover the ground. Therefore, I think the Senate must either
      question the fairness of the standing committee, or its capacity. In my judgment these
      Senators ought to be excused. The record is made that, at a late day of the session, the
      Senate took out of the hands of the regular committee an investigation, and appointed a
      special committee for that purpose; and the mere declaration of the Chair goes for nothing,
      while the record of this Senate stands to be read for all time. If I was a membher of that
      standing committee I would want to be excused.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Was the Senator from Hendricks here when the resolution
      authorizing the appointment of this special committee was under consideration?
     Mr. CAMPBELL: I think I was.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Did you vote for it?
     Mr. CAMPBELL: I certainly did.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Did you make that speech then?
     Mr. CAMPBELL: I did not.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Why didn't you make that speech then?
     Mr. CAMPBELL: Because I was willing the majority should take the responsibility of saying
      they didn't trust their standing committee; or take the responsibility of saying there
      would not be a full investigation.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The intimation is forced.
     Mr. BAILEY: The resolution calling for the appointment of a special committee was introduced
      in the Senate without consultation with anyone. It was a proper thing, I think, to introduce.
      It was discussed here for half a day. I had no thought, as a member of that committee, at the
      time, of any reflection upon it, nor had I knowledge of who the committee might be. Personally
      I have a great deal of opposition to being on either a regular or special committee; but if a
      duty be imposed upon me in the Senate I desire to perform that duty as well as possible. This
      matter was under discussion for a long time [the President pro tem.:
      "Nearly two days"]and the chairman and other members of that committee sat here
      without offering any amendment. The President of the Senate was compelled to appoint this
      special committee and certaisly no reflection could be cast upon him for doing so. I
      don't see any reason why the Senate should excuse members of the standing committee.
     Mr. WEIR : It seems to me if members will stop and reflect upon the reasons for the
      appointment of this select committee they will not insist upon their resignations being
      accepted. I understand it has been the practice, where, from any cause whatever, there was to
      be any extraordinary labor to be performed, select committees would be raised. I heard this
      resolution discussed Friday forenoon, and it never occurred to me once that there was anything
      in it of which that committee would complain, and I think they must conclude there was no
      intention on the part of the Chair or of the Senate to in any way reflect upon them.
     Mr. RAHM: Not a single member of the committee cast any reflection  upon the Senator for introducing the resolution. It was perfectly
      proper and right. One thing the committee thought wrong was: after the resolution passed and
      the committee appointed, which was last Friday, I think, then the Senator from Posey gave
      notice of a motion to reconsider, with a view of turning the investigation over to the regular
      committee. That motion came up yesterday. In the mean time the Chair filled the vacancy caused
      by the resignation of the chairman with the mover of the motion to reconsider, and when that
      motion was called up yesterday the Senator who offered the motion to reconsider withdrew it.
      We may not be as sharp as lawyers, but we can hear things, and we know it is a fact that the
      Senator was induced and requested to withdraw the motion; and at the same time he withdrew the
      motion the Senator from Laporte questioned whether he had the right to do it.--There was--I
      don't think two Senators voted.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: On what?
     Mr. RAHM: On the motion to reconsider.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: No vote was taken at all. Does the Senator say there was a vote
      taken on the motion to reconsider?
     Mr. RAHM: It was withdrawn at the instigation of members on this floor.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: When the Senator from Posey asked leave to withdraw the motion to
      reconsider, the chair distinctly asked twice whether there was any objection, and some one
      said: "Take it by consent;" the chair then said: "There being no objection the
      motion to reconsider is withdrawn."
     Mr. RAHM: Right there is where wrong and injustice come in.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: There is no wrong in that.
     Mr. RAHM: He made the motion to reconsider to get out of trouble; but he was requested to
      withdraw the motion, as it was stated awhile ago, because it needed an extraordinary talent,
      or, in other words, the lawyers. If that was the case why in the name of God did you put me on
      that committee? These charges were in the papers, and published all over the State, and
      yourself , Mr. President, knew it, and knew it would be our duty to make a thorough
      investigation.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Why did you not, as chairman of the committee, proceed to make an
      investigation, instead of rising in your place and saying you can't get your committee to
      consider it?
     Mr. RAHM: You must have misunderstood me. I said I mentioned that subject at two different
      meetings, and we were going to have a searching and thorough investigation; and because it is
      generally known that I would go to the bottom of everything, I think that may be drawn. I cast
      no reflection upon the Senator from Posey (Mr. French.) I believe if he had to do it over
      again he would not withdraw that motion. The trouble is Senators went to him and asked him to
      withdraw it. I know he has been told he ought not to have made that motion. There's where
      the trouble was. One of the standing committee, now upon the present committee, stated to me
      last Saturday he thought it was an insult to the committee, and although appointed on the
      special committee he felt like resigning from the special and regular committee. I told him
      not to mind it. But when it is stated you want a certain class to do this work, what in the
      name of God are we to do?
     Mr. FRENCH: I think most of the grievance is in their imagination. No one ever came to me
      and asked me to withdraw the motion to reconsider. I have no apologies to make. This body saw
      fit to adopt the resolution for a special committee. The President of the Senate simply asked
      me to withdraw that motion, and did it without knowing he was to appoint me on it. I asked him
      that I might not be connected with that committee. Without any machination, the Senate allowed
      me to with- draw the motion. I think these grievances are
      all imaginary. I hope members will reconsider their request to be discharged. I have no desire
      to serve on this committee and it would be a personal kindess to discharge me.
     Mr. COX: As a member of the Committee on Benevolent Institutions I want
      to say that when I signed that resigniation I was in earnest about it. I recognize the fact
      that this Senate had a right to appoint that select commitite; but there is one thing this
      Senate can never do, and that is to compel me to serve on that committee, and you had now just
      as well accept my resignation, because I never will appear on that committee again. I care not
      what the purpose was, I know the effect.
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion: I voted for a new committee out of deference to the feelings of
      Republican members. I thought they desired a special committee and I didn't want to do
      anything that would show I was opposed to an investigation. I was chairman of the standing
      committee during the eight years I was in the Senate before this session. The second session I
      served in this Senate there was a committee appointed over my head to investigate the Insane
      Asylum. I was glad of it for I didn't want to engage in hunting stories up, and perhaps
      so expressed myself to some Senators.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Well, are you done speaking, all of you?
     Mr. FOWLER: I move that the resignation of the Senators be accepted. That is the better way
      to get rid of it.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: It seems that some Senators think the chair is censurable for
      what they are pleased to term ignoring the Standing Committee on Benevolent and
       Reformatory Institutions. The chair selected and made up that committee and acted
      with great prudence and care, as much as it was in his power to do, and placed on that
      committee Senators in whom he had the greatest confidence. The chairman of that committee, the
      Senator from Vanderburg, was the selection of the chair. He selected him because he knew him
      two years ago; served with him in the Senate; occupied the same seat with him in part; and for
      that reason, and the good impression he had of him in the last session of the Legislature, and
      his services with him in the Senate, made him chairman of the most important committee in the
      Senate; and his associates were such men as the chair personally knew to be his equal. I
      naturally supposed, from the character of the Senators, that they knew what they ought to do
      and would do it with fidelity to the State. At no time did the chair ever suspicion their
      ability nor their integrity; and any such imputation as that, let it come from whom it may,
      from the minority or the majority, is wilfully and maliciously false. The chair did believe,
      in view of the campaign charges that had been made against the institution known as the
      Hospital for the Insane, that an immediate and vigorous investigation ought to be entered into
      by the the Senate, in view of the fact that the other branch of this General Assembly had
      refused to grant the Senate the privilege of participating in such an ivestigation and was
      carrying on the same, as the chair believes, for partisan purposes.
     Mr. HUSTON addressed the Chair.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: I don't want to be interrupted. If you want to enter into a
      discussion, I will take the floor.
     Mr. HUSTON: I simply wanted to ask a question.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Ask your question, then.
     Mr. HUSTON: I want to ask whether, the House, as you stated, has absolutely refused to
      jointly investigate the Insane Asylum? If that is a fact I want to know it.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair will state what ought to be satisfactory to every
      intelligent man, that when the House sought to put upon foot an investigation, of charges that
      were made by a so-called civil-service commission during the last  campaign, independent of the action of the Senate, without asking
      the Senate to participate, ignoring the Senate, declining to ask the Senate or allow it to
      participate as one coordinate branch in an investigation they claimed ought to have been
      made--
     Mr. HUSTON [interposing]: What I want to know is, whether the House refused? I understood
      you to say the House refused to participate in a joint investigation.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: By all decent and honorable implication they have done so.
     Mr. BAILEY [interposing]: There was at the time this question--
     Mr. WEIR [interrupting]: I rise to a question of order.
     Mr. BAILEY: The Senator from Fayette was making an inquiry and I desire to give him
      information.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: State your information.
     Mr. BAILEY: At the time the question was before the House a concurrent resolution was
      offered, and an effort was made for a concurrent investigation, and that concurrent resolution
      was voted down, as a matter of fact.
     Mr. HUSTON: I didn't know that.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Even the chair didn't know that.--That strengthens the
      judgment of the chair on the proposition. I know it was the will of the majority in the House
      that nobody should participate in that investigation that belonged to this branch, and I
      believe--
     Mr. HUSTON addressed the Chair.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: I desire to state further, and the Senator may take the floor on
      any question he desires. At the time the Senator from Grant offered the resolution for a
      select committee the chair had no more information about it than a man who lives in Kentucky
      or Michigan. The chair had never suggested it, but always believing an investigation should be
      had, the chair took the floor and participated in that debate. At that time I never supposed
      any member of the standing committee had any objection to what was then proposed to the
      Senate. No proposition was made to strike out the select committee and put in the standing
      committee. There was no objection made by Republicans or Democrats on the floor concerning
      that matter. I never heard anybody on the standing committee complaining. The first I heard,
      was the Senator from Posey introducing a motion to reconsider the resolution. After that was
      done I stated to the Senator from Posey that motion ought not to be made and it ought to be
      withdrawn. Why? Simply because I regarded it as one of the steps to impede this investigation.
      I think the Senator didn't so intend it. Now the question is whether the Senate will
      accept the resignation of these distinguished gentlemen who occupy places upon the most
      important committee of this Senate? The chair thinks the Senate ought not to accept these
      resignations. Their grievances are petty; they do not rise to the dignity of these gentlemen;
      they are better men. The chair hopes they will withdraw their resignations; if not, that the
      Senate will reject them. As many as favor the motion to reject will say "aye;"
      contrary "no." The chair can't decide. Those favoring the motion will rise and
      remain standing till the chair counts. [SEVERAL SENATORS: "There is no division asked for."] 17 the chair counts. Those opposed
      will rise. The chair counts 9. The resignations are accepted.
    
    
     EXTRA EMPLOYEES.
     Mr. WEIR: I move that the Doorkeeper of the Senate furnish to the Senate a list of all
      persons employed under him, to enable the Senate to determine whether or not there are more
      persons employed than the business of the Senate reasonably requires.
     Mr. BAILEY: I call for the regular order.
     Mr. WEIR: I understand the motion I made to be a privileged motion.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair holds it is not a privileged motion. The regular order
      being called for, take up bills on third reading.
    
    
    
     BENEVOLENT INSTITUTIONS INVESTIGATION
     Mr. HUSTON: I move that the Special Committee appointed to investigate
      the Benevolent Institutions be increased by the appointment of two members, one from each
      side.--My purpose is this: Senator Sears, of the minority, is a member of the Prison
       Committee and is necessarily absent a considerable part of the time. It is the
      desire, and so expressed by members of all parties on that committee, that we should commence
      work at once. Mr. Sears is absent, and we feel we should meet at night and proceed with work.
      I trust the request will be granted.
     The motion was agreed to.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: I will appoint the Senators from Jackson (Mr. Branaman) and
      DeKalb (Mr. Drake).--On Committee on Reformatory and Benevolent Institutions:
       Chairman, Branaman; Griffiths, French and Drake, in place of Senators Rahm, Cox, Howard of
       Decatur, and Dresser, resigned.
     
    
    
     EPISODIC.
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion, offered the following:
     
      
       
        Resolved, That the bouquet on the desk of the President of the Senate be removed, as it
         is in a wilting condition and is therefore no longer complimentary to the President,
         because he never wilts.
       
      
     
     PRESIDENT pro tempore: The bouquet on the President's desk is presented to the Senator
      from Wayne (Mr. Johnson.)
     The Senate adjourned.
    
   
   
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
    
     WEDNESDAY, February 16, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Hon. E. B. Reynolds, representative from the county of
     Wayne.
    
     PRINTING OF SCHOOL BOOKS.
     The House took up the consideration of Mr. Pleasants's school text-book bill [H. R. 9],
      which provides for the publication of a series of school books under the direction of the
      State Board of Education. The majority of the committee recommended its indefinite
      postponement, and the minority reported an amendment to the bill.
     Mr. PLEASANTS: The principal obection to this bill is that the State Board of Education will
      not have time to do the work; but it gives to the State Board the privilege of buying from the
      author the right to use his work. It is also objected that there is a great many books now in
      use that will be useless; but this amendment provides that one subject shall be completed in
      one year, and one subject each year thereafter, so that the changes will be so gradual it will
      hardly be noticed. As to the bill generally: The present system of supply in text-books is
      very burdensome to the people. The prices are excessive. The relief proposed by this bill has
      been tried in two States of the Union. California adopted the system in 1885. The readers in
      California cost for the entire series 85 cts. They took the place of Appelton's series
      which cost $2.90. This a saving of ¾ on readers alone. In Minnesota I have a price list of the
      books of November 16, 1886. The total cost of the series of readers is $1.90. The cost of
      McGuffey's readers which are used in a great many counties in the State is $3.95. This is
      a saving of over one-half in readers alone. This bill will make a saving of at least one-half
      if it is adopted. Now it is said that the books will not be equal in quality. With the
      provision in this law defining what quality the books shall be, I do not think there will be
      any danger that the books will be of inferior quality. I was told by the State printer that he
      could take the contract and furnish as good books as are now furnished at one-half the cost of
      the books that are now used. Another advantage will be the uniformity. Under the present
      system when a man moves from one county to another, he finds that he will have to purchase
      entirely new books. Under this system the books will be good in any county where he will go. I
      think this is a question that merits the serious consideration of every man. It is one that
      strikes directly at the pockets of the people. I hope the minority report will be substituted
      for the majority report.
     
     Mr. SCOTT: Without these proposed amendments I would be opposed to the bill. It gives four
      options to the State Board of Education; and it gives four years in which to make the change.
      That strikes my fancy. So I say that I think the amendment obviates the most serious
      objections to the bill. For that reason I am in favor of the minority report.
     Mr. ROBERTS: Such a law will cut off the frequent changes of text-books. This has been one
      of the greatest evils extant in our public schools. And it would result in the cheapening of
      text-books, so the patrons of our public schools could obtain books at greatly reduced prices.
      I believe such a law as this will redound to the good of our public schools, and I think this
      bill ought to pass.
     Mr. WHITE: After all I feel that this is a matter that ought to be very seriously considered
      before it passed. The chief argument in favor of this bill is the fact that it will make the
      school books cheaper to the people, which is a very considerable consideration. But the same
      argument will be used for the taking charge of the Telegraph Companies, and taking charge of
      the railroads by government. My opinion is that no power should ever be vested in the hands of
      the government that is not absolutely necessary for the existence of the government. The
      question we meet is whether the remedy proposed by this bill will have the desired result in
      regard to the serious evil? I do not think it would be best for the whole people to be
      educated in the same way and from the same books, so that their intellectual developments
      would be the same. Again this would give an opportunity for the State Board of Education to
      take advantage of their power, and give a religious or politicial or any other color to a
      class of text-books. I shall support this minority report, but at this time I doubt the
      propriety of this bill becoming a law.
     Mr. PARKER: In the first place this would secure cheaper books. As I understand it the State
      Board of Education will have the right to get the best text-books that they can a command. We
      would then have the best set of books that can be secured. The uniformity of these text-books
      would make them a legal tender all over the State. No man would be continually put to the
      expense of purchasing a new set of books for his children when moving from one place to
      another. Another consideration: These books will be adopted for a number of years.
     Mr. BUCKLES: This bill is to create a public establishment--a manufactory. I want to say
      there is no earthly necessity for it, for the reason that we have a good series of school
      books now. It is said that we should pass this bill for the reason that we would have the same
      series for several years. We can do that now. If the State Board of Education has not now the
      power to say that one series of text-book shall be used all over the State give them the
      power. I have not heard a valid reason for incurring the expense authorized by this bill
      unless it is that the books would be cheaper. I believe when we have tried this plan a while
      we would find that our school books would cost twice as much as they do now. (His remarks were
      interrupted by--)
    
    
     A VISIT FROM THE G. A. R.
     Representatives Grose, Van Slyke and Buskirk [Escort Committee], appeared
      with members of the Grand Army of the Republic attending the yearly encampment, who were
      heretofore invited by resolution to visits the House, and now greeted with applause.
     Mr. GROSE introduced them to the; House.
     Gen. T. W. BENNETT [The Department Commander]: After briefly returning thanks for the
      invitation, read a memorial adopted by the encampment a few minutes before, praying for the
      passage of the bill appropriatinig $200,000 for the erection of A State Soldier's and
      Sailor's Monument.
    
    
    
     SOLDIER's MONUMENT.
     On Mr. GARDINER'S motion the rules were suspended, and his Soldeir's Monument bill
      [H. R. 1] was taken up, committee amendments concurred in, and the bill ordered engrossed. He
      also made an ineffectual motion--yeas 48, nays 25--to set aside the constitutional restriction
      in order to press the bill to the last reading and final vote now.
     Pending the roll call--
     Mr. COX, of Miami, said: I protest against what seems to be an attempt to bulldoze on the
      part of certain gentlemen in this House. I think this is wrong, but as I said I intend to vote
      for the bill. I vote "aye."
     Mr. LINCK said: We are not discussing this question as a matter of bulldozing, but as a
      matter of compliment to the soldiers I vote "aye."
     Mr. MAJOR said: There is no man willing to do more than I am for the men who went south and
      faced the bullets of the rebels, but in making an appropriation of $200,000 to build a
      monument we ought to go slow. I vote "no" on this question.
     Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Owen, said: I am in favor of this bill, but I think a measure of this
      character ought to have more investigation than it can have at this time, therefore I vote
      "no."
     Mr. NIBLACK, when his name was called, said: I have an instruction from the G. A. R. post in
      my town to vote against this bill in its present shape. I have been in favor of this bill in
      this shape or some other. I am paired with the gentleman from Tippecanoe (Mr. Osborn). or I
      would vote "no."
     Mr. NOLAN, in explanation of his vote, said: I am instructed to vote for a Soldier's
      Home, but since that resolution has been read, I will vote "aye."
     Mr. PIERCE said: I want to say that I stand here as a friend of the soldier's. No man
      thinks more of the soldiers than I do, and my vote to-day shall be in the direction of what is
      right and proper, and will be to the best interest of the soldier. I think the money should be
      expended in a place that would be of some benefit, to the widow who bends over the washtub,
      and to the orphans of the soldiers, for these reasons I vote against this bill, I vote
      "no."
     Mr. WEYAND, in explaining his vote, said: I am informed by members of the G. A. R. that this
      measure is not very popular. I believe the circumstances are such that gentlemen cannot act as
      they would in a more deliberate way under other circumstances, and while I believe that the
      widows and orphans are some of them in the poor houses of Indiana to-day, I must vote
      "no."
     Mr. WHITE, when called upon to vote, said: At the present time I shall vote against this
      bill, for I do not believe this is the proper way to enact legislation. I believe it would be
      more complimentary to the soldiers if this bill should be passed in the regular way, and for
      that reason I vote "no," on this question.
     Mr. JEWETT said: I am opposed to suspending the rule for two reasons, which I will give. In
      the first place the county that I have the honor to represent contains the only national
      cemetary in the State. It has been my purpose in the beginning of the session to obtain a
      modest amount, say $25,000 to mark the spot of the only burial place of the soldiers in the
      State. The effect of this bill will be to cut off all hope for an appropriation to mark those
      graves. I am opposed to the suspension of the rules for another reason: It is well known that
      the State is nearly bankrupted, and if this bill passes we would have to borrow the money, and
      pay interest on it. I believe we could in a better way attain this object. For these reasons I
      vote "no."
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the motion was lost--a two-third vote being required to suspend the constitutional
      restriction.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     PRINTING OF TEXT-BOOKS.
     Mr. BUCKLES (resuming his speech, interrupted by the G. A. R. visit), said: The bill before
      the House will not remedy the evils that  it is claimed
      it will. It proposes either to publish or to have published a series of school books for the
      people of Indiana. I concede there has some inconvience from the frequent changes of school
      books, but can you better that by manufacturing our own school books at the expense of the
      State? The State of Indiana, as a book publisher is hardly a success, from a pecuniary point
      of view. It is possible we may learn, before we get through with this, that it is a job set up
      on us so that some one may make some money out of it. I don't impugn the motives of the
      author of the bill, or those who have supported it. It has been said that two States in this
      Union are putting this into practice. California has just commenced, and has not got very far
      along with the work. Minnesota has got a little further along, but my information from
      Minnesota is that they are clamoring to-day for a repeal; some of the counties absolutely
      refuse to use the State series of school books. I submit that we had better wait, while these
      experiments are being tried by other States, and see if it is the thing we want to do. If we
      manufacture our own school books because it is to our interest to do it, may we not apply the
      same principle to all other articles used by the people? Why should we manufacture school
      books any more than plows and other things that are necessary? I take it that private
      enterprise is the best security we will have on the question. I think the interest of the
      people of the State of Indiana ought to be protected by defeating this bill.
     Mr. IBACH: I believe this a better time to defeat this bill than to wait till it has passed
      the engrossment and defeat it then. Is it possible that with the present system of normal
      schools, with the great attention that is paid to teachers institutes, that in this day and
      age the teachers of the State of Indiana are incompetent to teach by topic? Is it possible
      after all the instruction that has been given to the teachers in the normal schools, that they
      must come to the Legislature of the State and ask that a uniformity of text-books be adopted
      to assist them to teach topics? I am opposed to any system of uniformity of text-books in the
      public schools, because there is no necessity that a boy or girl in the common schools of this
      State should have the same geography, grammer, or arithmatic. I think it is time for the
      Legislature to express itself on the subject, I insist that the topics should be taught. It
      makes no difference in what book a pupil studies a topic, so he studies it. I ask gentlemen on
      this floor who attended schools in their young days to compare your education with the boys
      and girls that are springing up all around us, and I believe the decision will be in favor of
      the education of the former days; therefore I am opposed to this bill, and will vote against
      it.
     Mr. JEWETT: This bill is in my opinion by no means a perfect measure. Few laws when first
      enacted are perfect. It will be enough if this general assembly shall become the pioneer in
      this line. To my mind there is no more important question before this House than this very
      question of furnishing the people of this State with a uniform series of school books, and
      their use enforced by the authorities of the State, and furnished to the scholars at cost. The
      school system of Indiana is a thing whih we all love, but it contains many imperfections, and
      many thousands of dollars of the school fund are used in foolish branches of learning. In the
      city where I live is a high school system, a system that does not bring an advantage to the
      people commensurate its cost. Uniformity in text-books is the policy of the State, and it is
      impossible now to secure a departure from that system. I believe that a uniform system of
      text-books is highly desirable. I think this is as good a bill as I could draw, or as any
      other gentleman in this house could draw. And I believe if it is passed into a law it will go
      a great way toward remedying the evils which now exist. There are but two considerations that
      influence me to  to support this bill, and one is, and
      the principle one, the cost of school books to the people of the State. The other is to
      relieve our present system from the corruption and bribery which has grown up under it. I
      believe if you will go into any county in this State where the people now suffer from the
      over-issue of township warrants and the other disgraceful operations of school trustees, you
      will find the township trustees have been corrupted by wholesale through the bribery of school
      book agents. But to pass on to the great argument, cheapness of the books. I believe there is
      in Indiana school children to the number of about half a million. I say when we think that
      even if a dollar in the whole school year is extorted from the parents of each child the
      amount of extortion is perfectly appalling,--half a million dollars a year. The people are
      robbed under the guise and by the authority of the law, because through the operation of the
      law the people are compelled to use these books at the publisher's prices. It is the
      meanest steal in the world, because it goes not only into houses of the rich, but into every
      humble house in this State. I cannot imagine any stronger appeal that can come to a father or
      mother's heart than the appeal that comes to buy school books like the other children
      have, to put them upon an equal footing with the others in the school. I need no further
      argument to convince me that it will at least alleviate the evil, than the great swarm of men
      and women who traverse this State from one year to another, in the pay of these publishers. It
      shows that the prices of these books are excessive.
     He declared that in California and Minnesota, where this system was in vogue, school books
      were to be had at about half the prices here. Everywhere he had gone during the campaign this
      question of selling school books at cost had met with a ready response. He read a memoranda
      placed in his hand saying that a practical printer could produce the text-books at 65 per cent
      of their present cost.
     Mr. LINOK: I am in favor of this minority report. Not that I have any objection to the other
      bills that have been introduced, but I think we are more likely to secure the passage of the
      bill referred to in the minority report. The people of this State are demanding this thing;
      and I desire to say that the people in my county want a bill such as this. At every voting
      precinct and at every township center they said to me, "If your go up to that Legislature
      we want you to provide us cheaper school books."
     Mr. GOUGH: There are two objects that we desire to obtain in this State and I believe they
      are worthy objects. One is that we may obtain uniform school books all over State; the other,
      that we should get them cheaper. No argument, of course, is necessary on the score of
      cheapness. The only question is how we shall obtain these two objects.--How shall we go about
      it to secure cheapness? We must do away with the middle men who get such a large profit. We
      must buy the books for the entire State. Our State Superintendent shouild simply advertise for
      bids for books to be used throughout the State. Let the State Board of Education determine
      what books shall be used, and let the Township Trustee distribute the book. It seems to me
      that this is a feasible plan. It does not require the appropriation of $70,000, nor any part
      of that sum. I think the laws should be simple, and that we should try to obtain the end in
      the simplest possible manner. I believe this bill creates unnecessary machinery.
     Mr. COX, of Miami: I know the people of my town are heartily in favor of a measure of that
      kind, as a number of men came to me and asked me to vote for a bill like this.--They are not
      rich men, they are men who work in factories and many who are working at six, seven and eight
      dollars a week and do not have the money necessary to provide text books that are required of
      them.--These are the men that are demanding a law like this. The rich do not need it. I do not
      think that any man should stand on this floor and talk
      about expense, for if there is anything that the people of this State believe in, it is in
      spending money to make education cheap. Money could not be spent for a better purpose--Because
      we cannot protect ourselves except by passing this bill I believe it is the only thing that
      will give relief.
     Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Owen:--While there are some features in the bill that I do not favor yet
      I believe the people demand some such legislation, and as I do not believe that we can get
      anything better than we can get in this bill, I am in favor of the minority report. I thing it
      is time for us to make a small appropriation and assist the children of Indiana to secure
      their school books.
     He demanded the previous question.
     The House seconded the demand for the previous question, and under its operations the
      minority was substituted for the majority report by yeas 58, nays 19,
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. ACKMAN said: Believing as I do that a law something like this would correct a great evil
      and relieve the children of a great incumbrance, I vote "aye."
     Mr. BARNES said: The reason why I vote as I do is that in every township in my county I have
      been asked to vote for a measure of this kind; and because the present system is robbing the
      people of Indiana, especially the poor class, and I know that the poor classes are those that
      are going from one town to another and have to buy the school books, therefore I vote
      "aye."
     Mr. DAVIS said: Believing as I do that there should be a reform in the present prices which
      are paid for school books; but I do not believe that this bill will exactly meet that reform;
      and not believing it is a wise investment for the State to engage in a manufacturing business,
      I vote "no."
     Mr. FOLEY, when his name was called, said: I am in favor of the minority report for I
      believe it would be quite a saving for the people of the State. I vote "aye."
     Mr. REYNOLDS said: I believe in uniformity of text books, but I do not believe in the State
      engaging in the business of publishing books; and believing there is a bill now pending in
      this House by which we can have uniformity of text books without the State publishing them, I
      vote "no."
     The result was announced as above.
     So the minority was substituted for the majority report, and the report, as amended, was
      concurred in.
     On motion by Mr. VAN SLYKE, the bill was further amended by adding a proviso that school
      books shall be supplied to families aided by the township.
     The was ordered engrossed.
    
    
     ASYLUM FOR FEEBLE-MINDED.
     Mr. DICKERSON moved to reconsider the vote of last evening recommitting the bill [S. 108] to establish an Asylum for feeble-minded children;
      with instructions for a commission to secure a location.
     Mr. ROBERTS: My one idea in supporting this bill is to promote the greatest amount of good
      to those unfortunate children. It may not be as perfect in all its parts as it could be, but I
      do abhor the idea that the State should peddle out its charities. It is discreditable to the
      State. I believe that these institutions should be held above all such considerations. Let us
      keep these institutions where they properly belong. They are the jewels in our crown as a
      commonwealth. I do not believe that the Knightstown location will be cheaper than the one at
      Fort Wayne. I believe, concerning the Morrison property, that there will be more money
      appropriated two years from now to improve that property than it is proposed to spend at Fort
      Wayne.
     Mr. VAN SLYKE: I hope their action may be reconsidered, for as it stands now these children
      have not a shingle over their heads. We have already determined that they should not be
      located at Knightstown. We have not located them anywhere as yet, and in fact they are
      standing  homeless and houseless to-day. I believe that
      the motion of the gentleman from Jefferson [Mr. 
       Linck
       Link
      ] is impractical. Before a commission can go all over this State and receive bids
      from the various places that will ask for the home, and submit a bill to House, and send it to
      the Senate its adoption, this Legislature will come to a close, and these children will be out
      of a home, which will cause every member upon this floor to blush with shame. I am not in
      favor of Fort Wayne, Kokomo or any other particular spot or place, but I am in favor of a
      place where they can be the most happily located, and where they can be the most happily
      surrounded, and I am in favor of removing them as far as we can from the Orphan's Home at
      Knightstown; that great big barn; a brick building which is intended as a dwelling. The
      building itself is impractical. We have said we did not want it, and we won't have it. If
      there is any class of people on God's green earth that ask for prayers and our help, it
      is the unfortunate class.
     Mr. REYNOLDS: I have listened with a good deal of interest and instruction to this debate,
      commencing yesterday afternoon. I can conceive of no immorality in the State accepting aid of
      this kind if it can be received honorably and legitimately. If there is a place in the State
      of Indiana that will furnish ample accommodations for taking care of these unfortunate
      imbecile children I am in favor of accepting that place, other things being equal. I do not
      believe, as representatives of the people of the State of Indiana, that we do our duty when we
      refuse to create this commission, simply to accommodate one city in the extreme north-eastern
      part of the State, where I do not believe a home of this kind ought to be located at all.
     Mr. LINOK: It seems to me as though it would be proper for a commission to be appointed
      without any politics. I am glad to hear the gentleman resent the idea that there was any
      politics in regard to this bill. I did not believe it was, yet I rather thought it was a
      reflection upon the Democratic Senators. I do not believe it should rest simply upon the
      statements of those interested. We have a statement of the gentleman from Ft. Wayne (Mr.
      Shambaugh) that it is a good place, but he is not a disinterested man. The commission can go
      there and see the locality Ft. Wayne ofers. They can go also to Kokomo and Madison, and
      perhaps they will be in favor of Ft. Wayne.
     Mr. JEWETT: I regard this as a question of good faith among the members of the House and
      Senate in this General Assembly. While I charge no gentleman with bad faith, it is an
      implication of bad faith on the part of the members of this House if we do not loeate this
      institution at Ft. Wayne. Ft. Wayne gave up its claim for the Orphan's Home in
      consideration that it had been agreed that as a building had to be built, Ft. Wayne should be
      selected.
     Mr. GROSE didn't think that it was any disrespect to the State to ask for donations. In
      the selection of sites for the new Insane Hospitals, Richmond and Logansport had out-stripped
      Evansville in liberality. He was in favor of the Knightstown plan, as that proposed to give
      the children an immediate home, while the other was uncertain.
     Mr. GORDON demanded the previous question. The demand was seconded; and under its operations
      the motion to reconsider was agreed to by yeas 42, nays 26.
     Pending the roll call--
     Mr. HARRELL [Explaining his vote]: I am of the opinion that this institution ought to be
      located in some central portion of the State of Indiana. I do not believe that this
      institution should be put in the south-east corner, where I reside, but in some spot where it
      would be handy. I vote 'aye.'
     Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Owen, when called upon to vote, said: Yesterday afternoon I voted for the
      motion because I thought the commission would be the proper thing. I think now that this may
      defeat legislation, I therefore vote "aye."
     
     Mr. NIBLACK, when his name was called, said: I live in a town that would like to have had a
      chance to bid for this institution, and if it goes to a committee I should have my town bid.
      But I think that no bill will pass this General Assembly unless this one will. I vote
      "aye."
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the motion to reconsider prevailed.
     On motion by Mr. GORDON the motion to recommit was laid on the table.
     The bill was amended and ordered to the third reading.
    
    
     A NEW PROPOSITIION.
     Mr. Niblack introduced a bill [H. R. 417] to create an Appellate Court.
     The House adjourned.
    
   
   
   
    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    IN SENATE.
    
     THURSDAY, February 17, 1887.

     There being no quorum present--
     The PRESIDENT pro. tem. directed the reading of House bills the first time by title
      only.
     This was pursued until the files were cleared.
     On a second reading of Senate bills--
     
       Mr.
       Wr.
       WEIR insisted that it was not fair to order these bills engrossed in the absence of
      a quorum, because after en-  grossed they are not subject
      to an amendment. Important measures should not be placed beyond amendment in the absence of a
      quorum.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     Mr. WEIR called attention to the fact that no quorum was present.
    
    
     WOMAN'S RIGHTS.
     Mr. DRESSER'S bill [S. 16] authorizing married women to make contracts and to hold
      themselves responsible for all debts so contracted was reported favorably by the majority of
      the committee on the Judiciary. There was also a minority report recommending indefinite
      postponement.
     Mr. SELLERS: I understand the purpose of this bill is to remove every restriction on the
      rights of married women to make contracts of all kinds. The only 
       restriction
       restrictihn
       remaining will be they shall not be able to convey real estate unless the husband
      joins.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: The sooner we come to acknowledge the fact that public sentiment is that woman
      is the equal of man in every respect, the sooner she will learn to take care of herself and
      her property. It is better to pass a law to remove these obstacles, and I believe there will
      be less liability of her losing her property.
     Mr. JOHNSON: The majority report ought to be accepted, and this bill ought to pass. I have
      no disposition to rehash what I discussed yesterday on a question somewhat similar to this.
      That is a great system of public education which teaches people to rely upon themselves. So
      long as you teach them to look to the law for protection they will be apt to rely upon the law
      and not upon themselves. I believe in legislation to still further enlarge the rights of
      married women, and put them upon a legal equality with man. The best way is to teach them to
      stand alone. Let every woman feel that when she owns property it is hers, and she can make
      such use as she pleases of it. When we pass this bill into a law I think the results will show
      that the Legislation was in the right direction.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I am glad to be able to say that Indiana was one of the first States in this
      Union to give to married women a title to real estate;--that was some 35 or 40 years ago,--and
      that was the beginning of more liberal, more sensible more just, equitable and upright
      Legislation. There are women, and I believe there are a majority of them, can take care of
      their property as well as their husbands can. I know one woman who can take care of her
      man's property better than he can take care of it himself. This bill sweeps away the last
      vestigate of the old law, and I sincerely hope the Legislature will take the proper steps to
      wipe it out.
     Mr. SMITH, of Wells: It seems to me the present law works admirably in all cases. Place a
      woman upon her own resources and she can take care of her property as well as any man. I
      don't believe there are many ladies who want this law repealed; I have not heard of any.
      Let us use protection; and why? This is one of the best educators I 
       know
       now
       of. Give them some protection until they can take care of themselves.
     Mr. LOGSDON: The law declares that all contracts entered into with persons who have not
      arrived at the age of 21 years, are void. I apprehend, sir, the reason the law so declares
      that person who have not arrived at the age of 21 years have not had sufficient experience in
      the business transactions of life to protect their own interests. I claim, for the same
      reason, the law as it now exists protect the interests of married women. I do not believe, Mr.
      President, that from the stand-point of natural intellect and ability, women are inferior to
      men, I believe that because of their position life they have not had sufficient experience to
      properly look after and care for their own interests; in other words, they can be more easiliy
      imposed upon than men whose walks in life bring them in contact with the different phases of
      business transactions. The law as it stands is a protection to this class of people. I believe
      this law should remain as it is, not as abridging the rights of women, but, as a matter of
      fact, protecting their rights and interests.
     Mr. WINTER: The only argument that can be made in support of maintaining this restriction is
      that the husband of a woman, instead of being her best friend and counsellor and adviser, is
      her enemy; and she is to be protected against her husband. If there is any argument in that it
      is an argument for abolishing marriage. In 99 cases out of 1,000, the husband of a woman
      instead of being her ill-adviser is her best friend and protector. When you say to married
      women they must exercise their own g judgment and protect themselves, that is  the way to educate married women--you hold out an inducement for
      them to be reliant and help themselves. That is what we need, not to build up a class to be
      protected against their own acts. I hope the majority report will be concurred in and this
      bill become a law.
     Mr. THARP: I am opposed to this bill. What is proposed here is contrary to the modern idea.
      The laws upon the subject of marital relations and husband and wife should remain as they are
      now. This bill is defective and should not pass.
     Mr. SELLERS made an ineffectual motion to substitute the minority for the majority
      report--yeas 17, nays 18.
     The Senate also refused to concur in the majority report by yeas 18, nays 19.
     Mr. SELLERS made an ineffectual motion to indefinitely postpone the bill--yeas 17, nays
      20--as follows:
     
      
       
        YEAS. Bailey, Branaman, Cox, Duncan of Brown, French, Griffith, Hale, Howard of Decatur,
         Logsdon, McClure, Sellers, Shively, Smith of Wells, Tharp, Urmston, Weir, Mr. President

     FOREIGN INSURANCE COMPANIES.
     The bill [H. R. 226] to prevent insurance companies from pooling, was reported back with a
      majority report favoring its passage, and a minority report recommending its indefinite
      postponement.
     Mr. GORDON: The object of this bill is to prevent the local agents of insurance companies
      from combining in order to control the rates of insurance. These agents fix the rates at which
      they will insure property, and no person can secure anything less than the rate fixed by this
      pool.--They even go farther, and even so far as to fix the policy fee, and no agent is allowed
      to throw off that fee.--They sometimes go farther than that and appoint a stamping secretary
      and receive his stamp. It becomes nothing less than a combination, and there can be no such
      thing as competition among the agents. There is no objection to this bill, but that the
      Insurance Companies will combine out of the State and and fix the rates,--that they would form
      a national board. I do not believe that a national board will be maintained. There might be
      one established but it would not be maintained .If we prevent the local boards from combining
      the national board will not combine.
     Mr. MAJOR: My only interest in this is to get insurance as cheap as possible. This bill
      provides that the local boards, containing all our friends and neighbors, the local agents,
      shall not, as they do now, pool together and fix the rates in their own town. If we enact this
      bill, it will not be our friends that will fix the rates but it will be corporations,--the
      managers and owners of the Insurance Companies,--that will fix the rates. Our local boards are
      interested in local interests and desirous of making the rates as low as possible, so that
      they may have as much business as possible. I move to recommit the matter to the Committee on
      Insurance.
     On motion by Mr. GORDON, this motion was laid on the table, the majority report concurred in
      and the bill ordered engrossed.
    
    
     TOWNSHIP TRUSTEES, ETC.
     The Special Committee thereon returned the bills [H. R. 44, 100 and 297] relating to
      Township Trustees, with a majority report proposing amendments to the bill H. R. 100, and a
      minority report with amendments to the bill H. R. 44.
     Mr. GORDON: I believe the minority report ought to be adopted for many reasons. This makes
      only one additional township trustee. It will not increase the township expenses. It simply
      divides the duties now performed by two officers and has it  done by three. It may be said that these meetings of the board,
      sixty in number each year, would cost too much. It would cost six dollars a day for these
      meetings, but that does not compare in expense to the provisions in the bill [H. R. 100] of
      the gentleman from Daviess (Mr. Gardiner), that the trustee shall make a list of everything
      that he requires and go to the county seat to file the statement of what he wants, and many
      other duties. I believe it is better to have a board of three trustees than to have one man,
      and I believe it would be a matter of economy.
     Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Owen: I am opposed to the minority report on this bill for several
      reasons. One of them I desire to state. I believe that nine-tenths of the people in my county
      are opposed to it. They were opposed to the road superintendent, and this mnority report makes
      an officer something like the road superintendent. I believe that some legislation is demanded
      by the people of the State on this question, but I believe the bill introduced by the
      gentlemen from Daviess [Mr. Gardiner--H. R. 100] fully covers all that is required by the
      people. The experience of the past two years has taught us that some restrictions should be
      thrown around the township trustee. I am opposed to the principle of three trustees. I think
      we ought to have one trustee, and have that officer restricted. I am in favor of the majority
      report.
     Mr. GOUGH: I think there is one vital objection to this bill, and that is that it increases
      the number of officers. I think the people of this State are opposed to making an increase in
      the number of officers. The main feature of the bill introduced by the gentleman from Daviess
      is that it requires the township trustee three months before he makes his purchases, to file a
      statement. The people then may know what they all cost and what they will have to pay for it.
      Is that not reasonable? Is that not fair? The cost of giving this notice cannot be much. For
      this reason I think the bill ought to be made a law if any change whatever is made.
     Mr. FOLEY thought that a Board of Trustees would have been a little more discreet than one
      man.
     Mr. GROVES believed that the people of the State were opposed to any increase in the number
      of township trustees. He moved that the further consideration of the bills be indefinitely 
       postponed
       postpone
      .
     Mr. JEWETT demanded a division.
     The bill H. R. 44 was indefinitely postponed by yeas 50, nays 20, as was also the bill H. R.
      297 by yeas 47, nays 24.
     The House refused to indefinitely postpone the bill H. R. 100 by yeas 35, nays 35.
     On motion by Mr. GARDINER, the report on his bill H. R. 100 was concurred in by yeas 46,
      nays 25, and the bill was ordered engrossed
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     THE MILITIA.
     The bill [H. R. 264] to amend the Militia law, was taken up, with a favorable comimittee
      report--the question being on Mr. Schley's motion for indefinite postponement.
     Mr. NOLIN: We have an adjutant with a salary of $1,200 a year. The State also provides that
      he shall be allowed $600 for his clerk. There are already in the State forty-two companies:
      this bill proposes to reduce that to thirty-six. Now what we ask is that there be $37,000
      appropriated to maintain the millitia. If this is not appropriated we must disband. We can
      show where every cent of money goes to that we ask for. I move that the motion made by the
      gentleman from Marion (Mr. Schley) do lie on the table.
     This motion was agreed to.
     Mr. GOUGH: I trust this report will not be concurred in. The bill proposes to appropriate
      $37,000 from a treasury that is kept continually borrowing. I do not think Indiana is ready to
      appropriate that amount, simply to uniform a number of young men in the State who desire to
      drill. What is the use of a uniform? They can drill without uniforms. Of course,  it makes the boys a little proud to dress them in red or blue. If
      the boys want this fun let them pay for it themselves. We have no use for a military
      organization now. I trust this measure will not be adopted by this body,--it is bad
      policy.
     Mr. LINCK: Were you ne'er a soldier, and did you never train?
     Mr. GOUGH: Yes, but I didn't ask the Senate to payme a cent for it.
     Mr. IBACH: I am surprised that any gentleman should oppose the meager appropriation asked
      for a purpose that ought to be of interest to us all. A State Militia has its advantages, and
      we ought to encourage the boys in preparing themselves for future usefulness. The idea that
      the great State of Indiana shall say that the meager sum of $37,000 shall not be appropriated
      to assist in equipping her militia! The young men are asking us to make this appropriation and
      I trust that by extending to them the helping hand they will grow up and make better men than
      we are.
     Mr. PLEASANTS: I do not believe the people generally care about that tax being placed on
      them. Another objection is that it limits the number of companies to thirty-six. There are
      already forty-two and that will reduce the number of companies. We cannot establish any new
      companies. It is a bill in the interest of a few and not for the benefit of the State
      generally.
     Mr. GRIFFITHS: I do sincerely hope that the appropriation asked for in this bill will be
      allowed. In looking over the list of appropriations in other States I findthat the little
      State of Rhode Island puts the State of Indiana to shame in this matter. Illinois appropriates
      $150,000; Michigan $57,000; California $67,000; New York $350,000; the Southern State of
      Louisiana $275,000; Mississippi $150,000, and New Hampshire $25,000. It does seem to me that
      there should be an appropriation made. I say that if the amount asked for is not granted, and
      these companies disband, that amount and ten times that amount may be destroyed in a single
      day.--The $37,000 proposed to be appropriated is entirely acounted for in the statement which
      has been made by the author of the bill. I have been told that the Knights of Labor are
      opposed to this bill. I believe as an organization they are not opposed to it. I do not
      believe they want to see lives and property destroyed. The militia is not the same as the
      regular army, they are taken from the body the people,--they touch elbows with us when we walk
      the streets.--We are living in perilous times, and while there is no war now, we cannot tell
      when the emergency will come. I say I am in favor of this bill because while I do not believe
      in any very large militia, but, for the great State of Indiana is two thousand a large number
      of men?
     Mr. GROSE: I do not suppose there is anybody here that would pretend to say we should
      discourage or abolish the culture of arms or that we should close the institution at West
      Point. The little nucleus of an army we have may perhaps save millions and millions of
      property, and many lives. Suppose we have a mob in one of our cities, how are we to put it
      down? We cannot call in for the occasion anybody but a similar mob, unless we have a trained
      company of men who are ready to protect lives and property. When that mob hear that little
      company is coming they will get out of the way.--There is another consideration that enters
      into this thing. It teaches these young men to look up to the stars and stripes under which
      they walk; it teaches them to obey the Constitution; it teaches them to love the old flag; it
      teaches them that peace and quiet shall reign. For these, if for no other reasons, I would
      vote for this bill. We have at least two thousand young men banded together in this State, who
      will nobly stand for their country. Leet me say in this House that in the hands of these young
      men is the destiny of the State of Indiana and of the United States. The power is in their
      hands to make and unmake. I hope to see no young man in this House misrepresent the people in
      his county. Take  a vote to-day and the people will say
      "Give us the appropriation necessary to keep these young men together."
     Mr. ROBERTS: I have utterly failed to hear any substantial reason why this bill should pass.
      Gentlemen imagine that some great emergency may come. I don't believe it ever will. They
      imagine some great violation of law; but I do not believe it will ever be so great that the
      sheriff and other officers of the law will not be able to put it down. I have never known the
      occasion when the people of the State of Indiana were not equal to the emergency. Tell me what
      aroused the patriotism of the people when Fort Sumpter was fired on? Who was it responded to
      the call? It was these men in the fields; in red hunting-shirts, and men from the workshops.
      They had no drill, yet their patriotism determined that the rebellion should be put down.
     Mr. GROSE [interupting]: Fifty companies of drilled men are worth five fifties that are not
      drilled. That was the reason the South whipped us so bad at first. Their men were trained, and
      they even boasted that one of their men could whip three of our poor boys who were not
      drilled.
     Mr. ROBERTS: The gentleman from Fayette and Henry (Mr. Grose) seems to forget that we have
      between 40,000 and 50,000 men who belonged to the army--the best drilled troops in America. It
      is intended that we shall vote this appropriation, and when the next General Assembly meets
      they will say "As we are about the eighth State in population why does not Indiana rank
      with Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York and other States?" If this kind of work keeps up our
      debt will be what it was a few years ago. Gentlemen should remember that just in proportion as
      we pay the debt and decrease the taxes we get to be one of the solid States of the Union, and
      the time will the sooner come when capital and prosperity will increase in our borders.
     Mr. LINCK: The Judge introduced one idea that I wish to comment on. He spoke about the
      people coming from the workshops and plow, and what good soldiers they made. The South whipped
      us for two years, just because they had men who were trained. They did it because the South
      was full of military schools.--They went against our poor boys who had come from the farm and
      the shop, and it was like a great big farmer fighting a light-weight pugilist. The little
      pugilist could knock the big farmer out in the first round. They were better trained, while
      the North was not prepared. I think we ought to be prepared. We were not prepared and that war
      cost us millions and millions of dollars more than it otherwise wouild had we trained men. I
      say we need this militia, and the few thoussands of dollars that we now appropriate would be
      nothing to what might be destroyed if we were unprepared in case of trouble. Therefore, I
      shall support this bill.
     Mr. CAVEN presented a communication from the Legislative Committee of District 106, Knights
      of Labor, earnestly opposing "any laws looking to the aid or encouragement of any State
      militia."
     Mr. VAN SLYKE: I am surprised that any man, whatever may have been his schooling, whatever
      may have been his surroundings, would oppose a bill of this character and nature. This bill
      calls for the mere pittance of less than a half a cent on the valuation on the hundred
      dollars. It asks for the pittance of $37,000. I want to call attention to one or two things
      that perhaps have not been referred to. If this bill fails to pass the militia will be
      disbanded. They will go to their homes, and they will say to the great State of Indiana when
      she gets into a pinch, "help yourself if you can." In case of any such
      possibilities, and they are more than possibilities, they are current probabilities, and
      occurring all around us in adjoining States, you wlll have to use undrilled men, with no
      knowledge of arms, and the fact of it is that you have no advantage of a mob. We have in this
      country of ours a class of communists, another known as socialists, in fact I may say they are
      known as nihilists, and on Sun-  days and other days in
      this country of ours they go swinging their red flags and defying God, devil and man. I say to
      you I am in favor of this militia bill. [He demanded the previous question.]
     The House refused to order the main question by yeas 20, nays 52. Pending the
      roll-call--
     Mr. ACKMAN said: Believing that this measure is a very important one, and knowing as I do
      that there are a number of gentlemen on both sides of this hall who want to speak, I vote
      "no."
     Mr. REYNOLDS, when called upon to vote, said: Believing in the right of free discussion, and
      not at all favorable to a gentleman making a speech, and then moving the precious question to
      prevent anybody else saying anything, I vote "no."
     Mr. VAN SLYKE, when his name was called, said: After I made the motion some gentlemen from
      the left wanted me to withdraw it and I offered to do so; then they said "no." Now I
      stand by my text and vote "aye."
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the main question was not ordered.
     Mr GLOVER: It is not because the Knights of Labor are opposed to our Military Organization
      that shall influence me in my stand in regard to this bill. I claim, if I can state it a right
      so I can be understood, that there is a wrong impression about it, and calculated to do harm.
      I believe there is no organization that is more calculated to keep us from these dangers, as
      this organization of the Knights of Labor, or the labor organization in general. If there is a
      certain class of people in this country that would on certain occasions break out and destroy
      life; when we get these people in this organization we talk to them and lead them on and get
      them away from the things and persons that would make trouble. This is why I am in that
      organization, and working for it. If I have a duty to perform, here it is, to exhort every man
      on this floor to give a helping hand to the organizations of the laboring man in this country.
      I think we have at the head of this organization one of the greatest men of our country, and I
      do not think that a man on this floor will differ with me when I refer to Mr. Powderly. The
      reason a great many people in the country are afraid of the laboring people is because they
      have been so terribly oppressed. That is where the trouble is coming from. I have been waiting
      to see some one from these monopolists have the manhood to come out and say we have been too
      hard on these poor men; we have been putting the screws down too hard on these men; and I
      propose we now let up a little. They do not propose to do that, but they stand in solid ranks
      to-day. They are opposing our organization, and if we make a defense they will have the
      Militia of the State on their side. But we are not going to bring things to that pass. We are
      going to be represented on the floor of the Legislature as other interests are represented.
      Whether I shall vote for this bill or not does not depend on my being a Knight of Labor. I
      shall consider whether the people of Indiana want this expense or not; or whether there is any
      necessity for it or not.
     Mr. KELLEY, of Boone: I hold in my hand a petition of half the population of my county, and
      I want to say that I except to vote for that bill. The majority of the people whom I represent
      are laboring men; and I am going to vote according to their request.
     Mr. BEASLEY: I am opposed to this bill for several reasons. We have heard that we should
      support this bill because it is a cheap one. I have made it a rule all my life not to buy any
      article because it is cheap. If this is necessary I do not think we should quibble over a few
      thousand dollars. If all the people have patriotism there is no demand for a State Militia. I
      believe that the sense of patriotism in the hearts of the people will furnish the men when
      they are needed. I believe it is poor policy for Indiana to ape that system of militia that is
      kept up in all the old powers of Europe. I believe the history of this State will bear me out
      in saying that  there has never been a mob but what the
      police force was sufficient, and I believe there never will be a time in the history of this
      State when the ordinary police force and the sheriff will not be able to cope with these
      things.
     Mr. REYNOLDS: I want to say that I was astounded at the speech of my friend from Jefferson
      [Mr. Linck]. The distinguished gentleman stated the astonishing proposition to this House, and
      gave as a reason why we should support this bill, that the first two years of the last war the
      rebels whipped us at all points. I say to you with the exception of the first Bull Run fight
      for the first 12 or 15 months the Northern men were supierior to the Southern men. Is it
      necessary in order to make us successful that we shall appropriate money to create a standing
      army? Shall we do it? That is the question for you and I to determine as intelligent men.
     Mr. BUSKIRK: I support this bill for the reason that less than twelve months ago I saw the
      necessity and realized the necessity for the militia. I was called to Martin Co. as an
      attorney, and there was a large mob there. It became evident that that mob had to be
      controlled by some means, and the Governor sent fifty militia boys from this city, and by
      their presence they saved property and lives. The company (the Richardson Zouaves] came there,
      and they behaved themselves like gentlemen, and overawed the mob; and these facts and others
      which I will not take time now to mention, warrant me in supporting this bill.
     Mr. THOMPSON: There has been a good deal said, upon this question on account of the expense.
      We have a bill to appropriate $37,000. I represent a county that has three of these companies.
      While we are making appropriations for the judiciary, and all the other constitutional
      requirements, it is time to-day to make provision for this which is also provided for in the
      constitution. The question as to the necessity of these things, every man can judge for
      himself, but as these companies are now organized, and are asking for this I am willing to
      give it to them.
     Mr. BROWN demanded the previous question.
     The House seconded the demand, and under its operations the committee report recommending
      the passage of the bill was concurred in by yeas 47, nays 21.
     The bill was ordered engrossed.
     The House adjourned.

     SOLDIER'S MONUMENT.
     Mr. Andrews bill [S. 3] for the erection of a State
      Soldiers' and Sailors Monument, came up on a pending motion [See page 425] to refer the
      bill back to a commnittee with instructions to report on the expediency of erecting a
      Soldier's and Sailor's Home instead of a monument.
     Mr. MCDONALD said: This bill is almost an identical copy of the act
      authorizing the construction of the State House. At the late annual meeting of the Grand Army
      of the Republic it was declared to be the desire on the part of that association to have
      either a memorial hall with a spire or a monument erected in the Circle Park in the center of
      this goodly city, so that persons passing through may pass under the structure. I hope no one
      will vote against this bill because it proposes a large expenditure of money. There are about
      18,000 of the boys in the membership of the G. A. R. now--a great many of whom went out as
      privates. When they came home they were taxed to pay for soldier's bounties. They walked
      up and paid them after serving three or four years in the army. Is there any injustice or any
      wrong in the soldiers who went out and did their duty in the field asking that the people of
      this great State shall pay for the monument? Both political parties have demanded that it
      shall be built, and are on record in favor of it. No more rights are claimed than those
      granted to any other class of citizens. Whent the soldiers went forth to fight they did their
      duty, while other men staid at home to take care of their families. The soldiers do not ask
      this great State to come to their relief. They ask her to grant their humble request and do
      justice to the boys that sleep the sleep which knows no waking. This request is made as a
      mattter of right to fallen comrades, who cannot be here to ask it for themselves. Is it asking
      too much to urge this as an act of simple justice to those who went forth, leaving their
      fathers and mothers, their wives, and their children, never to return? I hope this Senate, of
      which I am proud to be a member, in the glorious edifice erected by the people of this grand
      State, will vote unanimously for the bill.
     Mr. BAIlEY: When this bill was up a few days ago I offered an amendment to the motion of the
      Senator from White. I have talked to a large number of soldiers who were present at the annual
      encampment the other day, and I rise for the purpose of withdrawing my amendment. A memorial
      presented to the Senate says a Memorial Hall, but the bill says only a Monument.
     
     Mr. MCDONALD: The boys prefer, by about 4-5ths, that it shall be a
      Memorial Hall and Monument combined.
     Mr. MARSHALL: We find that there were 208,000 soldiers left the State of Indiana from 1860
      to 1865. The proposition is to appropriate $200,000 for the erection of a monument which is
      about one dollar apiece to those men. We find there were about 24,000 who died on the field of
      battle, and if we do this to the memory of those who died, it is about eight dollars to each
      of them. Now the question is for the great loyal State of Indiana--a State which feels as
      proud of her veterans as any State in this Union,--is it consistent, is it right, to go ahead
      and appropriate the sum of eight dollars apiece to the memory of those men who died that we
      might have a Nation? It is not a question of a shaft to soldiers living, for they have built
      their monument; but do you think the men who died are worthy a rememberance of eight dollars
      apiece? Is it surprising that the soldier's living should ask that? I believe the people
      without respect to political parties have that much respect for the memory of these soldiers.
      Monuments have been erected in cemeteries; that is a proper tribute; but inasmuch as our dead
      soldiers are scattered in Southern States there should be at least one monument erected in
      this city that others may look upon and remember it is erected in memory of those who fell in
      defense of this grand country of ours.
     Mr. JOHNSON moved to add an additional section authorizing the erection of a Memorial Hall,
      or Memorial Hall and Monument combined, at the discretion of the commissioners.
     The motion was agreed to.
     On motion by Mr. 
       WEIR
       WIER
       the constitutional restriction was dispensed with, the bill considered as engrossed,
      and finally passed the Senate by yeas 45, nays 0.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: Senator Rahm requested me to say that he was compelled to leave, but if here
      would vote for the passage of the bill.
     Mr. MCDONALD: I move it so be recorded.
     The PRESIDENT, pro tem.: It will be so ordered unless there is objection.
    
    
     CLAIMS AGAINST THE STATE.
     The bill [S. 145] to authorize claimants to sue the State, coming up--
     Mr. CAMPBELL: This is an important bill, as every member knows, who knows anything about it.
      I hope it will go over till the afternoon, so I can move to suspend the constitutional rule
      that the bill may be passed the Senate now and go to the House. It is so near the time for the
      noon adjournment--
     The PRESIDENT pro. tempore [interrupting]. It is a good time to make that motion now.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: Well, I will make the motion. I do not want to detain the Senate, but will
      briefly state that this bill was suggested by the difficulty in adjusting claims against the
      State. Every member knows it is impossible--utterly impossible--for the General Assembly to
      pass intelligently upon the great number of claims presented every session. I have been a
      member of the committee on claims, and have been compelled to pass judgment in cases where I
      was not satisfactorily informed. THey are brought sometimes for double the amount really due;
      and we do know that in many instances claims have been allowed that should not have been.
     Mr. FOWLER: The bill leaves it optional whether the claimant comes here or goes into
      court.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: Yes sir. This is an important measure. I regard it as one of the most
      important that claims the attention of the Legislature. It passed the General Assembly two
      years ago almost unanimously. It then provided that the Auditor of State should issue his
      warrant on the State Treasury upon the allowance made by the court, and the Governor vetoed
      the bill on that ground--holding that there should be an appropriation made by the
      Legislature, I think that was right. This bill obviates that objection. It will take away 95
      per cent, if not more than that, of the trouble the General Assembly has in the matter of
      allowing claims. And it will be an immense saving of money to the State. It is utterly
      impossible for the Committees to adequately examine the merits of the claims presented to
      them. Congress has established a Court of Claims and several other States have passed similar
      bills to the one proposed. It is of great value and importance, and I hope the motion will be
      sustained and the bill passed now.
     Mr. WEIR [Chairman of the Committee on Claims]: I will simply add in
      addition to what the Senator from Hendricks [Mr. Campbell] has said, that I regard this as a
      very important mea- sure and one that should be passed
      without delay. If Senators will stop to think of the time expended before committees in both
      Houses in considering these claims, and the unpleasant duties connected therewith, and
      consider the saving of time by the remedies provided in this bill, and the assurances that
      proper investigations will be made, it seems to me they will surely suspend the rules and pass
      the bill.
     A favorable report of the committee on the judiciary was concurred in, and the motion to
      press the bill to the final vote was agreed to by yeas 36, nays 0.
     Mr. FOWLER saying: I am going to vote to suspend the constitutional rule, but shall vote
      against the bill without having any good reason for doing it.

     THE LOAN BILL.
     Mr. GORDON moved to instruct the ways and means committee to report on
      the loan bill [H. R 13] tommorow morning, and make that a special order for that hour.
     Mr. BUCKLES moved to lay the motion on the table, as it was a reflection on the
      commitee.
     The latter motion was agreed to by yeas 54, nays 24.
     Pending the roll call--
     Mr. CAVEN, in explanation said: I am the chairman of this committee. On the 27th day of
      January this commitee reported on this bill and recommended its passage, and it was sent back.
      We reported it back, and it was sent back again. It has been lying in my drawer for several
      days, ready to be reported. Except for a few changes made last night, we have been ready with
      the whole business of this committee, and by this afternoon or to-morrow, if this House gives
      this committee an opportunity to be heard, it will be ready to report. We have made the report
      twice, I myself have been working day and night. This committee hold itself amendable to this
      House, and holds itself ready now and at all times to report, and if you choose to send the
      bill back, we are willing to go to work on it again. I vote "no."
     Mr. COX, of Miami, [Explaining]: I do not regard this motion as any reflection on the
       committee on Ways and Means. I regard it as an expression of this House
      that is a matter of great importance, and therefore vote against this motion to lay on the
      table. I vote "no."
     Mr. GORDON said: For the reason that I believe that this report ought to be received and
      passed upon I made the motion, and now for the stronger reason, the statement from the
      chairman that their report is ready at any time that the House calls for it, that an extra
      session ought not to be compelled on account of this bill, I vote "no"
     Mr. GROSE, when his name was called, said: The fact that this proposition has been twice
      before the House, and the fact that to-morrow is Saturday and most likely we will not have a
      quorum here, I vote "aye."
     Mr. HARRELL, Explaining said: As a member of this committee I wish to say that it met last
      night and found it necessary to make some changes in the bills before it, and personally I can
      say that bill has not been kept away from the House to delay its action. The 
       committee
       commiatee
       has been ready at any time to present the loan bill to the House. I vote
      "aye."
     
     Mr. JEWETT, when called upon to vote said: I am a member of the ways and means
       committee, and my recollection is that a week ago yesterday the chairman, by a vote
      of the committee, was directed to report this bill-- a simple loan bill, to borrow a million
      dollars,--not later than 2 o'clock Friday; and the report has not been made. I know of no
      reason why. I vote "no."
     Mr. KELLISON [Explaining]: I vote as I do because this loan bill was once before this House,
      and probably very much in the form that it will be reported again. I thought it was
      unnecessary to refer it back to that committee, and I resisted it upon this floor, and believe
      it was wrong to recommit it to that committee; but now that the bill has been sent back, and a
      large number of other bills have been referred to that committee, and a great many changes
      made necessary and because I do not believe to-morrow a good day to consider as important a
      measure as that; and because some gentlemen who wanted this bill re-committed, are now anxious
      to compel this committee to report; and becausue I believe the chairman will in due time
      report it to this House, I vote "aye."
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the motion was laid on the table.

        Be it Resolved by the House of Representatives, That the Assistant Clerk be and is hereby
         authorized to employ one extra clerk to assist in the work necessary to be done in his
         department.
       
      
     
     It was adopted.
    
    
     LEGISLATIVE STENOGRAPHER.
     Mr. GARDINER from the Committee on the
       Judiciary, returned the Senate concurrent resolution looking to the selection of a
      State Stenographer [see page 154,] with a recommendation "that said resolution be adopted
      by the House."
     The report of the committee was concurred in, and the resolution was adopted.
    
    
     FREE PASSES FOR OFFICIALS.
     The Judiciary Committee returned the bill [H. R. 247] concerning bribery
      in connection with R. R. passes,--a majority recommending the indefinite postponement and a
      minority a substitute.
     Mr. JEWETT: I am very much in favor of this minority report. I am in favor of a bill that
      will prohibit the granting of a railroad pass to any officer of the State of Indiana, not
      because I believe it would influence any officer, [for I don't believe that any officer
      ever was influenced by a railroad pass,] but I have been endeavoring to get justice for the
      shippers in this State in regard to charges, and this is said to be injurious to the
      railroads, as it cuts down their receipts, and I want to make some amends to the railroad by
      making all dead-heads pay their fare on the trains. As I am a friend to the railroad to that
      extent, I want this bill passed. It will relieve the railroad companies of one of the most
      abominable things that is imposed on the company. The railroads get no good from it. It ought
      to be the policy of this Legislature to make transportation as cheap as possible for the
      citizens. I object to a county officer, or State officer riding on a pass. We can do no better
      act to the railroads than to adopt this minority report and enact this law.
     Mr. BERTRAM: I am opposed to this bill. I know it to be a fact that nearly every prominent
      lawyer who rides on a railroad has a railroad pass, and if that bill contained a provision
      that they should not have a pass, I don't think we should have such an argument from the
      gentleman from Floyd [Mr. Jewett].
     The majority report was withdrawn, the minority was accepted as the report of the committee,
      the report concurred in and the bill ordered engrossed.
    
    
     REWARD TO DETECTIVES.
     On Mr. Harrell's bill [H. R. 118] to authorize county commissioners to offer reward for
      arrest of horse-thieves, a majority report recommended indefinite postponement, and a minority
      amendment.
     Mr. ROBERTS: I believe this is a bill that its importance cannot be questioned. Often it has
      occured that criminals guilty of the most flagrant crimes have escaped, for the want of proper
      means for their capture. It is not only the case in regard to horse-thieves and stock-thieves
      generally, but in regard to other criminals. Heretofore unless individuals saw proper to go
      down into their pockets and take out the money, the criminals are not pursued and captured.
      Every citizen wants to see property protected and the laws enforced. This bill allows the
      Board of County Commissioners where the crime is committed, at their discretion, to offer a
      reasonable reward for the apprehension and capture of the criminal.
     Mr. LINCK: I believe if the County Commissioners were allowed this authority they would not
      abuse their powers. I remember when I was prosecuting attorney we were greatly embarassed in
      catching criminals. Frequenty $25 would have been enough to have captured men who had
      committed the most heinous crimes, but the county Board has no power to act on the subject. I
      believe it a good bill and ought to be passed.
     Mr. METZGER: I am in favor of this bill. I belong to a detective society in the county that
      I have the honor to represent, and I know the need of such a fund. It has often been discussed
      at the meetings of our society how we could raise funds to carry on our work. I am in favor of
      this bill.
     Mr. WEYAND: It occurs to me that there may be two sides to this thing. I am very favorably
      impressed with a bill of this kind; but it occurs to me that it is possible when a crime is
      committed, parties who are cognizant of the fact would keep is from the public until the
      reward was offered. If it would not encourage a practice of that kind I would be very much in
      favor of the bill, I am very undecided whether or not it is in accordance with public policy
      to offer a reward of this kind. It looks to me it might be a little dangerous.
     The minority report was substituted for the majority report, the report as amended concurred
      in, and the bill was ordered engrossed.
    
    
     MORTGAGED REALTY.
     On Mr. KELLISON'S bill [H. R. 167] to require assessors to deduct the amount of liens
      from the value of real estate in assessing that real estate for  taxation, the majority recommended its indefinite postponemnt, and
      the minority report suggested an amendment.
     Mr. KELLISON: I introduced this bill at the request and urgent solicitation of a large and
      responsible class of my constituency who believe the present law in relation to the taxation
      of real estate is unjust and unfair. I wish to place myself fairly and squarely on the record
      as in favor of this proposition, and at the same time I propose to place some others on the
      record. This bill provides that when real estate is encumbered with mortgages or judgments of
      any amount, the amount of the encumberance shall be deducted from the value of the real
      estate, and the remaining value assessed to the owners of the real estate. This bill takes
      away double taxation. I do not know whether any bill can be framed to correct the inequalities
      and injustice of this law that would be entirely free from objections, but it is also true
      that no bill can be framed to correct any great evil without it will work some injustice and
      hardship in special instances. It has been urged against this bill that it might have the
      effect in some instances, to exempt the property of railroad companies and corporations when
      it is loaded down with judgments. If that is so, this bill can be amended so that it will only
      apply to cases where the incumberance on real estate does not exceed a certain portion of its
      value. I do not object to amendments to the bill, but I do object most strenuaously to the
      indefinite postponement of this bill. I believe these hardships can be remedied, and believe
      the House ought to substitute the minority report for majority report, and if gentlemen
      believe the bill is crude; but at the same time is intended to subserve a good purpose, let it
      be recommitted, or let it be amended here in the House. I believe 9-10 of the people of
      Indiana are in favor of some legislation of this kind. I would not dare as a representative of
      the people to record my vote against a measure of this kind. There is no necessity for double
      taxation on property in the State of Indiana. I say it is wrong, I say that a man ought not to
      be taxed on what he owes. God knows it is hard enough for him to pay the interest on the
      mortgage, without being compelled to pay taxes on it. I believe this measure is a righteous
      one.
     Mr. GARDINER: This bill proposes a matter that seems quite plausible on the face of it, but
      when you come to study the question it strikes me the plausibility vanishies; and it becomes,
      the more you study it, a matter of impossibility to adjust such a system so as to relieve the
      apparent trouble that the gentleman speaks of. Take a farmer who owns $10,000 worth of land,
      on which there is an incumberance of $5,000, the effect of the bill is to exempt him from
      paying taxes on his real estate. Another farmer, his neighbor, has $10,000 worth of land, and
      there is a mortgage for $5,000 on personal security, now what justice is there in relieving
      one man and not the other? Here is a manufacturer of lumber by the side of the farmer, who has
      $15,000 invested in real estate. The manufacturer has an equal amount invested in his stock,
      they each have $5,000 borrowed. Is there any justice to say that the farmer shall be relieved
      of that tax, and the manufacturer shall not? It seems to me, without stopping to elaborate an
      argument, that this character of legislation should not be enacted.
     Mr. GOUGH: I should like to see some feasible legislation on this subject, but it seems to
      me there are many difficulties. You take a piece of land that is worth $12,000, you put a
      mortgage on it for $6,000. When the appraiser comes around he values it at $4,000. What have
      you? You have an assessment against the holder of the mortgage for $6,000, but there is
      nothing left. The mortgage is larger than the assessment. Another illustration: suppose I have
      a mortgage of $10,000 on a farm in an adjoining county, I am taxed on the mortgage as personal
      property, and I am obliged to pay taxes on the mort- gage. This bill would also require me to pay taxes in the county where the mortgage is
      located. I would vote for any bill that would do away with double taxes, but while we are
      doing away with it on one hand this bill proposes to create it on the other.
     Mr. ROBERTS: I cannot comprehend the argument of the gentleman from Davies [Mr. Gardiner].
      It seems to me this is a proposition that is almost self evident. This bill simply provides
      that where a farmer is worth $10,000 and has on it a mortgage worth $5,000, the $5,000
      mortgage shall be deducted from the assessed value of the land. I think there is equality in
      that. A mortgage is a lien against every foot of land that a man may own. It is to all intents
      and effects a conditional conveyance and is so considered by the courts. I think he should be
      exempt, since, as long as that debt stands, he is not the owner of it. It is reprehensible; it
      is a legal monstrosity. The State of Indiana cannot afford to do such a thing. It is enough if
      she has the property taxed once; the burden is heavy enough on the taxpayer without asking the
      taxes to be paid twice. If I hold a mortgage against a man it is the duty of the assessor to
      take that down and assess it against me. The law is that when the assessor appraises real
      estate he should put it at a fair cash value. If he does not do it he does not do his duty. I
      think this bill has merits but few bill have that have been before this House.
     Mr. DAVIS moved to refer the bill. and reports to a special Committee to consist of Messrs
      Montgomery, of Gibson, McCallam, and Beasley.
     Mr. KELLISON moved to lay this motion on the table.
     The ayes and nays were demanded, and being ordered and taken resulted yeas 22, nays 32.
     No quoroum voting--
     The House adjourned [as was ordered early this afteroon,] till Monday at 2 o'clock p.

    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    IN SENATE.
    
     MONDAY, February 21, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Hon. J. H. C. SMITH, a Senator from
     the counties of Wells and Huntington.
    
     BILLS FOR ACTS WERE INTRODUCED BY
     Mr. Barrett [S. 324]: For the management and government of the two State prisons by one
      board of directors, to be appointed by the Governor.
     Mr. Sellers [S. 325]: For the better management of the four hospitals for the insane, the
      Deaf and Dumb, and blind asylums.
     Mr. Bailey [S. 326]: To amend Section 2623 R. S.--appropriation to the State Board of
      Agriculture.
    
    
     THE STATE PRISONS.
     Mr. BARRETT, from the committee on Prisons, returned the bill [S. 324, introduced this
      morning], to provide a government for the two penitentiaries, recommending its passage. The
      report was concurred in. He then moved for the suspension of the constitutional rule so that
      the bill could be passed. The terms of the officers, he said, now managing the Southern
      Prison, should be terminated, and they should be held up as an example to all future public
      officials of whatever party, so they may understand that gross neglect or worse condition of
      our institutions will not be tolerated.
     The motion to dispense with the constitutional rule was rejected by yeas 28, nays
      10--two-thirds not voting in the affirmative.
     On motion by Mr. BAILEY the bill was made the special order for to-morrow at 10
      o'clock.
     Mr. FRENCH offered a resolution, which was adopted, authorizing the special committee
      appointed to investigate the State benevolent institutions to employ an expert accountatn; and
      that the public printer print the testimony from day to day as fast as written out by the
      committee's stenographer, and when the testimony is closed that 1,000 copies be printed
      and given to the public.
    
    
     BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
     The committee on Finance returned the bill [S. 233] to make an
      appropriation to pay for the Brevier Legislative Reports of the 51st, 52nd and 53rd General
      Assemblies, with the recommendation that the same be amended as follows:
     By striking out of lines 2 and 3 of section 1 the words and figures "twenty thousand
      six hundred and ten dollars and forty-four cents ($20,610.44.)" and adding in lieu
      thereof the words and figures, "thirteen thousand one hundred and ninety-eight dollars
      and forty-four cents ($13,198.44)," and when the bill is so amended that it do pass.
    
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     BUILDING AND LOAN ASSOCIATIONS.
     Mr. Bryant's bill [S. 217] to tax building and
      savings associations, was read the third time.
     Mr. THARP: This is a measure universally demanded by share-holders. Under the present system
      the owner is not only compelled to pay taxes on his real estate, but likewise on stock in the
      building and loan association. I am surprised to see so little interest taken in this matter
      here. This measure is demanded by 50,000 people in Indiana--all poor people, for nine-tenths
      of shares in these associations are owned by poor people. They are demanding this as an act of
      justice.
     The bill passed by yeas 32, nays 10.
     Pending the roll call--
     Mr. BAILEY said: The poor people are asking for the passage of this bill. It simply exempts
      from taxation that part which these poor people draw out and put into their little homes; and
      it is to prevent double taxation.
     Mr. CAMPBELL [interposing]: I am for this bill if that is its purpose, but I don't
      believe that will be the effect of it.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: If Senators don't understand this bill the chair suggests
      they debate it before the roll call.
     Mr. BAILEY: This bill has been carefully prepared by the Legislative Committee of
       the Knights of Labor and others who have been consulted with regard to its legal
      significance. I vote "aye."
     Mr. BARRETT: If I thought the bill would accomplish the object stated by the Senator from
      Marion [Mr. Bailey] I would gladly vote for it. But if this bill has been prepared in the
      interest of men who desire to conduct a banking business in the name of building and loan
      associations, it could not be more carefully prepared. If this bill becomes a law many
      investors will put their money in building associations and thereby escape taxation. If we are
      to aid the poor man as we ought to we should pass a bill taking from the assessed value of
      real estate, the amount of mortgage placed on it, or deduct from the value of those shares the
      amount of money borrowed from the association. In my judgment this bill is not in the interest
      of small holders of stock in building associations. For these reasons I vote
      "no."
     Mr. DRAKE, when his name was called, said: When I see the Senators from Allen and Marion
      opposing each other on a bill proposing to benefit the laboring man, it is ealctilatod to make
      one hesitate; but believing the bill to be correct, I vote "aye."
     Mr. HARNESS: I have a letter showing how the law now works in some cases. A man pays taxes
      on the mortgage and the land both, and the owner of the property pays on it, which makes the
      same property taxed three times. This bill will make the property referred to taxed but once,
      instead of three times. I vote "aye."
     Mr. HOWARD, of St. Joseph, when called upon to vote, said: It seems to me this bill will
      relieve share-holders from being taxed on their shares, therefore I vote "aye."
     Mr. LOGSDON, In explaining his vote, said: No one is more fully and thoroughly in sympathy
      with that class of people who by a struggling effort are seeking to secure a home by putting
      their savings in building and loan associations, than I am; and if I thought this bill would
      reach the object intended by its author, I would most certainly vote "aye," but
      believing as I do it will not accomplish that object, and believing it will be in the interest
      of those share-holders who do not borrow out, and not in the interest of those who do borrow
      out and execute mortgages on their homes, I am compelled to vote "no."
     Mr. MCDONALD, when his 
       name
       mane
       was called, said: I am satisfied the purport of this bill is right. I have thought
      it hard that men who borrow money should have to pay taxes on the stock and on the houses they
      build. The argument that this is for the benefit of the money-lender cannot be sustained.
     Mr. SELLERS [interposing]: Does not this bill exempt from taxation the  man who has shares, and does not borrow?
     Mr. MCDONALD: No sir. I believe this bill is right, and I vote
      "aye" very emphatically.
     Mr. MULLINIX, when called upon to vote, said: Believing that this bill is demanded by the
      honest laboring classes who are trying to procure for themselves a home, I vote
      "aye."
     Mr. SCHLOSS, when his name was called, said: Knowing that this measure was asked for in 1883
      and 1885 by the people of this State, and knowing it is just, therefore I vote
      "aye."
     Mr. SMITH, of Wells, in explanation of his vote, said: As I understand it, building and loan
      associations are made up of those who pay in money, and shares are issued to each individual.
      Any expenses are paid by members of the association. This bill simply provides that where they
      borrow money they shall not be taxed on that. What still remains is taxed. What is taken out
      is not taxed; but that which remains in is. That is just and right. I vote
      "aye."
     Mr. FOWLER said: Hoping this bill will receive the interpretation by the courts given by the
      Senator from Marion [Mr. Bailey], and that its real effect will be such as he states, though I
      have great doubts about it, I will vote "aye."
     The result was announced as above.
     So the bill passed the Senate.
     Mr. French introduced a bill [S. 327] to legalize the town of Poseyville, Posey co.
     Mr. DeMotte introduced a bill [S. 328] for the relief of Wm. Watts, of Lake co.
     The Senate adjourned.
    
   
   
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
    
     MONDAY, February 21, 1887.
    
    The House met at 2 o'clock p. m., pursuant to adjournment last Friday.
    
     PROPOSED JOINT CONVENTION.
     Mr. GARDINER offered the following:
     
      
       
        Whereas, The duty devolves upon this General Assembly enjoined by positive law, of
         electing certain directors of the penal and certain trustees of the benevolent
         institutions, and a State Librarian, and
        Whereas, investigation by committees of the House of Representatives charged with the
         duty of making the same, have revealed astounding facts proving corruption, negligence and
         crime in the management of the Asylum for the Insane, and the State Prison South; and
        Whereas, It is currently rumored and generally believed that the Democratic members of
         this General Assembly, with a view to retaining their partisan friends in the control of
         said institutions regardless of their want of integrity or fitness, have determined not to
         join the Republican members of this General Assembly in the joint convention necessary to
         elect new and suitable officers for these institutions; and
        Whereas, Such refusal, if persisted in, would result in retaining dishonest, unfit and
         unscrupulous men in the control of these institutions, and thereby bring upon the State
         great disgrace and pecuniary loss, and upon the unfortunate inmates of such institutions a
         continuance of the cruelty and inhumanity hitherto visited upon them; and
        Whereas, The legal duty of electing such officers is enlarged and made more imperative by
         said revelations and such wicked determination not to join in such convention, therefore be
         it
        Resolved, By the House of Representatives, the Senate concurring, that the offices of
         said institutions, elected by the General Assembly, whose terms of office do not expire at
         this session, should at once resign; and be it further
        Resolved. That a joint convention for the purpose of electing directors and trustees of
         said institutions, and a State Librarian, be held in the Hall of the House of
         Representatives on Tuesday, March 1, 1887, at 2.30 P. M.
       
      
     
     Mr. KELLISON: I am not in favor of adopting this resolution in its present form, for reasons
      which I think will commend themselves for fairness and justice to the members of this House. I
      could endorse the resolution, and would do so if that which assumes to be a statement of facts
      were striken out of it. There is a preamble to the resolution reciting a number of rumors
      which have not been proven to be facts. It seems to me that a deliberative body ought not to
      pay any attention to rumors of this kind when it has the power to obtain the facts. That
      portion of the resolution which recites that the democratic members of this assembly are
      opposed to entering into a joint convention to elect officers, is a charge which is not
      sustained by facts. This is condemning men without trial, and I shall not vote for the  preamble in its present form, but I would vote for a
      resolution calling upon the members of the General Assembly to meet in joint convention. I
      therefore move to amend by striking out the preamble, and that part of the resolution which
      asks for the resignation of officers.
     Mr. JEWETT offered an amendment to the amendment as follows: "And such joint convention
      shall be presided over by the President of the Senate." He said: The history of the
      recent joint convention makes it very probable there may be a fuss as to who will preside over
      the convention. I should regret to participate in another joint convention carried under a
      flag of truce, as was the convention that elected a United States Senator in this hall. Custom
      has made it proper that the President of the Senate shall preside over these joint
      conventions. As far as I am concerned I favor a joint convention for the election of these
      officers. I favor this resolution for the plainest and simplest reason that can be given; the
      law requires that it shall done. I utterly refute the charges ads in the preamble, and I say
      that no gentleman is authorized to say that it is the intention of the democrats to prevent
      the election of these officers. As far as I am concerned when any gentleman charges me with
      that, he charges me with what is not true, nor is the statement any more exact as applied to
      other members who make up the Democratic minority on this floor. For that reason this part of
      the preamble should be stricken out in obedience to that strongest of all requirements, the
      obligation to speak the truth. Another part of this resolution that I object to is: It calls
      for the resignation of the officers of these institutions. This is the most unprecedented and
      unwarranted thing that I ever heard. Some of the gentlemen to be reached by this resolution
      have not served long, others have served a long time, and I am not willing that any just
      person should be condemned by us because there are unjust men. This resolution, as far as the
      preamble is concerned, is unfair, it is hasty, it seeks to have this deliberative body act on
      rumor, and I ask you in the name of justice to strike out this preamble, and you can have the
      unanimous vote of this side of the House for the resolution. I favor a joint convention and
      election of these officers, but am more favorable to the plan I have so often proposed here
      and in former Legislatures--the putting of the whole thing in the Governor's hands. My
      strongest desire is for a fair investigation and report. If under such circumstances these men
      are shown to be guilty, no politicial or personal obligations shall have a feather's
      weight with me, but I will go as far as any man on the other side of the House to punish and
      degrade them.
     The SPEAKER said: That the amendment of the gentleman from Floyd [Mr. Jewett] was out of
      order, inasmuch as it attempted to regulate or determine the duties of the Speaker of the
      House of Representatives.
     Mr. HARRELL: That resolution is certainly very unfair. In the first place it is like finding
      a man guilty before the jury has convicted him. (Reads the preamble.) I cannot say that is
      true, and I would not like to vote for a resolution with this kind of a preamble to it. It is
      premature, it is untimely, it is out of place at this time.
     Mr. ROBERTS: The fact is distinctly stated in the resolution that there is a formed design
      on the part of the democratic members of this House to refrain from entering into a joint
      convention for the election of these officers. I do not know a single circumstance, I do not
      know a single fact that justifies that assumption. As far as my knowledge goes it is without
      foundation in fact, and wholly false. There is not one word of truth to sustain it.
     Mr. GARDINER: I am very much gratified at what I have heard from the west side of this
      House: The determination on the part of those gentlemen who have addressed the House in
      relation to a joint convention, and the disclaiming of any intention on their part not to join
      the republican  members of this General Assembly in the
      joint convention for the purpose of electing officers for these institutions. We have been
      told by one of the most eloquent members on the other side that the party organ, the
      newspapers, were in a great part the party themselves, and control to a great extent the
      conduct of the members of the Legislature. On the third of this month it was heralded by the
      democratic press that the last joint convention had been held in the capitol of Indiana; that
      there would be no more joint conventions here in this capitol. If there has been a
      contradiction of this charge until this hour, I have never heard of it. These gentlemen object
      to the preamble, they say we should wait until the report of the committee comes to the House.
      These committees have just entered on the work; they have just begun, and during the two weeks
      that we have yet to sit they will be busy probing still deeper into the rottenness of these
      institutions that has been already uncovered. They say the preamble of this resoluion is too
      sweeping. Whe we have probed so deep, and have found rottenness on every hand, is it not time
      to call for the resignation of all from the top to the bottom? Let us begin now. Let us turn
      the rascals out. (applause.)
     Mr. BROWN: The people told us in 1876 the Insane Asylum was rotten to the core, and they
      told us in 1878 that the Southern Prison was likewise, but the committees said they were pure
      as angels, that the men who ran these institutions were pure. I think we should not hesitate
      to pass this resolution, and pass it in a hurry.
     Mr. MAJOR demanded the previous question.
     It was seconded, and under its operations, a division of the question being ordered, the
      House refused to strike out the preamble by yeas 33, nays 50. Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. FOSTER, when explaining his vote, said: For the reason that I know that the preamble
      contains matter that is not true, and is a reflection on the members of this side of the
      House; it reflects discredit on the management of such institutions as the Woman's
      Reformatory, and is an exhibition of partisan malice; for these reasons I vote
      "aye.'
     Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Owen, in explanation, said: I vote to strike out the preamble, first, for
      the reason that I believe it reflects discredit on the democratic side of this House and
      secondly, because I believe it recites things that are not facts, therefore I vote
      "aye."
     Mr. NIBLAOK, when his name was called, said: I care nothing whether this amendment carries
      or not; if it carries it will only be a continuation of the series of blunders of the majority
      of this House; it will be of no concern. Serious charges are made in this resolution which
      have not been proven. These officers have been undergoing investigation and they have had no
      chance to present tbeir side of the case, therefore I vote 'aye.'
     Mr. PARKER [explaining]: For the reason that the preamble does not state what is true; for
      the reason that there has been no action taken by the House to base any rumors of that kind
      on; for the reason that I do not believe that members on the floor of this House should seek
      to condemn anybody before they are proven guilty, I vote "aye."
     Mr. ROBINSON, when called upon to vote, said: Because I do not know that the preamble is
      strictly true in all its details I am disposed to give the accused the benefit of the, doubt,
      and therefore I vote "aye."
     Mr. STUBBLEFIELD, on answering to his name, said: Because I believe the rumors are true;
      because I believe the part of the preamble in reference to the democratic members refusing to
      go into joint convention is true; I therefore vote "no."
     Mr. VAN SLYKE, [in explanation]: I am informed by one of the candidates for State Librarian
      that democratic members have very strongly intimated to her that they would not go into a
      joint convention, and I know personally that she has been quite nervous over the matter. I
      must certainly vote "no". because believe the preamble speaks the truth.
     
     Mr. WORRALL, in explanation of his vote, said: I shall be compelled to vote the way I do on
      account of certain matters that are contained in preamble. I know that the Southern Prison
      from top to bottom is as rotten and corrupt as the bottomless pits of the lower regions. I
      know it; but there are some things in this preamble that I cannot believe, therefore I shall
      be compelled to vote "no" on this measure.
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the preamble remains.
     Mr. KELLISON asked and obtained consent to withdraw the other part of his amendment.
     Mr. HARELL demanded a division the question.
     The SPEAKER ruled it out of order at this time.
     The preamble and resolutions were adopted by yeas 50, nays 35.
     Pending the roll call--
     Mr. BEASLEY said: I am not in favor of that part of the resolution that calls on the
      officers of these institutions to resign; but I believe the resolution is offered to place the
      democrats in a false attitude. I am therefore compelled to vote "no."
     Mr. BERTRAM, explaining his vote, said: For the reason I know the preamble is not true, and
      for the reason that it is highly improper to introduce a resolution requesting any officer to
      resign before the Committee reports have come to this House, I vote "no."
     Mr. COX, of Miami, [in explanation]: I shall vote as I do in this matter because I believe
      the preamble contains matter that is untrue. I am in favor of holding a Joint Convention, but
      because I cannot vote for this resolution without voting for the preamble I must vote
      "no."
     Mr. GROSE, when his name was called, said: Believing that this resolution is true, and
      believing that the officers of the Southern Prison and the Insane Asylum should go out of
      office, I vote "aye."
     Mr. HARRELL [in explanation]: I asked for a division of the question. The Speaker held that
      that was not in order, therefore I am compelled to vote "no" on the first
      proposition in the resolution, and "aye" on the second. (Laughter.) I vote
      "no."
     Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Owen, [explaining]: Part of this resolution I could support, that part
      requiring a Joint Convention; but believing the preamble is unjust and untrue I cannot support
      that part. Therefore I vote "no."
     Mr. PATTON, [explaining]: I cannot vote for that preamble and cast a reflection on the
      intention of the democratic members of this House. I vote "no."
     Mr. WHITE said: I am in favor of a Joint Convention, but I do not think my vote on the other
      part of the resolution needs any explanation. I vote "no."
     Mr. GORDON said: Part of that resolution I can support, but I can never give very hearty
      support to anything that is found in bad company, and I shall therefore vote
      "no."
     Mr. BUSKIRK said: I am in favor of a Joint Convention, but opposed to the preamble in its
      entirely, therefore I shall vote "no."
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the preamble and resolution passed.
    
    
     BILLS FOR ACTS WERE INTRODUCED BY
     Mr. Van Slyke [H. R. 457]: To provide for a constitutional convention.

    IN SENATE.
    
     TUESDAY, February 22, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Rev. G. G. Mitchell, of the Presbyterian Church.
    
     THE STATE PRISONS.
     On motion by Mr. CAMPBELL, the bill [S. 324] for the government of the State Penitentiaries,
      was taken up.
     Mr. THARP: I don't like to be rushed with a bill of so much importance without proper
      consideration. I see no reason for rushing in here twenty-four hours after a bill is
      introduced to revolutionize two of the most important institutions in Indiana, and compelling
      Senators to vote on it. We ought to have some time to consider it. For that reason I move to
      postpone this special order till Thursday at 10 o'clock.
     Mr. WEIR: Senators must realize the importance of doing something, when they consider the
      condition of the Southern Prison as shown in the committee report. And I hear the Board of
      Directors are about to resign. The end of the session is rapidly approaching and if
      legislation is had at all it must be had promptly.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: I am satisfied there ought to be instant action. I hope we can have
      opportunity to amend this bill so it will be non-partisan in its character. I desire to see
      these institutions taken out of party politics.
     Mr. THARP: There is no necessity for a stampede here to re-organize an institution because
      one man has proved to be incompetent. I think this Legislature is as competent to elect men to
      control these institution as the Governor is to select them. I think to put the management
      under the control of one man is a dangerous thing. This man should be elected by the immediate
      representatives of the people. Because they have proven to be unworthy I don't believe
      the Board of Directors are criminals in this matter. I can see how easy it would be by
      carelessness to allow these irregularities and crimes to get in without their knowing it.
     Mr. JOHNSON: I was one who opposed yesterday a suspension of the constitutional rule, while
      I recognized the necessity for action. In the meantime I have reflected upon the propriety of
      making a change and am now ready to act. I am not here to say the bill is acceptable to me,
      for there are some things in it repugnant to my ideas of right; and I desire to submit some
      amendments. I hope the motion to postpone will be voted down, and right here and now we will
        proceed to amend the bill and decide what system we
      will inaugurate.
     Mr. MCCLURE: I feel very proud that this Legislature has furnished
      committees on prisons which have done their duty in the premises; but I cannot see the
      necessity for hot haste in this matter. Do you not know, Mr. President, that whenever we do
      things in haste we are apt to do things wrong? There are innocent persons connected with that
      prison, and because leaders have been corrupt we do not wish to include in that corruption the
      whole gang of prison officials. We have now a deputy acting as warden, and everything will go
      on harmoniously there. There is no occasion for hot haste in the matter. I am in favor of
      postponing the further consideration of this bill till Thursday so we may discreetly take into
      consideration everything in connection with it and act with wisdom.
     Mr. SMITH, of Wells: It seems me, there is no necessity for haste as we have heard but one
      side of this investigation yet. A jury in a trial has a right and should hear the evidence on
      both sides. I understand from a resolution passed in the House that it is anxious to have a
      joint convention to elect these officials. [A message from the House announced the passage of
      the concurrent resolution printed on page 000.] And I for one am willing to go into a joint
      convention to elect them in good faith. I think it premature to undertake to pass such a bill
      as this now, therefore I am opposed to taking it up now. After further consideration I may
      vote for the bill, but at the present time I am against it.
     Mr. SELLERS: This bill contains a very simple proposition: it provides for the appointment
      by the Governor instead of an election by the Legislature. Delay but endangers the passage of
      the bill. Remember, gentlemen, you have less than two weeks in which to finish your
      legislative work, and you need not lay the flattering unction to your soul that there will be
      an extra session. This or some other measure is necessary, and postponement endangers its
      passage. It is a Democratic doctrine to "turn the rascals out," and, whether
      Democrats or Republicans, I am in favor of turning them out at once. Men proven to be rascals,
      though placed in position by the Democratic party, are entitled to no consideration by a
      Democratic Senate. Will the people of Indiana approve delay of even a day in the discharge of
      a duty so clearly incumbent upon the Senate?
     The PRESIDENT, pro tempore: The chair understood the Senator from Hendricks [Mr. Campbell]
      to say that this bill will not pass the General Assembly in its present form, or unless an
      amendment is agreed to. What is going to be done if an amendment is not agreed to?
     Mr. SELLERS: If the Republicans in the House care to take the responsibility, with them will
      rest the blame and not with this Democratic Senate.
     Mr. CAMPBELL: I desire to correct an impression. I did express an opinion that this bill
      will not pass the House in its present shape; but I have no authority to speak for the
      House.
     Mr. KENNEDY: It seems like this thing ought to be attended to now. Some gentlemen intimate
      that they don't want anything partisan about these institutions. I say it is right to
      have them non-partisan; they are not partisan institutions; they are for the good of the whole
      State. If the Board were two of each party, the Warden would not do what he is accused of. I
      say it is good policy. I am heartily in favor of considering this bill now.
     Mr. URMSTON: During the greater part of the past twenty-five years the Republicans have been
      in possession of the Federal offices and I have observed how closely they have held on. It is
      only in the last few years they have been talking civil-service reform, no doubt because they
      saw that shortly they would have to let go the reins of Government; and in the hope that some
      of their men would hold over. If you can draw a Republican out to talking about anything; it
        is to talk about this matter of turning men out without
      giving them a chance to be heard. As far as the present matter is concerned, gentlemen have
      been insisting, and perhaps rightly, that no man should be removed unless he is given a chance
      to be heard. As far as some of the officers in the State Prison South are concerned, enough
      has appeared to show they are in the wrong; and we should take up this matter and act upon it;
      but because some in the State Prison South have been negligent in the discharge of duty, is
      that any reason we should include the State Prison North, which, so far as shown up to this
      time, has been managed in the best way possible? If it applied only to the State Prison South,
      I would have no objection to the bill. For my part I think the better motion would be to
      indefinitely postpone this hill. Are we not as capable to investigate all matters connected
      with these institutions as the Governor or anybody else? As far as the election of officers is
      concerned, we can remove them ourselves and have an election and elect new officers. But no;
      the bill proposes to put it in the hands of the Governor, who has power to remove any officer
      at his own suggestion; all he has to do is to give some reason for it, and nobody could
      question it. There is no chance for the officer to come before the Governor or any other
      tribunal to explain. That would be an unfair arrangement. As the law now stands any officer
      charged with negligence of duty may come before any committee and acquit himself if possible
      of any charge.
     Mr. WEIR: I hope this motion to postpone will not prevail. There seems to be some Senators
      opposed to giving the Governor the appointing power. As to that proposition I am very much in
      favor of it. We are told by a Senator, as a reason why this bill should be passed, that there
      will be no special session. I know nothing about that, nor care nothing, but I feel justified
      in saying that any man with a thimble full of brains can see that the General Assembly of
      Indiana cannot properly perfect legislation in sixty days--it is simply ridiculous to expect
      it. This is the reason why our laws are so crude and unsatisfactory, because everything must
      be done in a hurry. I am in favor of the non-partisan clause in this bill--decidedly so, and I
      shall vote for it. Aud I am ready, to say that I don't believe one Board of Directors is
      competent to manage the affairs of both these institutions. We have some thirty-nine of these
      Directors and they draw from three to six dollars a piece--about $19,000--and who are then
      men? Would a good business man attend to that business for six hundred dollars a year? They
      are simply figure-heads. They simply draw their salaries and let the business go. I am willing
      to give these Directors $1,500 or $2,000 a year, and we would be saving money by it.
     Mr. COX: I don't care to discus the merits or demerits or this bill but I do hope this
      motion will prevail. I think I am in favor of this bill as it now stands, but I want a little
      time to think over it. I want to say I am in favor of turning the rascals out, but ever man
      who has been accused of a crime is presumed to be innocent until he is proven guilty beyond a
      reasonable doubt. And I want to say to Senators now, you can never get me to give a vote that
      will cast reflection upon any man unless I have sufficient evidence to believe he is guilty.
      If you want me to vote for this bill you must give me some little time to think over it. I am
      opposed to a non-partisan Board. I am in favor o these institutions being governed and
      controlled by Democrats if we have majority in the State of Indiana; for if we have, we are
      responsible for them, let the conduct be either good or bad. If the Republicans have a
      majority in the State they should control these institutions. But now the trouble is, they
      haven't got the majority and they want to divide with us. They are asking, because they
      are in the minority, that there be a non-partisan Board to control these institutions. I am
      apposed to that, and shall vote against a bill of that kind every time I have an opportuni ty. So I hope the motion will prevail.
     Mr. HUSTON: I have listened attentively but have heard no good reason assigned why this bill
      should be postponed. It has been said on the floor of the Senate that the Deputy Warden is in
      charge of the Southern Prison. Who is the Deputy Warden? He is the creature of the Warden. I
      want immediate action, in order that the bill may be disposed of definitely; either passed,
      defeated, or amended so as to answer the demands, and I say the requirements of the people of
      this State. I am in favor of a non-partisan Board. I believe the time has come when we should
      put our Benevolent Institutions beyond the pale of party politics. I believe it would be for
      the interests of the people of the State. It has been said that the Democratic party is in the
      majority in this State. That is a question; and I doubt it very much. The people of Indiana
      have considered the question with regard to our great public institutions--they were the issue
      upon which the last battle was fought--and the people rendered a verdict in favor of turning
      the rascals out. We are investigating to-day the Insane Asylum, and we know what the evidence
      is. I am glad to know certain men of the majority admit that some men have been smirched in
      that investigation. There is no question so engrossing the mind of the people of the State as
      the question of our public institutions; and they look to us to enact such legislation as will
      remove beyond the pale of possibility any more infamy, such as has been exposed. I sincerely
      hope the motion to postpone will not prevail.
     Mr. TRIPPETT: In one particular I am very, much like the Senator from Fayette: I am opposed
      to postponing this measure. This Senate should act promptly as it is competent. Every man who
      heard the evidence in regard to the Southern Prison knows that it is corrupt. It is not only
      corrupt now but it has been corrupt for the last twenty-five years. It is as much a disgrace
      to the Republican as to the Democratic party that this mismanagement has been going on in that
      institution. And I say it is to the credit of this Senate--to the credit of the members of the
      present committee, if I am one of them,--that the infamy was exposed. The committee which went
      from this Senate gave the House committee the key by which they could follow up and expose the
      corruption it has exposed. The examination was started by this committee which put in all the
      time they had with unanimity.--We discovered the corruption. There was not a single man who
      wanted to white-wash. The only leniency he got was from a Republican member, and he is willing
      to admit it himself. [He gave a running history of the southern Prison and its trustees for a
      number of years; and read from House Journal of 1885, page 813.]--There ought to be a change
      made. I hope, Senators, this bill will not be postponed. Let it come up to-day and go to the
      engrossment, and let it be a third time to-morrow and be passed.
     Mr. MCDONALD: I do not know why a bill should be brought in here in the
      way this one was, under the existing circumstances. I am not willing by my silence here to say
      a bill should be passed that will strike down honest men who are not in the southern
      institution. I will not do it. No man will go more energetically against corruption than your
      humble servant, but I will never record my vote for a bill that will strike down an honest
      man. This bill says upon its face in broad language that we must have a change of officers,
      and why? On account of corruption.--Those men up there who have been honest and acted honest
      are they to be smirched because Jack Howard has been recreant? No, never will I cast a vote in
      that direction. I appeal to you, Senators, to ask yourselves with a clear conscience would you
      want to do such a wrong? Gentlemen on the other side say they want non-partisanship. Oh, yes!
      Go over to Ohio, go to Pennsylvanian, do you practice it there where you have  the grasp on us? We have the power here and we are going to
      exercise it. I believe the party in power should be held responsible. "Turn the rascals
      out!" Yes, sir, I say so. I say no dishonest man should hold a public office. I shall
      vote for postponement and I shall vote against the bill because I believe it will do injustice
      to honest men.
     Mr. LOGSDON: Whatever may be the suspicions aroused by the investigation of the Southern
      Prison as to the conduct of the Board of Directors, I do not understand that the provisions of
      this bill necessarily reflect upon the integrity or honesty of the Directors of the Prison
      North, against whom no breath of suspicion has ever been heard. An effort to change the
      management of a public institution is of itself not necessarily a reflection upon the
      character of the official conduct of those in charge of the institution. I do not now propose
      to discuss the bill. Let us take the bill up to-day and discuss its provisions; if we are in
      favor of it we can so declare by our votes; and if opposed to it we can so declare.
     Mr. BARRETT asked and obtained leave to submit the report of the committee on the State
      Prison North.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
      Mr. BARRETT: I shall not have much more to say than what I said when I introduced this
      bill. I was surprised at the motion to indefinitely postpone the bill, for I supposed it would
      be promptly passed under a suspension of the constitutional rule. I was glad to see it met the
      approval of my associates on this side of the chamber. This nor no other General Assembly can
      afford to give the time necessary to ascertain the standing and capacity of gentlemen who are
      candidates for these positions. When the general Assembly adjourns two-thirds or more go home
      never to return and they have no further responsibility for the conduct of these institutions.
      This alone, in my judgment, would justify a return to the former policy. The Governor remains
      in office for four years, and he is not only directly and personally responsible for the
      selection but also for their conduct in office. There is no one with which he can divide the
      responsibility. He knows the people of the State point directly to him,--and it is to avoid
      any adverse criticism that leads him to examine into the character and ability of men he
      appoints. These are reasons that justify the passage of a measure of this kind. Prior to 1883
      that was the policy of the State. Those who are in favor of thus changing the order of
      selecting these officers can find no objection to this bill except a so-called non-partisan,
      or, as some one has said, mug-wump objection. I believe in a party government, and a party
      administration. I believe when the Republican party is in power it has a right to the offices
      and when they were in power they took them. [He referred to favorable reports of the Prison
      South by Legislative committees two and four years ago when under the control of non-partisan
      Boards, when in fact, at that time, it was badly managed; and declared the history of this
      country shows the most corrupt and complete rings ever formed were in non-partisan
      Boards.]
     It is said that there is some reflection in some way in this bill upon the management of the
      Prison North. My surprise was indeed great when I heard the statement; and it was not greater
      when I heard it came from my distinguished colleage on the floor of this Senate. He did not
      have the courage or information to point out a single sentence in the bill that cast the
      slightest reflection upon the Board of Directors of the Northern Prison; and when I heard that
      statement I asked the privilege of bringing in the report of the Committee on that Prison as
      the most complete refutation that there was any reflectionon the management of that
      institution in this bill. Upon my own responsibility I drafted this bill and have presented it
      for the consideration of the Senate. I felt then as I do now that we must do nothing short of
      terminating these offices regardless of party.
     
     Mr. JOHNSON: The question under discussion, from which we have wandered somewhat, is whether
      or not the pending bill shall be taken up now or postponed until next Thursday? I am opposed
      to the postponement for the reason that I desire to see this bill properly amended, and for
      the reason that owing to the lateness of the season to delay it will virtually kill it.
      Because of the nearness of the close of the session ill-advised legislation will be had. My
      proposition is this: that these appointments should be vested solely and entirely in the
      Governor; and let him feel that the responsibility rests upon him. Let the Governor understand
      that he is to be the sole judge, and he will exercise the power cautiously and you will find
      him moving Heaven and earth to find out what qualifications his intended appointees have. We
      cannot safely withhold that power from the Governor of the State. Once put it in his hands and
      he will be careful not to go astray. I will venture the prediction that three years will not
      pass until the voice of the people will shout "Hosanna" to the Legislature giving
      the appointing power to the Governor. There is nothing like placing responsibility on one man.
      I desire to strike out the clause in this bill which requires the concurrence of the Senate:
      and I want to amend it in another particular, for I am tired and disgusted with the spoils
      system in politics. I have no patience with that system which will take offices that belong to
      the people and use them for the unhallowed desires of a few politicians in either party. It
      was started by Andrew Jackson and it is a wonder it has staid with us so long.
     I am not going to be unparliamentary enough to state that the Senate committee forestalled
      the action of the House committee and went down to the Southern Prison and exposed this thing,
      to the end that they might make a virtue of necessity and say: "Lo! and behold! the
      Democratic party found it, and the House committee followed the thing up and unearthed the
      rottenness existing there." It seems to me I would mildly suggest that they, don't
      take too much credit to themselves, but divide the honors with the committee composed of both
      parties in the other end of the capitol. If this bill is properly amended, I am for it; but if
      this bill is to be no better than the prevailing system,--if it is a mere subterfuge by which
      the offices are to be kept in the hands of the Democratic party and to form an excuse to keep
      out of a joint convention which they feel they are unable to control, I am against it.
     The Senate adjourned.
    
   
   
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
    
     TUESDAY, February 22, 1887.
    
    ANOTHER EXTRA CLERK.
    Mr. ROBERTS offered the following:
    
     
      
       Resolved, That the Committee on Engrossed Bills, be allowed a clerk
        during the remainder of the present session, excepting the last three days thereof.
      
     
    
    The resolution was adopted.
    
     INJURY TO EMPLOYE.
     The bill [H. R. 8] to define the liability of corporations for injuries sustained by
      employes, coming up--
     Mr. COX, of Miami: The majority report should not be adopted. If this House is not willing
      to do as much for laborers and employes as the British Parliament has done by an act, we
      certainly should go as far by legislation as the Supreme Court of the United States has gone
      on reason and authority, and that Court has held, in Chicago and Milwaukee Railroad Company
      vs. Ross 112 U. S. 377, these propositions: First, that the exemption only extends to cases
      where the fellow servants are engaged in the same immediate department of labor, and under the
      same immediate direction. Second, that servants who order and direct other servants are not
      co-employes within the rule.
     Mr. JEWETT: The majority report of the committee, it seems to me, ought to be adoped, and if
      for other reason because I do not believe the minority
      report, if concurred in, would give us a bill that could pass the House. The object of the
      bill is to lessen the hardships of employes of corporations which result from the effect of a
      rule that no person injured by the negligence of a fellow emloye could recover. This is as
      strong a bill as can be passed. There is nothing in the bill that I can see that provides for
      dangerous machinery. That ought to be in. In the bill recommended by the majority of the
      committee the action applies to all persons. I can see no objection to that. I think it would
      be dangerous to apply this rule to corporations and companies and not apply it to persons; and
      it seems to me that would be unfair. The danger is in going too far--in going to an
      extreme.
     Mr. ROBERTS: I am for the minority report which applies only to corporations and companies.
      I am against the majority report which makes it apply to everybody. I dare say if you could
      see all the men in Indiana that are to-day cripples for life on account of the corporations
      and railroads of this State it would be truly astounding. The railroad companies do not pay
      one cent for their support and they have become a public charge after they have perhaps spent
      half their lives in the employ of these corporations. I say it is but just when men sacrifice
      their lives or lose their limbs, that the company should compensate them for the injuries
      received in its service. Whenever an employe is injured by the act of another employe the
      company should be responsible.
     Mr. FOSTER demanded the previous question.
     The demand was seconded, and by consent the vote on substituting the minority for the
      majority report was postponed till 10.30 o'clock to-morrow.
    
    
     PLUMBING OF THE STATE-HOUSE.
     Mr. FOLEY offered a resolution, which was adopted, providing for a committee of five to
      investigate the plumbing of the State-house.
    
    
     BILLS FOR ACTS WERE INTRODUCED BY
     Mr. Montgomery, of Gibson [H. R. 464]: To protect the funds of estates.
     Mr. Pleasants [H. R. 465]: To amend the law regulating the purchase of land on school-fund
      mortgages by the Auditor of State.
     Mr. Oursler [H. R. 466]: To prevent certain performances on Sunday.
     Mr. Buckles [H. R. 467]: To pay claim of George H. Fleming, O. W. Tyler and Cyrus T.
      Nixon.
    
    
     RAILROAD PASSES FOR JUDGES.
     Mr. Worrall's bill [H. R. 175] to render judges ineligible to try cases where a
      railroad company over whose road he passes free, is a party, was reported back with a majority
      report recommending its indefinite postponement and a minority report recommending its
      passage.
     Mr. WORRALL: The only point in this bill is this: When it is known in a law suit where a
      railroad company is a party, that the Judge who is to try that case has a pass over the
      railroad which is a party to the suit, that fact shall disqualify him. This is about the only
      point in the bill. We have had some little trouble in our circuit in regard to this matter and
      whether just or unjust some of us thought these little matters do affect judges. Personally I
      am not interested in the bill. It was drawn up by lawyers in my county and sent to me to be
      introduced, but I endorse the bill and think it ought to pass.
     Mr. ROBERTS: I think this is a good bill. It is for a consideration that these railroad
      passes are given. It is in effect intended as a bribe. I have carried them, I do not deny it,
      but when I found out the motive that governed the giving of them I considered it a corrupt
      practice to receive them and refused to receive them.--Judges are nothing more than human
      beings. It is an implied bribe and so intended when issued. On the second day of this session
      an agent of the railrays runing into this city came to the desks of members and wanted to know
      over what roads they desired passes. It was an indecent exhibition, and shows the lengths to
      which those companies will go to accomplish their purpose. They do not offer passes to private
      citizens. Not  they. Tell me what is the difference
      between having a pass given you, worth $500. a year to a man and his family, and having $500.
      in money given you? I am glad to know that the Congress of the United States has passed a law
      making it a high misdemeanor for any official to accept a railroad pass--thus branding the
      practice as infamous; and can we afford do less?
     Mr. GARDINER: I am opposed the substitution of the minority for the majority report. I am
      opposed to it because it is a charge that the Judges of the State of Indiana can be corrupted
      by such means as this; that they can be influenced in their ruling on questions during the
      progress of a trial. I repel the insinuation against the Judiciary of the State of Indiana. I
      have never known the time when a client of mine who had a case against a railroad company
      failed to obtain a verdict, when there was the least show for him. Why did I favor the bill
      the other day? (A bill to prohibit any officer to receive passes.) Because that bill said it
      should be a 
       misdemeanor
       misdemanor
       to give a railroad pass to any officer in the State of Indiana. That includes
      Judges, I was willing that the Judges should stand side by side with the clerk, the sheriff,
      and other officers, but when an attempt is made to single him out, I repel it is an insult to
      the Judiciary o the State. I repel it as vicious legislation that should never go on the
      statute books. Why single out the Judiciary and say that something more than the general
      statute is needed against it? I oppose it because there is a bill already before this House
      that covers the proposition involved in this one. It is unnecessary legislation.
     Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Owen: I am apposed to the minority, as I am opposed to the bill now
      pending. I do not think any officers ought to be influenced by a pass, and I don't think
      they are. I oppose it for the reason that passes come in very good play sometimes.
     Mr. GOUGE: I think there is no need of legislation of this character, but if there is why
      not go on and render a man incompetent who has ever ridden in a farmer's wagon or buggy,
      or who has ever been treated to a glass of good bourbon? There are hundreds of things that
      might render a Judge incompetent as well as passes. I do not think there is a Judge in this
      State that would decide in favor of a railroad because he had a railway pass.
     Mr. FOSTER: The gentleman from Daviess [Mr. Gardiner] says that he would not take away from
      the Judge the same right that other officers have. I would be glad if this bill covered all
      officers, but it does not, and because it does not cover that much is that any reason that we
      should repudiate what is there? No. Let us strike down the evil. I am heartily in favor of
      this bill. It meets my concurrence for several reasons. Public officers should be above taking
      a railroad pass from a corporation. I have traveled thousands and thousands of miles, and paid
      the railroads hundreds and hundreds of dollars, and never had them as much as give me a pass
      for a single mile, but as soon as the good people of Madison county sent me down here, they
      came around me and enquired, "Have you your transportation arranged?" I support the
      bill for the reason it is right.
     Mr. BERTRAM: The idea is preposterous that we have got to legislate to make the officials of
      our State honest. Gentlemen who have spoken, though they do not know that any judge was ever
      corrupted by this means, are afraid they will be; and it seems to me that this view prevails
      largely in their minds: that every judge in this State has his price fixed, and is willing to
      sell out to the first bidder. I am opposed to the minority report, and am in favor of the
      majority report. I am opposed to a bill that forbids any official from taking a pass.
     Mr. WORRALL: I did not desire to assail the honesty and integrity of any judge in the State
      of Indiana, but I desire to protect him in this matter. This is the main point in this bill.
        There is to-day brewing in the minds of the public a
      sort of a disrespect for the judicial tribunal. People say there is no use of appealing cases
      because we cannot get justice. We are all human. Human nature is all alike the world over, and
      we can only judge of the possibility that these matters may affect judges, as little matters
      affect us.
     Mr. SHAMBAUGH demanded the previous question.
     The demand was seconded, and under its operations a vote resulted in yeas 14, nays 47.
     No quorum voting--
     A recess was taken until 2 o'clock.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     There still being no quorum the session was occupied inreceiving and disposing of reports
      from committees--some bills were indefinitely postponed, some amended, and some ordered
      engrossed for the third reading.
    
   
   
   
    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    IN SENATE.
    
     WEDNESDAY, February 23, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Hon. W. J. Davis, a Senator from the county of
     Elkhart.
    
     BILLS FOR ACTS WERE INTRODUCED BY
     Mr. Logsdon [S. 329]: To amend Section 3327 of the R. S. of 1881, with reference to
      incorporation of towns.
     Mr. Smith, of Wells, [S. 330]: To pay the claims of Geo. R. Fleming, Cyrus T. Nixon and
      Orson M. Tyler.
     Mr. JOHNSON entered a motion to reconsider the vote by which the Senate passed the bill
       [S. 217] to provide for the taxation of building and
      loan associations.
    
    
     THE STATE PRISONS.
     The unfinished business was the consideration of the new prison-management bill, [S. 324]
      the question being on the motion to make it a special order for to-morrow at 10
      o'clock.
     Mr. FOWLER moved to amend the motion to postpone by recommitting the bill with instructions
      to so mend as to provide for one Board of Directors, to be elected by the General
      Assembly.
     The motion was rejected by yeas 13, nays 31.
     The motion to postpone was also rejected by yeas 11, nays 31.
     The committeee report was concurred in.
     Mr. CAMPBLL offered an amendment to the bill, providing for a board of four members, two of
      each political party, the Governor to have the casting vote in case of a tie. He said: I think
      that proposition will relieve the prison of its partisan character and result in a better and
      more economical management. I offer the amendment in good faith, and hope it will be
      adopted.
     Mr. SELLERS: The Governor has recommended that this Board shall be non-partisan, and I am
      sure we ought not to restrict him because it is supposed the Governor of Indiana will select
      the very best men for these positions. We have found it is impracticable for the Legislature
      to elect these officers; as I think every man will admit we have no opportunity to judge of
      their qualifications. That the Legislature has been deceived is not surprising, and is not to
      be wondered at.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: I am not a civil service reformer, but I believe a little
      non-partisan management of the method in the management of the benevolent institutions of the
      State will do good. They ought to have the very best men in the State to manage their affairs.
      I have a desire to look upon a man as being 
       hon
       hon-
      
       est until I see he is a scoundrel. There seems to be a
      demand by the best people--and the best people are largely in the majority--that these
      institutions shall be put under different control from what they have been in the past. There
      is a demand for it not only from the republican party, but from the democratic party, and from
      the whole people, that there shall be a more honorable and better government of these
      institutions. Therefore I believe no other course will be justified by the people than a fair
      and impartial non-partisan administration of the affairs of these institutions; and I
      sincerely hope this amendment will pass.
     Mr. HOWARD, of Decatur: I move that the special order be now suspended, and we proceed with
      the regular order.
     This motion was agreed to by yeas 25, nays 23--as follows:
     
      
       
        YEAS. Andrew, Bailey, Berry, Branaman, Cox, Day, Duncan (of Brown,) Fowler, French,
         Griffith, Howard (of Decatur,) Howard (of St. Joseph), Logsdon, McClure, McDonald,
         Mullinix, Schloss, Shively, Smith (of Wells,) Thompson (of Marion,) Tharp, Trippet,
         Urmston, Zimmerman, Mr. President. 25
        NAYS. Barrett, Campbell, Davis, DeMotte, Drake, Dresser, Duncan (of Tipton,) Ensley,
         Hale, Harness, Huston, Johnson, Kennedy, Macy, Marshall, Moon, Peterson, Rahm, Schroyer,
         Sears, Sellers, Winter, Weir. 23
       
      
     
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore, when called upon to vote, said: For the reason that I believe
      this bill in its present condition will simply provoke discussion, and so amount to nothing,
      and that the friends of the bill may get together and formulate a bill that will meet the
      emergency of the case, I vote "aye."
     Mr. MCDONALD, asking that his name may be again called, said: For the
      reasons stated by the president I vote "aye."
     Mr. MULLINIX, requiring his name to be called again, said "aye."
     Mr. BARETT: Call my name. There seems to be a number of Senators in favor of a measure of
      this kind, who desire further consideration of this bill, and I would be glad that they may be
      given an opportunity to consider the amendments that may be offered. I do not desire for
      myself any further time, and thinking the bill ought to be promptly passed, I am compelled to
      vote "no."
     The result was announced as above.
    
    
     ORDER OF BUSINESS.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The regular order is bills on the second reading. We haven't
      been out of Wednesday's order for two weeks. There are in the neighborhood of 200 Senate
      bills on the second reading. I think I am right.
     On motion by Mr. RAHM, his bill [S. 61] for an appropriation for repairs the three new
      Insane Asylums, was taken up, the committee report concurred in, and the bill ordered
      engrossed.
     Mr. BAILEY: We have a large number of bills on the second reading and can't get at
      anything in this way. I move we proceed to the passage of bills--to the consideration of
      Senate bills on the third reading.
     Mr. WINTER: This is Wednesday, and we must proceed with the order Wednesday under the rule.
      [See page 24 of this book--top of second column.]
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: I don't think it is an intelligent rule anyhow. The rule is
      not well defined and it requires construction.
     Mr. SMITH, of Wells: I think new Senators should be given a chance. They ought to have some
      show to get their bills engrossed. Hundreds of bills have only been reported back from
      committees, and are waiting a second reading. I think it is due to the new members of the
      Senate that this order shall be followed up, and give us a fair show.
     Mr. WEIR: I believe justice should be done to meritorious bills. Inasmuch as we have already
      commenced bills on the second reading we should continue that order. I make that motion.
     
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: It is not necessary to be determined by a motion. It is a question of
      the construction to be given this rule. The chair is going to put a construction upon it, and
      if the Senate does not think the chair decides it right, it can decide it for itself. I think
      it an unreasonable construction to say that when we get in a certain order of business we
      shall remain there like a vessel in a whirlpool, and never get out. The chair will decide that
      this rul reaches from one Wednesday to another, and then take another start.
     Mr. WEIR: I move we suspend that rule, and take up Senate bills on the second reading, and
      continue until they are exhausted.
     Mr. SELLERS: I am opposed to that. If we are to spend a day or two longer in reading bills
      on the second reading this Senate will adjourn without giving the House an opportunity to pass
      the bills we have been discussing. There are but a few Senate bills on the third reading, but
      there are nearly 200 pending the second reading.
     The motion [Mr. 
       Wier's
       Weir's
      ] was rejected by yeas 18, nays 23.
     Accordingly, the Senate proceeded to the consideration of Senate bills on the third
      reading.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     HUNTING ON WET LANDS.
     Mr. Zimmerman's bill [S. 11] to amend Section
      2110 R. S. was then taken up.
     Mr. ZIMMERMAN said: The section referred to makes it unlawful to hunt or shoot on any
      enclosed lands. The bill proposes to amend the section so as to except wet or overflowed
      lands. Chicago capitalists have bought immense tracts of these lands in the northern part of
      the State--hundreds and thousands of acres--and by stretching a single wire around them they
      prohibit our people from fishing or hunting on them. It was to prevent the monopoly of hunting
      that is enjoyed in Europe, where the hunting and fishing grounds are kept for the pleasure of
      nabobs, that the bill was introduced.
     Mr. JOHNSON: There are a great many men who hunt for sport who don't know how to behave
      themselves on the farmer's lands, and there are some who can do so without laying down
      fences or stealing chickens, but there are others who leave down fences, and commit other
      depredations, and the object of the law is to put it in the power of the farmer to prosecute
      these trespassers and punish them. The statute does not make it a offense for any one to go on
      unenclosed lands. There is, as is well known, in the northern part of the State, a large
      portion of overflowed lands not avaliable for agricultural purposes. There are sportsmen in
      Chicago who buy up large bodies of these lands, run a sort of fence about them, and exclude
      the people of Indiana from hunting or fishing on that land. I think this bill is in the
      interest of the people.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: Some parties have leased a tract of land six miles up and
      down the Kankakee river, and they keep men on these lands to drive off the citizens of the
      State who attempt to go on their tracts. In other words they have already gained control of a
      large body of what is known as hunting lands, and are steadily progressing toward the control
      of more. It has become a nuisance. It is an unwarranted infringement upon the rights of the
      people. The law as it now stands protecting proper enclosures, was not meant to protect these
      fenced marshes, but such is the case. I think the bill is reasonable.
     Mr. WEIR: Many thousands of acres of these lands have been purchased by sporting clubs, they
      run a single wire around the lands, and every little while people of our State are arrested
      and brought before Justices of the Peace and prosecuted for trespass. If there is opposition
      to this measure I will have something more to say.
     Mr. HOWARD, of St. Joseph: I desire to say, in addition to what has been said, that within
      the limits of this wire stretched around there lands referred to, they charge sportsmen two
      dollars a day for the privi-  lege of hunting. I believe
      it is a discrimination against the sportsmen of this State. They stretch these wires about
      large tracts of land for the purpose of taxing citizens of this State for the privilege of
      hunting and fishing.
     Mr. FOWLER: Now I hope this bill will not pass. It seems to me a most outrageous bill. I
      want to know why, if a man owns property, though he may have bought it for the purpose of
      hunting on it, if he has not the same right to protect it that the Senator from Laporte has to
      protect his farm? This bill strikes down that, and although you may own the land, it says it
      shall be sporting ground to anybody that comes on it! I believe a man should have control of
      his own property, I don't care what kind of property it is. The law as it now stands is
      good enough.
     Mr.HOWARD of St. Joseph: I believe this bill is in the interest of the people. It is one of
      the worst kind of monopoly to keep large bodies of land for the sole purpose of hunting on
      them. Much of the land in the north part of the State is wet land, and our people are
      interested in this matter. They don't wish corporations to obtain possession of lands by
      lease or by purchase for these purposes. I think the bill should certainly pass. I think it an
      outrage that such people should be permitted to come in there. They do not come for the
      purpose of increasing the revenues of the State, but merely to keep the people of the State
      away from these lands, which are of no use except for hunting and fishing.
     The bill passed by yeas 37, nays 2.
    
    
     BRIBERY AT PRIMARIES.
     The substitute for bills 27 and 68 [S. 68] to maintain political purity and authorize
      primary elections, was read the third time.
     Mr. MCDONALD: I will never vote for a bill that has the word
      "paster" in it. It is a fraud and an outrage. A fraud upon honest men and a fraud
      upon the people generally.
     Mr. THARP: A man under this bill would be afraid to do anything. It would be almost
      impossible for a man to obtain a nomination, and be elected without some one would prosecute
      him under this bill. It is too stringent.
     Mr. FOWLER: I would vote for this bill and endorse everything in it if I thought it would
      remedy a single evil it proposes to remedy. I am opposed to putting on the statute book a law
      every man knows will not be observed.
     Mr. MACY: Don't you know that in Ohio they passed a law similar to this, and it has
      proved to be of vast benefit?
     Mr. FOWLER: I didn't know that. Anyway I am opposed to this bill.
     Mr. HARNESS: One word merely, in reply to the Senator from Owen [Mr. Fowler]. I am in favor
      of this bill, which points in the direction of reform. It is aid it will not prevent
      corruption of the ballot-box. Does he not know that a law similar to the 14th section of this
      bill has in some States in this Union worked absolute wonders? The territory of Nevada passed
      a law that no voter except the one to cast a vote should approach within 50 feet of the
      ballot-box; and it had the effect of absolutely preventing the purchase and sale of votes;
      because no man will buy a vote except he sees that vote delivered. It occurs to me no man in
      favor of fair elections should hesitate to take this step; no such man should hestitate on the
      floor of this Senate to cast his vote or let his voice go out in favor of this bill, and in
      every step that is in the interest of fair elections.
     On motion by Mr. MCDONALD the bill was amended by striking out the words
      "paster."
     Mr. KENNEDY: I am in favor of the purity of the ballot-box, and I think the best way to stop
      the impurity of the ballot-box is to make the salaries of officers so low that they will have
      nothing to spare to buy votes with.
     Mr. BARRETT: I don't believe any speech-making on this bill will do any good, or
      influence the vote of any Senator. A Senator who has not seen the necessity of some such bill is a mere tyro in politics. I think every good citizen
      will agree with me that we cannot throw too many safeguards around the purity of the
      ballot-box. Conceding there is a necessity for further safe-guards around the ballot-box, the
      only argument I have heard advanced against this bill is it will not be enforced. If it is not
      enforced, it is the fault of the people. I trust this law will be put on the statute book, so
      that office-holders will not come to the General Assembly with the plea that their fees must
      not be reduced because they must use money to procure their nomination and election. No excuse
      can be offered in justification of such conduct. Let us give the people an opportunity to
      enforce this law, and stop the lavish use of money at election times, which has become a dark
      spot upon the good name of the people of this State.
     Mr. LOGSDON: Suffice it to say I am heartily in favor of the provisions of this bill, and am
      exceedingly anxious it may become a law. It has been insisted upon this floor, Mr. President,
      that there is no necessity for Legislation of this kind; in other words that Legislation of
      this kind is a dead letter upon the statute book, and cannot be enforced. I feel, Mr.
      President that enforcement of law depends to a great extent upon public opinion, and I feel
      that public opinion is being aroused to such an extent concerning frauds in elections, that a
      law of this kind will meet with the approval of public sentiment. The purchaser will not be
      satisfied with the mere promise of a man who is base enough to sell his vote, but will provide
      some means by which he can see and know that a man who for a consideration agrees to give a
      vote carries out that promise and fulfills it to the letter; therefore the seller will be
      watched from the time he leaves the secret hiding place until the ticket leaves his hand and
      is placed int he ballot box. Therefore if some law could be enacted by means of which that
      conduct could be prevented, it seems to me we have reached a point that will tend to prevent
      corruption at the ballot-box. The provisions of the 14th section are intended to allow a man
      to go free and untrameled to the ballot-box, and he shall not be asked to show his ticket so
      it can be seen whether or not he is voting as he promised; but he is left free to vote and
      exercise his own free will without any restraint.
     The bill passed by yeas 41, nays 2.
     Mr. MULLINIX saying, when called upon to vote: Believing it is our duty to support any
      measure that has a tendency to purify the ballot-box and make better our election laws, I vote
      "aye."
     Mr. SELLERS, from a Committee of Free Conferene on the disagreement
      between two Houses on his bill [S. 208] concerning voluntary associations, made a report which
      was concurred in.
     Mr. FOWLER, [at 3.35 o'clock:] I move the Senate adjourn.
     Mr. HUSTON: I claim the right to be heard on a question of privilege. I claim the right to
      be heard before the motion is put to adjourn.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The chair decides the motion to adjourn is ahead of your question of
      privilege. [He declared the motion carried while Mr. HUSTON denounced it as a "a cowardly
      act," "the act of an "usurper," and said: "He is afraid to meet it
      and make an honest fight," etc, etc.; and Mr. DEMOTTE said: "I
      took it up and read it to him, and he told me he wasn't afraid of it, to bring it
      on," etc, etc., with similar expressions of disapproval from other Republican
      Senators.]
     So the Senate adjourned.
    
   
   
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
    
     WEDNESDAY, February 23, 1887.
    
    
     SOLDIERS MONUMENT.
     Mr. GARDINER called up the bill [S. 3] for the
      erection of a State Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, or a Memorial Hall, from the
      proceeds of the sale of $200,000 worth of State bonds to be made payable in twenty years.
     
     This motion was agreed to, and the bill was read the first time.
     Mr. GARDINER moved that the constitutional rule be suspended and the bill be read the second
      and third times and put upon its passage now.
     Mr. JEWETT hoped this woudd not be done, as he wanted to offer an amendment, to make a small
      appropriation for a monument in the Soldier's cemetery at New Albany.
     The House refused to second the motion to suspend the rules by a standing vote of 36 to
      42.
     Mr. JEWETT moved to refer the bill to the committee on military affairs,
      with instructions to report tomorrow at 9.30 a.m., when it shall be made a special order.
     Mr. BUCKLES offered an amendment instructing the committee to report back a substitute bill,
      providing for the building of a farm-home for disabled soldiers and their widows and orphans,
      in the central portion of the State, instead of a monument.
     Mr. COX, of Miami: I hope that amendment will be adopted. I have been in favor of this bill
      until I went home and talked with the soldiers in my county, and I found they were almost
      unanimously in favor of building a Soldiers' and Sailors Home, instead of this monument.
      That certainly would be the right thing to do. It would certainly look like mockery to build a
      long shaft pointing toward heaven, while some of these persons are in the poor house.
     Mr. GARDINER: I hope the gentleman's (Mr. Buckles') amendment will not be adopted.
      The representatives of the soldier's organizations in various parts of the State adopted
      unanimously a resolution in favor of this bill, and a mass meeting of soldiers also adopted
      similar resolutions. The soldiers are asking for this bill, and nothing else. If we propose to
      represent the soldiers and redeem the pledges in the platforms of both parties, we should pass
      this bill.
     Mr. REYNOLDS: I hope the committee will have these instructions, and that a bill will be
      reported which will be of practical benefit to the living, and also a monument that will
      perpetuate the memory of these men who went out in the dark days of the war and fought and
      bled and died for their country. It seems to me, with the gentleman from Miami (Mr. Cox) that
      it would be hollow mockery to pile up a mass of stone and mortar in a monument when there are
      a goodly number of these men in the poor-houses of Indiana. The gentleman from Daviess (Mr.
      Gardiner) says the demand of the soldiers is unanimous for it. It may be in some sections, but
      I want to say it is not in my section. I talked with a number of men from my county on this
      question, and not one single one of them favor the erection of a monument as is contemplated
      in this Senate bill. No man has a higher regard for the soldiers than I have. They have made
      for themselves a record that is as fadeless as the sun. But if we must spend $200,000, let us,
      as the amendment proposes, erect a home with all the pleasant and modern conveniences, that
      these old soldiers may have a place in which to die. The number of dependent soldiers is
      rapidly increasing, and will increase from this on; therefore we should give them a home, and
      we should take into consideration the present condition of our finance in deciding this
      question. A monument of this kind can add nothing to the comfort of the widow of a dead
      soldier or his child. It cannot feed them, or clothe them, or educate them. If we are able to
      do this, let us do that which will be benefical to the living. Therefore let us appropriate
      money to something that will bring happiness and comfort to the living.
     Mr. COMMONS: I hope the members of this House will not believe that Wayne county is opposed
      to this bill. I have in my hands a communication from a post of that county instructing me to
      vote for this monument. My colleague (Mr. Reynolds) may represent the minority, but I feel
      that I represent the majority, and I shall vote for this bill.
     
     Mr. 
       LINCK
       LINK
      : I feel that when a man speaks against this bill he speaks against those who made it
      possible for us to have a government. I was surprised to hear the gentleman from Wayne
      (Mr.Reynolds) make the speech he did. He says the soldiers want a home. I say the soldiers do
      not want a home, and I believe I speak the almost unanimous sentiment of the soldiers. The
      government has provided a better house than we can provide, and I say it is not necessary. The
      soldiers do not want a home. They want a monument. Why? Not simply to commemorate their deeds;
      but it will be to the young men who come after us an inspiration to grander and higher
      sentiment. This is a duty we owe to the soldiers. It is a duty we owe to the people of
      Indiana. The poor South, scarcely able to maintain herself, has built monuments in every large
      city; and shall we be behind them? We have delayed this long enough I say that this bill
      should be passed, and that this amendment should be defeated; and I hope it will be.
     Mr. BROWN: It seems to me that this amendment is for the purpose of defeating any
      legislation on this subject. The gentleman from Wayne (Mr. Reynolds) wants to appear as an
      economist. He is strongly in favor of building a home at the cost of $200,000, but for
      economy's sake is opposed to a monument. The National Government has provided a home for
      every poor soldier. The gentleman (Mr. Reynolds) says he voices the sentiment of his county. I
      take it that the voice of his county has not come to him, knowing that he has been opposed to
      every such measure from the beginning of this legislation. Mr. Commons voices the sentiment of
      the people of that county.
     Mr. CONDER: I was present at the G. A. R. convention when the resolution in favor of this
      bill was passed, and I did not hear a dissenting voice among all the delegates that assembled
      there, representing about 500 posts in the State of Indiana, and a membership of some 20,000
      or more,--more than a majority of the soldiers now living the State of Indiana. I think I
      speak the sentiment of the soldiers when I say I they want a monument erected. They want
      something erected that will be a lasting monument of the acts and deeds and valor of those men
      who went out in the days of '61 and fought for their country I think this amendent was
      gotten up for the purpose of killing the bill, and I hope the House will vote it down.
     Mr. KLEIN made an infeffectual demand for the previous question.
     Mr. GOUGH: I have heard it stated that there are no soldiers in this State who are opposing
      this monument. I have the honor of belonging to a Grand Army Post, and I wrote to that post on
      this subject. I have a letter from that post which says that the soldiers are not in favor of
      the State building a monument at this time. This monument will do no good to the men who lie
      buried on the Southern battlefields. Then why do we want a monument? Simply to gratify a
      little State pride; and this is all there is of it; so that when strangers from abroad come to
      our capital we may look at a great shaft pointing to the heavens and say: "This a
      monument to the soldiers of the State of Indiana." It is for this purpose, and this
      purpose alone that the State of Indiana is asked at this time to spend this money. I would
      like to see such a shaft erected at this capital to commemorate the deeds of the dead, but I
      say it is not now good policy, and for that reason I will oppose this bill. There may a time
      come, and the time will come, when we could consistently do this.
     Mr. GRIFFITHS: The gentleman from Warrick (Mr. Gough) asks what good a monument could do,
      and says that it is a mere sentiment. My answer to that is that a monument will commemorate
      the virtues of the men who were willing when this nation was in the throes of a great death
      struggle, to go forth and battle for the salvation of the Union. It is true that the soldiers
      of the late war do not need a monument in stone or bronze or marble to perpetate  their virtues, but this is no reason why the people of INdiana
      should hesitate longer to build this monument. It is said that a farm should be purchased and
      a soldiers' home built. If this is done we will soon reach the period when there would be
      no one to occupy the building, we want a monument that will stand for all time like Bunker
      Hill monument. To such a monument some patroitic mother in the dark days that may come, might
      bring her child and tell to him the story of heroic deeds and fire his sould with patroitic
      zeal. It seems to me that democrats and republicans alike should be eager to assist in the
      passage of this bill. The gentleman fom Warrick says he has a letter from some individual post
      opposing this bill. Perhaps some posts do not want it, but that is not the sentiment of the
      Grand Army of the Republic. They want a monument erected; they do not want a Soldiers Home;
      and therefore I hope the bill will pass in its present form without any amendment.
     Mr. 
       THOMPSON
       THOMPSON
      : 10 years ago a prominent man of this State offered $10,000 to help erect a soldiers
      monument here. The State was in a better condition than it is to-day to build a monument, but
      the project was defeated because it was said to be an unnecessary expense. I say it is wrong
      for this legislature to put this burden on the people. It is a burden that they will not
      suffer. It would be a nice thing for the people of Indianapolis; but the question is, is this
      the proper time to do it? I have been a soldier, and feel as much interested in the soldiers
      as any gentleman on this floor, but knowing the financial condition of the State I cannot
      support this measure at this time.
     Mr. HOBSON did not believe that there was any one on the democratic side of the House who
      would dare vote against this movement to commemorate the deeds of the brave boys who went
      forth to do battle for the Union.
     Mr. PARKER: I suppose it is hardly necessary at this state of the game to make any remarks
      on this proposition, but I want to say I have never been instructed by the posts of my county.
      They told me to exercise my own judgment in this matter, and I want to say that my own
      judgment is to vote for this bill.
     Mr. BRIANT: In regard to this matter my views were at first in favor of a monumental home,
      but as chairman of the committee I have received letters from all over the State asking for a
      monument, and I am willing to favor their desires. There is another point; they talk about the
      expenditure of $200,000. I do not believe there is a man in the State of Indiana who would
      deny a request for 50 cents to put up a monument for the soldiers, and I do not think they
      would object to this appropriation. These are my views. I do not believe a man can go home and
      be blamed in the least for voting for this monument.
     Mr. BUCKLES: I don't allow any man to entertain a higher esteem for the men who fought,
      bled and died for this country in suppressing the rebellion than I do. I believe the soldiers
      who founght, bled and died for this country were the best set of soldiers that God ever
      produced. Believing that, when I undertake to do anything for their benefit I want to do
      something that will do them some good. Suppose these poor soldiers who died on the battlefield
      could be here to-day, and we could ask them, "which would you prefer, a monument or a
      soldiers' home, where the poor widows and children of soldiers can be taken care
      of?" Each would say, "give me a home for my wife and children." If we are going
      to spend $200,000 in our present financial condition, in God's name let us spend it for
      something that will do some good instead of building something at a cost of $200,000 of no
      earthly practical benefit except to the city of Indianapolis.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     Mr. GARDINER: The gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Buckles) says  that we need a farm home for the use of the soldiers, while the
      fact stares us in the face that in a few years longer there will be none of them left. It is
      said that after while will do to build this monument. This after while is like the
      children's to-morrow, it never comes. For a quarter of a century the brave boys, 200,000
      strong, that went out to battle for their country, of which 20,0O0 of them have never
      returned, and whose bleached bones lie scattered all over the south, have waited for the
      people of Indiana to build a monument in memory of the deeds done by these glorious heroes of
      the State. The plea is to-day, "let us wait still longer." When will the time come
      the legislature shall be ready by its unanimous voice to build a monument to commemorate the
      deeds of our heroic dead? There was a time, when that grand leader, whose monument stands in
      yonder park, could have spoken the word, "one dollar a piece shall be devoted to this
      purpose by the State of Indiana," and the thing would have been done.
     Oh for the touch of the vanished hand, A sound from a voice that is
      stilled."
     Already this bill has passed a democratic Senate without one single dissenting vote. It
      comes here and ingeniously an effort is made to produce dissention in the republican ranks,
      that they may go to the people in the next campaign, and say that a democratic Senate passed
      the bill, and that the republicans are opposed to the soldiers. Is Indiana poor? Is she poor?
      With 2,400,000 of the bravest and of the handsomest men and women that grace God's
      footstool; with eight hundred millions of teeming wealth, and with a pitiful debt of five or
      six million dollars if I believed for one moment that the building of a monument of this
      character would take from the soldiers one single draught of water, or deprive a
      soldier's widow or orphan of a single bit of bread I would be opposed to the enactment of
      this law. I believe if you purchase a farm, that the noble women will not leave their
      firesides, their friends and associations, and take up their homes at such a place. You could
      not keep them there with a police force, making it their duty to remain. Such homes should be
      maintained by the government of the United States, and they are being carried on to the glory
      and good name of the government. They are in existence, and they are equal to all the wants of
      the soldiers. The nation has not been slow in taking care of her children; in taking care of
      her crippled and indigent soldier; neither has she been slow in making provision for their
      widows and orphans. Dare I talk about the abstract question of monuments? It has been said
      that they do no good; that you cannot help the man who is dead and gone; that the monument
      cannot feed the hungry; that it cannot satisfy the thirsty; that they care naught for the pile
      of stone and mortar that tells no tale; that makes no impression upon the human heart; that it
      is the mere gratification of our personal vanity and possibly our State pride. Is this true?
      Is it true that when you stand among the pyramids of Egypt, or stand at the foot of Bunker
      Hill monument that you feel no nobler impression than this? Monuments are not the conception
      of man. They have their origin in the eternal rocks of ages, created by the hand of God
      Almighty. When we stand in the Alps or the Andes and look at the peaks of these great shafts
      of God; or stand by the side of the roaring cataract of Niagara do we not feel a new
      inspiration coming upon us? They are to impress the living; the coming generations; the boys
      upon whos patriotism depends the governments' life. I believe that if these amendments shall
      prevail it is the end of the consideration of this bill.
     Mr. GOUGH offered an additional amendment that the committee should report a tax of 1 mill
      on the $100, which in a few years would raise the necessary funds for the monument.
     Mr. STUBBLEFIELD: I had no idea that there was any man on this floor who would oppose this
      bill. During this discussion it has been argued that the
      amendments proposed by the gentlemen should be adopted in order that there might be a home
      prepared for the disabled and poverty-stricken soldiers now living, and their widows and
      orphans. As the gentleman from Daviess (Mr. Gardiner) says this government has not been slow
      in providing the means for the worn out soldiers and their widows and orphans. Provision has
      been made for all that would avail themselves of it.
     Mr. SCOTT demanded the previous question.
     The demand was seconded, and under its operations the amendment to the amendment (Mr.
      Gough's) was rejected by yes 29, nays 63.
     Pending the roll call--
     Mr. ACKMAN, in explanation of his vote, said: Because the session is so near the close, I
      believe that if we adopt any amendment to the bill it will defeat its passage, I vote
      "no."
     Mr. COX, of Miami, [explaining]: I shall vote as I do upon this amendment for the reason
      that I am opposed to all amendments except the one that proposed to substitute a bill
      providing for a soldier's home instead of a monument. If that is not to be adopted I am
      opposed to all other amendments, therefore I vote "no."
     Mr. DAVIS, explaining, said: I have frequently stated that I was opposed to this bill, and I
      have received instructions from every post of the G.A. R. except one in my county instructing
      me to vote against this bill. But I do not believe that the posts at present understand
      affairs as they are now. Believing that the object of this amendment is to defeat the bill I
      vote "no."
     Mr. GOUGH said: I would like to see this bill amended, but if I cannot get it with the
      amendment I shall vote for it without. I think we can amend this bill by 10 o'clock
      to-morrow morning, and pass it by 11 o'clock, simply providing that the State will be
      required to borrow money to build this monument. I vote "aye."
     Mr. GROSE, when his name was called, said: The maintainance of soldiers is a duty that
      belongs properly to the general government, and the general government has provided for their
      widows and orphans. I vote "no."
     Mr. MAJOR, in explanation of his vote, said: From the fact that I think the amendment
      offered by the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Buckles) contains the most patriotic idea that the
      House has expresed this session, I vote "no" on this amendment.
     Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Owen, said: I favor a monument erected to the memory of the soldiers, yet
      I am not in favor of voting $200,000 at this time for that purpose, therefore I vote
      "aye."
     Mr. PARKER, when called upon to vote, said: Because I am in favor of the bill without any
      change or amendment of any kind whatever, I vote "no."
     Mr. VAN SLYKE, [explaining]: I want to say that I am in favor of a $200,000 monument,
      nothing more and nothing less. I am not in favor of this amendment. The boys that went out in
      those dark and crimson days, with a patriotism as broad as our prairies, as vast as our
      forests, as bounteous as our rivers, as strong as our iron, and as enduring as our everlasting
      hills, ought to be honored in this great State of ours with a $200,000 monument. Therefore I
      vote "no."
     The vote was announced as above.
     So Mr. Gough's amendment was rejected.
     Mr. Buckles amendment was also rejected by yeas 35, nays 61.
     Pending the roll call--
     Mr. COX, of Miami, said: I shall vote as I do, upon this proposition,--not out of any
      hositility to the monument bill but only to determine whether or not it shall be best, after
      the committee consider this question, that a soldier's home shall be erected. If they
      determine that scheme is not proper, then I should be for the monument bill, I vote
      "aye."
     
     Mr. KELLISON, explaining his vote, said: Because I believe that a home erected for the
      benefit of the soldiers of Indiana would be more of a home in the State of Indiana than in
      Ohio or any other State in the Union; and because I believe that every soldier in Indiana
      ought to have the best possible home; because I believe that a home is worth more to them
      while living than a monument when dead, I vote "ayae."
     Mr. JEWETT, when called upon to vote, said: We have been treated very shabbily upon this
      side of the House. The majority quarreled most of the morning, and again this afternoon, and
      then moved the previous question. Now I favor the monument; but I believe it is better policy
      to raise the money by a tax instead of borrowing. I am in not in favor of erecting a
      soldier's home that is not asked for, I vote "no."
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the amendment was rejected.
     The motion to refer (Mr. Jewett's) was also rejected.
     On motion by Mr. GARDINER the constitutional restriction was dispensed with--yeas 70, nays
      23.--The bill was read the second and third time, and under the operations of previous
      question finally passed by yeas 81, nays 15.
     Mr. BARNES saying: As I am aware there are a number of soldiers in the State of Indiana who
      need a home; and from the fact that the finances of the State of Indiana to-day do not warrant
      the spending this amount of money for a monument, my conscience will not allow me to vote for
      this bill, I therefore vote "no."
     Mr. BLINKS, when his name was called, said: Because I believe that the fame of Indiana
      soldiers and sailors is placed so high on the country's scroll that it cannot be
      detracted from; neither can any monument, in my opinion at this time, give inspiration to
      those who may come after us; because I believe that when the emergency rises, if it ever does,
      that this government can rely upon the patriotism of the people; and because I do not believe
      this a proper time for the erection of this monument; and not because I am opposed to it, I
      vote "no."
     Mr. BUCKLES, in explanation of his vote, said: Inasmuch as I have been unable to get what I
      want for the soldiers I propose to take the next best thing, I vote "aye."
     Mr. COX, of Miami, [explaining]: I shall vote as I do because I regard this as an act of
      justice from a great State, to those men who freely offered up their lives that their country
      might be saved. I do not care for party measures when a matter of 
       justice
       justic
       to the soldiers of the republic is concerned. If we cannot have a soldiers home or a
      memorial hall built, then let us have the next best thing; let us have this monument of
      granite and marble, here in the capital of a great State. I don't want a two for a cent
      monument in New Albany, or any other place. I vote "aye."
     Mr. GORDON said: I have not been instructed by my constituents how I should vote except from
      one post of the Grad Army. I do not know how the majority of my people desire me to vote. I
      can therefore follow only my own judgment. Believing that this matter has not been fully and
      completely discussed apd understood by the people of the State; and not believing that there
      is any general demand in the State, it occurs to me that I cannot vote for this measure
      without knowing more of the wishes of my people. I vote "no."
     Mr. GROVES said, when his name was called: This is the first time I have risen to explain my
      vote. I would greatly have preferred that a tax had been levied to meet this expense, but I
      have made up my mind to support the bill. I therefore vote "aye."
     Mr. IBACH [explaining]: I believe that every man upon this floor has heard from his people
      what they want. He heard of it during the canvas; his party told him what was expected from
      him. I am sorry that this bill is not like the House bill, but as it is utterly impossible to
      get everything we would like to have, therefore having been instructed to vote  for a soldier's monument, I vote "aye."
     Mr. JEWETT, when called upon to vote, said: I very much desired to have an amendment to this
      bill, but as I have always been in favor of it, I vote "aye."
     Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Owen, said: I vote my own sentiments. Since seeing the G. A. R. here last
      week quite a number have requested me to vote against this measure, believing that the
      treasury was not in condition now to stand it. I have always been in favor of erecting a
      monument, but at this time I am opposed to taking $200,000 out of the people's pockets
      for that purpose. I cannot conscientiously vote for this bill, I therefore vote
      "no."
     Mr. NIBLACK, when his name was called, said: I have some amendments that I would like to
      have made to this bill. In its present shape I am instructed by the G. A. R. posts of my city
      to vote against this bill. I believe it costs too much; $200,000 is too much to be
      appropriated now when we have to go in debt for the amount. I believe it will cost $500,000 to
      complete this monument. Before it is done it will be in this respect like the new Insane
      Asylums. I vote "no."
     Mr. PARKER, [in explanation]: So far as I know I am not instructed to vote for or against
      this bill. I know that a large number of the G. A. R. men in my county are in favor of it. I
      am in favor of this bill because I believe it is right; because I believe it is due to the men
      who fought for their country; because it tends to cultivate a patriotic sentiment; I vote
      "aye."
     Mr. PATTON said: For the reason that this is a bill for the purpose of furnishing an
      ornament to the city of Indianapolis, and the further reason that the living soldiers of the
      State of Indiana are burdened by a debt, and taxation is increasing every day; for the reason
      that I was a soldier and think it is not right to thus contribute money that comes through the
      hands of politicians, I vote "no."
     Mr. PIERCE, when called upon to vote, said: I was among the first counted as being a friend
      to the soldiers. I have concluded to do that which I think is the best for us to do, as I am
      one of the soldiers that went to the war. I vote "aye."
     Mr. REYNOLDS [in explanation]: I have made as gallant a fight as I could againt this bill.
      While I still adhere to my views in regard to the impropriety of this monument, but yielding
      to the fact that it is a demand from the party to which I belong, I vote "aye."
     Mr. ROBERTS said there had not been a moment since he occupied a seat in this hall but that
      he had been firmly resolved, in obedience to the sentiments of the patriotic people he had the
      honor to represent, to vote for a measure to erect a suitable monument to commemorate the
      valor and patriotism of the soldiers of the Union Army in the late war. He had hesitated only
      as to the proper method (with an eye to the bankrupt condition of the State Treasury,) to be
      adopted to secure means with which to build the monument. He had believed, and still believed,
      it would have been better to pass an act assessing a low tax that would result in the
      accumulation of $200,000 at the end of five or six years, which would have cast but a slight
      burden upon the people each year, instead of borrowing money at a rate of interest that would
      burden them for many years to come. But as the House had rejected all suggestions of this
      character he now cheerfully voted "aye."
     Mr. ROBINSON said he voted for the amendment becauses he wished to aid the poor and needy
      soldiers who got 50 cents a day. But he would not oppose the bill, and he voted
      "aye."
     Mr. STUBBLEFIELD Wished to see a monument erected to the dear ones who had gone before. He
      voted "aye."
     Mr. WEYAND, in explaining his vote, said: I am in favor of doing all honor to the soldiers
      and to the memory of 
       soldiers
       solders
      . I came here instructed by the people, yet from a business stand point, considering
      the condition of the finances of our State  Treasury, I do
      not think this is the time for this expenditure, because we have soldiers' widows and
      orphans in poor houses, I do not believe it is proper to build a monument of this kind, I vote
      "no."
     Mr. WHITE, when his name was called, said: Individually I am opposed to this bill. I believe
      it is unwise and ill-advised to pass it at this time, but inasmuch as the party to which I
      belong is in favor of this bill, I vote "aye."
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the bill finally passed.
     Those voting against the bill were Messrs Barnes, Bensley, Blinks, Oates, Darrock, Gordon,
      Kellison, Mackey, Mock, Montgomery of Owen, Niblack, Patton, Pleasants, Thompson and
      Weyand.
    
    
     STATE BENEVOLENT INSTITUTIONS.
     On motion by Mr. Griffiths the bill [H. R. 247] for the appointment of non-partisan boards
      forthe benevolent institutions was read the third time.
     Mr. GROSE: I believe now that had we had such a Board as this bill provides we would have no
      need of the recent committee examinations. They would have been entirely useless. These
      institutions would have stood like the Reformatory and the Orphans" Home at Knightstown,
      and we would not have had to inquire into the management of them. It is due to our people, it
      is due to justice, that this measure be passed.
     Under the operations of the previous question demanded by Mr. GRIFFITHS, the bill passed by
      yeas 58, nays 37.
     Pending the roll call--
     Mr. BEASLEY said: I have been at all times a Democrat. I have opposed at all times mugwumps
      and civil service; but as this bill only applies to the benevolent institutions whose inmates
      appeal to every sense of manhood; and believing if this bill should become a law that, for the
      time being at least, we would have a better administration of these institutions, I vote
      "aye."
     Mr. GARRISON [explaining]: I would be content that the selection of these trustees should be
      placed in the hands of the Governor of the State, but I am opposed to this bill, therefore I
      vote "no."
     Mr. JEWETT, when called upon to vote, said: The greatest scandal that has come over this
      State for years, it seems, according to the public prints, is that charged against the warden
      of the State Prison South, and he was selected by a non-partisan board. A Democrat and a
      Republican elected Howard. I vote "no."
     Mr. KLINE, in explanation of his vote, said: I believe the Democrats are going to be in
      power and I want to keep the Republicans in, I therefore vote "aye."
     Mr. ROBISON [explaining]: Because usually the ladies of the country have as pronounced
      convictions politically as do the gentlemen, and therefore this board, which is said to be
      non-partisan, would be strictly partisan, and as the Governor's politics would be, so
      would be the mnajority of that board; and as the bill does not state that no two shall be of
      the same political party; and for the reason that a board thus constructed is a political
      board of the mugwump species, I vote "no."
     Mr. THOMPSON, when called upon to vote, said: This bill provides for too many officers;
      three for each institution, which makes eighteen. I think these institutions could be
      controlled by a less number of officers than this bill provides for, but under the present
      circumstances I vote "aye."
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the bill passed the House.
    
    
     LIEUT. GOVERNOR-ELECT ROBERTSON.
     Mr. LINCK offered the following:
     
      
       
        MR. SPEAKER:--Whereas, The following certificate of
         the Clerk of the Supreme Court of the State of Indiana was this afternoon brought to the
         attention of the temporary presiding officer of the Senate, to-wit:
        
         
          
           
            THE STATE OF INDIANA.
            
            IN THE SUPREME COURT.
           
           I, Wm. T. Noble, Clerk of the Supreme Court of said State, do hereby certify that said
            Supreme Court has, on this 23d day of February, 1887, reversed the judgment of the court
            below in the case of Robert S. Robertson against the State of Indiana on the relation of
            Alonzo G. Smith; appealed to said Supreme Court
            from the Marion Circuit Court, with an opinion holding that said court has no
            jurisdiction of the person or the subject matter.
           Witness my hand and the seal of said court this 23d day of February, 1887.
           
            [Signed,]
            WM. T. NOBLE, Clerk.
           
          
         
        
        Whereas, Such temporary presiding officer declined to receive it, or to allow it to be
         read for the information of the Senate; and,
        Whereas, Senator Huston claimed the floor on a question of highest privilege for the
         purpose of having the above certificate of the action of the Supreme Court read to the
         Senate, but was refused by the presiding officer, and while he was still on the floor the
         majority of the Senate deprived him of his privilege by a forcible and illegal adjournment
         of the body; and,
        Whereas, Robert S. Robertson is the lawfully elected and duly installed Lieutenant
         Governor of the State, so determined by a joint convention of the General Assembly, held on
         the 10th day of January, 1887, the legality of which and the validity of whose action have
         been determined by the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Swift, 69th Indiana
         Reports, the opinion of the court in such case being delivered by Justice Niblack; and,
        Whereas, Said Robert S. Robertson is present and ready to assume the duties of President
         of the Senate as provided for by the Constitution; therefore,
        Resolved by the House of Representatives, That until the House shall be officially
         informed that the said Robert S. Robertson is in the actual and peacable discharge of the
         duties of his office as such presiding officer, the House of Representatives must regard
         the Senate as illegally and unconstitutionally organized, and no official communication can
         be had with them in order to the due preservation of the just rights and responsibilities
         of this General Assembly.
        JOHN W. LINCK.
       
      
     
     Mr. LINCK moved the adoption of the resolution, and on that motion demanded the previous
      question, which demanded was seconded and the main question ordered by yeas 55, nays 43--
     Mr. KELLISON saying, when called upon to vote: If this House were to adopt a resolution of
      that kind in would disgrace itself in the eyes of the civilized world. Even if the Senate has
      outraged all precedent and violated all dignity, it is not for the House of Representatives of
      the 55th General Assembly to say who has been elected Lieutenant Governor of the State of
      Indiana. I vote 'no' as I don't believe in this kind of procedure
     The preamble and resolution were adopted by yeas 55, nays 43--as follows:
     
      
       
        YEAS. Ackman, Alexander, Barnard, Briant, Brown, Buckles, Carrick, Cates, Casey, Caven,
         Commons, Conder, Conger, Covert, Davis, Dickerson, Dunn, Fleece, Friend, Gardiner, Glover,
         Gough, Green, Griffiths, Grose, Groves, Hobson, Howard, Kelley (of Boone,) Kelly (of
         Lagrange,) Kercheval, Klein, Leighty, Linck, Little, Loop, McCallum, McCray, McMath,
         Mackey, Miller, Morse, Montgomery (of Gibson,) Nolin, Osborn, Oursler, Pleak, Reynolds,
         Scott, Sinclair, Stubblefield, Thompson, Trout, VanSlyke, Mr. Speaker. 55
        NAYS. Askren, Barnes, Beasley, Bertram, Blinks, Buskirk, Clarke, Connely, Cox (of Cass
         and Miami,) Cox (of Miami) Cruson, Cushman, Custer, Darroch, Foley, Foster, Galbraith,
         Garrison, Gordon, Harrell, Ibach, Jewett, Kellison, Major, Metzger, Mock, Montgomery (of
         Owen,) Niblack, Parker, Patton, Pierce, Pleasants, Roberts, Robinson, Schley, Selvey,
         Shambaugh, Shields, Stull, Weyand, White, Whitworth, Worrall. 43
       
      
     
     Pending the roll call--
     Mr. JEWETT, when called upon to vote, said: As no debate is allowed on this I ask to briefly
      explain my vote. Early in this session I proposed to the other side of the House a legal
      settlement of this matter. I do not want to put myself in the attitude of opposing a
      legally-elected officer, and if the Supreme Court by express terms had said that Colonel
      Robertson was elected Lieutenant Governor I would be in favor of his taking his seat. But
      because I do not believe that resolution recites the truth I vote "no;" and for that
      reason only.
     Mr. LINCK, when his name was called, said: By request of a Democratic Governor the
      Democratic Attorney General decided that there was a vacancy in the office of Lieutenant
      Governor. That opinion was passed upon by the conventions of every political party in the
      State that nominated a candidate for this office; that action was ratified by the people, and
      a Lieutenant Governor was elected. Now the Senate of this Le-  gislature, day after day and week after week, has refused to allow
      the Lieutenant Governor to take his seat. The Republicans feel that they have been bulldozed
      sufficiently long by the revolutionary proceedings of the Senate. I vote "aye."
     Mr. MAJOR [in explanation]: I feel that the action which the House proposes to take now is
      hasty. The action of the Senate may also have been hasty. If the majority in the Senate is
      wrong it may be that a good night's sleep will make them all right. I vote
      "no."
     Mr. PARKER, explaining his vote, said: I believe that the Democrats of the General Assembly
      have at all times proceeded in accordance with law, and I regard this resolution as an unjust
      aspersion on the Senate. I vote "no."
     Mr. PATTON said: Believing that the Senate will do what is right, under circumstances over
      which they have any control, and that they will have to obey the mandates of the law; and
      believing that they have adjourned for the purpose of holding a caucus to determine what their
      rights are, I vote "no."
     Mr. ROBERTS said, explaining: I believe, sir, that this resolution will disrupt this General
      Assembly and render necessary an extra session. The adoption of this resolution is equivalent
      to a dictation to the Senate what their action should be--that attempting to interfere with a
      high constitutional prerogative--the Constitution providing that each house shall control its
      own conduct and determine what its action shall be. The resolution is, therefore,
      revolutionary and in palpable disregard of the Constitution of the State of Indiana. We have
      no right to say how the Senate shall act upon any matter. I believe that on the second day of
      November, 1886, the people of the State of Indiana had a legal and constitutional right to
      elect a person to fill the office of Lieutenant Governor by reason of the resignation of
      General Manson. I never had any doubt about it and when I went to the polls and cast my vote
      for Colonel Nelson I believed that I was exercising a constitutional prerogative in a lawful
      way. Robert S. Robertson is entitled to hold the office of Lieutenant Governor, and it is only
      to be regretted that the Supreme Court of the State of Indiana could not have settled that
      question and set at rest the controversy. I vote "no."
     Mr. ROBINSON, when his name was called, said: I am not a lawyer and I do not claim to
      understand legal points in this controversy; but I do not think that this body has a right to
      dictate to the other body who shall be its presiding officer, therefore I vote
      "no."
     Mr. STUBBLEFIELD, explaining, said: Because of the fact that the resolution does not attempt
      to dictate to the Senate anything, but because of the fact the resolution declares that we
      won"t do some things that we have done, I vote "aye."
     Mr. WEYAND, when his name was called, said: As this resolution has very much the appearance
      of a non-intercourse bill I vote "no."
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the preamble and resolutions were adopted.
     The House adjourned.
    
   
   
   
    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    IN SENATE.
    
     THURSDAY, February 24, 1887.
    
    The PRESIDENT pro tempore [at 9.35 o'clock]: The Senate will come to order.
    
     THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR-ELECT.
     Lieutenant Governor-elect ROBERTSON [after an Assistant Doorkeeper had
      used force to prevent his ascending the steps leading to the President's chair] said:
      Gentlemen of the Senate: I have been by force excluded from the position to which the people
      of this State elected me. We have heard it stated that if the Supreme Court decided favorably
      I would be recognized--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [interrupting]: Unless the gentleman desists he will have to be
      removed from the chamber.
     Lieutenant Governor-elect ROBERTSON: I wish to make a statement. You may
      remove me from the floor if you wish--
     Mr. BAILEY [interposing]: I rise to a point of order. No one not a member has a right to
      speak here.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The point of order is well taken.
     Mr. HARNESS: This body has not been legally called to order and he has a right to speak
      here.
     Lieutenant Governor-elect ROBERTSON: I make a demand upon you, gentlemen,
      to see that I am placed in the position the Constitution requires me to possess--
     Mr. BAILEY [interposing]: I insist on my point of order.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Doorkeeper and his Assistants will remove the gentleman from
      the floor if he don't stop speaking.
     Lieutenant Governor-elect ROBERTSON: They may remove me; I am here
      unarmed.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: We are unarmed. We are fore-armed, though.
     Lieutenant Governor-elect ROBERTSON: I have a right to make this demand
      and insist upon my rights under the Constitution.
     Mr. BAILEY: If this gentleman has any grievance he can present it in a proper manner. There
      is a proper tribunal through which such grievances may be presented.
     Mr. DEMOTTE made a remark.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Senator from Porter will go to his seat.
     Mr. DEMOTTE: When he gets ready he will.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Mr. Pritchett [the Doorkeeper], put  Senator DeMotte in his seat, and if he refuses to go I will see
      that he leaves the floor of the Senate. If the chair is fairly treated there will be no
      trouble.
     Mr. HUSTON: I don't think, and I submit to members of the majority, that the President
      of the Senate has the right to say he will remove a Senator from the floor. Let us proceed
      with good sense this morning.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: That's right.
     Mr. SELLERS: Senator DeMotte was not in his seat. As long as he remains in his seat no
      Senator in the majority will object to his talking.
     The. PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Doorkeeper will maintain order if he has to put the Senator
      out. Senators will take their seats and come to order. Now, will Senators and persons present
      give their attention to the chair for a moment? The Senator from Fayette (Mr. Huston) desires
      to present the claims of--
     Mr. HOWARD, of Decatur: I rise to a point of order. The Senator from Fayette has not
      addressed the Chair.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Senator addressed the chair before that fuss got up
      there.
     Mr. SELLERS: Another point of order. I shall not interpose any objection to any Senator
      speaking, but let us proceed in order.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Senator from Fayette wants to make a statement in behalf of
      Mr. Robertson.
     Mr. SELLERS: But should not the journal be read?
     Mr. HOWARD of Decatur: I insist upon my point of order that the Senator from Fayette has not
      addressed the President.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Let him do so.
     Mr. HOWARD, of Decatur: He has presented himself in a contemptuous manner.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Does the Senator address the chair?
     Lieutenant Governor-elect ROBERTSON: I still insist that I have a right
      under the Constitution on the floor of the Senate--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [interrupting]: The chair must enforce order. Mr. Pritchett [the
      Doorkeeper], Captain Pritchett.
     Mr. SELLERS: We should read the journal.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Read the journal.
     Lieutenant Governor-elect ROBERTSON: I insist upon my rights on the floor
      of the Senate--
     Mr. FOWLER [interposing]: I insist that the Doorkeeper remove this gentleman.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [after calling for a vote]: The ayes have it. Where is Captain
      Pritchett? Remove that man from the floor of the Senate. Put him on the outside and lock him
      out. [Which the Doorkeeper proceeded to do.]
     A SENATOR: The Republican Senators are going with him.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Let them go if they want to; they will come back.
     Mr. JOHNSON: No man will be scared by you.
     The PRESIDNET pro tempore: You are awfully scared now.
     Mr. JOHNSON: Not at you.
     (From and after this point in the proceedings no Republican member uttered a word
      or cast a vote in the Senate during the sessions of the Fifty-fifth General Assembly which
      came to a close by constitutional limitation on the 7th day of March, 1887.)
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Call the roll of the Senate.
     Mr. BAILEY: Let us proceed in order. Let us have prayer and then the reading of the
      journal.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Senator Smith, of Wells, will come to the chair. Senators will
      take their seats. Visitors will take their seats. The proceedings of this day will be opened
      with prayer by Senator Smith, of Wells.
     Hon. J. H. C. SMITH, a Senator from the counties of Wells and Huntington,
      prayed as follows : Oh! Lord, we invoke Thy blessings upon us this morning. We are the
      creatures of  Thy will. Help us to do right. Direct us to
      Thy praise and accept of us, through Christ. Amen.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair directs a call of the Senate.
     Mr. FOWLER: The journal ought to be disposed of.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Read the journal.
     Mr. FOWLER: I move the reading of the journal be dispensed with.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: It is so ordered without objection. Call the roll of the Senate.
      [The Clerk reported thirty Senators answering.]
     Mr. FOWLER [after the roll-call]: I think the Senator from Hendricks (Mr. Campbell) is
      here.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Call the absentees.
     Mr. BARRETT: Senator Weir requested me to ask indefinite leave of absence for him.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: It is so ordered unless there is some objection.
     Mr. BAILEY: I ask that the Senator from Rush (Mr. Kennedy) be called. [After the name was
      called.] And the Senator from Vermillion (Mr. Sears.)
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Call Senator Sears.
     Mr. BAILEY: I ask that the roll be called again.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Well, call the roll again. Senators will pay attention to the
      call of the roll of the Senate. [When each Republican Senator was called]: Mark him present
      and not answering to his name. [When the call was completed]: There are thirty-one present and
      answering to their names and eighteen Senators present and not answering to their names.
    
    
     A LOAN BILL.
     Mr. BAILEY: I move we take up Senate Bill 286.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: What is the bill?
     Mr. BAILEY: A bill to provide for a loan of a million dollars.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Is there any objection to taking it up?
     Mr. BAILEY: I move it be taken up now.
     The PRESIDENT pro temopre: It will be taken up.
     It was read the second time with a favorable committee report, which was concurred in, and
      the bill ordered engrossed.
     Mr. BAILEY: I move the constitutional rule be suspended and the bill be read a third time
      and put on its passage.
     This motion was rejected by yeas 31. Present and not voting 18--the Constitution requiring a
      two-thirds affirmative vote.
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. SELLERS said: I move the record show that the Senators from [he named several districts]
      are present and not voting.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Call those present and not voting and mark them so the record
      will show it. Hear the vote: ayes 31; present and not voting 18, which the record will show.
      So the constitutional rules are not suspended.
    
    
     THE NEW INSANE ASYLUMS.
     Mr. SCHLOSS8: I wish to call up Senate Bill 61.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Well, take it up, whatever it is.
     The bill [S. 61] making appropriations for the three new Insane Asylums, was read the third
      time.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [after the roll-call on its passage]: Hear the vote: ayes 31, noes
      none; Senators present and not voting 18. So the bill is passed for the support of the
      additional Hospitals for the Insane.
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion: We have had some little trouble in the Senate this morning,
      and--
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [interrupting]: We have I did n't' know it.
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion: And I ask that Senators be careful about speaking about it out
      doors. [Laughter.]
     On motion by Mr. TRIPPETT, his Appellate Court bill [S. 10] was ordered engrossed.
     
     Mr. THARP called for the regular order.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Take up bills on the third reading.
    
    
     THE GAME LAW.
     The bill [S. 34] to prohibit the shooting of quails, pheasants and wild turkeys for two
      years, coming up on the third reading, the vote on its passage was taken, but before it was
      announced--
     Mr. FRENCH: I move that Senators present and not voting be not excused.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Put your motion in writing and name the members. Name each
      Senator.
     Mr. FFRENCH: I have the motion ready.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Send up your motion. [To the Reading Clerk]: Read that
      motion.
     The CLERK read: "I move that those members of this Senate who are present and refuse to
      answer to their names when the roll is called on the passage of bills, be not excused from
      voting."
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair suggests that each Senator's name be set out in
      that motion. Amend your motion so as to set out each name in that motion. Take the resolution
      back and set out the names of those who are present and not voting.
     Mr. SELLERS: This motion ought to set out the vote on this particular bill.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Let it be so amended. [After a pause.] The question is on the
      adoption of the resolution.
     Mr. BAILEY: Let the resolution be read as amended.
     The Clerk read as follows:
     I move that those members of this Senate who are present but refuse to answer to their names
      when the roll is called on the passage of Senate Bill No. 34 be not excused from voting, the
      same being Messrs. Campbell, Davis, DeMotte, Drake, Dresser, Duncan of Tipton, Ensley,
      Harness, Huston, Johnson, Kennedy, Macy, Marshall, Moon, Shroyer, Sears, Thompson of Jasper,
      and Winter.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Call their names again.
      Mr. FRENCH [after the names were called]: The resolution I have moved is based on the
      following Section of the Statutes: Section 2060 of the Revised Statutes of 1881 reads as
      follows:
     Whenever it shall happen that a quorum shall not ba present or voting in the Senate or House
      of Representatives by reason of the willful or intentional absence of any member of the same,
      or of their refusing to vote or to answer to their names on any vote or roll-call, any member
      of the General Assembly so willfully refusing to vote, to be present, or to answer to his name
      with the intent to defeat, delay, or obstruct legislation or legislative action, shall be
      deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be fined one thousand
      dollars; and the Marion Criminal Court shall have original jurisdiction of all offences
      arising under this Section.
     On that statute I base my action. I don't care to discuss it but leave it to the
      Senate. I move the adoption of the resolution.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The question is on the adoption of the resolution. Are you ready
      for the question? As many as are in favor will say "aye," contrary "no."
      The ayes have it and the resolution is adopted. Give me the vote upon that bill.
     Mr. FOWLER: I move that Senators who are present and not voting on than bill be now
      called.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Call their names again. I have had them called once or twice.
      [After the names were called]: Hear the vote: ayes 17, noes 13, not voting 18; so the bill is
      not passed. The Constitution requires a majority vote. Take up bills on the second
      reading.
    
    
     NECESSARY LEGISLATION.
     Mr. BARRETT offered a concurrent resolution that necessary legislation for the maintenance
      of the Benevolent Institutions and the State government shall receive immediate consideration
      by both the Senate and House, and be promptly passed.
     The vote was taken by yeas and nays.
     Pending the roll-call, seventeen separate votes were taken upon motions that each of the
      seventeen Sen- ators present and not voting "be not
      excused."
     Mr. SELLERS: It seems to me there is no necessity for this action. Rule 20 [see page 22 of
      this book] makes it obligatory upon Senators present to vote.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: This will go upon the record.
     Mr. MCDONALD: Before the vote is announced I move that their names be
      called again.
     Mr. BAILEY: That the record may be completed upon this resolution, I move that the names of
      these persons who were present and who were called and refused to vote, and were not excused,
      be marked as present and refusing to vote and were not excused by the Senate.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The record will show that. That is what I am having it done
      for.
     Mr. URMSTON: I have not heard whether the Senator from Jasper (Mr. Thompson) was excused or
      not.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Senator from Jasper was not excused from the Senate. Does he
      want to be excused?
     Mr. URMSTON: Yes, sir.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: It will be so ordered if there is no objection. Hear the vote on
      the resolution: yeas 29, nays 0, present and refusing to vote 17.
     So the concurrent resolution passed.
     On motion by Mr. MCCLURE, his bill [S. 280] to amend Section 6293, R. S.,
      was read the second time, a favorable committee report concurred in, and the bill ordered
      engrossed.
     Mr. Johnson's bill [S. 73] to encourage stock breeding, was laid on the table.
    
    
     THE SOUTHERN PRISON.
     Mr. BARRETT, from the Prison Committee, in presenting a further report in
      relation to the Jeffersonville Penitentiary, concerning the Directors, recommending that they
      be removed and that Senate Bill No. 324 be passed, said: In connection with that report it is
      proper for me to say that a Director, speaking to me personally at the Bates House in this
      city, said that while they were not guilty of any dishonesty in the management of the Prison
      they knew of nothing they could offer for their negligence; and they did not appear before the
      committee because they did not know any defence, as far as their negligence is concerned, that
      would do any good. I stated to them that I would make this statement to the Senate.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Do you want the report adopted?
     Mr. BARRETT: I move the report be adopted.
     Mr. BAILEY: We want the yeas and nays.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Do you want the yeas and nays?
     Mr. BAILEY: Yes, sir.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Call the yeas and nays.
     Mr. URMSTON [after the roll-call]: All the Republican Senators are present except the
      Senator from Jasper (Mr. Thompson.)
     Mr. BAILEY: I have looked over the Senate, and may have missed one or two as they run in and
      out, but make the following motion:
     I move that Senators Ensley, Moon, Macy, Duncan of Tipton, Winter, Johnson, Harness,
      Shroyer, Kennedy, Drake, DeMotte, Dresser, all being present at the vote taken upon the
      adoption of the report of Prison Committee of the Prison South, be marked
      as present and refusing to vote in favor of said report.
     The motion was agreed to.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Hear the vote on the adoption of the report: ayes 31; present and
      not voting l7.
     So the report was adopted.
     On motion by Mr. RAHM, it ordered, that when the Senate adjourn it be till to-morrow morning
      at ten o'clock.
    
    
     COURTESY BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Secretary desires me to say that he took Senate Bill 27 to
      the House and attempted to convey the information to the House that it had passed the Senate,
      but was refused admittance to the the door with the statement that no further communication
      would be received from the Senate, and that the Speaker would refuse to receive  a proclamation of the passage of the bill. I desire the record of
      the Senate to show that fact. Will some Senator introduce a resolution to that effect?
     Mr. SELLERS: I enter a motion to reconsider the vote by which Senate Bill 61, making
      appropriations for the new Insane Hospitals, passed the the Senate.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Will some Senator prepare a resolution so the Senate record may
      show the fact that the House refused to receive a message from the Senate?
     A number of Senate bills on the second reading were disposed of.
    
    
     COURTESY BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES.
     Mr. TRIPPETT offered the following:
     
      
       
        Whereas, On the 24th day of February, 1887, the Senate passed Senate Bill No. 27, being
         an act to maintain political purity; and,
        Whereas, Webster Dixon, Secretary of said Senate, acting in his official capacity, did
         make out and convey the following message to the House of Representatives, to-wit: I am
         directed by the Senate to inform the House that the Senate has passed Engrossed Senate Bill
         No. 27, a bill for an act to maintain political purity, etc., and the same is herewith
         transmitted to the House.
        
         WEBSTER DIXON,
         
         Secretary of Senate
        
        And, Whereas, The Door-keeper of the House of Representatives refused said Dixon, as
         aforesaid, admittance into said House under direction of the Speaker of said House, and
         said Secretary of the Senate was also informed that the House of Representatives would not
         hold any further communication with this Senate; therefore, be it
        Resolved, That the Senate learns with regret of the discourteous action of said House of
         Representatives, and its protests that said action of said House is unprecedented,
         unparliamentary and unconstitutional; than it is obstructive of needful legislation;
         detrimental to the interest of the people and revolutionary in tendency.
       
      
     
     It was adopted.
    
    
     EXTRA DOORKEEPERS.
     Mr. BAILEY offered the following:
     
      
       
        Resolved, That Frank Pritchett, Door-keeper of this Senate, be and is hereby authorized
         employ such force, in addition that already under his employ, as he may deem necessary to
         preserve order in the Senate, repel the attacks of any person or persons who may gather on
         the outside of this Chamber menacing a forcible invasion, and to disperse all disorderly
         mobs or persons who may threaten any unlawful interruption of the peaceful proceedings of
         this body; and that the empployment of such additional help herein authorized shall
         terminate as soon as the emergency calling for their employment ceases, and that they each
         be so notified when placed by the Door-keeper upon his force: Provided, That the pay or per
         diem of such additional employes be hereafter fixed by resolution.
       
      
     
     The resolution was adopted.
     The Senate adjourned.
    
   
   
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
    
     THURSDAY, February 24, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer [at 10.30 o'clock] by Hon. Henry Groves, a
     Representative from the county of Perry.
    
     SIGNAL-SERVICE BUREAU.
     Mr. CONGER called up his bill [H. R. 334] to establish a meteorological service. It was
      intended to benefit the farmer, for whom he thought it was high time something should be done.
      The bill was read the third time and passed by yeas 94, nays 0.
     The SPEAKER, in announcing the result, said: When the Lieutenant Governor is occupying his
      seat in the other end of the capital the Clerk will notify the Senate.
    
    
     APPORTIONMENT LAWS.
     Mr. KERCHEVAL submitted the following:
     
      
       
        MR. SSPEAKER:--Your Committee on
          Elections, to whom was referred the resolution concerning the present
         Congressional and Legislative apportionment laws, beg leave to submit the following
         majority report:
        CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS:--It is so apparent to
         every one that the act of 1885, which creates the Congressional Districts, is outrageously
         unfair; that we do not feel called upon to go into the details. The Democratic party for
         many years has not had a majority of the voters in this State, and it is still in the
         minority; the other parties having the majority. Yet the Democratic Legislature of 1885, in
         defiance of this fact, and in violation of the commonest principles of Justice, so
         gerrymandered the counties of the State as to give on the basis of the party vote in 1884
         ten of the thirteen Congressional Districts to the Democratic party.
        This was done notwithstanding the self-evident fact that the Democratic minority was not
         justly entitled to more than six out of the thirteen Congressmen allotted to this State.
         Nothing more need be to prove that this was a deliberate and wicked attempt to disfranchise
         at one-fourth of the voters of the State.
        
        THE LEGISLATIVE DISTRICTS:--It
         is provided by the Constitution and the Statute, that there shall be, every six years, an
         enumeration of all the male inhabitants of the State over the age of twenty-one years. See
         Article IV. Section 4, of the Constitution, and Revised Statutes of 1881, Sections 4780 to
         4802.
        It is also provided by the Constitution that "the number of Senators and
         Representatives shall, at the session next following each period of making such
         enumeration, be fixed by law and apportioned among the several counties, according to the
         number of male inhabitants above twenty-one years of age in each." See Article IV,
         Section 5.
        Now, let us see if this Constitutional command was obeyed in the enactment of the
         Legislative apportionment laws of 1885.
        THE SENATE:--The enumeration of 1883, upon which
         the apportionment should by law be based, showed 494,650 male inhabitants over twenty-one
         years of age in the State.
        There are fifty State Senators, hence,each Senator should represent, or have for a
         constiutency, one fiftieth-part of such inhabitants or 9,893 male inhabitants, over
         twenty-one years of age, or voters, as we may call them for brevity.
        There being ninety-two counties in the State, and most of them having a voting population
         of less than 9,893, two or more counties must, in most cases, be combined to form a
         Senatorial District.
        It is in the making of these combinations of counties, with the single idea of creating
         Democratic districts, and with little regard to securing to each county its just
         representation, that most of the injustice has been done.
        Marion County has a voting population, according to the last enumeration, of 29,812.
        This is a sufficient constituency for three Senators, with a surplus over. But, instead
         of giving it three separate Senators, it is given two separate Senators, and a
         Joint-Senator with Hancock County and Shelby County, both of which have Democratic
         pluralities largely in excess of the he Republican plurality in Marion County, so that the
         Senator elected in the district is almost certain to be a Democrat instead of a Republican,
         as he would with almost as much certainty have been, had he been given to Marion County
         alone.
        But not satisfied with obliterating the Republican plurality in Marion County in the case
         of this one Joint Senator, the large Democratic pluralities in Hancock and Shelby Counties
         are again used to wipe out Republican pluralities in two other counties. Hancock County,
         with a Democratic plurality of 689, is joined with Rush County, with a Republican plurality
         of 347, for the election of a Joint Senator. And in like manner Shelby county, with a
         Democratic plurality of 581, joined with Decatur County, which has a Republican plurality
         of 210.
        By this double use of the Democratic pluralities in the two counties of Hancock and
         Shelby, Republican pluralities in the three counties of Marion, Rush and Decatur are
         rendered unavailing.
        In the same way Brown County is twice sought to be used in nullifying the Republican
         pluralities of Monroe and Morgan counties, being made a part of two joint Senatorial
         districts, one composed of Brown, Bartholomew and Monroe counties, and the other of Brown,
         Johnson and Morgan counties.
        It not only destroys the Republican pluralities in the two counties named, but to affect
         this it is given a large excess of representation.
        Though it has a voting poiulation of 2,260, it is given a share in two Joint Senators,
         while Randolph County with a voting population of 6,710, Wabash County with a voting
         population of 6,495, Henry County with a voting population of 6,283 and many other large
         counties, have only a representative of one Joint Senator.
        The perversity of the Senatorial apportionment is illustrated with special perspicuity in
         the districts formed of the four counties of Jennings, Jefferson, Scott and Clark.
        Jennings County has a voting population of 3,737, and gave a Republican plurality of
         268.
        Jefferson County has a voting population of 5,870, and gave a Republican plurality of
         462.
        Scott County has a voting population of 1,803, and gave a Democratic plurality of
         305.
        Clark County has a voting population of 7,079, and gave a Democratic plurality of
         809.
        There are thus two Republican counties and Democratic counties.
        The four counties are together entitled to two : Senators. A due regard for the rights of
         the majority in each would have led to the joining of the two Republicam counties into one
         district, and two Democratic counties into another. The result would have been two
         districts nearly equal in population and of nearly proper size, as one would be composed of
         9,657 voters, and the other of 9,882 voters.
        Instead of thus forming the districts, Jennings, Scott and Clark counties constitute one
         District, and Jefferson and Clark another.
        By the placing of Clark County in both districts, each is given a population largely in
         excess of the proper number for a Senatorial District, one being composed of 12,669 voters,
         and the other of 12,949 voters, and the Democratic plurality in Clark County makes both
         districts bountifully Democratic, thus practically disfranchising the Republicans of two
         counties.
        Nothing more need be said as to the Senate.
        
        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:--The same method has been
         used in computing the irregularities in the apportionment of the State into districts, for
         the election of members of the House of Representatives.
        The only difference being that as there are one hundred Representatives, or twice as many
         as there are Senators, the constituency of a Representative should be one-half that of a
         Senator, or one hundredth part of the total enumeration of voters of the State.
        This gives 4,946 voters as the just constituency of a Representative.
        Statistics show that there are 29,997 voters in Republican counties who are not
         represented.
        There is, it is true, an excessive representation in other Republican counties equal to
         9.777 votes, but deducting this from the number of voters not represented, a balance of
         20,220 voters is still left unrepresented.
        In the Democratic counties the reverse is true. They have gross excessive representation
         equal to 29,288 votes, and only 10,643 not represented. There is, therefore, in the
         Democratic counties, a net excessive representation equal to 18,645.
        It is, therefore, seen that the Democratic counties in the State have an advantage in
         representation over the Republican counties equal to 38,865 votes, this being the sum of
         the difference in their representation, one class having 20,202 voters not resented, and
         the other having an excessive representation equal to 18,865 votes.
        The following table in reference to the apportionment of Representatives gives the
         figures in the sixteen Republican counties in which the number of voters not represented is
         the greatest, and in the sixteen Democratic counties that have the largest excessive
         representation:

         representative is 6,374, while in the Democratic counties named it is only 3,661.
        As before stated, each Representative should have a constituency of 4,946 voters.
         Seventeen and five-sixths Representatives (the number in the above Republican counties)
         should have therefore a constituency of 88,202, and no more. But in the counties named,
         seventeen and five-sixths Representatives have a constituency of 113,682. There are,
         therefore, 25,480 voters in the counties named who are not represented; that is, they have
         cast useless votes, or votes that should not have been used in electing the Representatives
         allowed to these counties, but in electing other additional Representatives.
        In the Democratic counties named the contrary appears. Nineteen and five-sixths
         Representatives should have a constituency of 94,798, but, instead, in these counties they
         have a constituency of but 71,846, a deficit of 22,952 voters.
        The 71,846 voters in these Democratic counties have the voting force or power of 94,798
         voters.
        There is, then, we say, as a convenient mode of expression, an excessive representation
         in the counties equal to 22,952 votes.
        
        We will now consider some of the individual counties.
        Lawrence County, with a voting population of 3,927, has only one-third share of a
         Representative, while Owen County with a voting population of 3,610, Tipton County with a
         voting population 3,700, Perry County with a voting population of 3,708, and Pike County
         with a voting population of 3,789, are each given a separate Representative. Lawrence
         County is Republican, the others are all Democratic. Randolph County (Republican), with a
         voting population of 6,710, is given one representative, and so also are Owen, Tipton,
         Perry and Pike counties (all Democratic) each with a population little more than half that
         of Randolph County.
        Hancock County (Democratic), with a voting population of but 4,167, is given the same
         amount of representation as Elkhart County (Republican), with a voting population of
         9,148.
        Pulaski County (Democratic), with a voting population of 2,411, is given the same
         representation as Jay County (Republican), with a voting population of 5,067.
        Hancock County, though not entitled to one representative, having a voting population of
         but 4,167, while 4,946 are required for one Representative, not only receives the one
         separate Representative, but its large Democratic plurality is used again to filch a
         Republican Representative from Marion County; which is given five Representatives, but is
         entitled to six, having a voting. population of 29,812, enough for the constituency of six
         Representatives and a small surplus over. But instead of being given its six
         Representatives, it is given five separate Representatives,and the sixth is made a joint
         Representative with Hancock and Shelby counties.
        In like manner Sullivan County (Democratic), with a voting population of 4,740, is given
         one Representative, and then loaded down with a one-third share of another.
        Ohio and Switzerland counties, both Republican, have, together, a voting population of
         4,539, which is more than the voting population of either Owen County, Tipton County, Perry
         County, Pike County, Warren County, Fulton County, or Washington County, to each of which a
         separate Representative is given, and yet, Ohio and Switzerland counties are made to share
         their one joint Representative with Dearborn County, which has an overwhelming Democratic
         majority.
        Thus, again, one Democratic county is made to count more than two Republican
         counties.
        The Republican county of Jay has a voting population of 5,067, which is more than the
         voting population of any one of at least eighteen different Democratic counties, to each of
         which a separate Representative is given, and yet Jay Cepnty is deprived of its
         Representative by being given one joint Representative with Adams County, and another with
         Adams and Blackford counties.
        The voting population required to entitle a county to one Representative is 4,946.
        Jay County with 5,067 voting population, is, therefore, fully entitled to one
         Representative and a small surplus over. But Jay County is Republican, and if given a
         Representative by itself a Republican would be elected, but when given two joint
         Representatives with the Democratic counties of Adams and Blackford, the Republican
         plurality in Jay County is overcome and both districts become safely Democratic.
        Other arguments might be urged, but we have presented enough to show that there was some
         reason for the oft repeated Democratic boast that they would have a least sixty majority on
         joint ballot, when, as a matter of right, justice and law, such party is not entitled to
         any majority whatever.
        It is true that in the last election the people in many of the Democratic districts
         elected men of other political parties to Congress and to this General Assembly, but this
         was done for the express purpose of rebuking the party which passed these unfair and
         unconstitutional acts.
        So strong is the feeling of the people on this subject that we deem it safe to prophesy
         that they will again administer a similar rebuke to the Democratic party if it stands in
         the way of a reformation of these laws.
        The people have, by their votes at the recent election, expressly commanded that these
         wrongs be righted and these vicious acts shall be reformed.
        If we turn a deaf ear to this command for constitutional representation the people will
         continue to rebel against injustice, and to repeat their command in the election of both
         branches of a General Assembly in opposition to the Democratic part, and do this until the
         wrong is righted.
        THE LAW QUESTION:--Having shown,
         as we believe, that the Legislative Apportionment act is unjust and unfair to the people,
         we will now consider it as a question of law.
        For convenience we again quote the section of our Constitution which governs:
        "The number of Senators and Representatives shall, at the session next following
         each period of making such enumeration, be fixed by law and apportioned among the several
         counties according to the number of male inhabitants above twenty-one years of age in
         each."
        This language is clear and unmistakable, and it must be construed strictly to the end
         that the rights of the people may be fully protected, for it is undoubtedly
         restrictive.
        Lanning v. Carpenter, 20 N. Y. 447
        Gardner v. Newark, 40 N. J. Law, 297.
        Cooley's Const.Lim. 79.
        The Legislature, by this section of our Constitution, is restricted in the exercise of
         its power, and it is now well settled that all attempts to exercise a legislative power
         contrary to the restrictions of a constitution are absolutely void.
        Lanning v. Carpenter, 20 N. Y. 447
        
        Bradley v. Commissioners, 2 Humph. 427.
        Ford v. Farmer, 9 Humph. 151.
        Maury Co. v. Lewis Co., 1 Swan, 244.
        Bridgnor v. Rodgers, 1 Colder, 259.
        Kinney v. City of Syracuse, 30 Barb. 360, 361.
        And it is universally held that any law which operates as a disfranchisement of the
         voter, or denies to him that representation which belongs to him as a citizen, is
         unconstitutional and void.
        State v. Constantine, 42 Ohio St., 437; Attorney General v. Board, 15 Mich., 463.
         Therefore we conclude that the act under consideration is not only in violation of the
         Constitution but is absolutely void. This brings us to the consideration of the question
         whether or not these acts can be cured or reformed by the General Assembly at this session.
         To us it seems clear that a void act is no act at all, and that in the enactment of such
         act, the Legislature of 1885 did not exhaust its constitutional power. If that power was
         not exercised in a constitutional manner in 1885 it still remains in existence, and it is
         incumbent upon thisi General Assembly to perform the duty which should have been performed
         in 1885. The essence of the constitutional command is making of the apportionment, the time
         when it shall be done is not of the essence. The apportionment not having been made as the
         Constitution commanded, it follows that, that is a duty yet to be performed. How shall it
         be done? We answer that it may be done by amending the act of 1885. By this means may be
         exercised the power vested in the General Assembly by the Constitution and an invalid act
         made valid. This view is strengthened by the fact, that there is nothing in the
         Constitution itself to prohibit the alteration or amendment of an apportionment act. If the
         people had intended that such an act should stand, no matter how vicious, until after the
         next enumeration, they would have said so in plain terms in the Constitution as did the
         people of New York and New Jersey. For these reasons, and believing as we do that justice
         and right demand that the minority shall not have greater representation than the majority
         in Congress and in the General Assembly, we recommend the adoptin of the resolution.

     Mr. CLARKE submitted the following:
     
      
       
        Mr. SPEAKER:--The minority of your committee, to whom was referred
         House Concurrent Resolution No. 2, respecting the re-apportionment of the State, beg to
         submit the following minority report:
        The undersigned regret that they can not concur in the conclusion reached a majority of
         the committee, and assign the
        If this resolution had been introduced at an earlier period in this session, when there
         was time for deliberate action by both branches of the Legislature, there would have been
         less room to suspect the object of its introduction: 
          but
          bnt
         , coming as it does at this late period of the session when there is scarcely any
         possibility and no probability of its passage, forces us to look upon it, however
         reluctantly, as another installment of that species of cheap, transparent buncombe, with
         which it appears some gentlemen of this Assembly are seeking to immortalize their names in
         the BREVIER REPORTS, of this House.
        While this Assembly has passed so little needed legislation, and there is so much of it
         demanding attention at our hands, and we have left but a very few days of this session to
         devote to it, it is no more nor less than a criminal steal from the tax payers of the State
         to sit here from day to day, drawing our per diem, and suffer the few remaining days of
         this session to be frittered away in mutual admiration speeches and self advertisement. We
         can see no possible good to the people of the State which can grow out of the consideration
         of this resolution, especially at this time, even if the facts therein recited were true,
         which they are not; and believing that the time devoted to its consideration would be
         wasted, and believing that such time can be and ought to be more profitably employed, with
         all due respect for the author of the resolution and deference to the majority of the
         committee, we respectfully ask that the further consideration of the resolution be
         indefinitely postponed.
        
         I. M. CLARKE,
         JNO. R. CUSHMAN,
         SYLVESTER BERTRAM.
        
       
      
     
     Mr. KERCHEVAL demanded the previous question.
     The demand was seconded, and under its operations the House refused to substitute the
      minority for the majority report by yeas 41, nays 57.
     The majority report was concurred in by yeas 55, nays 42.
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. COX, of Miami, said: I shall vote as I do for the reason, first: that I think this a
      great outrage upon this House to spread a stump speech on the journal in favor of one
      political party. It is unjust to the minority in this House; and for another reason: I think
      it certainly contains some untruths. I vote "no."
     Mr. GORDON said: Being, as I am, a good friend to the Speaker of this House, there is
      considerable temptation to vote for this report, for the reason that this gives an opportunity
      to get one of his campaign  speeches on the records of
      the House. But because it contains so much outside of a campaign speech that is not true, I
      vote "no."
     Mr. KELLISON [explaining]: If this were a resolution reciting the fact that the Democratic
      party had made one of the greatest blunders of its life two years ago, I would vote for the
      resolution. If it recited the further fact that they were being severely punished for that I
      would vote for it. But because I believe that this General Assembly can take no steps
      impairing the work of the last General Assembly, however outrageous that may have been, I vote
      "no."
     Mr. ROBINSON, when his name was called, said: As a member of the Fifty-fourth General
      Assembly, two years ago, upon the final passage of the apportionment bill I vote against it,
      believing, as I did then, that it was not in every respect fair. But the election exploded the
      key note, and perhaps retired the author of it. It balances it up so even, giving to the
      Greenback party, at least in a measure, the balance of power, I vote "no."
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the majority report was adopted.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     FEES AND SALARIES.
     Mr. Foster's fee and salary bill [H. R. 33] was read the third time.
     Mr. FOSTER: I believe, after long consideration, this is the best fee and salary bill that
      has been offered to the House. I have received letters from all parts of the country, and
      newspaper statement, and they are in favor of the bill regardless of party. I had a laboring
      man state to me: "there is much labor legislation that is practical and that is to cut
      down these fees and salaries." [Mr. F. demanded the previous question.]
     The demand was seconded, and under its operation the bill passed the House by yeas 68, nays
      24.
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. ACKMAN said: Because I do not believe this bill to be of any practical benefit to the
      people of the State, and because I believe if it should become a law it would work a harm or
      injury by taking away a very great stimulant from the officers in collecting fees and taxes, I
      vote "no."
     Mr. BEASLEY, when his name was called, said: I made an effort pass another bill on this
      subject, but under existing circumstances I do not see that we can pass any other except this
      one. I hope that this bill in its present shape will not become a law, and believing it will
      be amended in the Senate I vote "aye."
     Mr. BROWN [in explanation}: I am satisfied that the people of this State are demanding some
      relief in the matter of fees and salaries. But I think this bill fixes the salaries in some
      cases higher than present fees; and for the reason that it does not go into effect in many
      instances until 1892, I vote "no."
     Mr. DAVIS, when called upon to vote, said: Believing, that legislation is necessary in the
      way of reducing fees and salaries, I vote "aye."
     Mr. GOUGH [explaining]: Because I find upon examining this bill that it will increase fees
      and salaries in most of the offices in my county; and because the people of my county have
      been demanding lower salaries and not higher salaries, I vote "no."
     Mr. GROVES, when he voted, said: I know that the people of my county are demanding a
      reduction of fees of county officers, and at first I supposed I would support this bill, but
      when I got the text of the bill and looked at it I find it will increase the fees of most of
      the officers in my county. Much as I might desire a bill lowering the fees of officers, I am
      compelled to vote against this one. I voted "no."
     Mr. HARRELL, in explanation of his vote, said: I find there are no itemized fees for the
      auditor in this bill. It makes no provision for the disposition of the money that might be
      collected in excess of paying these officers' salaries. I vote "no."
     Mr. JEWETT said, when his name was called: This bill does not propose any immediate relief
      for the people. It does not materially reduce  the cost
      of litigation; it does not meet the demands of the people for reduced fees; and it leaves the
      door open for constructive fees. I vote "no."
     Mr. LINCK, explaining his vote, I think this bill is not perfect, and I think it should be
      amended in the Senate. I think it ought to go effect now. Whether the Senate ever comes to the
      front or not, it cannot become a law until it goes through the Senate. It is not in the small
      counties, where the great outrages of fees affect the people; it is in the larger counties
      that this cuts them down. In the smaller countes I do not think they get too much. People
      complain who don't know anything about how much work these officials do or how much they
      get. Because it will be a benefit, on the whole I am in favor of the bill and vote
      "aye."
     Mr. MOCK [explaining]: I believe the bill is inequitable; and the fees are not graded as
      they should be. I do not believe the fees will be reduced by the passage of this bill in any
      of the offices, and in some cases they be increased. I vote "no."
     Mr. MONTGOMRY, of Owen, said: I believe this bill is nearer what it should be than any other
      I have read. I vote for this bill because it does not affect officers now elected. I vote
      "aye."
     Mr. NIBLACK, when his name was called, said: I would like to vote for a reduction of fees. I
      do not believe it is practical to pay county officers the salary plan. If this bill were to
      reduce fees I might favor it, but in its present shape I do not believe it is practical and am
      compelled to vote "no."
     Mr. PARKER [in explanation]: I believe the people of the State demand that a reduction be
      made in the salaries of officers. Because I believe the exorbitant fees paid county officers
      now, is in a great degree the cause of corruption; and because I believe that this bill
      institutes a kind civil service reform which I favor, I vote "aye."
     Mr. PATTON said: This bill increases the salaries, and creates a direct tax on the people to
      pay the excess, where the fees are not sufficient to meet the demands. This is no fee and
      salary bill at all. It does not relieve the people one particle; It does not cut the fees down
      any reasonable amount. As this bill, leaves the fees about as they are and increases the
      salary in the large counties, I shall vote against it. There are other bills, or other bills
      can be prepared, that will give us what is required. I vote "no."
     Mr. REYNOLDS [in exlanation]: For the reason that this bill will very materially decrease
      the pay of county officers in my county, being one of the large counties; and for the reason
      that in these large counties the pay has been out of all proportion to the labor required; and
      for the reason that the people of my county are demanding some reduction in fees ands
      salaries, I vote "aye."
     Mr. ROBERTS, when called upon to vote, said: I believe in a reduction of fees and salaries
      and I think that this bill has a tendency in that direction. I vote "aye."
     Mr. WHITE [explaining]: I desire to say that I voted for the engrossment of this bill, for
      the reason I believed at that time this was the only bill that could be passed at this session
      of the Legislature. I vote for it to-day for the same reason. I believe firmly that very
      little relief would come to the people by the passage of this law, but I believe that it will
      assist very much in future legislation. I vote "aye."
     Mr. KELLEY, of Boone, asking that his name be called, said: I have done all the figuring and
      studying I can do since this bill has been brought up, and I think in all probability it would
      reduce the salaries in my county about $500; and as I am in favor of reduction, I shall vote
      "aye."
     Mr. GARRISON, requiring his name to be again called, said: Because my constituents have
      insisted upon a reduction of salaries, and as under this bill no officer can get more than he
      gets under the present law, I vote "aye."
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the bill passed the House.
    
    
    
     APPROPRIATION AND TAX BILLS.
     The Committee on Ways and Means introduced bills H. R. 468, 469 and 470,
      making appropriations for the State government for the years ending October 30, 1887, 1888 and
      1889. Also H. R. 471, to continue the two cent State-house tax for the next two years. This
      last bill was passed the House under a dispensation of the constitutional rule by yeas 84,
      nays 4.
    
    
     HOUSE BILLS PASSED.
     Mr. Mock's bill [H. R. 83] to authorize purchasers at partition sales to take
      possession of real estate immediately after the sale, passed--yeas 67, nays 17.
     Mr. Caven's bill [H. R. 200] authorizing the Board of School Commissioners in cities of
      over 30,000 population to fund their present indebtedness, was passed by yeas 82, nays 2.
     Mr. Garrison's bill [H. R. 84] creating a lien on foals, passed by yes 80, nays 5.
     Mr. Robinson's bill [H. R 309] relating to the operation of coal mines, passed by yeas
      84, nays 1.
    
    
     EXTRA EMPLOYES.
     Mr. LINCK offered a resolution authorizing the Doorkeeper "to employ four extra
      Assistant Doorkeepers."
     It was adopted by yeas 51, nays 36.
     Mr. STUBBLEFIELD offered a resolution, which was adopted, "that the errand boy,
      appointed by a resolution of the House several days ago, be allowed the same pay as a
      page."
     The House adjourned.
    
   
   
   
    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    IN SENATE.
    
     FRIDAY, February 25, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Hon. J. H. C. Smith, a Senator, from the counties of
     Wells and Huntington.
    
     LIET-GOV-ELECT ROBERTSON.
     Mr. BAILEY offered the following:
     
      
       
        MR. PRESIDENT:--Whereas, The Honorable Alexander C.
         Ayers, Judge of the Marion Circuit Court, has decided that no election could be lawfully
         holden for Lieutenant-Governor of the State in November, 1886; and,
        Whereas, Two of the Judges of the Supreme Court, the only members thereof delivering
         opinions upon the question, have decided the same point the same way; and,
        Whereas, No joint convention of the two houses has ever been held at which the votes for
         Lieutenant Governor, even if lawful, could be counted, canvassed or the result thereof
         declared; and,
        Whereas, No joint assembly of the two houses has ever been held which could take any
         cognizance of a contest of the election for Lieutenant-Governor, even if there had been any
         election held; and,
        Whereas, No court or judge has, at any time, expressed the opinion that an election for
         Lieutenant-Governor was lawfully holden in November, 1886, and the intentions of any person
         to such office are therefore, unfounded and unsupported by any judicial opinion whatever;
         and,
        Whereas, One of the Judges of the Supreme court, the Honorable William E. Niblack,
         construing the Constitution of the State upon this subject, has said: "The controversy
         is one over which the courts have no jurisdiction, and over which no court can exercise the
         slightest control, and that the Senate has the unquestioned right to determine who is
         entitled to act as its presiding officer (Section 10, Article IV of the Constitution). When
         there is a contest as to which of two persons is entitled to preside over the Senate, the
         question becomes one which the Senate must decide"; and,
        Whereas, Heretofore on the 6th day of January, 1887, the Senate did elect to the
         Presidency thereof the Hon. Alonzo G Smith, now acting as President of the Senate in the
         absence of the Lieutenant-Governor of the State chosen at the general election in 1884,
         and,
        Whereas, No Lieutenant-Governor could have been, or has been, elected since that time, or
         can be elected until 1888; and,
        Whereas, the majority of this Senate has been, and is now, willing to submit the question
         of the election for Lieutenant-Governor, held in November, 1886, directly or indirectly, to
         the Supreme Court, and allow them to decide it, and abide by their decision as arbitrators,
         if not as judges; and,
        Whereas, The President of this body has twice attempted, unsuccessfully, to have the
         question determined, and no decision has been made against his rights as President of the
         Senate; therefore, be it
        Resolved, That the majority of the Senate are willing to submit to the Supreme Court, as
         arbitrators, the question of the legality of the election held for Lieutenant Governor in
         1886; and,
        Resolved, further, That the Senate is, and has been, organized with said: Alonzo G. Smith
         as President, constitutionally, regularly and lawfully, and that we proceed, in the
         speediest manner possible, to enact legislation needed for the interests and welfare of the
         State, in order that  we may be ready, having
         performed all our duties as legislators, for adjournment at the end of the sixty-one days
         period of the regular session.
       
      
     
     Mr. BAILEY: I move the adoption of the resolution, and upon that I demand the ayes and
      noes.
     It was adopted by yeas 30, nays 0. Present and not voting 13.
     Pending the roll-call--
      The PRESIDENT pro tem. said: Call the Senators present and not answering and mark them
      present and not answering.
     Mr. RAHM, [after the roll call]: I am requested to ask leave of absence for Senator
      Kennedy.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: It will be so ordered unless there is objection. Senator Sears said
      he wanted leave of absence to attend the funeral of ex-Senator Spann; I told him he could have
      it; is there any objection?
     Mr. SMITH, of Wells: The Senator from Jasper (Mr. Thompson) asks leave of absence for
      to-day.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: It will be granted if there is no objection. Hear the vote: Ayes 30,
      noes 0; 13 present and not voting. They will be so recorded. The resolution is adopted.
    
    
     ONE MILLION LOAN BILL.
     Mr. BAILEY: I call up Senate bill 286, known as the loan bill.
      The PRESIDENT pro tem: Take it up. (After it was read the third time; and the roll called
      on its passage.) Hear the vote: Ayes 30, noes 0. Present and refusing to vote, 15. So the bill
      has passed.
     Mr. BARRETT: I move to reconsider the vote by which Senate bill 236 (to index papers in the
      Supreme Court Clerk's office) was passed.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: The secretary will notify the House that the Senate wishes its
      return.
     Mr. HOWARD of Decatur introduced a bill [S. 331] to provide for security for costs in cases
      brought for divorce.
     Mr. FOWLER'S bill [S. 58] to prohibit County Auditors from issuing Auditors'
      warrants on the County Treasurer with an order from the County Commissioners was passed by
      yeas 27, nays 0. Present and refusing to vote, 11.
    
    
     NEW INSANE ASYLUMS.
     On motion by Mr. RAHM, the bill [S. 47] to appropriate $100,000 for the completion of the
      three new Insane Asylums, was read the third time.
     Mr. FOWLER: I would like to have the author explain the necessity for appropriating so large
      an amount of money.
     Mr. RAHM: That is not necessary. I would state that the amount in this bill has been asked
      for by the commissioners building these new asylums and by the Governor. As a matter of course
      if it does not require that much money, the balance will be turned into the treasury; but the
      persons building these asylums, I guess, know how much is needed.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: I am waiting for somebody to make a speech.
     Mr. RAHM: I suppose everybody is satisfied.
     Mr. BAILEY: These new hospitals are at that point where any delay would result in great loss
      to the State.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: Are they not covered?
     Mr. BAILEY: Some of them are not, as I understand. It may be possible the Senator from Wayne
      (Mr. Johnson} can give some light on the one in his vicinity; if so I would be pleased to hear
      from him.
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion: I regret very much the silence of those gentleman in the
      Senate.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: A great many people have been praying for it for some time.
     Mr. THOMPSON of Marion: I think it important that they should speak out. I think it would
      not hurt their cause a particle to say what they want. I don't suppose their presence
      will affect the passage of the bill one way or the other, but they ought to represent the
      districts from which they come. You owe it to the community you represent; and to the great
      State of Indiana. I speak in behalf of your constituency, that you should represent them on
      this  floor. You were sent here for that purpose, and how
      can you reconsile your consciences to sit here and take no interest in such bills of great
      importance to this State? I feel very much like scolding these men. I believe I will.
     Mr. BAILEY: Is the Senator from Marion aware of the fact that this silence is in accord with
      an agreement in caucus of the republican party? It is a question of caucus dictation.
     Mr. THOMPSON of Marion: Does . that answer the obligation these Senators took that they
      would perform the duties of their office in all respects to the beet of their ability under
      the constitution and laws of the country ? I can see no excuse for them. These gentlemen even
      refuse to vote, to gratify party feeling. I do hope these gentlemen will take this matters
      into consideration. These remarks are made in the kindest feeling. I love every one of them;
      but I say the interest of the State is not the interest of party; and when they see a bill
      about passing that is in the interest of the State I think it is their duty to speak out.
     Mr. MULLINIX: As far as our republican brethen are concerned, I am glad it has taken the
      turn it has. It has shut off a great deal of music, and from now on we can look forward to
      solid democratic legislation.
     The bill passed by yeas 29, nays 0. Present and not voting 12.
     Mr. McCLURE'S bill [S. 307] authorizing public aid to bridges, was
      passed by yeas 28, nays 1; present and not voting 10.
    
    
     COURTESIES BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES.
     Mr. SELLERS and Mr. BARRETT each presented a communication from principal secretary of the
      Senate reciting that on two occasions this morning he took messages from the Senate to the
      House of Representatives, but "was denied admission by the principal doorkeeper of the
      House Representatives, who informed me he was instructed by the Speaker of the House to deny
      admission to the Secretary of the Senate bearing official messages from the Senate."
     They were ordered spread on record.
     Mr. SELLERS: In view of the reports from the secretary, and the action of the House of
      Representatives, I move that when the Senate adjourns it adjourn till Monday at 2
      o'clock.
     Mr. MCDONALD: I am opposed to any adjournment until the constitutional
      limit of this session. We should stay right here and do our work, that the people may know we
      are acting in good faith.
     Mr. SMITH of Wells: I would prefer to adjourn sine die.
     Mr. MCDONALD: The people demand that we shall stay right where it is our
      duty to stay. The people demand that we shall make a record for the State of Indiana, and sir,
      I want to say if gentlemen in the minority in this House will take the responsibility to lock
      the wheels of legislation here, they and they alone must bear the responsibility before the
      people. A very unfortunate thing occurred here yesterday; unfortunate for our own credit;
      unfortunate for the people of Indiana, and unfortunate for the interests of all. How those
      gentleman who took solemn oaths to support the constitution and perform their duties as
      Senators under that constitution can answer to their God and to their consciences and to their
      people, after being interested in such unonstitutional proceedings is a marvel. In the name of
      the men who tried and succeeded in saving this country from treason, I ask that democratic
      Senators stay here--to stand by the right, and if treason is to stalk in this Hall, let others
      be responsible for it and take the consequences. So far as the assault of yesterday is
      concerned no man of credit, courage and good sense would be guilty of such conduct.
     A VOICE: "Take down the words."
     Mr. MCDONALD: Yes, take down the words and write them in iron that we
      will hold those men responsible who take an oath to support the constitution and then come in
      here and violate it. Put it down. I appeal to Democratic Senators to stand by us  and in 1888 the Democracy will give 5,000 majority in Allen and
      Whitley to the ticket (applause) because of the treason and duplicity practiced here in
      refusing to follow out their oaths and the wishes of the good people of the whole State of
      Indiana in proper legislation. I make these remarks with no ill feeling to gentlemen on the
      other side of the House. If they act under the dictation of a party caucus and party lash
      instead of under their oath before high heaven; if they can do that, with them rests the
      responsibility. I do hope the motion to adjourn till Monday will not prevail.
     Mr. FRENCH: I believe it is our duty to stay here, even if our Republican brethern do refuse
      to assist us in our work. We can do the work and deliver it to the secretary, and he can take
      our messages to the House of Representatives, and come back and show they refuse to receive
      them, and the consequences will be with them. Let us take up the important measures and pass
      them in good faith and leave the people in no doubt as to how the record was made up.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: The Chair desires to say to the Senator from Posey [Mr. French] that
      no later than today Republican Senators have demanded warrants for their pay signed by the
      President of the Senate.
     Mr. MCDONALD: The Senator from Whitley has not received a dollar of his
      per diem.
     Mr. FRENCH: And they have asked this Democratic Senate for leave of absence in order that
      they may go around wherever they will outside of this chamber.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: The Chair will state further that I am informed Republican members of
      the House of Representatives and this Senate are drawing money on warrants issued by the
      President of the Senate and Speaker of the House of Representatives, when Democrats are denied
      that privilege.
     Mr. FOWLER: It smirches a Republican Auditor to make that charge
     The PRESIDENT pro tem. [interposing]: I was informed by a Representative in the other branch
      of the legislature that he yesterday drew money on a warrant issued by the Speaker.
     Mr. FOWLER: I don't want to see injustice done to any one, though he be a Republican
      Auditor. The other morning at breakfast Mr. Carr told me that by three o'clock the money
      in the treasury would be gone, and if I wanted money or any of my friends, I had better come
      over and get it.
     Mr. RAHM: He didn't tell me. I haven't got any per diem yet.
      Mr. FOWLER: He has treated me fairly, and seemed to want to treat Democrats fairly.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: I understand he did on yesterday when he tried to break in one of
      the Senate doors. A State officer who will try to break in a transom and doors of this
      building is a very fair man indeed!
     Mr. FOWLER: I am not excusing him for that.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: He will not be excused either when the appropriation bill comes
      up.
     Mr. SELLERS: I don't think the Auditor knows anything about money being paid out. I am
      informed he was here heading a mob, and recommending the bursting in of the doors of the
      Senate, instead of being in his office; and that the Secretary of State was here also instead
      of being in his office; and that the Clerk of the Supreme Court was not far away, aiding and
      abetting in that. I think they don't know anything about paying Republican members,
      because if my information is correct, they were engaged in other business.
     The motion to adjourn till Monday was rejected.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     Mr. BAILEY'S Alien detective bill [S. 223] was read the third time. He said: The
      purpose of the bill is to prohibit the imporation of Pinkerton detectives or other
      organizations of that character coming into the State 
      for the purpose of quelling riots, etc. It confines the appointment to persons who have the
      same residence qualifications as voters.
     The bill passe by yeas 27, nays 1, refusing to vote 15.
    
    
     C0URTESIES BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES.
     On motion by Mr. FOWLER a Communication from the Secretary was ordered spread on the
      journal, reciting, like unto those of this morning, that the House of Representatives refused
      to receive another message from the Senate.
     Mr. RAHM introduced a bill [S. 332] to amend Section 5105 of the Revised Statutes of 1881,
      concerning the repair of free turnpike roads, and authorizing the construction of new
      turnpikes.
     Mr. MCDONALD'S bill [S. 84] to amend Section 312, of the R. S. of
      1881, concerning the commencement of actions and giving jurisdiction to the county where the
      property may be found, was passed by yeas, 27, nays 0, refusing to vote 12.
     The Senate adjourned.
    
   
   
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
    
     FIDAY, February 25, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Rev. W. H. Wydeman, of the M. E. Church.
    
     HOUSE BILLS PASSED.
     Mr. Carrick's bill [H. R. 157] providing for the trimming of hedge fences passed--yeas
      69, nays 18.
     Mr. Leighty's bill [H. R. 107] fixing the time when the term of office of township
      trustee should begin passed--yeas 88, nays 0.

      68, nays 13.
     Mr. Foster's bill [H. R. 32] to prevent the killing of quail, passed--yeas 54, nays
      33.
     Mr. McCray's bill [H. R. 49] in relation to the laying out of streets, passed--yeas 69,
      nays 15.
     Mr. Morse's bill [H. R. 37] permitting cities of more than 70,000 inhabitants to
      straighten their boundaries, was passed--yeas 78, nays 10.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     Mr. NIBLACK'S bill [H. R. 417] to create an Appellate Court, coming up on the third
      reading--
     Mr. NIBLACK said: I only want to occupy the attention of the House for moment and explain as
      rapidly as possible the provisions of this bill. I have no doubt that most of the members have
      read the bill already, and know it better than I can explain it. It is a bill to create one
      Appellate Court, prepared not by myself, but by judges and lawyers all over the State. It is
      prepared by the law association of Indiana. It provides a rapid method by which the decisions
      of the court of final resort may be reached, with an additional expense of only the salaries
      of the judges and of running the court. It can go into immediate operation, and it, affords
      immediate relief both to Litigant and to the Supreme Court; in that it provides that cases
      come without the jurisdiction of the bill shall be immediately transferred to the Supreme
      Court. I think it universally conceded by the members of this House and this General Assembly,
      and the people of this State generally that it is time that something should be
      done,--something in the way of relief to avoid delay. I not particular as to what method is
      adopted. My own view of the situation is that we ought to have a constitutional convention for
      the purpose of revising our judiciary system, because I believe that one-half the number of
      judges could do the business of the State as well.
     Mr. JEWETT: I desire to state briefly that I have no pride of opinion about any bill or any
      measure that shall be presented, and the bill that is before this House bearing my 
       uame
       name
      , is largely made up from two Senate bills. I believe there is a conceded necessity
      for some relief for the Supreme Court. If that necessity is not conceded all arguments in
      favor of this measure go for naught. If that is conceded, and if it be further conceded, which
      I think no gentleman will deny, that the demand is only for relief of the Supreme Court, and
      not for the establishment of a different sort of Appellate Court, then it seems to me that
      this bill ought not to pass. House bill 414, is the  one
      introduced by me. The distinction between these two measures, in regard to an Appellate Court,
      is this, mine is but a temporary expedient, until an enlargement of the Supreme Court can be
      had, or until a trial of this system can make it popular and permanent. All systems but the
      system provided for in bill 414 are departures from our policy to have but one Supreme Court,
      or court of last resort in the State. What is the hardship? The hardship is simply this, that
      it is a delay, and to that extent a denial of justice. Upon whom does this hardship fall?
      Largely upon the poor classes. Why? Because appeals are taken from just decisions for the
      purpose of delay, only when that court is in such position as that an appeal cannot be
      prosecuted without delay. It has become a practice in this State to appeal merely for delay.
      If a man's property, of the value of $50, is destroyed by a railroad company, he may
      obtain a judgment, and then it is possible to delay the collection of that judgment for three,
      four or five years. The relief is demanded by the great body of the people, and not merely by
      the lawyers. There is but one way to properly arrange this matter, and that is by an increase
      in the number of supreme court judges in this State. This can only be done by amendment to the
      constitution of the State. The constitution cannot be amended in this particular in four
      years. Two years ago the gentlemen from Marshall (Mr. Kellison) who is now the representative
      from that county, offered a constitutional amendment to that effect. But as the constitution
      now stands it cannot be considered at this session of the General Assembly, unless we can get
      up some agreement to reject the pending constitutional amendments. I do not believe that
      practical. For myself I prefer a constitutional convention in this State. I flatter myself
      that if this bill of mine passes, it will make a very popular court, because it is a plain,
      simple, cheap court. It will be popular among the members of the bar, because it will enable
      them to have small cases settled in their own county. It proposed by my bill, that there shall
      be three benches of three judges each, who shall receive a less salary than the Supreme Court
      Judges. They are to sit in every county seat in the State. They take out of the Supreme Court
      clerk's office more than 40 per cent, probably 50 per cent., of the cases on file there.
      The only expense is the salary; there are no officers. The entire plant will be three seals
      that can be bought for $30. All that is sought by this is to get the decision. In the small
      cases the decisions are to be final, unless the Judges think it should be certified to the
      Supreme Court. The only interest the public have in a decision is that a case shall be
      decided. The public have no interest, except as a precedent, whether it is decided right or
      wrong. These little cases only require a decision, and they are not be printed. But it gives
      every man a chance to have his case reviewed. If it fails to do what is expected of it the
      next General Assembly can wipe it off the face of the earth, and there will be no record, no
      library, and nothing but the fact that these cases had been decided.
     Mr. BROWN: Under bill 414, to have a case determined by that court, one must make a deposit
      with the clerk of the court, before that clerk can be called upon to certify any transcript to
      that court, and further than that a person of small means must pay the cost of getting a
      transcript of all the testimony. I do not see how it is possible for any Appellate Court to
      determine cases without the testimony. He deposits a fifteen dollar docket fee, and he waits
      twelve long months before he can get his case into that court, or before that, court gets to
      his case. Now the bill proposed by the gentleman from Knox (Mr. Niblack) simply creates an
      Appellate Court here, and the officer of the Supreme Court would be the officers of the
      Appellate Court. We can get a decision from the Supreme Court in about ten months. I think
      this court would be much better than one under bill 414.
     
     Mr. KELLISON: I will endeavor briefly to give the reasons why I am not in favor of the
      passage of House bill 414. My principal objection to this bill is that it proposes to create
      another court of errors. The only object and purpose that a bill of this kind can have, and
      subserve, is to relieve the pressure of business before the Supreme Court of Indiana. That
      there is need of something of this kind no gentleman can question. But this condition of
      things has existed for a number of years in the State of Indiana. This is not the first time
      the legislature has been confronted with this question. In 1881 it appointed a commission to
      assist the Supreme Court in disposing of the cases in that court. That was not satisfactory to
      litigants at the bar of State, or to the people. Two years ago this same question was before
      the General Assembly for consideraton, and yet that General Assembly adjourned without making
      provision to remedy that evil. It has been before nearly every legislature for the past ten
      years. The fault is in our judiciary system. It needs re-organization from top to bottom; and
      it seems to me we ought no longer to temporize with this question. It is the duty of this
      legislature, as it was of the last and preceding ones, to take hold of this question, and
      re-organize our judiciary in a way that will meet the wants of this great and growing State of
      ours. I believa we do not want another court of error alone, and that is all this Appellate
      Court would be. A court that reviews errors of law, and has nothing but jurisdiction in cases
      appealed to it, is termed a court of appeals and errors. They do as a general rule go into the
      merits of a controversy or decide the case upon its merits in any sense of the word. And I say
      that is the greatest folly connected with our judiciary system to-day. When we get beyond the
      nisi prius court there is absolutely no remedy for the injured party except to take his
      chances before an Appellate Court that does not consider his case. I am not in favor of
      creating any more courts of that kind. I wish we did not have the one we have of that kind.
      The constitution of the State of Indiana providing for the organization of a supreme court
      defines its powers and duties. It provides that the judges of the Supreme court shall give an
      opinion upon every question of law in the case; and yet it is well known that not in one case
      in five, that goes to that court do the judges of that court give a decision upon every
      material point that has been properly raised by the Appellant's attorney. I am not in
      favor of spending a cent of the public money for creating another court of that kind. I do not
      propose to discuss the merits of the bill offered by the gentlemen from Floyd (Mr. Jewett). I
      will say that the purpose, the object, and the scope of that bill, to my mind, is one that is
      needed in this State much more than this bill, because it proposes to do away with that
      expensive method of getting a case to the Supreme Court, and proposes to have a review of the
      case upon the original papers and upon the original evidence. Then it seems to me that the
      next demand is that we re-organize the circuit courts, enlarge the circuits, and make the
      circuit court what it should be, a court of dignity and high character. We could reduce the
      number one half, and the salaries would more than pay the salaries of the 92 probate Judges of
      the State of Indiana. There is no reason but with an enlarged circuit, with perhaps better
      judges, and with better salaries, and by giving the circuit courts of this State the
      Apppellate jurisdiction proposed in this bill, that we could have a complete and substantial
      remedy. I do not believe in temporizing in creating courts only to exist for a year or two.
      There is no necessity of every little case going before a court of Appellate jurisdiction. We
      want more cases decided upon their merits and fewer upon technical quibbles. If we are to have
      a re-organization of the judiciary of the State of Indiana, let us have a re-organization that
      will take the 
       origina-
       original
       transcript and take the original bill  of
      exceptions, and review the whole case, and decide it, not upon a few errors of law, but review
      the facts, review the law, and decide the case upon equitable principles, and upon the
      principles of right. That is the kind of court we want, if we are going to the expense of a
      court at all.
     The further consideration of the bill was postponed till Monday at 2 o'clock p.m.
     The House adjourned till that time.
    
   
   
   
    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    IN SENATE.
    
     SATURDAY, February 26, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Hon. Timothy E. Howard, a Senator from the counties of
     St. Joseph and Starke.
    
     ASSEMBLY REPORTER.
     Mr. MCDONALD introduced a bill [S. 333] to elect a State Legislative
      Stenographer. [W. H. DRAPIER.]
     Several bills were ordered engrossed.
    
    
     STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE.
     The bill [S. 326] to make an appropriation ($10,000) in aid of the State Board of
      Agriculture, was read the third time.
     Mr. FRENCH: This bill is in the interest of farmers and its passage desired by farmers. A
      statement has been handed me of the sums appropriated by other States for the encouragement of
      Agriculture. [Reads] I don't think it requires any argument to show this bill is just and
      right to every member on this floor.
     Mr. SCHLOSS: In view of what other States appropriate to Agricultural societies, I think
      this bill ought to pass.
     Mr. MCDONALD: I think it due to the farming community of the State of
      Indiana that they should have this sum, and even more if we could spare it now. In view of the
      condition of the State treasury they have asked for the very lowest sum that would be of use
      for the good purpose of carrying on the State Agricultural Society.
     Mr. FOWLER: While we are voting large appropriations to other institutions, certainly some
      aid ought to be furnished this society, as a large proportion of taxes comes from the farming
      community.
     Mr. BAILEY [after the vote on the passage of the bill]: I ask the Secretary to call again
      those present and not voting.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Call those not answering, and mark them present and refusing to
      vote.--[The CLERK: "Shall I mark Mr. Huston?"] Yes, he is around
      in the cloak room or somewhere. It don't make any difference, mark him present.
     Mr. BAILEY: How many are there? [CLERK: "Twelve."]. I move the
      twelve Republicans whose names are marked as present and refusing to vote, be excused from
      voting on this bill.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [after putting the question]: The ayes have it; they are excused.
      The Secretary will make the proper entry. Hear the vote:
      yeas 29, nays 0; present and excused from voting 12. So the bill is passed.
    
    
     CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS.
     Mr. FOWLER: The chairman of the Judiciary Committee is now here, and I
      ask him to report the Constitutional amendments. I think the House of Representatives ought to
      have them.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: No doubt the House is waiting for them.
     The Judiciary Committee returned "Amendment No. 1," a joint
      resolution heretofore agreed to by the Fifty-fourth General Assembly, that county clerks,
      auditors, recorders, treasurers, sheriffs, coroners and surveyors, shall hold office for four
      years from the 1st of January after election, but no person except surveyor shall be eligible
      to either of said offices more than four years in any period of eight.
     The vote stood yeas 29, nays 0; present and not voting 12.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Will the Senate excuse Senators present and not voting?
     Mr. BAILEY: I move the Senators be excused.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The Senators are excused.
     The Judiciary Committee also returned "Amendment No. 3," a joint resolution agreed
      to by the Fifty-fourth General Assembly, to strike out the word "white" in Section
      1, Article XII.
     Mr. FOWLER: It just strikes out the word "white" in the article providing for a
      militia.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: It will just have the effect to equalize the races; that's
      all.
     The vote stood yeas 29, nays 0; present and not voting 13.
     Mr. SELLERS: I move those present and not voting be excused.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The ayes have it. The Senators are excused from the
      responsibility.
    
    
     A MESSAGE FROM THE GOVERNOR
     Announced his appointment of Levi A. Barnett, of Hendricks county, and Lewis Jordan, of
      Marion county, Commissioners of the Indiana Reform School for a term of four years from
      February 23, 1887.
    
    
     COMMON SCHOOL BOOKS.
     On motion by Mr. ZIMMERMAN, his bill [S. 55] for the publication of the State school books,
      was taken up with a majority committee recommending indefinite postponement, and a favorable
      minority report. He moved to substitute the minority for the majority report and said: next to
      the appropriation bills this bill is more important than any other.
     Mr. BAILEY: It seems to me nothing could be more beneficial the general welfare of school
      children for the purpose of laying a foundation for good citizenship than a bill of this
      character.
     Mr. DUNCAN, of Brown; In behalf of the Committee on Education, I would
      say that the committee carEfully considered this bill in all its provisions, and recommended
      its indefinite postponement. The members of the State Board have all the educational duties
      they can perform;--they have so stated to the committee while in session; and it has said by
      members of the State Board of Education that if they were called upon to perform any such
      enormous task they would resign their positions on the Board of Education. Section ten of this
      bill proposes to, appropriate $20,000 out of an empty treasury for the purpose of procuring a
      compilation of this system of books. Another section provides for the sum of $50,000 for the
      purpose of carrying out the provisions of this act. We must consider not just what is in the
      terms of this bill, but what will be its effects. I undertake to say it would cost the people
      from one to one a half million of dollars. Frequent change of text bookss is one of the
      principal evils sought to be avoided by this bill, but changes have so universally condemned
      by the people that it is by this time almost a thing of the past. I had an intelligent teacher
      to make a computation  of the amount invested in school
      books in this State, and it cannot be less than one and a half million of dollars. You propose
      therefore to confiscate the value of these books now in the hands of the people. I know, if
      Senators will look into this question as carefully as the Committee on
       Education has done, they will not sustain the motion to amend by the Senator from
      Fulton (Mr. Zimmerman) proposing to substitute the minority for the majority report.
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion: I take a great deal of interest in this bill. It must be a very
      profitable business to supply the children in the State of Indiana with school books. If there
      are one and a half million of dollars worth of school books in the hands of the children of
      this State to-day, think what it would amount to in the course of a few years if they are
      changed three or four times in a year. Massachusetts supplies them free to all who choose to
      take them. That would complete our school system and put Indiana, as she is, in advance of all
      the other States. I therefore go in for the bill and will vote for it.
     Mr. MULLINIX: I am not able to say whether this is just exactly bill we should have, but I
      believe we should have some legislation in this direction. We have put in a great deal of time
      legislating for corporations, and now, sir, I believe the time has come when we should enact
      some legislation for the State of Indiana. For, sir, in Indiana we have a great school system,
      and an enormous school fund; and if we don't try to remedy this great evil upon the
      subject of books, we are neglecting and failing to discharge a duty to a worthy class of
      people who desire to secure an education. It seems to me the time has arrived when we should
      protect the poor classes in Indiana who desire our protection. I hope minority report will
      prevail and that we will have some legislation on this subject.
     Mr. HOWARD of St. Joseph: On behalf of the minority of the committee I desire to say a few
      words. In the first place, this kind of a law is not an experiment. It has been tried in some
      of the States., And it ought to be borne in mind that these laws are subject to repeal,
      amendment and improvement. In a reform of this kind everything is not expected be perfect at
      once. Gentlemen know the Revised Statutes have been well published and cheaply published by
      the State. The amendment proposed by the minority will answer one serious objection to the
      bill, and that is, the State can procure a series of text books as good as those now in use.
      If it be said that the State Board has not time to compile them, the State Board may procure
      from the author the right to use his books in the State of Indiana and give them to the
      children at the lowest price possible. I think this is one of the reforms that is sure to
      come. There is necessarily no job in this. I understand Mr. Burford, at present the State
      Printer, so-called, is willing enter into a contract for the printing of books for the
      children at one-half the present cost.
     The vote on substituting the minority for the majority report resulted--yeas 24, nays 2;
      present and not voting 10.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Call the names of Senators in seats and not answering. [The CLERK: "Senator Drake has been here all morning. Shall I mark him
      present?"] Yes. Will the Senate excuse Senators present and not voting? Hear the vote:
      yeas 24, nays 2; present and not voting 10. So the minority has been substituted for the
      majority report.
     The minority report was concurred in, and the bill ordered engrossed.
    
    
     BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
     Mr. SELLERS offered the following:
     
      
       
        Resolved, That the Auditor of State is hereby directed to honor and pay out of the fund
         appropriated for the expenses of this session, warrants issued by the last Senate to pay
         one of its officers.[W. H. Drapier, for Brevier Legislative Reports of the last General
         Assembly.]
       
      
     
     
     It was referred to the Committee on Claims.
    
    
     EXTRA PAY TO OFFICERS.
     Mr. DUNCAN, of Brown, offered a resolution to allow the Principal and Assistant Secretary
      $450 each for services enumerated, "and the President of the Senate is hereby authorized
      to draw his warrant in favor of the above named officers for said sums of money, payable out
      of the funds appropriated for the payment of the expenses of the General Assembly."
     It was referred to the Committee on Finance.
     The Senate adjourned till Monday next at 2 o'clock, p. m.

    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    IN SENATE.
    
     MONDAY, February 28, 1887.
    
    The Senate met at 2 o'clock p. m.
    On motion by Mr. RAHM each Senator was allowed to press one bill when his name was
     called.
    
     LABOR FEDERATIONS
     Mr. BAILEY called up his bill [S. 169] concerning labor organizations. He said it will
      permit labor organizations to incorporate for the purposes set forth in Section 1 of the bill.
      On his further motion [after the vote on the passage of the bill] Senators present and
      refusing to vote were excused from voting.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: Hear the vote: Yeas 26, nays 0; present and not voting 11. So the
      bill passed.
    
    
     THE STATE PRISONS.
     The bill [S. 324] for the management of the State Prisons was read the third time.
     Mr. MCDONALD: I understand there has been an honest administration of the
      prison North, and I am not prepared nor will I vote for a bill that will intimate or insinuate
      that that we cannot trust such men. If the prison South has been corrupted this legislature is
      not to blame for it.
     Mr. BARRETT: While there has been a general charge of this kind, there has been no attempt
      to point out a single word in the bill which reflects in any way upon the prison North. I am
      sure it was not so intended, nor do the officials themselves so regard it. I care not what has
      been the policy of legislation heretofore, it behooves the legislature to put it in the right
      channel if possible. This is the only bill that has been introduced thus far looking to the
      removal of these officials, and I am greatly surprised that any Democrat should think of
      opposing it for a single moment. When the Democratic party, or any of its members confess they
      are unable to purify the the party within itself; when they confess they are unable to remove
      their corrupt officials, it is time for the people to consider whether or not they will
      continue the Democratic party in power. The people have been shown it is the first to discover
      corruption in its ranks, and it should be the first to remove. The bill seeks to accomplish
      another thing of the highest importance, and that is to employ an expert accountant to
      determine what amount is owing the State of Indiana, in order the people may recover the sums
      of money due them. I trust the bill will pass.
     Mr. MULLINIX: I am certalny favorable to this bill. When we find  out and know what is right and proper, that we certainly ought to
      do. This bill places the appointment in the hands of a man who is responsible, and he must
      answer to the people for his acts. There is but little danger of the Governor of our State
      making a mistake in his appointments. He would select no man who is here spending money to
      secure a position with a salary of $5O0. I believe the people all over Indiana demand the
      appointment by the Governor instead of a selection by a legislative body, and therefore I am
      certainly in favor of this bill.
     Mr. URMSTON: The only question is whether we are going to better our condition any by the
      passage of this bill. I can see but one thing in it I am in favor of, and that is that these
      institutions should be put in the hands of one board. The present law give the whole power
      into the hands of the wardens. The Directors are simply figure heads. If I had time I think I
      could make it appear that the appointing power is just as likely to be abused in the hands of
      the Governor as by the General Assembly.
     The bill passed by yeas 27, nays 0; present and refusing to vote 10.
     Pending the roll call--
     Mr. FOWLER said: I vote on this bill with many misgivings. Without taking time to discuss
      it, I vote "aye."
     Mr. MCCLURE, when his name was called, said: I would much rather have the
      election of prison directors by the legislature. I believe the General Assembly is as
      competent to select the Directors of the Prisons as a Governor is to appoint then. But in view
      of the hurrah that seems to prevail with Senators here to "clean the prisons out,"
      as they term it; the innocent as well as the guilty; inasmuch as that seems to be the
      prevailing sentiment, I would desire to have a rule or principle established that hereafter
      whenever we consider the nomination of Prison Directors we seek after those who have the
      business capacity and are capable and willing to perform their duties honestly. I shall not
      get an opportunity to offer such a motion now, but on this occasion, believing this bill will
      not become a law, I will vote "aye" at present.
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion, when called upon to vote, said: I vote for the bill with great
      pleasure. I think it is a move in the right direction. I think the thing ought to be cleaned
      out entirely. I vote "aye."
     Mr. URMSTON, in answering his name, said: I like the placing of the penal institutions under
      one management; but I believe there ought to be a section in this bill requiring Directors of
      the State Prisons, North and South, to buy their supplies on requisition. Feeling that I am
      not able to get a provision of this kind in the bill, and desiring the other shall become a
      law, I will vote "aye."
     Mr. MCDONALD said: I will never go against a solid vote of Democrats. I
      vote "aye."
     The vote was announced as above.
     Mr. BARRETT: I move to excuse those present not voting on this bill.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: The record will show the fact that they were excused.
    
    
     ELECTION BALLOTS.
     Mr. Bryant's bill [S. 289] was read the third time. He said: It provides that all
      ballots shall be a piece of plain white paper of uniform width of three inches; no device or
      distinguishing marks shall appear on it; pasters are prohibited; ballots may bear a plain
      written or printed caption expressing its politicial character, and no name shall printed on
      it other than those nominated by the party.
     The bill passed by yeas 26, nays 0; present and not voting, but excused 10.
    
    
     NEW PROPOSITIONS.
     Mr. SELLERS introduced a bill [S. 334] placing the license for selling intoxicating liquors
      at $200.
     Mr. BAILEY introduced bill [S. 335] to make appropriations for the State Government for the
      year ending Oct. 31, 1888; also [S. 336] for the  year
      ending Oct. 31, 1889; also [S. 337] for the year ending Oct. 31, 1887.
    
    
     COURTESIES BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES.
     On motion by Mr. FOWLER two communications from the Principal Secretary (similar to those of
      yesterday) stating that he was denied admission to the House of Representatives with messages
      from the Senate; were 
       orderad
       ordered
       spread on the Journal.
    
    
     SENATE BILLS PASSED.
     Mr. Howard, of St. Joseph's, bill [S. 35] providing that not more than one judgment by
      default shall be taken in a Justices Court, was passed by yeas 29, nays 0; refusing to vote
      and excused 11.
     Mr. Logsdon's bill [S. 329] concerning the incorporation of towns was passed by yeas
      28; nays 0; refusing to and excused 11.
     Mr. McClure's bill [S. 280] concerning the taxation of coal barges at Jeffersonville
      was passed by yeas 27, nays O; refusing to vote and excused 10.
     The Senate adjourned.
    
   
   
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
    
     MONDAY, February 28, 1887.
    
    The House met at 2 o'clock p. m. pursuant to adjournment last Friday.
    
     ANIMALS AT LARGE.
     The bill [S. 111] providing that the Supervisors
      shall take up animals running at large, was read the second time.
     Mr. GORDON: It seems to me bill proposes just one more turn of the screws upon the poor
      people of this State. I believe that as the matter now stands the law is very good. Stock can
      be impounded and disposed of just in the very ways that this bill proposes; and the only
      difference is that it proposes to put a fine upon the officer if he don't take it up.
      That is all there is in it. We will suppose that the county commissioners have passed an
      order, and a cow is running at large upon the commons and doing nobody any harm, shall we say
      that because the supervisor fails to take up that cow that he is guilty of misdemeanor? I do
      not it believe this bill ought to pass.
     Mr. BUCKLES: As the law is, stock is not allowed to run at large upon the the public commons
      or highways, unless an order of the board of county commissioners is made. It is said by some
      that it is no great nuisance to have the stock run at large in an agricultural district. Let
      us see for a moment; in Eastern Indiana rail timber is becoming very scarce. You are required
      to pay taxes upon on your land and put fences around it yourselves. Did you buy it for the
      purpose of accommodating some one else?
     Mr. KELLISON: I see by the provisions of the bill that it is made the duty of the road
      supervisor to impound cattle running at large, but does not specify what kind of notice shall
      be sufficient; whether printed or in writing.
     Mr. BUCKLES: Notice as I understand it is knowledge of a fact. If he is given notice, and
      that notice is true, it is his duty under this bill to look after it.
     Mr. KELLISON: Suppose the supervisor is a farmer, and at the time he might be engaged in
      threshing. Are you willing to put the supervisor in a position where he will be subject to so
      heavy a penalty?
     Mr. BUCKLES: The law is based upon reason, and if he does it as soon after he gets notice as
      he can, that is all that is required.
     Mr. GARRISON: This is a bill that directly affects my interest as a farmer, and I have a
      similar bill, simply differing from this one in this, that it makes it the duty of the
      constable to take up stock. As to the question of the poor widow's cow spoken of, I want
      to say to you that I am nearly surrounded by farms of widow women, and they desire a bill of
      this kind as much as I do; and they are just as able to take care of their stock as I am. I do
      know a great many of them that have cows and they are annoyed as much as the balance are by
      stock running at large.
     Mr. METZGER: You will find that this is the best bill. I think this is a bill that the
      farmers all over the  State want. I believe that the day
      has gone by for making a free public pasture of our public highways.
     Mr. GARDINER: I am acquainted with a large number of lawyers in the State of Indiana, and I
      don't know of one who lets his stock run at large. I am for the bill because I want the
      farmers cows out of my yard. It seems to me that every objection that has been made to the
      bill has been ably met by the lawyers.
     The constitutional rule was suspended by yeas 68, nays 14. The bill was read the third time.
      It finally passed by yeas 55, nays 27.
     Pending the roll call--
     Mr. FOSTER, when called upon to vote, said: I wish to say that upon this bill I have found
      out exactly how to vote. But I have fixed my opinion from majority of the opinions of those
      who are farmers themselves. I said during the canvass that I would try to represent the
      farmers. For the reason that I believe a majority of the farmers want this legislation, I vote
      with emphatic pleasure "aye."
     Mr. MAJOR, in explanation, said: This is a bill I have been somewhat opposed to. But
      believing that there has been very little received by the farmers, and believing that they ask
      for this bill, I think I shall cast my vote with the farmers and vote "aye."
     Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Owen, [explaining]: It has been said that the farmers are demanding such
      legislation as this. Being a farmer myself I am constrained to differ with the gentlemen
      because I believe that the principle in this bill is wrong. I do not believe that the farmers
      are in favor of a bill of this kind; therefore I vote "no."
     Mr. WHITE, in explanation of his vote, said: It is a matter of very little consequence
      whether the farmers want this bill or not. I vote for this bill for the reason that I believe
      the time has come that the public highways of this State should no longer be a free place for
      stock. I believe that the people desire a law similar to this bill, I therefore vote
      "aye."
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the bill finally passed.
    
    
     A MILITIA BILL.
     Mr. NOLIN'S bill [H. R. 264] to encourage military organizations was read the third
      time.
     Mr. BEASLEY: Since this bill was under discussion before I have consulted with some of my
      constituents and I have failed to find a single man who thinks it ought to become a law. What
      reasons are urged why this bill should pass? It is said that Ohio or Illinois appropriates so
      many dollars, and then we are asked if we are willing that the State of Indiana shall stay
      behind. I don't believe the tax payers are willing to pay out $37,000 for the purpose of
      maintaining a military reputation along with other States. I believe that Indiana should make
      a reputation for getting along without any militia. As American citizens I believe we have the
      best government on earth. The very fact that we have a militia will cause some to have hard
      feelings and it will eventually make them rise up in their might. I have been asked to vote
      for this bill by the Adjutant General, and I believe he is sincere, but I can not see it that
      way, and I believe if the members of the House will give the bill the consideration it
      deserves that it will fail, as I hope it will.
     Mr. IBACH: The more I think of this bill the more I think it should pass. When I look at the
      amount of taxable property as reported by the Auditor of State; and the value of property as
      taxed in cities and towns, as compared with the farms, I believe this protection is needed the
      cities much greater than in the country.
     Mr. MONTGOMERY of Owen: I am opposed to the provisions of this bill now, as I have been at
      all times since its introduction into this body. I am opposed to it for two reasons. First, I
      do not believe there is present demand for it; and for the further reason that I think it is
      time to call a halt on account of our finances. I  hope
      the bill will not become a law. I think $37,000 given to that purpose would be thrown away at
      this stage of the game.
     Mr. GOUGH: I do not think this bill ought to become a law at this time. 1,800 men would be
      no force to repel an invasion, or anything of that sort. If any militia is needed for any
      purpose, then we ought to have all the men that can bear arms in this State in the militia. We
      find on this floor that the men who represent cities are generally in favor of this bill. They
      are in favor of it because they have military organizations in their cities, and these
      military organizations are urging it. It is all very nice. I am willing that the cities may
      have their companies of soldiers and all that sort of thing, but I am opposed to paying for
      them out of the public treasury, especially at this time. There may come a time when the State
      can afford to indulge in this luxury.
     Mr. BRIANT: I hold in my hand memorials from eleven counties to which 535 names are signed
      asking for this bill, and many members of House have such memorials. The young men of the
      State of Indiana have not asked the State of Indiana to do any more than refund the money they
      have spent. I think that Indiana can do no lees than refund this.
     Mr. WEYAND: I have listened with considerable interest to the discussion of this bill. I
      thought that Indiana was an agricultural and stock raising State, and not a military State. I
      know if I vote against this I will reflect the sentiment of the people of my county. I have
      one objection to the bill, and that is it proposes to support 36 companies. I believe they
      have now 42. Doubtless six companies will be refused recognition as State militia. This would
      be an outrage. Besides the location of Indiana is such as not to demand a large military
      organization. We are not on the seaboard but in an 
       argicultural
       agricultural
       community, and there is no demand for a large military force in the State of
      Indiana.
     Mr. NOLIN: It is true that the State of Indiana has 42 organized military companies, but
      they do not belong to the State of Indiana. The citizens have equipped them. This bill
      proposes that the State shall provide for them, and not that the citizens of the cities shall.
      It the State does not want us we want to disband.
     He demanded the previous question. The House seconded the demand, and under its operations
      the bill passed by yeas 60, nays 19.
     Pending the roll call--
     Mr. COX, of Miami [explaining]: It is said that there is one element in the State that is
      opposed to this bill, and therefore it ought not to become a law. If there is one element in
      the State opposed to the law, because the militia may be called out enforce the law, that is a
      good reason why this bill should become a law. Whenever a man opposes the militia because that
      militia may be called out to enforce the law, that man is wrong. I believe that this State is
      a.peace-loving State; I believe that peace should be maintain at all times and under all
      circumstances when it can be properly. The militia, it is to be presumed, will only be called
      out when ordered by the officer whose duty it is to enforce the law. There is another reason
      why the State ought to support the militia. If the State needs the militia she ought to pay
      for their services. I vote "aye."
     Mr. FOSTER, when his name was called, said: I am in favor of this bill because I believe the
      State ought to be the protector of all such institutions. I support this bill because I
      believe it encourages a spirit to believe in the State. We should teach our children, and
      train our young and old men to love our State. This thing of never needing military force is
      preposterous. I do not believe that it will cause any trouble among our people, but on the
      other hand I think this law will promote peace, I vote "aye."
     Mr. MILLER, when called upon to vote, said: I do not often explain my vote. Here I have a
      petition in  instructing me to vote for this bill, and of
      course I can't very well get around it. My early religious training was against shedding
      blood, but about the time the rebellion broke out it took away nearly all the quaker spirit
      there was in me. When we have organized dangerous forces around us I think it is necessary,
      and for that reason I vote "aye."
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the bill passed the House.
    
    
     BILLS WERE INTRODUCED BY
     Mr. Brown [H. R. 473] to legalize the acts of the trustees of the town of Knightstown.
     r. Cruson [H. R. 474] to change the charter of the town of Vernon.
     Both bills were finally passed the House under a suspension of the rules.
    
    
     APPELLATE COURT BILL.
     Mr. NIBLACK's bill [H. R. 417] to create an Appellate Court was passed by yeas 52, nays
      35.
     Pending the roll call--
     Mr. BUCKLES said: If there is such a demand, the plan suggested by the gentleman from
      Marshall (Mr. Kellison) the other day for such a court, is the best that can be adopted, I
      vote "no."
     Mr. DICKERSON said: Not one single man, so far as I know, in Vigo county, has asked for
      this. I am opposed to taxing the farmers for the purpose of creating new courts for the
      benefit of the lawyers. I vote "no."
     Mr. GARDINER, when his name was called, said: I believe the Supreme Court needs relief, but
      I understand the committee on organization of courts is now considering a
      bill that will relieve the Supreme Court without the creation of another Supreme Court, I
      therefore vote "no."
     Mr. PARKER, in explanation of his vote, said: Because I know of no bill in the course of
      preparation--and I am a member of the committee on organization of
      courts--that better than this one, I vote "aye."
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the bill passed the House.
     Mr. HARRELL: I move that the clerk of this House be instructed to transmit this bill to the
      Senate, and immediately notify the Senate of its passage.
     The SPEAKER: The motion is out of order.
    
    
     ANOTHER EXTRA EMPLOYE.
     On motion by Mr. GORDON $1.25 additional pay was allowed the elevator boy.
     Mr. Kellison's change-of-venue bill [H.R. 140] was passed by yeas 80, nays 0.
     The House adjourned.
    
   
   
   
    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    IN SENATE.
    
     TUESDAY, March 1, 1887.
    
    Mr. SCHLOSS: I move a call of the Senate.
    Mr. SHIVELY: I think there is a quorum present. I see no necessity for a call.
    The PRESIDENT pro tempore: If Senators leave without leave of absence the Senate has power to
     punish them for contempt, or refuse them their pay.
    
     COURTE5Y BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES.
     Mr. FOWLER: As chairman of the Joint Committee on Enrolled Bills I sought
      to deliver to the chairman of Committee on Enrolled Bills in the House of
      Representatives Enrolled Senate Act No. 108, but was refused admission by the Doorkeeper of
      said House. I then addressed to the Speaker of the House the following note, to-wit:
      [Announcing his business.] And the Speaker returned to me said note with directions to the
      Doorkeeper not to admit me, and I have returned said Enrolled Act to the Secretary of the
      Senate to be disposed of as the Senate may direct.
    
    
     THE INTIMIDATION LAWS.
     Mr. RAHM called up his bill [S. 308] to repeal Section 2127, R. S., which was read the third
      time and failed to pass the Senate by yeas 23, nays 7; refusing to vote 11--as follows:
     
      
       
        YEAS. Bailey, Barrett, Branaman, Bryant, Cox, Duncan (of Brown,) Fowler, French,
         Griffith, Hale, Howard (of St. Joseph,) Logsdon, McClure, McDonald, Rahm, Schloss, Sellers,
         Shively, Tharp, Trippet, Urmston, Zimmerman, Mr. President, 23.
        NAYS. Andrew, Berry, Day, Mullinix, Peterson, Thompson (of Marion,) Weir, 7.
        PRESENT AND REFUSING TO VOTE Davis, Drake, Dresser, Ensley, Harness, Huston, Johnson,
         Kennedy, Macy, Marshall, Moon, 11
       
      
     
     Pending the roll call--
     Mr. MULLINIX said: I am not willing to cast my vote for anything that will invite criminals
      to interfere with the tribunals of our country; therefore I vote "no."
     Mr. THOMPSON of Marion, when his name was called said: This bill presents itself to me as
      one of a most dangerous character. I had nothing to do with putting that law on the statute
      book, but it is there in order to punish those who may interfere with the law of the land. I
      will not aid in throwing down any guard for the protection of the life and liberty  of the traveling community or the life and liberty of others. No,
      sir. Look at Chicago, where six men to-day are awaiting the gallows because of their
      disposition to destroy life and trample down law. This law is not in the way of any man of
      good character;--this law does not interfere with him. Gentlemen, think well before you throw
      down the gate and thus tend to destroy the safety of those traveling; for, I tell you, public
      indignation will arouse itself on that subject. This is a country of constitutions, and of law
      and order; and when men come from foreign countries and imbue their hands in the blood of
      officers of the law, who are bound to keep the peace, it is time for the American people to do
      something to protect themselves and preserve the honor of their country. I vote
      "no."
     Mr. THARP, when he voted, said: I am in favor of revolution, in many instances. Revolution
      is the thing which worked out the liberty of the people. But for revolution the tyrants who
      dominated the world for so many centuries would still be dominant torday. But for the spirit
      of rebellion which stirred the patriotic breast of Patrick Henry, and incited the noble deeds
      of our revolutionary fathers, we would to-day be living under the administration of the powers
      beyond the sea. I am surprised, Mr. President, at the subterfuge many monopolies report to in
      order to put up prices of the products which go to sustain the homes of this country. They
      burden agricultural and other interests by pooling their issues. Legislation does so much for
      capital and so little for labor that labor is rising in a revolutionary struggle for existence
      through that medium. I, for one, will never vote to allow a monied corporation, or any other
      kind of an institution to invoke the aid of the law to strike down and crush out any effort of
      the humble laboring people to sustain their rights in this country. I therefore take pleasure
      in voting "aye."
     Mr. WEIR [in explanation]: I am not a revolutionist; I am, however, in favor of law and
      order, and therefore I am opposed to the passage of this bill. I do not believe there is any
      class of citizens, who are good people, demanding the repeal of this law. I do not believe
      there is any class of good citizens in this State that desire other than good order.--The
      statute sought to be repealed is one in the direction of good order. This law should remain on
      the statute book in order that good order may be preserved, and the law enforced to prevent
      interference with the legitimate business of the coutry. It is astonishing that there can be
      found any number of Senators in favor of taking such a provision of law from the statute book.
      I vote "no."
     Mr. ZIMMERMAN, when his name was called, said: The laboring people of Indiana are a
      law-abiding class of citizens; and I believe this section of the statute is a stigma upon fair
      name of the laboring men of the State. It suspects them of a crime they have not committed.
      The Senator from Marion (Mr. Thompson) referred to the bloody deeds of the Chicago anarchists.
      Don't the Senator know the capitalists of this country are responsible for that? They
      bring over the most ignorant class of emigrants,--the class of men who bore the red flag at
      Hay-market in Chicago. The capitalists of this country are responsible for that. Don't
      the Senator know that?
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion: I didn't know the capitalists were the cause of the mob at
      Chicago.
     Mr. ZIMMERMAN: Those men were brought over here to take the place of American workingmen. It
      is a fact that cannot be denied. Another pernicious system inaugurated against American
      laboring men, and formally acknowledged by legislation is that which permits contract convict
      labor. Contract pauper labor on the one hand, and prison contract labor on the other. I am in
      favor of law and order; that every man shall enjoy the rights of property; and that he may
      hire whom he will and when he pleases; but I am not in favor having the law-abiding and
      peaceful  laboring people of the State of Indiana suffer
      for crimes perpetrated by foreigners who come over here, not for the purpose of becoming
      American citizens and enjoying our grand institutions, but simply come over to take the places
      of American laboring men. For these reasons I vote for the repeal of this section. I vote
      'aye.'
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the bill failed to pass for want of constitutional majority--"a majority of all the
      members elected."
    
    
     SENATE BILLS PASSED.
     Mr. SELLERS called up the bill [S. 267] which prohibits the maintenance of dams without
      fish-ladders, and it was passed by yeas 28, hays 0; excused from voting 6.
     Mr. MULLINIX called up Mr. Barrett's bill [S. 57] to prohibit the obsruction of drains
      and ditches, and it was passed by yeas 30, nays 0; excused 8.
    
    
     PURDUE UNIVERSITY.
     Mr. SELLERS introduced a bill [S. 388]: Appropriating $24,000 for the maintenance of Purdue
      University. He made an ineffectual motion to press the bill to a final vote.
    
    
     STATE LEGISLATIVE STENOGRAPHER.
     The Committee on Finance returned the bill [S. 383] to elect W. H.
      Drapier State Legislative Stenographer, "the recommendation that the same do
      pass."
    
    
     OFFICIAL LIST OF BILLS FINALLY PASSED.
     Mr. FOWLER submitted the following:
     Mr. President--Your Joint Committee on Enrolled Bills would submit the
      following report: That there have been passed by the Senate and House of Representatives,
      signed by the Speaker of the House, Hon. Warren G. Sayre, and the President of the Senate,
      Hon. Alonzo G. Smith, and delivered to the Governor, and by him approved, the following Senate
      Bills, to-wit: Nos. 21, 72, 52, 19, 6, 278 and 292. That there have been passed by the house
      of Representatives and the Senate, signed by the Speaker of the House, Hon. Warren G. Sayre,
      and the President of the Senate, Hon. Alonzo G. Smith, and delivered to the Governor, and by
      him approved, the following House Bills, to-wit: Nos. 6, 19, 77, 191, 166, 132, 105, 70, 14,
      46 and 143, and said committee asks that this report be spread in full upon the journal of the
      Senate.
     The report was concurred in.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     SENATE BILLS PASSED.
     Mr. Logsdon's bill [S. 119] legalizing the acts of notaries public after their
      commissions have expired, was passed by yeas 28, nays 0; refusing to vote 10.
     Mr. FOWLER called up his telephone and telegraph bill [S. 211] which was also passed by yeas
      28, nays 0; refusing to vote 9. On his motion Senators refusing to vote were not excused.
    
    
     PAY OF REPUBLICAN SENATORS.
     Mr. FOWLER offered the following:
     
      
       
        Resolved, That all Senators absent without leave of absence and all Senators present who
         refuse to vote on any and all questions before the Senate, unless they are excused, shall
         not be allowed and per diem or any other compensation as such Senators.
       
      
     
     Mr. WEIR: I submit if that resolution is in order. It attempts to change an existing law
      which affects members of this body. The law fixes their compensation at six dollars a day.
     Mr. FOWLER: Any Senator absent without leave is not entitled to compensation. It seems to me
      if Senators set here and refuse to take any part in the deliberations of this body, they ought
      not to be allowed per diem or any other compensation.
     Mr. WEIR: What I said was not intended as a justification of what those Senators see fit to
      do. The Senate can send for absentees and if unable to secure their attendance, the Senate can
      do with them as it sees fit.
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion: Mr. President, it seems to me Gabriel's trumpet cannot wake
      these people. What under heaven has struck them dumb? With such dumb people as are in the
      institution for the deaf and dumb what are we to do? Here are the subjects, and there is the
      assylum; what are we to do? [Laughter.]
     Mr. BAILEY: This Senate has no power to deal with the matter of pay of members in the manner
      this resolution proposes. Perhaps the better way to dispose of this resolution  and save any question of legality, will be its reference. I move it
      be referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.
     This motion was agreed to.
    
    
     FREE GRAVEL ROADS.
     Mr. URMSTON called up the bill [H. R. 15] authorizing County Commissioners to construct free
      gravel roads. It was passed by yeas 27, nays 1; refusing to vote 8.
    
    
     LIQUOR LICENSE.
     Mr. SELLERS called up his $200 license bill. [S. 334] introduced on Monday; and moved to
      amend the bill so as to appropriate half the revenue obtained from the licenses to the school
      fund, and half to the fund for the construction of free gravel roads.
     Mr. TRIPPETT offered an amendment to the amendment which was adopted, that half be paid into
      the county instead of road fund.
     Mr. THARP: I certainly am in favor of the amendment offered to the amendment, but the bill
      seems to be too sweeping in its character. The U. S. charges the wholesale merchant a big
      license fee, and if the State comes in and puts on another--
     The PRESIDENT pro tem [interposing]: It don't raise the price of it any.
      [Laughter.]
     Mr. SCHLOSS made an ineffectual motion to strike out "$200," and insert in lieu
      "$150" as the license fee.
     Mr. BAILEY: I move this bill be referred to the Committee on Temperance
      with House bill 20.
     Mr. MULLINIX: I believe we ought to consider these bills separately. I believe the time has
      come when we ought to take some steps in deference to what is demanded of the Senate of
      Indiana. I don't want to see this bill committed. I represent a class of people who
      compose the honest bone and sinew of Indiana, and they demand high license. I received, when
      at home recently for only a few hours time, a petition asking me to support House bill 20,
      signed by 73 voters--non-partisans--of my town. I represent on this floor one of the grandest
      Democratic counties in the State of Indiana. Sullivan county is a strong temperance county,
      and I certainly would not discharge my duty if I would not advocate her views upon this
      floor.
     The motion to refer was agreed by yeas 22, nays 6; refusing to vote 7.
     On motion by Mr. FOWLER Senators refusing to vote were not excused.
     The Senate adjourned.
    
   
   
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
    
     TUESDAY, March 1, 1887.
    
    The sessionn was opened with prayer by Rev. G. G. Mitchell.
    Mr. Custer's bill [H. R. 94] making it the duty of the road-master's of railroads
     to cut thistles and other noxious weeds along the highways, was passed by yeas 75, nays 2.
    
     THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNORSHIP.
     Mr. ROBRRTS: offered the following:
     
      
       
        Whereas, Prior to the general election in 1886, Hon. Mahlon D. Manson, the then acting
         and lawfully constituted Lieutenant-Governor of the State of Indiana, vacated said office
         by accepting, qualifying, and entering upon the discharge of the duties of an office under
         the laws of the United States; and
        Whereas, After said office was vacated, as aforesaid, the Hon. Francis T. Hord, the
         Attorney General of the State of Indiana, on the solicitations of the Hon. Isaac P. Gray,
         Governor of this State, gave it as his opinion as such Attroney General that a vacancy
         existed in said office of Lieutenant-Governor, and that the electors of this State might
         lawfully fill the same by the election of a competent person at the then ensuing November
         election for the year 1886; and
        Whereas, Acting upon the opinion of said Attorney General, the political parties of this
         State respectively placed in nomination, for the suffrages of the people, a candidate for
         the office of Lieutenant-Governor, and thereafter, on the 2d day of November, 1886, the
         electors of the State, believing they had the lawful right to do so, voted for the
         candidate of their choice for said office, in manner and form as the law, in such cases
         provides, which resulted in the election of Hon. Robert S. Robertson to such office, by the
         free and untrammeled suffrages as aforesaid; as was verified by a canvass of the votes cast
         in the several counties at said election, and lawfully declared on the 10th day of January,
         1887, when said vote was canvassed as aforesaid; and
        
        Whereas, The said Robert S. Robertson, on said 10th day of January, 1887, took the oath
         of office; according to law, and has ever since been ready and willing to enter upon the
         discharge of the duties of said office; and
        Whereas, A controversy has arisen whether Hon. Alonzo Smith or Hon. Robert S. Robertson
         is lawfully entitled to preside over the Senate in its deliberations; therefore,
        Be it resolved by the House of Representatives, the Senate concurring, That it is the
         sense of this General Assembly that in all such controversies, in the absence of a
         well-defined rule of law touching such controversy, that all doubts should be thrown in
         favor of the people, acting in their sovereign capacity at a general election, such as was
         held on the 2nd day of November, 1886; and therefore, surrendering all differences of
         opinion, and earnestly desiring and intending to recognize the action of the people in said
         election as an expression of their sovereign will, we declare it to be our deliberate
         judgment that the Hon. Robert S. Robertson should be, and he is hereby, recognized as the
         lawfully constituted Lieutenant-Governor of the State of Indiana, and that he at once enter
         upon the discharge of the duties of said office in obedience to the expressed will of the
         people at the ballot-box on the 2d day of November, 1886.
       
      
     
     Mr. KELLISON offered a substitute therefor. The reading of which was interrupted by--
     The SPEAKER, who declared it was out of order, and said: This House has adopted a
      resolution, which then became a rule of action, to have no communication with the Senate until
      Robert R. Robertson is seated as Lieutenant-Governor. This substitute comes in conflict with
      that resolution, which must be considered as a command resting upon this House
     Mr. KELLISON desired to appeal from this decision of the Chair.
     The SPEAKER decided such an appeal not in order.
     Mr. KELLISON: Then, Mr. Speaker, I will offer a resolution to expunge that resolution from
      the record.
     The SPEAKER: And that will be out of order.
     The substitute was as follows:
     
      
       
        Whereas, The Senate and House of Representatives of the Fifty-fifth General Assembly of
         Indiana did severally effect an organization on the 6th day of January, 1887, with Hon. A.
         G. Smith as the presiding officer of said Senate, and Hon. Warren G. Sayre as speaker of
         the said House of Representatives; and,
        Whereas, On the 10th day of January, 1887, in the presence of this House and certain
         members of said Senate, papers purporting to be the official returns of an election had and
         holden on the 2d day of November, 1886, for the election of a Lieutenant-Governor were
         opened by the said Hon. Warren G. Sayre, and said vote was then and there canvassed, and,
         it appearing that a greater number of votes were cast for Hon. Robert S. Robertson than for
         any other candidate named therein; said Robert S. Robertson was declared by said Warren G.
         Sayre, Speaker as aforesaid, to be the duly elected Lieutenant Governor of Indiana to the
         vacancy made by the withdrawal from said office of Hon. Mahlon D. Manson, and said Robert
         S. Robertson did then and there take an oath in form and substance as is required of a
         Lieutenant Governor of said State; and,
        Whereas, Said Robert S. Robertson did afterward enter upon the floor of said Senate and
         make claim to be the lawfully elected Lieutenant-Governor of said State and did demand the
         right to preside over the sessions of said Senate, and has ever since continued to make
         such demand, but his said claims were not recognized by said Senate, but were treated as
         though wholly unfounded in law, and, in fact said Robert S. Robertson, whether rightfully
         or wrongfully, is kept out of said office and said Hon. A. G. Smith has continued to
         preside over said Senate ever since said organization, and is de facto, if not de jure, the
         President of said Senate, and has been such from the 6th of January, 1887, to this time;
         and
        Whereas, This House did, by its acts, recognize the legality of the organization of said
         Senate, with said Alonzo G. Smith as its presiding officer from the day said Senate was
         organized until the 23d of February, 1887, and long after the time from which said Robert
         S. Robertson claimed the right to act as Lieutenant-Governor and President of said Senate;
         and,
        Whereas, On said 23d day of February, 1887, this House did pass a resolution refusing to
         hold any further communication with said Senate, and refusing to recognize the legality of
         its organization until the said Robert S. Robertson was permitted to preside over the
         sessions, therefore, and,
        Whereas, As a result of said action and refusal of this House to transmit bills and to
         recognize the organization and to hold communication with said Senate great and irreparable
         injury is likely to result to public interests and undertakings; therefore,
        Resolved, by the House of Representatives: That the resolution of the 23d of February
         last, refusing to have any official communication with the Senate until Robert S. Robertson
         was permitted to occupy and discharge the duties of Lieutenant Governor and President of
         said Senate, he and the same is hereby rescinded and expunged, and the Assistant Clerk of
         this House is hereby instructed to strike from the journal of Wednesday, February 23, 1887,
         all that part of the proceedings of this House relating to said resolution.
       
      
     
     
     Mr. JEWETT offered the following as amendment, which was also declared out of order by the
      Speaker:
     
      
       
        I move to amend the resolutions as follows: Add to the preamble the following: "And,
         whereas, this General Assembly has duly elected Hon. David Turpie a Senator from Indiana in
         the Senate of the United States." Add to resolutions the following:
        "Therefore, be it further
        "Resolved, That Hon. David Turpie should be admitted to his seat in the Senate of
         the United States without opposition, and that any and all efforts to prevent him from
         taking his seat as Senator are unpatriotic and wrongful, and are deliberate attempts to
         thwart the will of the people in their political choice as expressed at the
         polls."
       
      
     
     Mr. IBACH questioned the consideration of the Robert's resolution on the point of order
      applied to the Kellison substitute. He said the Roberts resolution was concurrent and
      therefore conflicted with the action of the House.
     The SPEAKER overruled the point of order.
     Mr. ROBERTS: Mr. Speaker:--The preamble and resolution just read from the Clerk's desk
      was prepared by me in no fractious spirit. They are the result of a solemn conviction of duty
      after more than six weeks careful and thoughtful deliberation. This paper recognizes the fact
      that a vacancy occurred prior to the November election, in 1886, in the office of
      Lieutenant-Governor by the acceptance by General Manson, theretofore Lieutenant-Governor, of
      an office under the laws of the United States. When Gen. Manson's acceptance of the
      office was fully known, the Governor of this State solicited the opinion of Hon. Francis T.
      Hord, the Attorney General, who after careful consideration, gave it as his opinion that a
      vacancy had occurred in the office, and that it was right and proper it should be filled by
      the people at the ensuing November election. Of the eminent ability of the Attorney General I
      need not speak, for it is recognized by all. Not a voice from any quarter was raised adverse
      to the able opinion of the Attorney General. Men of all parties acquiesed in it. The
      Democratic State Convention met in Tomlinson Hall in this city, made up of such distinguished
      Democratic jurists as McDonald, Holman, Voorhees, Coffroth, the Hords, and many others, and
      without even questioning the right of the people to fill the vacancy by a popular election
      according to law, and as a result, Col. John C. Nelson was placed in nomination for Lieutenant
      Governor. The Republicans following with their State Convention, placed in nomination for that
      office Col. Robert S. Robertson. No question was raised by the Republican convention as to the
      right of the people to elect a competent person to that office. The National Labor Party and
      the Prohibition party did likewise. The canvass was spirited, and up to the close of the
      election, November 2, 1886, no one anywhere doubted the right of the people to elect. I did
      all I could to elect Colonel Nelson and the entire Democratic ticket. The people believed, and
      I believed with them, that they had a right to elect a Lieutenant Governor. I never cast a
      vote in better faith in my life. I believe I had the same lawful right to vote for Nelson that
      I had, two years before, to vote for Cleveland for President. I don't believe there were
      100 votes cast last November with any other feeling.
     Mr. Speaker, were I in Russia, Italy, Austria or Prussia and a controversy would arise
      between the crown and the people, I would expect all doubts to be resolved in favor of the
      crown, for in monarchial governments the crown is recognized as being superior to the rights
      of the people. Not so, thank God, in a land of free men and free institutions. In this country
      the people are recognized as the source of all political power. When a controversy arises
      between the people, acting in their sovereign capactiy, as at a general election authorized by
      law, any and all doubts, in the absence of a positive rule of law on the subject, are cast in
      favor of the action of the people. This rule attains as the result of free institutions, and
      free institutions can be maintained in no other way. When you strike down the sovereign will
      of the people, lawfully expressed at the  ballot box in
      the choice of public servants, you strike down popular liberty itself. Sir, the people have
      spoken in this matter. They have said, at a free and untrameled election, held according to
      law, that Robert S. Robertson is their choice for Lieutenant Governor, and as much as I regret
      the result, and as anxious as I was for the election of Colonel Nelson, yet I bow with
      becoming reference to the sovereign will of the people as expressed at the ballot-box, on the
      2d day of November, 1886. As a friend of free institutions I cast all doubt in favor of the
      people, and recognize them in so doing as the true source of all political power, and I pray
      God that the time will never come with me when I will fail to approve this fundamental
      principle. We must submit to the will of the majority lawfully expressed, for in this way only
      can we maintain popular liberty and free institutions.
     Mr. Speaker, in 1861, when the tocsin of war sounded and armed rebels rose up against the
      Government, I stood almost alone on the floor of the Indiana House of Representatives, on the
      Democratic side, in favor of the enforcement of laws and the suppression of the Rebellion. I
      never regretted the stand I then took, and I do not believe I will regret the stand I have
      taken to-day. I believe I am in the right for I am upholding, in so doing, the sovereignty of
      the people, I have law and order on my side, and I fear not the judgment the people of
      Dearborn county will pronounce upon me. I did not fear it in 1861, and I do not fear it now.
      God forbid that I should ever allow my judgment to be warped by motives of political ambition
      or selfish interests.
     Mr. BEASLEY insisted on the point that an order had been issued a few days ago whereby the
      House refused to recognize the Senate until Colonel Robertson was seated in the chair. This
      resolution was a concurrent resolution, and was therefore not in order. If the Republicans had
      conceded one or two points at the outset of the session he believed it would have been good
      party policy for the Democrats to have recognized Colonel Robertson as Lieutenant Governor. He
      believed that a majority of the House having been obliged as a matter of policy to recognize
      Hon. A. G. Smith as President of the Senate earlier in the session, it was too late now for
      them to take any other action. This branch of the Legislature having recognized the other
      branch, it would nullify all the legislation that had gone before, if any other action was
      taken now. He did not believe that the adoption of this resolution would do any good. It was a
      mere piece of party buncome.
     Mr. JEWETT: The gentleman from Vigo and Sullivan [Mr. Beasley] has properly called attention
      to the ludicrous position which this House occupies toward the Senate upon necessary
      legislation. The other day the majority of this House passed a childish resolution declaring
      that unless a different organization was effected in the Senate--unless the Senate should
      abandon all claim to regulate its own business and affairs--the House would decline to
      transact any further business with the Senate. Now comes the gentleman from Dearborn [Mr.
      Roberts], the latest, and I predict, the last recruit to the shattered and defeated column of
      the enemy, and proposes a concurent resolution! This is moonshine madness, and were it not so
      serious in its effect upon the people's business, it would be laughable. You want to pass
      a resolution upon which the Senate will act, yet the House will refuse, as they have for days
      unlawfully refused, to transmit the same to the Senate for action. Could partisan stupidity go
      further? Yet I do not entirely regret the introduction of this resolution, because its
      consideration gives us a chance to call attention to the history of the unhappy controversy
      which has brought the State to dire an extremity--which has frittered away our time and the
      people's money. And I warn gentlemen upon the other side that the people will hold them
      responsible for all this confusion and waste, and will condemn them as unscrupulous  partisans and politicians, who think more of using this
      session for the advantage of the Republican party than the needs of the people. You will,
      indeed, have trouble in explaining to the plain people of this State, why, if the present
      organization of the Senate was good enough to transact business with for fifty days, it is not
      good enough to go on and complete the business of the session. You will have trouble in
      explaining to them why it is so dreadful a thing to resist Robertson's claim to the
      Presidency of the Senate; but is so patriotic and excellent a thing for you to sit up at night
      plotting to keep David Turpie out of his seat in the Senate of the United States. You say that
      the people elected Robertson. So the people elcted Cornelius Meagher Representative from Vigo
      county, but not one of you could be found who did not make haste to deprive him of his seat.
      The people of this State, through the forms of law duly elected Hon. David Turpie United
      States Senator but your newspapers throughout the State are declaring that you will resist his
      claims by unlawful means. Do you think the people will take any more kindly to your acts than
      ours? I am of the opinion they will not, and that buncome resolutions like this introduced by
      the gentleman from Dearborn will not in the slightest degree aid you. I say it's the
      merest buncomb, for the reason that Colonel Roberston, who claims to be the Lieutenant
      Governor of this State, has refused to allow this question to be decided by the Supreme Court,
      the only tribunal whose decision the people would consider final. On the contrary, when the
      court could have settled the trouble--when the people of the State were praying that it
      might--when every consideration of public policy and patriotism demanded that such decision
      should be made, this so-called Lieutenant-Governor pleaded the baby act, and claimed that the
      Supreme Court had no jurisdiction of his person because this suit was not first commenced in
      Allen County. It was a coward act, and, having thus escaped a decision which knew would be
      against him, this so-called Lieutenant Governor is found addressing a mob of Republican thugs
      who had assembled to batter down the doors of the Senate. You wil find when these matters are
      fully known to the people they will not condemn--but applaud the Democrats of this General
      Assembly for having stood up for law, for the right of the majority to rule. It was a foolish
      act, this determination of yours to stop legislation, unless your so-called martyr was
      admitted to preside over the Senate. Your purpose was to have your way or to starve the State
      institutions. Be it so, we can stand it if you can. The people of this State elected a
      Democratic Legislature, and that Legislature elected * David Turpie to succeed Ben Harrison.
      Your purpose is to get control of the organization and by unlawful methods put Ben Harrison
      back in his place as his own successor. Once for all, I you it will never be done. Never while
      his pulses beat can Harrison again be Senator from Indiana. Early in this session I offered a
      resolution asking that a case be presented to the Supreme Court for the purpose of having
      decided this one question: Was there a vacancy in the office of Lieutenant-Governor to be
      filled at the last general election? And in that resolution I plainly stated that only
      question should be the vacancy, and everything else should be taken for granted in favor of
      Robertson. What was the result? You voted down the resolution, and then when Mr. Smith brought
      his action, your claimant sneaked behind his personal privilege and claimed that he must be
      first sued in Allen County. I pity a man whose soul is so small that he could make a defense
      of that sort. But what followed? When this plea of Robertson had been sustained, and the court
      said that the Marion Circuit Court had no jurisdiction over his person or the subject of the
      action, what did you do? Why, with a flourish of trumpets you claimed the case was decided in
      your favor. Let us once for all silence that foolish lie
      so very industriously peddled out over this State. Let us once for all proclaim that no
      decision has ever been made in favor of Colonel Robertson's pretensions. A decision might
      have been made had he not feared to have one. A very simple illustration will suffice to make
      this plain: Suppose, when we first came here, my friend from Madison county loaned me $500,
      and, as I did not pay it, he went the other day and sued me for the amount before a Justice of
      the Peace. Now, if I should plead that I could only be sued in Floyd county, the Court would
      so hold and dismiss the suit. But would that decide I did not owe $500 ? or, if the Court
      should further decide, as is the fact that a Justice could not try a case involving $500, and
      so had no jurisdiction and dismiss the case, would that decide that I did not owe Mr. Foster
      the money? According to the claim made by your party, that would be effect of the decision.
      It's very droll when Judge Gresham decides that he has no jurisdiction over the election
      cases the Republicans do not herald that as a decision in favor of Mr. Perkins and others. By
      no means. They say that only shows the case was begun in the wrong court. It's very funny
      these contrary opinions about keeping people out of office and the effect of decsions. It
      makes a difference whose ox is gored.
     Mr. BROWN: I would like to ask about the public charge that a Democratic Governor, who acted
      upon the opinion of a Democratic Attorney-General in calling for the election of a
      Lieutenant-Governor, declared that he would call out the militia, if necessary, to support the
      usurpation of a Democratic Senator?
     Mr. JEWETT: Never mind about the Governor. Thus far in every emergency he has proved himself
      more than equal to the occasion, and I doubt not he will take care of the State and himself
      very much to your inconvenience.
     Mr. KELLISON said he was willing to concede that the gentleman from Dearborn [Mr. Roberts]
      was sincere in his declarations and that he was actuated by honest and patriotic motives in
      offering the resolution to the House. No man held the gentleman in higher estimation for his
      courageous, manly character than did the speaker. Yet he was not willing to concede that the
      gentleman was right or that his resolution stated the fact and law of his case. On the
      contrary he believed that the resolution was wholly incorrect as to the law governing the
      cases of a vacancy in the office of Lieutenant-Governor. As a matter of sentiment it was a
      fact that some of the Democratic papers Northern Indiana had protested at the beginning
      against any attempt to prevent Robert S. Robertson from discharging the duties of the office
      of Lieutenant-Governor. This was, as the speaker believed, only a matter of sentiment and in
      the interest of what is popularly termed 'fair play' and not because these papers
      believed that Robert S. Robertson was legally or constitutionally elected to that office, and
      not because they conceded or admitted that he was lawfully entitled to the office. He himself
      had been a delegate to the Democratic State Convention and helped to nominate a candidate for
      Lieutenant-Governor, and had not questioned the proposition that an election the people was
      necessary. He had gone to polls and cast his vote for the opponent of Mr. Robertson without a
      question of the necessity for so doing and without giving the matter any examination or
      thought. He came to take his seat in this House undecided as to whether there was a vacancy to
      be filled by popular election or not, and it was not until he had read the arguments and brief
      of counsel in the case of Smith vs. Robertson that he became convinced that the election of
      November 2 in so far as it related to Lieutenant-Governor was void. He was now as thoroughly
      convinced that Robert S. Robertson was not and could not have been elected to that office last
      November as he was that he was standing upon that floor. The General Assembly was unable to
      decide it or else it would neve have found its way to the courts. The General Assembly was still unable to settle it, for the House
      decided it in favor of Robertson, and the Senate in favor of Smith.
     The Republican House says it is right and will not yield, and the Democratic Senate, equally
      conscientious, says that it is right and will not yield. Every utterance that has been made by
      any Judge or any court is in favor and strengthens the Democratic position, and gentlemen may
      make up their minds once for all that there will be no backing down on the part of the Senate.
      They have the key to the situation, and their feet are upon the rock of the Constitution and
      there they will stand forever. When it is all done with, the whole thing amounts to a contest
      between two men claiming the right to the same office. Mr. Smith was lawfully in once, and no
      man will or ever has disputed that fact, and if Colonel Robertson believes he is entitled to
      the office why has he not filed his contest under the laws and Constitution of Indiana?
      Because he has no confidence in his case, and when himself dragged into court by Smith, he has
      always stood upon then threshold of the court with a demurrer in his hand or plea to the
      jurisdiction. Now you propose because you can not have your own way about this matter to block
      legislation and do what was never done before in the history of Indiana. You are the
      revolutionists. From a partisan standpoint I might hope that you will stand by your refusal to
      communicate with the Senate. If my loyalty to the interest of the State was not above every
      partisan consideration I would thank God if you would stand by this refusal. We would make it
      interesting for you, I can assure you.
     Will you dare to refuse to make provisions for an empty treasury? Will you dare to let all
      these measures fail? Will you dare to let the feeble minded children of the State and the
      inmates of the Insane Asylums go unprovided for? Will you dare to face the people on issue?
      Even now the needs of the hour are for action. "Standing amidst the ashes and ruins of
      their home the Soldiers' orphans turn to us with tearful eyes and implore that kindly
      parental care that every State in the Union owes these unfortunate children of the
      Republic."
     Mr. GRIFFITHS said it had been claimed that the Senate had the key to the situation. If that
      was so, it was a disgrace to the party that supported the Senate in its revolutionary action.
      It is now a question between the people and the revolutionists whether constitutional
      government will upheld or lawlessness should rule. The Republicans are not to be cowed by any
      threats that the Democratic Senators will not do this or that. They have planted their on this
      platform, there they will stay. This General Assembly is to be of no value until the Liutenant
      Governor is admitted to the office to which the people elected him. It has been said that the
      Republicans were inconsistent in their position in having unseated Meagher. There is no
      similarity between that case and this. Meagher had been elected in violation of the
      Constitution. He had qualified for an office the holding of which prohibited him from being
      legal candidate for the General Assembly. He was not entitled to a seat, but
      Lieutenant-Governor Robertson had a prima facie right to preside over the Senate. If any
      contest is to occur it must come from Smith, who has gone twice to the courts and been
      defeated, for the courts have no jurisdiction, either of the person of the Lieutenant-Governor
      or the subject-matter of the 
       controversy
       controvery
      .
     Mr. FOSTER: Did not Smith offer to waive the question of jurisdiction?
     Mr. GRIFFITHS: Lieutenant-Governor Robertson could waive nothing. The jurisdiction belonged
      solely to the General Assembly.
     Mr. FOSTER: Did not claimant refuse to wave the question of jurisdiction?
     Mr. GRIFFITHS: The claimant, as you call him, had no right to waive anything. As for Mr.
      Smith, he was only elected as a Senator from Jennings county, whereas Colonel Robert-son held a certificate of election in his pocket.
      Gentlemen of the other side, including his frequency from Floyd, [laughter] have placed up and
      down the aisles of this House denouncing the act and insulting the law. You have been told by
      the gentleman from Floyd [Mr. Jewett] why there has been three weeks of revolutionary
      proceedings. It was to defeat Benjamin Harrison, the leader in the last campaign, whose work
      reduced the usual majority of 750 for the gentleman from Floyd to 250. [He then reviewed the
      services of Senator Harrison in arousing the people against the gerrymander and the gross
      mismanagement of the benevolent institutions, which led to the Republican victory. Passing
      from this he rapped the Democrats roundly who had charged the Republicans with being supported
      by cut-throats and bruisers.] It was the Democratic Senators who were guarded by door-keepers
      selected for their pugulistic qualitites. He was going up Illinois street, the other night,
      and saw a Democratic Senator looking in at a window of a saloon, where hung a picture of John
      L. Sullivan. The Senator was admiring the picture, and, in the fullness of his delight,
      exclaimed: "That's the kind of man we want for door-keeper." [He extrolled the
      manly action of Lt.-Gov.-elect Robertson in allaying the passions of men the day he was
      ejected from the Senate.] Democrats were grieving over the loss of appropriations for the
      School for the Feeble minded. He did not blame them for their anxiety, for if there ever was a
      time when a school of that kind was needed by the party, it was now. From the Republicans had
      pursued an orderly, law-abiding and constitutional course, while that of the Democrats had
      been lawless, reckless, unconstitutional and unjustifiable. He had heard a great deal about
      the excellence of Democratic principles; but he was always reminded of the English tourist who
      had written in a room of a Swiss inn: "You will find excellent meat, bread and wine here,
      providing you bring them with you." So with the Democratic party; you can always find
      excellent principles, justice, right and orderliness there, provided you bring them with
      you.
     Mr. BEASLEY wanted to know how this resolution or concurrent one could reach the Senate.
     Mr. GRIFFITHS: There will no trouble about that, after Green Smith steps down and out.
     Mr. PLEASANTS said that the people of his party were not in sympathy with the resolution of
      the gentleman from Dearborn. It was a cheap advertisement of the situation.
     Mr. SCOTT demanded the previous question.
     The demand was seconded by the House, and under its operations the preamble and resolution
      were adopted by yeas 57, nays 41.
     Pending the roll call--
     Mr. GORDON declared that the Democratic party and Democratic Senate were absolutely right on
      this question. He was willing to go before the people of the State of Indiana on an aggressive
      statement of the facts in the case. He voted "no."
     Mr. HARRELL explaining, said he was opposed to the resolution because it eminated from the
      Republicans, and it would not settle the question whether or not Colonel Robertson was elected
      President of the Senate of Indiana, and because four Supreme Judges had declared that there
      was no election.
     Mr. LINCK when his name was called thought this resolution expressed the facts in the case
      and voted "aye."
     Mr. NIBLACK, when called upon to vote, said: I don't believe a concurrent resolution
      would give Colonel Robertson even a prima facie right to occupy the chair as presiding officer
      of the Senate, and as it would give him no right, and as he had no right under the laws or the
      Constitution of the State of Indiana, either at the time of the organization of the Senate, or
      since that time, I see no good to come from this proposition. I am further of opinion that the
      Senate in its organization and in the continuance of that body, been a lawful  body in every respect. Gentlemen on the other side are going to
      commit one of the grandest of the many blunders they have made, in voting for a proposition I
      don't believe would be sustained by any legal tribunal in this State or any other State.
      Mr. Speaker I vote "no."
     Mr. PARKER believed the organization of this Senate was a lawful organization. When the
      Meagher case was up the Republicans had voted that Mr. Meagher was unconstitutionally
      ineligible. For the same reason he had voted that Colonel Robertson had no right to the office
      of Lieutenant-Governor, he voted "no."
     Mr. SHAMBAUGH [explaining]: For the reason that the statements made in the resolution are
      not only false in fact but false in other respects, I vote against it, and because I believe
      the party in this State which I have the honor to represent, is more than satisfied with the
      position the Democratic party has taken in this House; and because I believe this resolution
      was put in here more for the purpose of buncombe than anything else; therefore, Mr. Speaker, I
      vote "no."
     Mr. STUBBLEFIELD: I vote for this resolution, because it expresses my views on this matter.
      I hope this resolution will be kept before the people. I think it ought to be made a matter of
      record. You may call it political clap-trap or just what you please, it is something that
      ought to be placed upon record, and handed down to the rising generations to look upon as the
      most disgraceful act of the Democratic party since 1862. I vote "aye." We have been
      trampled on for 50 days. Legislation has been retarded while the people of the State have been
      demanding that there should be a re-organization of the the Senate, and the legislature
      accomplish the necessary legislation. They talk about stopping the wheels of legislation! and
      leaving the State in such a deplorable condition! I am sorry for it, but the Democratic party
      to-day is responsible for all this deviltry. If the 
       Democsotic
       Democratic
       party had not set the constitution and laws at defiance at the opening of this
      session by standing up in the face of Governor Robertson and wagging their cowardly heads at
      him, when he was declared the legally elected Lieutenant-Governor, I would have some little
      confidence in their pretense to honesty. If they had let Lieutenant-Governor Robertson take
      his seat necessary legislation would have been accomplished. Now they pretend, as they always
      do, and, like the devil at the beginning of this world, turn the truth into a lie, and
      undertake to shove the responsibility upon the Republican party. I vote "aye."
     Mr. SUNMAN had listened to the reading of the resolution, and thought that the gentleman
      from Dearborn had only offered the resolution for Colonel Robertson, and as he was not a
      member of the party, he voted "no"
     Mr. VAN SLYKE voted as he did for the reason that the preamble and resolution recited the
      facts in the case. He voted "aye."
     Mr. WEYAND, when his name was called, said that he thought the preamble and resolution were
      offered for buncombe, and as they would not change the situation in the Senate, he voted
      "no."
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the preamble and resolution were adopted.

    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    IN SENATE.
    
     WEDNESDAY, March 2, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Hon. J. H. C. Smith, a Senator from the counties of
     Wells and Huntington.
    Mr. BAILEY introduced a bill [S. 339] for an act to make ground-hog day a public holiday in
     honor of the election of Hon. David Turpie as United States Senator on February 2, 1887, and
     declaring an emergency. [Laughter.]
    
     APPROPRIATION BILLS.
     On motion by Mr. BAILEY, his bill [S. 335] to make appropriations for the maintenance of the
      State government for the year ending October 31, 1888, was the third time.
     Mr. DUNCAN, of Brown: I would like to have that part of the bill making appropriations to
      the State University referred to a special committee. There is some doubt about its
      construction. When general appropriation bills are passed it has been a rule that this
      institution shall have an annual appropriation of $23,000.--[It was so ordered, and he
      subsequently reported that there be appropriated $23,000 annually.]
     The report was concurred in, and the bill, as amended, passed by yeas 27, nays 1; refusing
      to vote 12.
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. FOWLER, when he voted, said: I was not present when this bill was read the second time,
      or I would have offered some amendments. I think Item 8 ought to come out of this bill. I
      regard that as a more than useless waste of the people's money.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: What is it?
     Mr. FOWLER: It is with reference to the Bureau of Statistics. And there is another item that
      ought to come out, which is also a useless expenditure of money; and that is with reference to
      the Fish Commission. It is doing no good in Indiana, and never will do any good in my
      judgment. I wish to place myself right on the record. With this explanation I vote
      "aye."
     Mr. URMSTON, when his name was called, said: Of all the bills that come before us this is
      one of the most important. This bill always comes from the House. After being considered there
      item by item, it is then considered here item by item, so that every member can know for
      himself whether or not every amount is right and proper. For an unsophisticated member,
      inexperienced in matters of legislation, to come here and consider such a bill, and properly
      digest it in  every particular, would be as much as could
      be expected; yet we take up this bill which was introduced Monday, and pass it in a few
      minutes. I feel in my conscience that I cannot vote for a bill without knowing what is in it.
      I must vote "no."
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: [After announcing the vote as above.] Will the Senate excuse the
      Senators present and not voting?
     Mr. FOWLER: I move they be not excused.
     This motion was agreed to.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The bill is passed. Read the title. The Secretary will see that
      this bill is engrossed and taken to the House of Representatives at once. If you can't
      get in there pin it on the door. [Laughter.]
     Mr. BARRETT called up the bill [S. 337] to make appropriations for the maintenance of the
      State government for the fiscal year ending October 31, 1887, which was read the third
      time.
     Mr. WEIR, in calling attention to certain provisions, said: It is a sort of legislation that
      hardly commends itself to those who desire the interests of the State protected.
     Mr. FOWLER: I am completely at a loss about this bill. I didn't know it was introduced.
      I would like the author to tell us something about it, if he knows anything about it. If he
      doesn't I would like it referred to a committee to find out something about it. As stated
      by the Senator from Laporte (Mr. Weir) here are double appropriations that cerainly need some
      explanation. I move to refer this bill to a committee of five Senators.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The motion is to refer with instructions to report it back at
      once. [After the vote.] The chair is going to appoint this committee now.
     Mr. FOWLER: I suggest the chairman of the Committee on Finance (Mr.
      French) be chairman.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Senators French, Fowler, Weir, Barrett and Schloss will be that
      committee.
    
    
     SINE DIE ADJOURNMENT.
     Mr. SMITH, of Wells, offered the following:
     
      
       
        Whereas, The Democratic Senators of the Fifty-fifth General Assembly of the State of
         Indiana, have done all in their power to pass the necessary loan and appropriation bills,
         together with other needed legislation; and,
        Whereas, The Republican members of the House of Representatives have passed a resolution
         locking the doors of the House on the Senate so far as to completely block all further
         legislation; and,
        Whereas, The Republican party, by their Representatives in the lower branch of the
         present General Assembly, have declared they will not have any further business relations
         with the Senate; therefore, be it
        Resolved, That the SEnate do now adjourn sine die
       
      
     
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The resolution will be referred to the Committee on the
       Judiciary.
     Mr. WEIR: I ask for the reading of the resolution.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: I don't think the Senate can adjourn sine die. I would be
      very willing to vote to adjourn sie die, but I don't believe the Senate can do it.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     APPROPRIATION BILLS.
     Mr. FRENCH, from the special committee thereon, returned the bill S. 337 without
      recommendation.
     Mr. WEIR: These bills are here without reference to the Committee on
       Finance. The fact that it was discovered just as the appropriation bill was being
      passed this morning that it would have given to the State University a double appropriation,
      it seems to me should induce the members of the Senate to wait and consider such matters more
      carefully.--Heretofore these bills have been considered in Committee of the
       Whold. [He pointed out objections to the bill.]
     Mr. FRENCH: As chairman of the Committee on Finance I do not feel like
      having the responsibility of these bills thrust upon me. If the Senate wants to consider them
      any further it can go into a Committtee of the Whole and consider them, and
      thus save all the time they would be in the hands of the Finance Commit-  tee. I am not seeking to shirk my duty, and if these
      bills had been brought in at the proper time I should not object. But to fire this whole
      bundle of appropriation bills at the committee and leave the responsibility on us at this
      stage of the game, for one I don't propose to do it, and I think I voice the sentiments
      of the committee.
     Mr. FOWLER: I have made up my mind to make a motion to go into a Committee of the
       Whole. I think that will address itself to the judgment of every Senator. There are
      certainly things in this second bill that ought to come out, and I hope the motion will
      prevail to go into a Committee of the Whole on the two bills together.
     Mr. BAILEY: What is there in the bill passed this morning that ought to be changed?
     Mr. FOWLER: I confess I have not had time to consider. I do not know ithat there is, but if
      there is anything that ought to come out we can take it out.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Why not go into Commitee of the Whole on this
      bill?
     Mr. FOWLER: I have no objection.
     Mr. FRENCH: I beg leave to return the bill to the files first.
     The motion was agreed to, and thereupon the Senate resolved itself into a Committee
       of the Whole [Mr. Tharp in the chair] and proceeded to the consideration of the
      bill S. 337. After some time spent therein the committee rose, reported sundry amendments:
      among them one by Mr. URMSTON to increase the sum for buildings at the Deaf
      and Dumb Asylum from $10,000 to $20,000; another by Mr. ZIMMERMAN for
      enlarging the chapel at the Reformatory for boys $3,500.
     The report of the committee was concurred in, and the bill passed by yeas 28, nays 3;
      refusing to vote 8.
     Mr. FOWLER saying: This is the first time I have ever been called upon to vote upon an
      appropriation bill without understanding what is in it. I have never know since I have been a
      member of this Senate, so much confusion in passing appropriation bills. Feeling that we are
      making duplicate appropriations, I shall vote against this bill. I vote "no."
     On motion by Mr. SCHLOSS, Senators present and refusing to vote were not excused.
     Mr. BARRETT entered a motion to reconsider the vote by which the bill [S. 61] making
      appropriations for the new Insane Asylums, was passed.
    
    
     EXTRA PAY TO SECRETARIES.
     A majority of the special committee thereon, reported in favor of a resolution allowing the
      secretaries $450.00 each, for indexing the Journal of the Senate, etc.; a minority favoring
      $300.00.
     Mr. FOWLER made an ineffectual motion to substitute the minority for the majority
      report.
     The majority report was concurred in; and subsequently--
     On motion by Mr. WEIR, the resolution was adopted.
    
    
     SERVICE-PENSION LAW.
     Mr. MCDONALD offered a resolution declaring it as the sense of the Senate
      that Congress should pass a law pensioning every good and faithful soldier at a certain age,
      incapacitated from supporting himself, which was made a special order for Saturday at 10
      o'clock.
    
    
     VITAL STATISTICS.
     Mr. Rahm's bill [S. 213] to provide for collecting reports of births and marriages and
      deaths, was read the third time and passed by yeas 26, nays 1; present and not voting 9.
     On by Mr. FOWLER, Senators refusing to vote were not excused.
    
    
     BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
     The Committee on Finance returned the resolution [No. 87--see bottom of
      page 533 of this book] "with the recommendation that it be adopted."
     It was adopted by yeas 17, nays 10; refusing to vote 10.
     The Senate adjourned.
    
   
   
   
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
    
     WEDNESDAY, March 2, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Hon. SYLVESTER BERTRAM, a Representative from the county of Stark.
    
     BILLS FOR ACTS WERE INTRODUCED BY
     Mr. Pleak [H. R. 475] that the State officers shall constitute a commission to a appoint a
      person to take charge of the State-house.
     Mr. Oursler [H. R. 476] to legalize the acts of the trustees of the town of Carmel.
     Mr. CAVEN made an ineffectual motion that the House resolve itself into a Committee
       of the Whole for consideration of the appropriation bills.
     On motion by Mr. STULL, his bill [H. R. 65] for the destruction of thistles and ther noxious
      weeds, was taken up and passed by yeas 76, nays 6.
    
    
     THE HOUSE PROTEST.
     On motion by Mr. GRIFFITHS, the order of business was suspended by yeas 55, nays 37, to
      enable him to submit the following:
     Mr. GRIFFITHS offered the following memorial:
     TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE:--Your memorialists, members of the Senate and House of
      Representatives of the Fifty-fifth General Assembly of the State of Indiana, respectfully
      protest and remonstrate against the admission of David Turpie as a member of the Senate of the
      United States from the State of Indiana, for the term of six years, beginning on the 4th day
      of March, 1887, by virtue of an alleged election thereto by the General Assembly of the State
      of Indiana in joint Convention on Wednesday, the 2d day of February, 1887.* They show that such alleged election
      is invalid by reaon of the facts and occurrences hereinafter set out.
     The Constitution of the State of Indiana provides that the Lieutenant Governor shall, by
      virtue of his office, be President of the Senate. Revised Statutes, 1881, sec. 147.
     It further provides that the Senate shall consist of fifty members, who are divided into two
      equal clases, one class going out of office on the day succeeding the biennial election at
      which their successors are elected. Revised Statutes, 1881, secs. 88 and 89.
     It takes two-thirds of the entire membership to constitute a quorum to do business, Revised
      Statutes, 1881, sec. 107.
     Members-elect are not sworn into office until the General Assembly meets, which is on the
      Thursday succeeding the first Monday in January succeeding the biennial election, and from the
      time of the election until this time there is no quorum of the Senate in existence, unless in
      the meantime a special session has been called and the members-elect sworn into office.
     The Senate has power to elect a President pro tempore whenever the Lieutenant Governor shall
      act as Governor, or shall be unable to attend as President of the Senate. Revised Statutes,
      1881 sec. 137.
     At the general election held in November, 1884, one Mahlon D. Manson was elected Lieutenant
      Governor for the term of four years, commencing on the second Monday of January, 1885.
     He presided over the Senate of the Fifty-fourth General Assembly, and was so presiding and
      in the actual occupancy of the chair on the 13th day of April, 1885, when the Senate attempted
      to elect Alonzo G. Smith, Senator from the counties of Jennings and Jackson, President
      pro-tempore.
     On the -- day of July, 1886, he was appointed by the President of the United States
      Collector of Internal Revenue for the Seventh District of Indiana, and accepted the office.
      This had the effect to vacate the office of Lieutenant Governor. Thereupon the Governor of the
      State of Indiana requested of the Attorney General an opinion as to whether the vacancy should
      be filled at the general election to be held on the second day of November, 1888.
     The Attorney General delivered an opinion that a vacancy having ocourred in the office, the
      same should be filled at the next general election.
     The Democratic State Convention, which was held on the--day of August, 1886, was the first
      to be held after this opinion was delivered. It proceeded at once to nominate a candidate for
      Lieutenant Governor. Among the persons placed in nomination for the office was Alonzo G.
      Smith, who had been elected President pro tempore of the Senate at its last session. He was
      present in the convention, arose in his place, and declined the nomination in a speech in
      which he pledged the support of his county to the candidate who should be selected. Judge John
      C. Nelson, of Logansport, was selected as the candidate. The Republican State Convention,
      which met on 4th day of September, 1886, selected as its candidate for said office Col. Robert
      S. Robertson, of Ft. Wayne. The Prohibition, Greenback and Labor parties also nominated
      candidates for said office. During the canvass preceding the election, no question was
      publicly made by any one that there was no vacancy in the office, or that the vacancy was one
      not proper to be filled by election. At the election the votes of the electors for said office
      were received at every precinct in the State, and such votes to the aggregate of 474,354 were
      counted and returned by the Election Boards throughout the State. The Canvassing Boards in
      each county of the State canvassed and certified such votes at the time and in the manner
      required by law, and returned their certificates to the office of the various Circuit Court
      Clerks, and such Clerks, at the time 
       * See this book pages 297-301.
       and in the manner required by law, returned to the
      Secretary of State a certificate showing the number of votes received by each candidate for
      said office in each county of the State, and also delivered to the Senator or member of the
      House of Representatives of each county a like certificate to be by him delivered to the
      Speaker of the House of Representatives, as required by law. The result of the said election
      was that Robert S. Robertson, the Republican candidate, was elected. The result of the general
      election held in said State, on the 2d day of November, 1886, for members of the General
      Assembly, was such that upon the face of the returns the Democratic party had elected
      seventy-six members of the senate and House of Representatives, including the Senators holding
      over, and the Republican party had elected seventy-four members, including the Senators
      holding over. The Senate, consisting of fifty members, had a Democratic majority of twelve,
      while the House of Representatives, composed of one hundred members, had a republican majority
      of ten, the Democratic majority on joint ballot on the face of the returns being two; but
      among the Democratic members returned as having been elected to the House, was one Cornelius
      Meagher, whose election was immediately contested by his opponent, one Henry C. Dickerson,
      upon the ground that Meagher at and before the election was holding the office of Justice of
      the Peace, and was, therefore, ineligible to the office of Representatives, and that said
      Dickerson was really the person so elected thereto.
     The Constitution of the State of Indiana provides that no person elected to any judicial
      office shall, during the period for which he shall have been elected, be eligible to any
      office of trust or profit under the State, other than a judicial office.
     Revised Statutes, 1881, section 176.
     It had been repeatedly decided by the Supreme Court that this provision applied to Justices
      of the Peace, and that the ineligibility resulting from the holding of a judicial or other
      public office was one which the voters are held to know, or are legally bound to know, and
      therefore the casting of the majority of the votes for a person ineligible for that reason,
      not only did not result in the election of such person, but that all votes cast for him were
      to be regarded as void, and the person receiving the next highest number of votes would be
      elected.

     The facts were equally clear, Meagher had been elected a Justice of the Peace at the April
      election, 1886, to succeed one Joseph Steinmehl. He accepted the election, and on the--day of
      May, 1886, having been duly commissioned by the Governor of the State, he qualified by giving
      bond and taking the oath office as required by law
     The term of office of his predecessor expired on the 29th day or October, 1886, and on that
      day Meagher's term, which was four years began.
     It was apparent that this contest must result in the unseating of Meagher and the seating of
      Dickerson, who was Republican, and that the election which had apparently resulted in a
      Democratic majority of two on joint ballot, had in reality resulted in a tie, without
      reference to other contests which were commenced against Democratic Representatives elect.
     Upon this result of the election becoming apparent, a conspiracy was entered into for the
      purpose of preventing the apparent Democratic majority two on joint ballot, in the General
      Assembly being changed by the unseating of Mr. Meagher and the seating of his opponent, and to
      secure the election of a Democrat to the Senate of the United States for term beginning on the
      fourth day of March, 1887, and in pursuance of conspiracy the following acts were committed,
      by means of which the alleged election of David Turpie was brought about. It was at once
      publicly announced that the Democratic majority of two on joint ballot must be maintained, and
      that if Democratic members of the house were unseated, Republican Senators elect be unseated.
      Contests were procured to be entered against Wm. N. McDonald, Archibald M. Kennedy, Benjamin
      F. Harness, Jasper M. Dresser, A. R. Schroyer and Simon P. Thompson, Republican Senators
      elect, with a view to unseating a Republican Senator and seating his competitor, in
      retaliation for the unseating of Meagher or any other Democratic Representative. It was
      further determined to prevent Lieutenant Governor Robertson from acting as President of the
      Senate by virtue of his office, or from presiding over the joint Convention for the election
      of a United States Senator.
     To this end it was publicly asserted that the vacancy which had occurred in the office of
      Lieutenant Governor was not one which could be filled by election of the people, but that
      under the constitution the President pro tempore of the Senate, Alonzo G. Smith, succeeded to
      the office of Lieutenant Governor, and, therefore the election of Col. Robertson was of no
      validity, and should be disregarded.
     The constitution and laws of the State provide, that the returns of every election for
      Lieutenant Governor shall be transmitted by the Secretary of State, and the members of the
      Senate and House of Representatives, to whom they have been entrusted by the clerks of the
      Circuit Courts in the various counties, to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, who
      shall open and publish them in the presence of both houses of the General Assembly; that the
      person having the highest number of votes for Lieutenant Governor shall be elcted; that if two
      or more persons have an equal and the highest number of votes for such office, the General Asssembly shall, by joint vote, forthwith
      proceed to elect one of such persons Lieutenant Governor; that contested elections for
      Lieutenant Governor shall be determined by the General Assembly in such manner as may be
      prescribed by law, and the manner of determining such contests prescribed by law is, that any
      elector may, within twenty days after the first day of the next session of the General
      Assembly after the election, deliver to the presiding officer of the House of Representatives
      specifications of the grounds of his contest, verified by his affadavit. The presiding officer
      thereupon notifies the person whose election is contested, and also notifies both houses of
      the General Assembly that specifications of the ground of contest have been received.
     Each house then chooses, by a viva voce vote, seven of its members, and these members
      constitute a committee to try and determine such contested election. They report their
      judgment to both 
       branches
       brances
       of the General Assembly. The report is entered on the journals of the respective
      houses, and their judgment is conclusive. If the election is adjudged to be invalid, the
      office is deemed to be vacant.
     Revised Statutes, 1881, Sections 130, 131, 132, 4729, 4744, 4745, 4756.
     The time for opening and publishing the votes for Lieutenant Governor by the Speaker of the
      House of Representatives as prescribed by statute, is on or 
       before
       befero
       the Monday succeeding the meeting of the General Assembly. The Lieutenant Governor,
      upon being declared elected, takes the oath of office in the presence of both houses of the
      General Assembly in joint convention, and this oath is required to be entered on the journals
      of each house.
     Revised Statutes, 1881, Sections 135, 552.
     No contest of the election of Col. Robertson was ever commenced, either by said Smith or any
      other elector of the State, but on the 1st day of December, 1886, said Smith began an action
      in the Circuit Court of Marion County, Indiana, against Wm. R. Myers, Secretary of State, to
      enjoin said Myers from delivering to the Speaker of the House of Representatives the returns
      of the election for Lieutenant Governor, which had been deposited in his office by the Clerks
      of the Circuit Courts of the various counties of the State, and which it was his duty, under
      the law, to transmit to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and to be by him opened
      and published in the presence of both houses of the General Assembly in joint convention
      assembled. It was alleged, in the complaint, that said Smith had been elected President pro
      tempore of the Senate, on the 13th day of April, 1885, and, as such, was entitled to preside
      over the Senate of the Fifty-Fifth General Assembly; that no vacancy existed in the office of
      the Lieutenant Governor which could have been filled at the general election held on the 2d
      day of November, 1886; that the votes cast at said election for said office were invalid and
      could not have been legally received or counted or certified to said Secretary of State; that
      the Secretary of State, unless prevented, would transmit said returns to the Speaker of the
      House of Representatives, who would open and publish the same, and declare the result thereof
      as to the election of the Lieutenant Governor, and thereby a cloud would be cast upon said
      Smith's title and right to preside over the Senate of the Fifty-Fifth General Assembly,
      and he would be hindered and embarrassed in the discharge of his duties as presiding officer
      in said Senate.
     David Turpie was one of the plaintiff's attorneys of record in this cause.
     The Secretary of STate demurred to this complaint, and on the 13th day of December, 1886,
      the demurrer was sustained. The plaintiff elected to stand by his demurrer. Final judgment was
      rendered against him thereon, and he appealed to the Supreme Court of the State, where, on the
      4th day of January, 1887, the judgment was affirmed.
     The General Assembly met on the 6th day of January, 1887. The Statute provides that "in
      the absence of the Lieutenant Governor it shall be the duty of the Auditor of State to preside
      in the organization of the Senate; and, in the absence of both the Lieutenant Governor and the
      Auditor of State, it shall be the duty of one of the judges of the Supreme Court to preside at
      the organization of the Senate." (Revised Statutes of 1881, section 4961.)
     When the hour for the organization of the Senate arrived, Alonzo G. Smith, Senator from the
      counties of Jennings and Jackson, took possession of the President's desk and gavel and
      assumed to call the Senate to order. He had no color of authority for so doing, except his
      pretended election as President pro tempore of the Senate of the Fifty-fourth General
      Assembly. This could give him no right to act as President pro tempore of the Senate of the
      Fifty-fifth General Assembly, because the Senate of the State of Indiana is not a continuing
      body, and all of its officers go out of office on the day succeeding the next general
      election, at which time the terms of one-half the members of the Senate expire, and it ceases
      to exist for want of a quorum. Moreover, the pretended election of the said Smith as President
      pro tempore of the Senate of the Fifty-fourth General Assembly was invalid because, at the
      time, the Lieutenant Governor was not acting as Governor, or unable to attend as President of
      the Senate, but was, in fact, actually in attendance and presiding over the Senate as its
       President.*
     Immediately upon said Smith assuming to act as President of the Senate, a Republican Senator
      holding over arose in his place and objected that such assumption on the part of said Smith
      was a usurpation of authority and a violation of the rights and privileges of the Senate, and
      de- 
       * See Vol. 23 Brevier Legislative Reports page
       175.
       manded that he should desist there from; that the Senate
      should be organized by the Auditor of State, who was then present.* But the said Smith rapped with the gavel, and in loud
      voice decared the Senator to be out order, and required him to take his seat. Other Republican
      Senators arose and objected to the proceedings of said Smith, and attempted to address the
      Senate in objection thereto. But the said Smith, by continually rapping with the gavel and in
      a loud voice declaring them to be out of order and ordering them to take their seats,
      prevented them from being heard, and refused to allow any action to be taken by the Senate,
      except such as he directed. He directed the roll of holding-over Senators to be called, and
      also the roll of the Senators newly elected to be called, and had the oath of office
      administered to the Senators-elect. He then directed that the Senate should proceed to elect a
      Secretary, Assistant Secretary and Principal Doorkeeper. A Republican Senator at this stage
      again arose and demanded that the organization of the Senate proceed according to law under
      the direction of the Auditor of State, and that the first officer elected, the Lieutenant
      Governor not being present, should be the President pro tempore.† Said Smith declared the Senator out of order, refused
      to entertain any motion or put any question to the Senate for the election of a President pro
      tempore, rapped continuously with his gavel, and in a loud, insolent and overbearing tone
      ordered and required the Senators to take his seat and keep it. Other Senators who attempted
      to make the same demand were treated in the same manner.
     He then directed the Senators to proceed to the election of a Secretary, Assistant Secretary
      and Principal Doorkeeper, and such an election was had, the Republican Senators declining to
      vote. After this a Democratic Senator introduced a preamble and resolution, which had been
      previously prepared, reciting that Lieutenant Governor Manson had accepted the office of
      Collector of Internal Revenue, and that by reason thereof the office of Lieutenant Governor
      was vacant; that Alonzo G. SMith had been elected, on the 13th day of April, 1885, President
      of the Senate, and therefore resolving that said Alonzo G. Smith was "recognized and
      elected as President of the Senate of Indiana."† When the resolution was offered said Smith was occupying the chair. He
      called to the chair Mr. Sellers, Senator from White County, and said resolution was then
      adopted under operation of the previous question, a division of the question, so that a vote
      might be taken upon the resolution distinct from the preamble being demanded and refused.
      Immediately thereafter another Democratic Senator offered a resolution embodying a code of
      rules for the government of the Senate, and this resolution and the rules referred to therein
      were at 
       * See this book pages 17-18.
      
       † See this book page 19. once adopted under
      the operation of the previous question, said Smith being in the chair, and refusing a division
      of the question demanded by Republican Senators. A copy of the resolutions thus adopted is
      filed herewith, marked "Exhibit A."*
     By the second of said rules, which provides that twenty-one Senators with the President, or
      twenty-two in his absence, having chosen a President pro tempore, shall be authorized to call
      the Senate, compel the attendance of absent Senators, make an order for their fine or censure,
      and may adjourn, [page 21 this book.] it was attempted to be provided that in case Lieutenant
      Governor Robertson should at any time obtain possession of the chair as presiding officer of
      the Senate, he and the Republican Senators, nineteen in number, should have no power to compel
      the attendance of absent Senators, and thereby enable the Democratic majority to absent
      themselves from the Senate with impunity. This rule is in violation of the Constitution, which
      gives any smaller number than a quorum of Senators the power to meet, adjourn from day to day,
      and compel the attendance of absent members. Revised Statutes of 1881, sec. 107.
     The fifteenth rule provides that when two or more Senators happen to arise at once, the
      President shall name which speak first, subject, however, to the right of appeal by either of
      said Senators, and if the President shall fail or refuse to entertain such appeal, the same
      shall be pending before the Senate, and upon demand of two Senators the Secretary shall call
      the roll, announce the result and record the same, and such appeal shall be decided without
       debate.†
     The third and tenth rules also provide that if the President shall fail to promptly put all
      questions to a vote, the same shall be deemed as pending and the Secretary shall, immediately
      upon the demand of two Senators, call the roll and record vote on the pending question, and at
      the conclusion of the vote announce the result. The ninth, tenth, and twenty-fourth rules
      provide that the Committee on Elections, whose duty it was to report upon
      the certificates and other credentials of the Senators returned to serve in the Senate, and
      take into consideration all petitions, documents and evidence relating to elections which be
      referred to them by the Senate, should be a committee of the highest privilege; that it should
      have leave to report at any time on the right of any member to his seat by presenting its
      report to the Senate or by filing the same with the Secretary thereof; that the report should
      be a question of the highest privilege and might be called up at any time by the chairman of
      the committee or any member thereof; that when so called up it should be pending before the
      Senate, and the chairman of the committee should be entitled to hold the floor and address
       
       * See pages 21-25 of this book.
      
       † See this book page 22.
       the Senate for one hour, unless the previous question
      should be sooner ordered. The previous question, when ordered, should have the effect to cut
      off all debate and bring the Senate to a vote upon all questions pending in such contest, and
      no motion to take a recess, to adjourn, or to fix a day to which the Senate shall adjourn,
      should be in order until such contest should have been determined by the Senate. In case any
      contest should be determined under the operation of the previous question no motion shall be
      made except the motion to reconsider any vote so taken, and the previous question shall at
      once attach to such motion to reconsider upon the table.*
     The purpose of these rules could only be to throttle the minority and hamper the Lieutenant
      Governor, if he should obtain possession of his office, and to enable the majority to unseat
      Republican Senators whenever they should determine to do so, without the minority having any
      opportunity to be heard thereon, or to secure even delay. On the second day of the session,
      being Friday, January 7, 1887, the House of Representatives adopted a resolution reciting that
      the Speaker had announced that on Monday, the 10th day of January, 1887, he would, in
      discharge of the duty imposed upon him by the Constitution, proceed to open and publish in the
      presence of both Houses of the General Assembly in joint convention the returns of the
      election for Lieutenant Governor, and therefore resolving that the Senate be invited to meet
      the House in joint convention at that time to witness the opening and publishing of the
       vote.† Upon this resolution being
      adopted in the House, and before the same could be officially communicated to the Senate, a
      Democratic Senator offered a resolution that when the Senate adjourned it adjourn to meet on
      Tuesday, the 11th day of January, 1887, and demanded the previous question upon the adoption
      of the resolution.
     Before the vote was taken, upon seconding the demand for the previous question, the Clerk of
      the House, with the message from the House announcing the adoption of the resolution inviting
      the Senate to meet in joint convention, came into the Senate Chamber. A Republican Senator
      arose in his chair and notified the occupant of the chair, said Smith, that the Clerk of the
      House was waiting to deliver a message. The presiding officer of the Senate, said Smith,
      refused to allow the Clerk to deliver his message at that time, and put the question, upon
      seconding the demand for the previous question, and also the question as to whether the main
      question should be now put, but before the question had been put upon the adoption of the
      resolution fixing the time of adjournment, the Clerk of the House was recognized and delivered
      his message announcing the adoption by the House of the resolution 
       * See pages 22, 23 of this book.
      
       † See page 37 of this book. inviting the
      Senate to meet in joint convention, but notwithstanding this the resolution was adopted that
      when the Senate adjourned it would adjourn until Tuesday, January 11, 1887. Immediately
      thereafter a Democratic Senator introduced a resolution reciting that under the constitution
      of the State of Indiana an election for Lieutenant Governor could only be held in the year
      1852, and every fourth year thereafter; that no valid election could have been held in the
      year 1886, and therefore resolving that the Senate declined the invitation of the House to
      meet in joint convention on the 10th day of January, 1887, to witness the opening and
      publishing of the votes cast for Lieutenant Governor at the general election held in 1886*. The resolution was adopted under
      the operation of the previous question, and thereupon the Senate adjourned.
     On the 10th day of January, 1887, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, in the
      presence of the members of the House of Representatives and nineteen Republican Senators who
      attended in a body, in joint convention assembled, proceeded to open and publish the votes
      cast at the general election of November, 1886, for Lieutenant Governor, and to announce the
      result thereof. It was found and declared that Robert S. Robertson had received 232,916 votes;
      John C. Nelson, 229,593 votes; Edward S. Pope, 3,016 votes; Jesse M. Gale, 8,828 votes, and
      Evils, 1 vote, and that Robert S. Robertson having received the highest number of votes, was
      duly elected to said office. Said Robertson thereupon came fowrward, and in the presence of
      the joint convention took the oath of office, which was administered to him by Lewis C.
      Walker, a Judge of the Superior Court of Marion County, and entered upon the Journal of the
      House of Representatives. He attempted to address the joint convention, whereupon all of the
      Democratic members of the House of Representatives, with but few exceptions, arose to their
      feet and clamored and shouted as loudly as they could during all the time he was speaking,
      completely drowning his voice and preventing him from being heard, He concluded by declaring
      the joint convention adjourned until Wednesday, the 19th day of January, 1887, when it would
      meet in the hall of the House of Representatives to proceed to vote for United States Senator,
      as prescribed by the act of Congress in relation thereto.†
     On Tuesday morning, January 11, 1887, when the Senate met, a Republican Senator offered a
      preamble and resolution wherein it was recited that the Speaker of the House of
      Representatives on the day previous had opened and published the returns of the votes cast for
      Lieutenant Governor at the November election in 1886, and setting out the results thereof, as
      hereinbefore stated, and further reciting that Robert S. Robertson had been declared by said
      Speaker to have received 
       * See page 33 of this book.
      
       † See this book pages 38-39.
       the highest number of votes cast for the office of
      Lieutenant Governor, had been elected thereto; that thereupon said Robertson had taken the
      oath of office required by law, and setting out a copy of said oath, and resolving that the
      proceedings attending the opening and publishing of said vote and declaring the resuult
      thereof, and as to the oath of said Robertson, as therein recited, should be entered upon the
      Journal of the Senate, as required by law. [See pages 44 and 45 of this book.]
     This resolution was at once, by said Smith, who was occupying the chair as presiding officer
      officer of the Senate, declared to be out of order, and refused to entertain the same or to
      put any question thereon to the Senate. Thereupon a Republican Senator offered a resolution
      that Robert S. Robertson, having been duly elected to the office of Lieutenant Governor of
      Indiana, and have taken the oath of office, should be invited to take the chair and preside
      over the Senate*. This resolution
      said Smith likewise declared to be out of ordor, and refused to allow any question thereon to
      be put to the Senate. Thereupon a Republican Senator presented a memorial and remonstrance
      from Lieutenant Governor Robertson, of which a copy marked Exhibit "B" is hereto
       attached.† Upon the said memorial
      being attempted to be read, a Democratic Senator moved that it be rejected without reading. It
      was finally allowed to be read for the information of the Senate. Thereupon it was rejected by
      the votes of the Democratic members of the Senate, the Republican members voting
      "No."
     During these proceedings Lieutenant Governor Robertson was present in the Senate Chamber,
      but the doors were strictly guarded, and no one but Democrats were allowed to enter.
      Republican Senators were not allowed to pass any one in.
     On Tuesday, the 11th day of January, 1887, the Committee on Elections and
      other committees of the Senate were appointed by said Smith. ‡
     On Wednesday, the 12th day of January, 1887, the Committee on Elections
      of the House of Representatives, who have been for some time before considering the contested
      election case of Dickerson vs. Meagher,‖ filed their report in the House, recommending the unseating of Meagher and the
      seating of Dickerson, and the same was set for hearing for Thursday afternoon, an hour and a
      half on either side being allowed for discussion. At that time the report was considered, and
      upon the law and the facts as in substance hereinbefore set out, the House voted that Meagher
      was not entitled to his seat, but that Dickerson was, and said Dickerson was thereupon
      admitted and sworn as a member.
     Immediately upon this being done, the presiding officer of the Senate, said Smith, delivered
      to the Committee on Elections

       the papers in the various contests which had been, as hereinbefore stated, procured to
      commence against Republican Senators elect, including therein the contest against William N.
      McDonald, Senator from the counties of Jackson and Lawrence, by Frank A. Branaman, his
      defeated opponent. The ground for this contest was that McDonald had used money for the
      purpose of improperly influencing the electors, and was based upon the following provision of
      the Constitution:
     "Every person shall be disqualified from holding office for the term for which he may
      have been elected who shall have given or offered a bribe, threat or reward to secure his
      election." Revised Statutes, 1881, section 87.
     Evidence had been taken by the contestor, as provided by law, in the shape of depositions,
      before the meeting of the General Assembly.
     The contestee had also taken 
       evidence
       evfdence
       to rebut the evidence of the contestor, and all this evidence had been filed with
      the Secretary of State before the meeting of the General Assembly, as required by law, and was
      delivered to the committee.
     The committee met to consider the case on Saturday, January 15, 1887, and the contestor then
      produced before them for oral examination a witness named Brunig, and offered to prove by him,
      as a ground for seating the contestor, that it was a matter of public rumor that McDonald was
      using money in the election.
     The contestee objected to any such evidence being received for the reasons that no notice
      had been given that any additional would be heard by the committee, an that such evidence was
      not competent to show notice to the electors of the ineligibility of McDonald, at the time he
      was voted for, as a ground for seating the contestor.
     The committee overruled the objections and heard the evidence, which was in substance that
      the witness had heard it rumored at Brownstown, in Jackson County, when the Commissioners were
      in session, that on the first Monday in September, 1886, that McDonald was using money in the
      election.
     The contestor, Branaman, then took the stand, and over the same objection, was permitted to,
      and did testify, in substance, that there was a common rumor that McDnoald was using money to
      secure his election, and that he himself, the contestor, had made numerous speeches during the 
       canvassing
       canvassjin
       the various townships of the Senatorial District, and had announced in each speech
      that McDonald was using money and had warned the electors against him.
     Upon this evidence being concluded, the contestee demanded that a subpena should issue to
      Jackson County for witnesses in his behalf to rebut the same. The committee issued the
      subpena, making it returnable on Monday morning, January 17, and refusing to grant any longer
      time. The contestee represented to the committee * See page 62 of this
       book.
      that it was impossible to procure its service unless the
      committee would send an officer of its own to serve it, for the reasons, which were true, that
      the witnesses to be subpenaed resided in Jackson Country, sixty miles south of Indianapolis;
      thatthe sheriff, to whom the subpena was addressed, resided at the county seat, Brownstown,
      which was eleven miles off the railroad from Indianapolis and upon another railroad, and that
      there was no intervening day except Sunday, which the sheriff, who was a Democrat, could avail
      himself of as an excuse for refusing to serve the subpena.
     The committee refused to send an officer to serve the subpena, or to grant any longer time.
      The contestee thereupon took the subpena, in person on Saturday afternoon, to Jackson County,
      procured the Sheriff to over from Brownstown to Seymour, the point on the railroad from
      Indianapolis where he was, tendered the subpena to him, and demanded that he should serve it;
      but he refused to do so because it would have to be served on Sunday. The contestee then
      procured some six or seven witnesses to come up to Indianapolis on Monday morning,
      voluntarily, without service of process. These witnesses were examined by the committee on the
      forenoon of Monday, January 17. They testified tht McDonald had not been nominated for Senator
      until late in the month of September, 1886; that they there had never been any common rumor or
      report that the contestee was using money to secure his election; that they had themselves
      been present at speeches made by the contestor, and in none of said speeches had he stated or
      announced that the contestee was using money or warned the electors against him on that
      account. The evidence upon said contest was closed about noon on Monday. The oommittee
      proceeded to hear argument on Monday afternoon, allowing but--minutes to each side. The
      testimony taken before the committee was not yet written out by the stenographer.
     Immediately upon the argument being closed, which was about 4 o'clock in the afternoon,
      the majority of the committee voted to adopt a lengthy report, in which they set out what was
      claimed to be the substance of the evidence in behalf of the contestor, but which entirely
      omitted any evidence on behalf of the contestee, including that which had just been heard by
      the committee. This report had been prepared in advance of the hearing of the testimony or any
      consideration of the case by the committee. It concluded with a resolution that McDonald
      should be unseated and Branaman seated in his stead. Upon this report being adopted by the
      majority of the committee, consisting of the Democratic members, the Regublican minority asked
      time until Tuesday, January 18, 1887, to prepare their minority report, stating that it could
      not be sooner done, on account of the evidence taken before the committee not having been
      written out by the stenographer. The committee granted them this time and thereupon
      adjourned.
     Immediately thereafter the chairman of the committee arose in the Senate and presented a
      majority report of the committee and moved the resolutions accompanying the same be adopted,
      and upon this motion demanded the previous question.* The Republican members of the committee at once announced that this was
      in violation of the agreement that they should have until the next morning to present a 
       minority
       minornority
       report. The Chairman of the committee did not deny that it had been agreed that the
      minority of the committee should have until then to prepare their report, but asserted that
      the majority did not agree not to present their report before then, but he did not say that
      any intimation had been given by them, a majority, that they would present their report before
      then. The demand for the previous question was seconded and the main question ordered to be
      put, and thereupon the resolutions were adopted by the Democratic 
       majority
       majorty
       over the protest of the Republican members, that the action was in violation of the
      understandings had with the minority of the committee, and that the majority report entirely
      suppressed all mention of the evidence for the contestee, and was untrue in its statement of
      the evidence for the contestor. Thereupon the contestor, Branaman, was sworn in as a Senator
      and given the seat before then occupied by McDonald.† The majority received by McDonald at the election was six hundred and
      ten, and there was no evidence whatever that any of this majority had been procured by the
      corrupt use of money.
     Your memorialists submit that this action in unseating McDonald and seating Branaman was the
      result of the conspiracy hereinbefore mentioned, entered into for the purpose of maintaining
      the alleged Democratic majority of two on joint ballot; that it was not justified by either
      the law or the evidence heard before the 
       committee
       comcommittee
      , and, as to the seating of Branaman, was directly opposed to the law as declared by
      the Supreme Court of this State, in the decisions hereinbefore cited, which permits the
      minority candidate at an election to take an office through a contest based upon the
      ineligibility of his opponent only where such ineligibility is either actually known or of
      such notorious and public character as to be presumed to be known by the electors. The refusal
      of sufficient time to the contestee to procure the attendance of witnesses; the preparation by
      the majority of their report in advance of the final hearing of the case by the committee; the
      violation of the agreement to allow the minority time to make a report; the haste with which
      the majority report was made to the Senate and the manner in which it was adopted, are only to
      be explained in consideration of the fact that upon the next day, Tuesday, Jan. 18, 1887, the
      act of Congress in reference to the election of Senators in the Congress of the United States
      required each House to vote sepa- * See pages 104, 105 of this book.
      † See this book page
       108.
       rately for candidates for United States Senator, and
      each day thereafter to meet in joint convention and vote until a Senator was elected. The
      entire proceedings were in retaliation for the action of the House in unseating Meagher, and
      taken for no other purpose than to restore the alleged Democratic majority of two on joint
      ballot. It was then openly announced by the chairman of the Election
       Committee that on Tuesday, the 18th day of January, 1877, the committee would meet
      and consider the contests against Kennedy and Thompson and, that the reports in such cases
      would ready to be presented to the Senate by Tuesday evening, in anticipation of any further
      unseating of Democratic members in the House.
     Prior to these proceedings, on Wednesday, January 12, 1887, the House of Representatives
      adopted a resolution, reciting, according to the fact, that it had always been the custom in
      the State of Indiana for the joint conventions of the two houses of the General Assembly for
      the election of United States Senators and other officers required to be elected in joint
      convention, to be held in the hall of the House of Representatives, and therefore resolving
      that the Senate be invited to meet the House in its hall on Wednesday, the 19th day of
      January, 1887, for the purpose of electing a Senator to the Congress of the United States. The
      resolution was communicated to the Senate, and thereupon the Senate adopted a resolution
      declining to meet the House in joint convention in the hall of the House and inviting the
      House to meet them in joint convention in the Senate Chamber.*
     This resolution was adopted in view of the fact that the Democratic majority in the Senate
      anticipated that the Lieutenant Governor Robertson would preside over the joint convention if
      it should be held in the hall of the House of Representatives, and for the purpose of
      preventing him from presiding over the joint convention, if it could be procured, to be held
      in the Senate Chamber. There is no instance in the history of the State in which a joint
      convention has been held in the Senate Chamber. They have always, as was truly stated in the
      resolution of the House, been held in the hall of the House of Representatives. In further
      pursuance of the conspiracy hereinbefore stated, and to prevent Lieutenant Governor Robertson
      from presiding over the joint convention, if it should be held in the hall of the House of
      Representatives, said Alonzo G. Smith, on the 12th day of January, 1887, began a suit in the
      same of the State of Indiana upon his relation by information in the nature of quo warranto
      against Lieutenant Governor Robertson in the Circuit Court of Marion County, Indiana. Inthis
      suit said Smith who therein was represented by said David Turpie and others as his counsel of
      record, stated that he, by virtue of his election on the 13th day of April, 1885, as President
      pro tempore of the Senate of the 
       * See page 44 of this book. fifty-fourth
      General Assembly, the subsequent vacation of the office of Lieutenant Governor by Mahlon D.
      Manson by acceptance of the office of Collector of Internal Revenue, and his recognition and
      election as President of the Senate of the State of Indiana on the 6th day of January, 1887,
      as hereinbefore stated the resolution hereinbefore set out, had become and was Lieutenant
      Governor of the State of Indiana, and was entitled to exercise the function of said office as
      President of the Senate; that Robert S. Robertson had been voted for for said office of
      Lieutenant Governor at the November election in 1886, and had been declared elected thereto by
      the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and was declaring and asserting that he was
      entitled to preside over the Senate and over the joint convention to be held for the election
      of a United States Senator, and unless prevented by the court from so doing by injunction he
      would preside over said joint convention. He asked that said Robertson be required to show by
      what authority he claimed to exercise the function of said office of Lieutenant Governor, and
      that he be enjoined and restained from presiding or attempting to preside over such joint
      convention for the election of a Senator.
     On the 13th day of January, 1887, said Robertson appeared and file a plea in abatement,
      under oath, stating that he was a resident of Allen County, in the State of Indiana, and that
      there were courts in said county competent to entertain jurisdicton of said cause. The relator
      demurred to this plea, and the Court sustained the demurrer, and thereupon proceeded to hear
      the cause upon the application for a temporary injunction to prevent said Robertson from
      presiding over the joint convention to be held on the 19th day of January, 1887, and on the
      17th day of January, 1887, granted an injunction forbidding said Robertson from presiding, or
      attemping to preside, over said joint convention. Said Robertson immediately appealed from
      this decision to the Supreme Court, and endeavored to have the cause advanced and heard before
      the meeting of the joint convention, but was unsuccessful in so doing. On the 18th day of
      January, 1887, each house of the General Assembly voted separately for candidates for United
      States Senator. In the Senate David Turpie received 32 votes, including Branaman, who had been
      seated in the place of McDonald, and Benjamin Harrison receiving 18 votes.* In the House David Turpie received
      43 votes, Benjamin Harrison, 53 votes; Jason H. Allen, 4 votes.† Having procured an injunction to prevent Robertson
      from presiding over the joint convention,the Democratic members of the Senate abandoned their
      resolution that the joint convention should be held in the Senate Chamber, and on Wednesday,
      January 19, 1887.the Senate came over and went into joint con- * See page 124 of this book.

       128.
      vention in the House of Representatives, an arrangement
      having been affected whereby the Speaker of the House of Representatives should preside over
      the joint convention, but that Smith, as President of the Senate, should direct the call of
      the Senate roll and announce the result of the vote.
     The result of the first vote in joint convention was as follows:
     *David Turpie received
      seventy-five votes, including therein the votes of Branaman as Senator from Jackson and
      Lawrence counties; Isaiah B. McDonald, as Senator from the counties of Allen and Whitley, and
      Alonzo G. Smith as Senator from the counties of Jennings and Jackson. Benjamin Harrison,
      seventy-one votes. Jason H. Allen received four votes.
     Upon the name of said Branaman being called, and before he had voted, a Republican Senator
      arose in the joint convention and protested against his vote being received and counted for
      the reason that Branaman was not a Senator in the General Assembly of the State of Indiana,
      not entitled to votes for United States Senator. † He further stated and announced that William N. McDonald, who was the
      lawfully elected and qualified Senator for the counties of Jackson and Lawrence and entitled
      to vote in joint convention demanding to be allowed to vote for United States Senator was then
      present in the joint convention demanding to be allowed to vote for United States Senator, and
      that he would vote for Benjamin Harrison. Said McDonald was, in fact, then present in the
      joint convention ready and willing to vote for said Harrison if permitted to do so. When the
      name of Isaiah B. McDonald, as Senator from the counties of Allen and Whitley, was called and
      before he had voted, a Republican Senator arose in the joint convention and protested against
      the vote of said McDonald being received or counted for Senator for the reason that said
      McDonald was not a Senator in the General Assembly of the State of Indiana, not entitled to
      vote for United States Senator .†
      The facts upon which said protest was made, and which your memorialists aver to be true, are
      these:
     At the general election for members of the General Assembly held in November, 1884, one Eli
      W. Brown was elected the Senator from the counties of Allen and Whitley, for a term of four
      years, commencing on the 5th day of November, 1884. He appeared at the meeting of the Senate
      for the Fifty-fourth General Assembly in January, 1885, and duly qualified as Senator from
      said counties and served throughout said session as such. On -- day of --, 1885, he was
      nominated by the President of the United States to the office of postmaster at Columbia City
      in Whitley County. He took possession of said office and continued to act as such postmaster
      until the adjournment of the first session of the Forty-ninth Congress, when, not having been
       *See page 141 of this
       book.
      See this book page 137. confirmed by the Senate of said
      Congress, he was again nominated by the President of the United States, to said office of
      postmaster at Columbia City, and has continued to act as such postmaster from then to the
      present time. His nomination has not been confirmed by the Senate of the United States. He
      never resigned the office of Senator for said counties of Allen and Whitley. No writ was
      issued by the Governor for an election to fill said office of Senator at the general election
      held on the 2d day of November, 1886, but at said election said McDonald, assuming said office
      to be vacant, became a candidate therefor, and received a majority of the votes cast and was
      returned as elected to said office for the unexpired term of said Brown, and when the General
      Assembly met on the 6th day of January, 1887, he presented himself as Senator-elect from said
      counties, and was sworn in and thereafter continued to act as such.
     When the name of Alonzo G. Smith was called and before he had voted, a Republican Senator
      arose in his place in the joint convention, and protested against his vote being received or
      counted for Senator, because he was not entitled to vote as a Senator in such election. *
     This protest was based upon the ground that said Smith having taken upon himself to act, and
      having acted during the session of the Senate as its President and claimed to have succeeded
      to the office of Lieutenant Governor, could not vote except in the Senate, and then only in
      case of a tie. Revised Statutes 1881, sec. 147.
     The votes of said Branaman, McDonald and Smith were recorded for said Turpie notwithstanding
      these protests.
     No candidate having received a majority of all the votes cast in the joint convention, the
      members of the Senate and House of Representatives again met in joint convention on the 20th
      day of January, 1887, and again voted for candidates for Senator, with the same result as on
      the previous day. The same protests were again entered against the votes of Branaman, McDonald
      and Smith, and upon the same grounds, and an agreement was then made in the joint convention
      that it should not be necessary to repeat these protests from day to day but that they should
      be regarded as being formally made upon each day upon which candidates for Senator were voted
      for until a decisive vote was had, and should be regarded as made upon said decisive vote.†
     The members of the Senate and House of Representatives continued to meet from day to day,
      Sundays excepted, in joint convention, and voted upon each day for candidates for United
      States Senator until Wednesday, the 2nd day of February, 1887.
     In the meantime the suit commenced by said Smith against Lieutenant-Governor Robertson had
      been brought to a hearing in the Supreme Court, and it had been argued and taken under
      advisement by the * See page
       137 of this book.

       152.
      Court, but the injunction of the Court below whereby said
      Robertson was forbidden to preside over the joint convention or exercise any of the functions
      of the office of Lieutenant-Governor continued in force, and was observed by him, and,
      although he was in daily attendance, he was not permitted to preside over the Senate or joint
      convention; said Smith during all said time presided over the Senate, and in the joint
      convention directed the call of the Senate roll and announced the result of the vote, the
      convention otherwise being presided over by the Speaker of the House of Representatives.
     On Wednesday, the 2nd day of February, 1887, a vote was taken, in joint convention with the
      following result:
     For David Turpie, including the votes of Branaman, Isaiah B. McDonald, Alonzo G. Smith, and
      one F. J. S. Robinson, a member of the House, who had theretofore constantly voted for Jason
      H. Allen, 76 votes. For Benjamin Harrison, 74 votes. *
     
     Before the result of this vote was announced the protests which had been before made against
      the votes of Branaman, Isaiah B. McDonald and Alonzo G. Smith were again formally announced
      and entered in the joint convention by a Republican Senator, and for the grounds hereinbefore
      stated said Smith announced the result of said vote that Turpie had received seventy-six votes
      and that Benjamin Harrison had received seventy-four votes. † The Speaker of the House who, under the arrangement
      which had been entered into at the time the first joint convention was held, was the presiding
      officer of the joint convention, declared and announced that no person had received a majority
      of the legal votes cast, and no person was elected. The convention thereupon adjourned.‡
     
     On the twenty-third day of February, 1887, the Supreme Court rendered its decision in the
      case of Alonzo G. Smith vs. Lieutenant Governor Robertson, wherein the injunction against said
      Robertson had been granted. It was held, the five Judges of the court concurring therein, that
      the courts below had erred in sustaining the demurrer to the plea in abatement filed by said
      Robertson, and that the court below had no jurisdiction of the person of said Robertson, and
      for that reason that the judgment granting an injunction should be in all things reversed, It
      was further held by three of the judges, constituting a majority of the Court, that under the
      Constitution and laws of the Stage of Indiana no court had any jurisdiction to try or
      determine any question affecting the title to the office of Lieutenant Governor, but that all
      contested elections for the office of Lieutenant Governor were to be determined solely by the
      General Assembly, and, therefore, neither the Court below, nor any other Court in the State,
      had jurisdiction of the subject matter of said Smith's action. Immediately upon 
       * See page 300 of this book. 
      
       See this book page 299.
      
      ‡ See page 304 of this
       book. this decision being made a certificate thereof was presented to said Smith, and
      he was asked whether he proposed to further prevent said Robertson from presiding over the
      Senate. He declared that he would continue to preside over the Senate until some Court had
      decided that he should not. The doorkeepers of the Senate were immediately directed by him to
      lock and guard they doors and prevent all persons from entering, and he at once caused the
      Senate to be adjourned for the day.*
     On February 24, 1887, the Republican Senators, upon presenting themselves at the door of the
      Senate, found them locked and guarded, and in many instances were only able to obtain
      admission after violent personal struggle. Said Robertson was refused admission at first, but
      was afterward permitted to enter, but all persons not known to be in the interest of said
      Smith, or vouched for by Democratic Senators, were rigidly excluded. Upon being admitted,
      Lieutenant Governor Robertson advanced to the President's desk, and attempted to ascend
      the rostrum, but was at once seized and hurled violently away by a Doorkeeper, who had been
      stationed there for the purpose by said Smith. He then attempted to address the Senate, and
      stated that he was there for the purpose of demanding his rights as Lieutenant Governor to
      preside over the Senate. A Democratic Senator moved that he be ejected from the Senate Chamber
      by the Doorkeeper. Said Smith, without putting the question to the Senate, and without any
      direction from the Senate so to do, directed the Doorkeepers to remove said Robertson from the
      Senate Chamber, and he was thereupon seized by the Doorkeepers and put out of the chamber with
       violence.† Said Smith still
      maintains himself in possession of the chair as presiding officer of the Senate, and supported
      by the Democratic majority of the Senate, he excludes, by means of the officers of the Senate,
      said Robertson from the floor of the Senate.
     Your memorialists further show that said Smith, upon repeated occasions during the sessions
      of Senate, has conducted himself toward the Republican minority in the most overbearing,
      insolent and offensive manner. He has ordered Senators to take their seats in a loud and
      violent tone, and threatened, if not instantly obeyed, to have the Doorkeeper force them into
      their seats and keep them there. He has threatened to have Republican Senators ejected from
      the Senate Chamber. Upon one occasion he stationed a doorkeeper near a Republican Senator with
      orders to remain and keep him in his seat. On another occasion the Doorkeeper, by his
      direction, seized a Republican Senator by the throat and forced him into his seat with such
      violence as to break the chair and cause the Senator to fall to the floor.
     The only provocation for this treatment * See page 499 of this book.
      * See this book pages 510,
       511.
      was that the Republican Senators at this time were
      protesting against his usurpation of the chair as presiding officer of the Senate and against
      his arbitrary and oppressive rulings, by which their rights as a minority were
      disregarded.
     Your memorialists submit that the organization of the Senate of the Fifty-fifth General
      Assembly of the State of Indiana in the manner hereinbefore set out was in violation of law
      and revolutionary; that it was entered into for the purpose of enabling the majority to unseat
      Republican Senators and seat instead their Democratic competitors, for the sole purpose of
      preserving the alleged Democratic majority of two on joint ballot, and thereby secure the
      election of said David Turpie to the Senate of the United States. They submit that in the
      execution of said design William N. McDonald, a Republican Senator, lawfully elected and
      entitled to his seat, and who would have voted for Benjamin Harrison for Senator, was deprived
      of his seat and prevented from so voting, and that Frank A. Branaman, who was not elected and
      not entitled to a seat as Senator, was given a seat instead of said McDonald and allowed to
      vote for said Turpie for Senator for the Congress of the United States.
     They further submit that neither Isaiah B. McDonald nor Alonzo G. Smith was entitled to vote
      at said election for Senator, and that their votes for said David Turpie should not be
      allowed. And your memorialists, resrving the right to submit any further facts bearing upon
      such alleged election of David Turpie to the Senate of the United States as may hereafter come
      to their knowledge, say and show that they are ready and willing to prove the facts
      hereinbefore stated at such time and in such manner as this Senate may deem proper.
     During the reading of the memorial--
     Mr. JEWETT [noticing that the Clerk was not reading consecutively] said: When an infamous
      libel and falsehood is going to be spread upon the records of this House I want it read in
      full.
     The SPEAKER: The gentleman is out of order. The Clerk will proceed with the reading.
     Mr. GRIFFITHS moved that the memorial be adopted, and that the Clerk of the House be
      instructed to certify a copy thereof and the action of the House thereon, to the Senate the of
      the United States. And on that motion he demanded the previous question.
     This demand was seconded, the main question ordered by yeas 54, nays 39; and the memorial

     Pending the roll call--
     Mr. BERTRAM: Believing that the memorial is false from the beginning to the end, I vote as I
      do. And I believe that the majority side of the House will vote the same way if they are as
      honest to-day as I was yesterday. There is not a man on the other side of the House who knows
      what is in that resolution. I vote "no." [Applause.]
     Mr. COX, of Miami, in explanation, said: I am constrained to vote as I do upon this
      question, with my party, in order to keep the truth, and in order to be consistent with my own
      feelings. Although I would not object to voting with the Republicans sometimes if they were
      not so outrageously inconsistent. I vote "no."
     Mr. FOSTER, when his name was called, said: I think the minority ought to be allowed a
      little indulgence in this regard because the majority has seen fit to skulk behind the
      previous question to-day. The reason probably is, that they were taught a lesson yesterday.
      They came into the lists yesterday, and to a horse we unmanned them fairly. [Applause.] I vote "no."
     Mr. GORDON [explaining]: I am prompted to this action by a feeling of benevolence toward the
      majority of this House. A good deal in this memorial is untrue, and what is true found on the
      records of this House. Therefore to try to save them from another one of their blunders I vote
      "no."
     Mr. IBACH, when called upon to vote, said: I vote as I do because I can look into the faces
      of fifty-six cowards in the House of Representatives. You are afraid of free discussion. I
      vote "no."
     Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Owen, [in explanation]: I am apposed to this memorial from the fact that
      I don't believe it recites the truth. And for another reason, that there is legislation
      that ought to be passed. I believe the people are demanding different legislation, therefore I
      vote "no."
     Mr. ROBERTS, when casting his vote, said: I have never doubted for a moment but that David
      Turpie was a United States Senator. I do not now, and never have believed that Mr. Smith was
      Lieutenant Governor of the State of Indiana. In revery regard, in all respects, I believe that
      the law was strictly complied with in the election of a United States Senator. I vote
      "no."
     Mr. STUBBLEFIELD: I vote for this resolution because I think it recites the facts. If I had
      no other reason I would vote for it because the gentleman from Huntington (Mr. Ibach) said we
      were a pack of cowards. I vote "aye."
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the memorial was adopted.
    
    
     REGISTRATION OF ELECTORS.
     On motion by Mr. KERCHEVAL, his bill [H. R. 443] for a Board of Registry and the
      registration of voters was passed by yeas 58, nays 30.
     Mr. BEASLEY saying: There are many features of this bill that I like, but there are some
      that I don't indorse. I believe there is a large number of poor persons who move
      frequently, who, under the law, would be prevented from voting at all. I vote
      "no."
     Mr. BERTRAM, when his name was called, said: I believe that bill will insure a fair
      election, I therefore vote "aye."
     Mr. GARRISON [in explanation]: I shall vote as I do because I do not know what the
      provisions of the bill are. Another reason is that under a former registration law that we
      had, the people were not satisfied; they did not seem to have a better opportunity for a fair
      election. An reason is that it only provides, as I understood it read, that the registration
      shall be made once in two years. Another reason is that I think it allows the Registers too
      much money for their services. For these reasons and others I shall vote "no."
    
    
     RAILROAD FARES.
     Mr. Patton's bill [H. R. 231] to prohibit railroad companies from charging more than
      three cents per mile passenger fare, was taken up.
     Mr. JEWETT moved it be referred back the committee with instructions to amend so as to refer
      only to fares for which tickets were bought.
     Mr. PATTON: Some roads charge four cents where passengers have no ticket and three cents
      where they have a ticket. They make people pay more for riding on their roads without a ticket
      than with it; I say it is unjust, it is not right; there should be a uniform rate. I hope that
      this amendment will not prevail. If it prevails it will destroy the utility of this bill. I
      would rather the bill would not pass at all. This bill will compel them to accept three cents
      only, and that is right. Let us pass this bill; it is a good bill and is in the interests of
      everybody.
     Mr. JEWETT: It is but a business transaction. There is not a wholesale house in the State of
      Indiana that don't make a reduction for cash. Wherever the company does not provide a
      ticket-seller they cannot lawfully charge more. If for any reason you can't get a ticket,
      and they put you off, you have your action for damages. I know that the company wants its
      tickets sold. It seems to me but fair that the railroads
      be allowed the discretion to put a penalty on it when a man fails to get a ticket. If you get
      a ticket you get the benefit of the rate.
     Mr. HARRELL: In our section of the country they charge, maybe, a cent a mile more, and then
      give them a rebate check. The bill as it now stands says that no railroad company shall charge
      more than three cent a mile. I think it is just, equitable and right, so that one railroad
      cannot charge more than another.
     Mr. SCOTT: I am not in favor of the motion of the gentleman from Floyd (Mr. Jewett). I do
      not see that the railroad companies have any power at all to force people to buy tickets from
      them. I don't see why I should buy a ticket if by going on a train I can get my fare just
      as cheaply as to get a ticket. The result of the passage of this bill would be that there
      would be almost no tickets sold.
     Mr. KELLISON: I do not know that it would do any good to debate this amendment and pass this
      bill. We did pass a bill of this kind two years ago, and I was surprised to find that it was
      not in the printed acts of 1885. It is the law to-day, and what has become of the bill? If I
      am mistaken in this I hope gentlemen here will correct me. But I will make an amendment to the
      amendment that the instructions go this far, that it only apply to stations along the line of
      railway where they keep their offices open for the sale of tickets before the departure of
      trains.
     Mr. JEWETT: I accept that.
     Mr. PATTON: If this bill should receive such an amendment as that I would not vote for it
      myself. it is done for the purpose of killing this bill. It will make the law worse than it is
      to-day.
     Mr. BEASLEY: I understand the provisions of the Inter-State Commerce bill would make this
      amendment of no force because that requires railroad companies to carry freight and passengers
      for a uniform rate. I believe the amendment ought not to be adopted for that reason.
     The amendment was rejected.
     The bill passed by yeas 79, nays 8.
     Mr. WHITE saying: With the amendment proposed I would have voted for this bill, but in its
      present shape I do not believe it is right. I believe that the railroad companies should have
      some right to control their business. "No."
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     BILLS PASSED.
     The bill [S. 152] to pay a claim of Levi R. Green was passed by yeas 6l, nays 10.
     Mr. Ackman's bill [H. R. 332] to regulate foreign Insurance Companies which insure
      plate glass, passed by yeas 79, nays 6.
    
    
     DENTISTS'S LICENSE.
     On motion by Mr. LINCK, thet bill [S. 13] to regulate
      the Practice of Dentistry, was pressed to the final reading under a dispensation of the
      constitutional rules--yeas 68, nays 14.
     Mr. ROBINSON: I do not think this bill ought to pass. It certainly goes too far. There are
      many doctors competent to extract teeth who, under this law, would be subject to a penalty. In
      cities it might be very well. I understand that this bill would prevent any one from even
      extracting a tooth unless he be a graduate of the Dental College. Of course it is gotten up by
      gentlemen who make dentistry a profession. I am willing that they should have protection, but
      the people should have protection also. It is a hardship and a discrimination against
      gentlemen who understand surgical dentistry and do not understand mechanical dentistry. I
      think if you will canvass the country over, the people in the out-towns and country where
      there are no mechanical dentists would certainly almost unanimously oppose this bill, and if
      this bill should pass it should be amended as not to include surgical dentistry.
     Mr. PARKER: I don't believe this bill ought to pass. I don't believe that any man
      who is practicing dentistry, or medicine, or any other profession, should subjected to any
      examination There are competent  men in the State of
      Indiana who are not graduates, and have not been practicing since the year 1879. I do not
      believe this class of legislation is called for, or asked for by the people, and it is a
      species of legislation that this House ought not to pass.
     Mr. WHITE: I think there is a misapprehension of the general features of this bill. Under
      the provisions of this bill, as I understand it, there is nothing that will prevent any
      physician from extracting teeth.--Under the present law no one is allowed to practice medicine
      without a license. This bill goes to one who practices; one who pulls a tooth with a string
      would not be amenable; it is the man who practices for pay. But no man who pulls a tooth for a
      member of his own family, or for any other, so far as that goes, would be amenable. I do not
      regard it as a species of class legislation. It occurs to me that it is rather a species of
      protection for the people at large. The great majority of the people do not know anthing about
      dentistry, and when they seek the services of any one holding himself out to the world as a
      professional man, they go to him believing that he understands the theory and practice 
       ef
       of
       the profession that he attempts to practice. So I say the man who holds himself out
      to the world as one who is fit to practice a profession ought to possess the requisite
      capability for that profession.
     The bill passed by yeas 68, nays 16.
    
    
     CIVIL SERVICE.
     On motion by M. GRIFFITHS, his bill [H. R. 39] to serve the civil service of Indiana, was
      passed by yeas 55, nays 33.
     Mr. KELLISON saying: I believe that the whole theory of this legislation is based upon a
      wrong hypothesis, and that is, that because a man is a partisan he can't be trusted. I
      will not give my vote for any theory that says that because a man is a member of a political
      party he is not as trustworthy as though he were not.
    
    
     MR. KELLISON'S PROTEST.
     Mr. KELLISON filed the following
     
      
       
        Mr. Speaker--On this day (Tuesday, March 1, 1887,) the gentleman from Dearborn offered a
         resolution in reference to the duty of this General Assembly concerning the succession to
         the Lieutenant Governorship, and the same was read, whereupon, the protestant, having
         secured the recognition of the Speaker, offered the following substitute for said
         resolution, and same proposed substitute was forwarded to the Clerk's desk, and, after
         a portion of the preamble had been read, the Speaker, Hon. W. G. Sayre, announced the
         proposed substitute was out of order, and then and there refused an appeal and ordered said
         proposed substitute to be returned to this protestant, which proposed substitute was in
         words and figures following, to-wit:
        [See page 545 of this book.]
        I, therefore, most respectfully protest against the ruling of the Speaker in refusing to
         allow said proposed substitute to be read as unwarranted by the facts and contrary to the
         general parliamentary law of the land and the rules of this House.
        CHARLES KELLISON.

    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    IN SENATE.
    
     THURSDAY, March 3, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Hon. J. H. C. Smith, a Senator from the counties of
     Wells and Huntington.
    
     INDEXING OF THE SUPREME COURT RECORDS.
     Mr. FOWLER: I move to reconsider the vote by which Senate bill 236 was passed.
     Mr. WEIR: I would like to have a reason given why this bill should be reconsidered. I know
      these records have to be removed and that they should be indexed. I believe there is some
      other reason for this motion. The whole of this money is to be expended under the direction of
      the Judges of the Supreme Court; they are to audit the account; and I don't care whether
      the clerk is a Republican, Democrat or Greenbacker, I believe the money was properly
      appropriated, and so did every other Senator who voted for it. I think this is going a little
      too far.
     Mr. FOWLER: The Senator wants me to give a reason why this bill ought to be reconsidered. I
      voted for this bill. It appropriates $3,500 for the benefit of a man who a few days ago headed
      and led a mob against the doors of this chamber for the purpose of breaking them down, and
      driving out of this chamber the legally organized Senate. I don't care if it is
      absolutely necessary that this work should be done, I would not vote to give him one dollar.
      He has violated law, and acted with a mob in favor of driving out of this chamber the legal
      Senate.
     Mr. WEIR: What investigation has this body ever made whereby it is known that is a fact?
     Mr. FOWLER: It is notoriously known. It has been charged in this chamber, and outside of the
      chamber, that he was one of the men who appeared at that door trying to break it down. If it
      is not a fact I would like to know it. I would not favor voting one dollar to him. I venture
      to say that the Supreme Judges, knowing what they do of the conduct of this officer, would
      say, "reconsider the bill." That is my reason, and I hope every Democrat on this
      floor will cast his vote in favor of reconsidering this bill.
     Mr. WEIR: I for one will not vote to reconsider for any such reason. It may be this man was
      in the crowd at the time of so much excitemen; and the excitement is not to be wondered at.
      But is that any reason why the Sen- ate should reconsider
      a vote by which it passed a bill which it considered necessary? I am not governed in
      legislation by any such feeling. Why did the Senator vote for this bill unless he believed it
      was necessary and proper legislation?
     Mr. FOWLER: Because I believed the man who would receive the benefit of it was a law-abiding
      character.
     Mr. WEIR: Did you see him there? What evidence have you more than hearsay that he was there?
      It is not becoming in this body to--
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: Will the Senator from Laporte [Mr. Weir] indulge the chair to ask if
      he does not know the fact that he violated law, and stands in contempt of the Supreme Court by
      certifying a case passed upon the Supreme Court in fifteen minutes after it was passed
      upon?
     Mr. WEIR: I do not know, nor do I care.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: And he certified a lie in the certificate too.
     Mr. WEIR: As far as this motion is concerned it has nothing to do with that. The Supreme
      Judges have said they believe these papers should be indexed. I undertake to say you may carry
      out this spirit in legislation, and it will be a long time before a reconciliation takes place
      between the political parties.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: Nobody cares about that.
     Mr. WEIR: The people will care. As far as I am concerned I am above any such petty spite,
      under any and all circumstances.
     Mr. FOWLER: I would not ask this bill to be reconsidered because Mr. Noble is a Republican;
      by no means; but I know it has been charged on this floor and over the State, that he was in
      the mob trying to break down the doors of the Senate, and I never heard any word of denial
      either orally or through the newspapers; and I take it for granted he was there. If I shall
      learn he was not there, giving aid and counsel to that mob, I will be pleased to get up here
      and retract every word I have said about him. There has never been a denial, and I don't
      care if the Senator from Laporte charges me with petty spite, I don't care what you
      charge me with, I will never give a vote to vote one dollar in the pocket of a man of that
      character, and who is guilty of such conduct. I understand the Senator from Laporte was not
      here when that disgraceful scene occurred at the door. We have learned now who were
      participating in it. If any have been wrongfully charged I would be glad to know it and
      retract every word.
     The motion to reconsider was agreed to by yeas 25, nays 5, not voting 13.
     Pending the roll call--
     Mr. BARRETT said: This bill appropriates $3,500 for arranging and cleaning these papers, in
      addition to $2,500 appropriated yesterday for removing them into this building. That seems to
      me an outrageously extravagent sum to pay for the work proposed to be done.
     Mr. DAY: The bill says just so much as is necessary.
     Mr. BARRETT: Has the Senator ever heard of an appropriation in those words but every cent
      was used?
     Mr. DAY: Of course.
     Mr. BARRETT: Then it must have been under Democratic officials. I vote "aye."
     Mr. MCDONALD, when his name was called, said: I was sitting very quietly
      at my desk, as I usually do, on the morning the disgraceful scenes referred to took place, and
      was asked to go over to the door where the trouble was, and I did so. I went over with a good
      purpose. I approached gentlemen and asked them to go to their seats. One of the members I went
      to, and I say it to his credit, treated me like a gentleman, and I will never forget it, as he
      is of opposite politics. Another member I prevented from falling over the end of a settee,
      struck me in the face; but I went on with my endeavors, and with the Senator from Decatur and
      other Senators, a most disgraceful riot was prevented. I kept my temper; and the only motive I
      have in speaking of this thing is to say that to any man engaged in such disgrace- ful work, if he was my brother, I would not vote to put one cent in
      any man's pocket who will lead a mob. I have no sympathy with any such acts, I fully
      agree with the Hon. Senator from the county of Owen [Mr. Fowler]. There has been some damnable
      lying about this thing; it has been talked of all over the country, and some poor scurvy pimp
      has gone so far as to say that I undertook to expel Senators from this room which is as false
      as hell. I went there for a purpose, and I carried out that purpose, notwithstanding blood was
      running down my cheek. And now you ask me to vote money to a man engaged in any such work! No,
      never. I have now had an opportunity to explain my vote on this subject; and let it go to the
      people. I want to ask the Hon. Senator from Laporte [Mr. Weir]--a man who left that party
      because of its corruption--I ask the Senator: Why didn't you ask an investigation of
      this?
     Mr. WEIR: The reason why I haven't asked for an investigation is I didn't suppose
      it necessary to be investigated. I was not here when this occurred. I don't know it is
      any more the business of the Senator from Laporte than it is of any other Senator. The Senator
      from Whitley [Mr. McDonald] was as much an injured party as any one; why has not he asked for
      an investigation?
     Mr. MCDONALD: Because it was a personal matter with myself; and I
      generally take care of myself individually and personally, inside and outside of this chamber.
      Whenever I am requested to go from my seat to stop a riot I believe it is my duty to attempt
      it. I did it once, and can do it again. I believe I am voting right when I vote to reconsider
      this matter, therefore I vote "aye."
     Mr. THARP, when called upon to vote, said: If I voted for this bill on its passage I
      don't remember, and I didn't know what I voted for when I did; and I am surprised to
      see some Senators here who are willing, if they have voted for this measure, to allow it to
      stand. It is a well known fact by the people all over the State that the fees of all
      officials, especially in the Clerks offices and Auditors offices are extravagent. I venture to
      say two-thirds of the voters of Indiana would be willing to take the offices for half the
      fees. The fees out of this office pays that officer twice the amount a Judge of the Supreme
      Court gets, and it is his duty, by law so laid down, to keep that office in a proper manner.
      And now because he is called upon by the Judges to straighten out the records he asks for 3 or
      $4,000 for what is his duty to do! Independent of the conduct on the part of that officer I
      think it is an outrage to vote him $3,500 for what it is his duty to do. As to his conduct, if
      he is guilty of that, no action on the part of the Senate would sufficiently punish that
      high-handed outrage other than impeachment. For an officer to head a mob to invade the Senate
      of the State of Indiana is high-handed treason, and he should be impeached, and impeached
      promptly. If I had an opportunity to vote, if the proof sustains that, I certainly would vote
      to impeach him or any other State officer who attempted to assault the Senate chamber, or was
      known to resist the legally constituted authority of this body, or undertake to hammer down
      the doors of the Senate chamber. If I had an opportunity I certainly should vote for articles
      of impeachment to be brought before us to expel him from his office. I vote to reconsider for
      these various reasons. I vote "aye."
     Mr. WEIR, in explanation of his vote, said: Believing as I did when I voted for this bill
      that it was the opinions of the Judges of the Supreme Court that an appropriation should be
      made for the purpose of removing these records and putting them in proper condition. I voted
      for the passage of the bill. I have no inclination to judge a man without a hearing. I vote
      "no."
     Mr. ZIMMERMAN, when his name was called, said: Since the passage of this bill the Clerk of
      the Supreme Court was in a mob which tried to break in this chamber to oust our legally
      presiding officer from his seat.  The act, by a State
      officer, had a tendency to break up this Senate, and had a tendency to stop all needful
      legislation; therefore I vote in favor of reconsidering this vote on the passage of this bill.
      I vote "aye."
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore [in explanation of his vote] said: For the reason that the Clerk
      of the Supreme Court is handsomely paid, I think, on general princples, this bill ought never
      to become a law. And for the further reason that he is a violator of law in having led a mob
      of foot-pads and dead-beats to break in this Senate chamber, and if necessary kill and murder
      Senators; and for the reason I believe he publicly violated the law and stands in contempt of
      the Supreme Court for issuing and certifying a decision before he should have done so; and
      that he is unworthy of the confidence of this Senate or the people of the State of Indiana, I
      vote "aye." Hear the vote: ayes 22, nays 6--
     Mr. FOWLER [interposing]: I ask that the Senator from Orange (Mr. Andrew) vote on this
      measure.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Call the Senator from Paoli.
     Mr. ANDREW, in answering to his name, said: On account of understanding that Mr. Noble, the
      Clerk of the Supreme Court, headed a mob in violation of law, I vote "aye."
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Present and not voting 12; ayes 25, noes 5. So the motion to
      reconsider the vote is carried. [As the Senate was about to take a recess for dinner.] The
      chair directs the Secretary to make a certificate that the vote by which Senate Bill 236 was
      passed is reconsidered, and place a copy in the hands of Charles L. Jewett, of the House of
      Representatives.
     Mr. FOWLER: I think before that is done the Secretary should try to communicate the fact to
      the House in an official capacity. Of course he will not be able to do it.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Let him make the attempt.

       by yeas 28, nays 0; refusing to vote 14.
    
    
     CONTRACT CONVICT LABOR.
     Mr. ZIMMERMAN offered the following:
     
      
       
        Whereas, The various labor organizations of the State of Indiana have earnestly prayed
         for, and rightfully anticipated of, this General Assembly needful legislation on the
         question of abolishing in this States "contract convict labor;" and,
        Whereas this session is now rapidly drawing to a close without any visible prospect of
         this Legislature giving due consideration to this important subject; and
        Whereas, The employment of convicts in various important manufactures of this State, at
         the nominal contract price paid by the highest bidder, establishes an unfair and injurious
         competition between the factories and workships in which free and respectable men and women
         are employed; and,
        Whereas, the low and merely nominal prices paid by the contractors for the labor of
         penitentiary convicts materially influence and lower the wages of free laborers and working
         men employed in similar workshops and factories; and,
        Whereas, The very fact that the labor of a convicted criminal and felon should be
         permitted by this State to enter into competition with the labor of a free and respectable
         citizen, and diminishing his ability to provide for his family and educate his children, is
         humiliating to the free laborer, and an injustice and wrong to his family; and,
        
        Whereas, It is the paramount duty of the State to protect both the material intrests and
         the dignity of its citizens; and,
        Whereas, The pretext of making our State prisons self-sustaining, by letting out the
         labor of the convicts, is no excuse for injuring the private rights and lowering the wages
         of honest citizens; therefore, be it
        Resolved, that the present system of letting out under contract the labor of convicts has
         created a class of cheap slave labor, inflicting serious injuries upon free labor and the
         industries in which it is employed, and that a speedy remedy should be provided for.
        Resolved, That a committee of three members of this Senate holding over be appointed by
         the Chair to thoroughly investigate the present contract convict labor system, with a view
         to its final abolishment, and to devise means and plans of utilizing the employment of
         convicts as may contribute to the maintenance and support of the penitentiaries without
         interfering or entering into competition with the labor and compensation of free laborers
         and citizens.
        Resolved, That, to the end that the result of the labors of said committee may accomplish
         the salutary purpose, to be empowered, if it deem necessary, to send for persons and
         papers, and that it may visit the penal institutions of other States where contract convict
         labor has been partially or wholly abolished.
        Resolved, That said committee shall report by bill or otherwise to this General Assembly
         at its next special session, if there be one, or to the General Assembly of 1889.
       
      
     
     It was referred to the Committee on Prisons.
     Mr. ZIMMERMAN: I move that the Committee report to-morrow.
    
    
     SOLDIER'S MONUMENT BILL.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: The Governor has handed me Senate bill No. 3, on which appears the name of one R. S. Robertson.
      The Secretary will take red ink scratch and scratch it effectually out, and then I will sign
      it as correct. [Applause.]
     Mr. THARP: That bill originated in the Senate; was, I understand, sent to the House, passed
      there, and signed by the the Speaker.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: The Governor sent it to for my signature.
     Mr. THARP: Was not that unusual?
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: It is an unusual procedure. The chair has but one duty to perform,
      and that is to sign the bill [After doing so.] The chair announces that he has signed enrolled
       Senates act No. 3, and the Secretary will transmit it
      to the Governor.
     Mr. FOWLER [chairman of the Committee on Enrolled bills]: Send it to me
      and I will transmit it.
     Mr. THOMPSON of Marion: I see there are some unofficial names on it.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: There is no unofficial name there now. It is a genuine name and never
      can be blotted out.
     Mr. RAHM: If the House sends any more bills to the Governor without the proper signature, we
      can call on the doorkeepers to throw the parties bringing such bills out of this room. It is
      an insult--
     The PRESIDENT pro tem [interposing]: No such thing has been done. The bill just signed by me
      passed the other House, was enrolled there and then signed by the Speaker of the House, and
      then an unwarranted person signed it and transmitted it to the Governor. The Governor
      transmitted it back for the President of the Senate to sign, and the President of the Senate
      has performed his duty.
     Mr. RAHM: I hope the Governor--
     The PRESIDENT pro tem [interrupting] The Governor will take care of himself, and don't
      you forget it.
     Mr. FOWLER: I will ask leave of absence until I deliver bill No. 3 to the Governor.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: Leave will be granted.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     A message from the Governor was received announcing the appointment of Mrs. Eliza C.
      Hendricks and Mrs. Claire A. Walker, both of Marion county, as members of the board of
      managers of the Female Reformatory for a term of four years from March 3, 1887. The
      appointments were at once confirmed.
    
    
     SENATE BILLS PASSED.
     Mr. THARP called up Mr. Sears' bill [S. 29] concerning the mining of coal--the mining
      to be paid for  before screening--and it was passed,
      after he explained its provisions, by yeas 26, nays 3; refusing to vote 11.
     On motion by Mr. FOWLER the 11 were not excused.
     Mr. FOWLER called up his bill [S. 185] to compel foreign insurance companies to pay
      judgments rendered against them in this State.
     On motion by Mr. 
       WEIR
       WIER
       the word foreign was stricken out.
     The bill as amended was passed by yeas 30, nays 0; present and not voting 14.
     Mr. HOWARD, of St. Joseph, called up his bill [S. 134] to authorize the issue of graduated
      drainage bonds for the payment of assessments for constructing drains, which was passed by
      yeas 27, nays 1; present and not voting 11.
    
    
     SOLDIER'S MONUMENT BILL.
     Mr. HOWARD of Decatur, offered a resolution that this Senate congratulate the Soldiers'
      and Sailors of Indiana upon the rescue by the Governor of the Monument and Memorial Hall bill
      from the deliberate attempt upon the part of the Speaker of the House, and Robert S. Robertson
      to destroy the same by means of illegal and unwarranted attestation.
     On motion by Mr. FOWLER it was adopted.
    
    
     EXTRA DOORKEEPERS.
     Mr. BAILEY offered a resolution which was adopted, to pay $5 a day to "additional
      assistant doorkeepers."
     The Senate adjourned.
    
   
   
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
    
     THURSDAY, March 3, 1887.
    
    HUNTING ON WET LANDS.
    On motion by Mr. KELLISON, the bill [S. 11] to permit
     hunting on wet lands, was pressed to the final vote.
    Mr. HARRELL: I have no objection to this bill for the lands on the Kankakee river; but I
     think it would apply to overflowed land anywhere in the State, and that it would also apply to
     that part of a man's farm that is overflowed and lying along a river.
    Mr. STUBBLEFIFLD: I am opposed to this bill from the fact that it permits hunters to go upon
     the river bottom lands and excludes them from other places. I know in the part of the State
     where I live there is a great deal of bottom land, and a great deal of land that is uninclosed.
     People turn their hogs and cattle out there, and to have them stampeded by hunters is wrong. I
     am opposed to this bill; it is wrong and ought not to pass.
    Mr. HOWARD: The principle, as it now stands, is the same as the park lands of England. All
     our people want, is the right to go on these lands.
    Mr. BERTRAM: The pretended owners come there, in the hunting season, about five days before
     the law is out, and yet they propose to prosecute every man who sets his foot on these lands. I
     live in Starke county and I know the present law works a great hardship to people in the
     neighborhood. The men who live there in the country are prohibited from hunting on these lands
     to any extent.--These lands are taxed very low, the assessment upon them being about two
     dollars an acre; and these lands are bought up and held in reserve for these foreign hunters.
     We have a case in court now where a man was arrested for going through that laud on a section
     line.
    Mr. FOSTER: I want to ask if they don't draw the line around land that they have not
     bought?
    Mr. BERTRAM: They hold probably three thousand acres of sand to which they have not a shadow
     of title, and never have had, and they keep men there to keep others off.
    Mr. WEYAND: Large tracts of land in the northwest part of the State are falling into the
     hands of non-residents and into the hands of syndicates for the purpose of hunting grounds.
     This is they best soil in the State, and it should some day be brought into cultivation.
    Mr. JEWETT: I hope this bill may pass, not for the reason that has been urged but for another
     reason. The effect of the passage of this bill will be to discourage the holding of large
     bodies of land in the northern part of the State for hunting purpos- es; and that alone ought to be sufficient reason for passing this
     bill.--Public policy requires that no one should have an interest in a large body of land in
     this State except to improve it, and throw it open for the benefit of the public. I saw in
     Ireland a family of human beings that were endeavoring to support themselves upon four acres of
     sterile land, for the rent of which the head of the family had to pay one pound a year. And I
     saw more than thirty thousand acres of land that was protected by police that it might become
     the abode of wild animals; that the owner of it, a non-resident, might come out there and with
     his fellow debauches, and libertines, spend a few days in hunting. I want this thing
     discouraged; I want these gentlemen who are able to buy land for the purpose of making it a
     hunting ground to go to some other State than the State of Indiana. I would withdraw from these
     men the protection of the law. I would vote to agree to a constitutional amendment that no
     corporation should hold in this State, more real estate than is necessary for its business. I
     would go further, and say that no person should hold more than a half section of land. I
     believe that the best security of a democratic form of government is in the possession of the
     soil by those only who till it. This bill is in that direction, and for that reason and that
     reason alone, and because I recognize the rights of property exists just as well in the man who
     holds ten thousand acres, as the man who holds an acre, I favor it.
    Mr. KELLISON: I want to answer one objection that is urged against this bill. In the first
     place, I want to say I have no personal interest in this question. I am not a hunter, and I do
     not believe that I have been seen in the company of a gun and dog once in the last fifteen
     years. This bill should be construed liberally, and as we would construe any other bill or law.
     It has been urged that this bill would make all overflowed lands subject to the hunters. It
     does not exempt from the provisions of the preseat law simply the wet lands alone, but the
     language of the provision making the exception is, that it shall not apply to wet and
     overflowed lands. It certainly would not apply to a piece of wet land in the center of a farm.
     It would not give the hunter a right to go through your field to get to a pond on your farm,
     because he would be obliged to act in violation of other laws of the State of Indiana. He would
     be a trespasser upon your land. But the provisions of this bill apply only to cases where the
     hunter can get to these wet and overflowed lands without violating any other law. This bill
     must be considered in connection with the laws now upon the Statute books, and it does not
     affect or modify the game or fish laws of the State of Indiana. There is no reason why a man
     who owns a thousand acres of this wet and overflowed land should be protected any more than a
     foreign corporation.
    The bill passed by yeas 59, mays 29.
    Pending the roll-call--
    Mr. GARRISON said: Inasmuch as there is a persistent effort to favor these gun clubs I think
     it well to explain my vote. In my part of the State there are hunters in every community, and
     they are confined to very small areas. My experience has been that even with the present law a
     man has almost to take his shot gun to protect his land when these hunters go out with their
     dogs. It is very annoying, especially to owners of sheep, to have these dogs get together among
     them in the day-time, or at night either. I vote "no."
    Mr. STUBBLEFIELD, when his name was called, said: I know that corporations hold large tracts
     of land in this State for hunting grounds; and believing that this bill will be a good thing;
     and as I am willing to stand what little inconvenience it will be in my part of the country, I
     vote "aye."
    So the bill finally passed.
    
     SENATE BILLS PASSED.
     The bill [S. 198] to set apart a space in the
      State-house for a statue of the late General P. A. Hackleman, was  finally passed by yeas 78, nays 0, under a suspenion of the
      constitutional rules.
     The bill [S. 293] to enclose Tippecanoe
      battle-ground, was, under a further suspension of the rules, passed by yeas 74, nays 10.
    
    
     BUILDING AND LOAN ASSOCIATONS.
     The bill [S. 217] providing for the exemption of
      building and loan associations from taxaction except in the amount of money actually in the
      hands of the Treasurer on the first of April, was read the third time.
     Mr. Speaker SAYRE [Mr. Stubblefield in the chair]: It has not been my aim during this
      session to make any speeches, but I have been requested to make some remarks upon this bill.
      The first reason I have for supporting this bill is, that I believe there is nothing or no
      institution that is authorized by the laws of the State of Indiana that ought to command the
      attention of the Legislature more than the Building and Loan Associations. I believe their
      operation is beneficial in every way. I believe they enable thousands of persons to obtain
      homes sooner than they could otherwise. I know of their operations from several that I have
      been connected with in the ciy where I live, an I know that many scores of homes have been
      obtained there, by men of small earnings, that could never have been obtained except by the
      operation of these companies. I fear many persons do not understand the significance of these
      Building and Loan Associations. If I have a dollar a week I cannot loan it, but if five
      hundred men each have a dollar, it can be loaned, if put together. Suppose the gentleman from
      Marion and I each had a lot worth two hundred dollars; we were each living in rented houses
      and paying eight or ten dollars a month rent; I borrow enough to erect a house upon my lot
      worth four or five hundred dollars; I pay the building and loan society for a few years the
      same amount monthly that I have been paying as rent, and I pay the same that the gentleman
      from Marion pays, and at the end of six years, or whatever the time may be when the class runs
      out, I own the house that I live in, while the gentleman from Marion, who has paid out the
      same number of dollars for rent, is yet a renter in a rented house. And I believe that this
      bill ought to pass because it does prevent double taxation upon a class of persons who deserve
      this exemption in their behalf. These persons who put in their dollar a week; that money never
      gets on the tax duplicate. It is not taxed now. It cannot be taxed because when the first of
      April comes around the small sum of money that may be in the hands of the working men is not
      taxed. And this bill says that what is on hands on the first of April shall be taxed; and that
      gives more than is now collected. And this money that they pay in there is borrowed by their
      own members and it is put into houses--into houses that become the homes of these people; and
      when it is so invested they pay taxes upon their homes. And then, it seems to me, that as this
      is not for the purpose of making money by speculation, that the relief asked for by this bill
      ought by all means to be conceded to societies of that kind. Everybody knows and feels this
      way, and the mere suggestion is all that is necessary. That country is the safest where the
      people of the community own the houses they live in. Now, it has been proposed that as these
      societies are artificial persons they should be taxed upon their mortgages. It is simply the
      men loaning to each other enough money which they have accummulated, that they may build homes
      for each other. I hope this bill may become a law.
     Mr. MAJOR: In view of the fact that there is before this House a memorial from seventy-two
      of the assemblies of the Knights of Labor, pre-eminently the organization of the poor men of
      this country; in view of the fact that the Building and Loan Associations are the poor
      man's corporations; in view of the fact that the passage of this bill would do more good
      than the passage of any other, I am in favor of it, and I hope that no one on this floor will
      oppose it.
     
     Mr. PATTON: It has been said by the gentleman from Shelby (Mr. Major) in his innocence;--he
      looks innocent, and he presumes that we are innocent, when he supposes that nobody will oppose
      this bill. What is a loan association? I belong to one myself, and what is the result of it?
      Charging these poor men eighteen per cent. for the use of their money. You know they are the
      worst thing for the poor people that we have ever had in the State of Indiana. The money goes
      into the hands of the banks. You will find more bankers going into them than of the men who
      work by the days work. You will find in every one of them some banker. Wealth and capital go
      in there, for what purpose? To get the hard earnings of these poor men. Who gets the money?
      The banker. You might as well come in here and ask that the banking system be exempt from
      taxation, and that the property of the banks be exempt from taxation. They talk about laboring
      men, what are we in the State of Indiana but laboring people? Legislation should be in the
      interests of all the people; but this is a bill to exempt the property of the rich and put a
      heavier tax upon the poor. You will find that these people who are claimed to be benefitted by
      it will not be benefitted by it. It look like an opportunity for a man to accumulate wealth,
      and get himself a home, but you have to pay what amounts to eighteen per cent. for the use of
      money belonging to these associations.
     Mr. MAJOR demanded the previous question.
     The demand was seconded, and under its operations the bill finally passed by yeas 71, nays
      20.
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. COX, of Miami, said: I am willing to vote for this bill, but with some misgivings. I
      believe there is danger it will exempt from taxation some property that should pay tax. I know
      in many towns the stock in building and loan associations is owned by rich men--who put money
      in there as a matter of speculation. But if it encourages men in getting homes, I will vote
      for the bill--"aye."
     Mr. GARRISON [in explanation]: I would certainly not cast my vote against the interests of
      the poor man. But I believe that this bill is calculated to exempt from taxation a large
      amount of money which is placed in these institutions by men who are just as able to pay taxes
      as I am upon what little I have, and I believe that men who are able to pay their taxes should
      do so. For my part I cannot see that it is a poor man's bill, because the poor mean are
      the men who borrow the money and the rich ones are the ones who loan the money. I vote
      "no."
     Mr. GORDON said: I regret very much that I was shut off by the previous question. I want to
      say right here the bill if passed wil exempt $25,000,000 from taxation in this State. I vote
      "no."
     Mr. GOUGH, explaining, said: I favor this bill because it is equal; because there is no
      inequality about it; because it proposes to tax the stock of the assoctition at its fair tax
      value; and proposes to exempt from taxation the mortgages that are given for that stock. This
      proposes to exempt from taxation a mortgage upon a house where the owner pays a tax on the
      house. Where double taxation can be prevented without injury it should be done. I vote
      "aye."
     Mr. HARRELL [in explanation]: I have not been able to understand the bill as I desired to. I
      vote as I do for the reason that if it exempts any property it is unconstitutional. I vote
      "no."
     Mr. HOWARD, when called upon to vote, said: Every dollar of stock is taxed, that is the
      stock that is not surrendered. Say that I own a house and lot, I surrender my stock and I pay
      the tax on the house and lot, but my surrendered stock amounts to nothing and the mortgage
      amounts to nothing except double taxation. I vote "aye."
     Mr. IBACH said: I regret that members cannot get the proper understanding of this bill. If
      this does exempt property it is unconstitution-  al.
      There is no double taxation in a building and loan association. I vote "aye."
     Mr. LINCK, when his name was called, said: Most of the men in the building and loan
      associations down our way are poor men. It has almost ruined our liquor shops, and everybody
      is in favor of them; therefore I vote "aye."
     Mr. MAJOR [explaining]: In this matter, the gentleman from Putnam (Mr. Gordon) is very far
      wrong. This bill, if passed, will do nothing but relieve a poor class of people from taxation;
      and that in a very small amount. I vote "aye."
     Mr. MONTGOMERY, of Owen, in explanation, said: I have always been in favor of this bill, but
      I do not believe that discussion should be cut off in this way on bills of this kind. I will
      vote "aye."
     Mr. MORSE [explaining his vote]: Believing that the building associations have helped the
      advancement of this city more than anything else; and believing also that the taxable property
      in the city is increased by the improvements made upon the land; and believing that these
      improvements can be more fully arrived at under this bill; and knowing that the building and
      loan associations have helped the interests of the working men all over the State; I vote
      "aye."
     Mr. NIBLACK, when his name was called, said: Because I know what a benefit the building and
      loan associations have been to our city, and because I have been asked by the people to vote
      for this bill, I vot "aye."
     Mr. PARKER said: I am opposed, in the first place, to class legislation of all kinds. And so
      far as I have been able to get light upon this bill it opens the door to the exemption from
      taxaction of property that ought to be taxed. I know that building and loan associations have
      been a great benefit to this State and I believe, while I am opposed to rushing a bill of this
      kind through under the gag law, I will vote "aye."
     Mr. PATTON: For the reason that this would not be double taxation; for the reason that the
      certificate of stock or share of stock is not upon any value except the amount of money in the
      hands of the treasurer of the association; and for the reason that three-fourths of the
      members of the loan associations of the State of Indiana do not take out any money, but invest
      in them for the purpose of speculation and to get a high rate of interest; for the reason that
      the poor man who has a house and lot pays the tax on it; and for the further reason that the
      corporation, company, or association of which he is a member owns all the mortgages and has
      the money. I therefore vote "no."
     Mr. SCOTT said: Believing that double taxation should always be avoided, and knowing the
      difficulties of doing that, but believing that here is one case where double taxation can be
      avoided, and avoided in the interests of the poor men; and believing that if by this law
      capital will be induced to be put into building and loan associatons it will be for the
      benefit of the poor men, I vote "aye."
     Mr. SHAMBAUGH, when called upon to vote said: I believe this would seriously affect the tax
      revenue, therefore I vote "no."
     Mr. VAN SLYKE said, when casting his vote: Knowing the fact that the building and loan
      associations of one of the counties that I represent have materially aided many poor men to
      get homes that never could have gotten themselves homes in any other way, I vote
      "aye."
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the bill finally passed.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     EXECUTIONS IN THE PENITENTIARIES.
     The bill [S. 26] to provide that executions shall be
      made in the State Prisons, was read the third time, and, after an explanation by Mr. REYNOLDS,
      was passed by yeas 77, nays 3.

     COURTESIES BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES.
     Mr. GORDON introduced a resolution which the clerk began reading. [As soon as it was evident
      that the resolution referred to admitting the Secretary of the Senate]--
     The SPEAKER [interrupting]:--This is out of order.
     Mr.GORDON: I appeal--
     The SPEAKER [interrupting]: This House has, by resolution, decided to receive nothing from
      the Senate and to hear nothing pertaining to that action, therefore you are out of order. The
      chair decides nothing pertaining to the resolution, but declares that its presentation, in
      view of previous action of the House, is out of order. Therefore there is nothing to appeal
      from, and your appeal is denied.
     The resolution, after setting forth the refusal of the Door-keeper to admit the Secretary of
      the Senate, concludes thus:
     
      
       
        "Resolved, That the Door-keeper be and he is hereby instructed and directed to at
         all times admit the Secretary of the Senate and his subordinates, and all other persona
         bearing messages and communications from the Senate to the floor of the House when the same
         is in session, when such Secretaries present themselves for the purpose of making such
         communications."
       
      
     
     The House adjourned.
    
   
   
   
    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    IN SENATE.
    
     FRIDAY, March 4, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Hon. J. H. C. Smith, a Senator from the counties of
     Wells and Huntington.
    
     SOLDIERS' MONUMENT BILL.
     Mr. MCDONALD offered the following:

     Mr. President:--We, the undersigned members of the Senate, and honorably discharged soldiers
      of the Union army, most respectfully ask of the Honorable President and members of this
      Senate, to adopt the following resolution, to-wit:
     
      
       
        Resolved by the Senate, That Governor Isaac P. Gray, the patriotic and consistent
         Executive of the State of Indiana, has the lasting 
          gratitude
          gratitute
          of the soldiers of Indiana, for his manly and constitutional course in saving the
         Soldiers' Monument and Memorial Hall Bill from defeat by returning it to the President
         of the Senate for his signature. And, further, that as a matter of justice to this Senate
         and the whole people of Indiana, as well as the old soldiers, dead and living, we ask this
         Senate, which passed said bill without one dissenting vote, that the manly and conservative
         message of the Governor to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, dated March 3,
         1887, be and the same is unequivocally indorsed by this Senate and that the same be spread
         in full upon the journal of this Senate.
       
       
        ISAIAH B. MCDONALD,
        TIMOTHY E. HOWARD,
        JACOB H. C. SMITH,

        PHILIP SCHLOSS,
        F. M. HOWARD,
        SILAS W. HALE.
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,
         
         INDIANAPOLIS, March 3, 1887.
        
        
         To the Honorable, the Speaker of the House of Representatives:
        
        Senate Bill No.3, entitled "An act to provide
         for the erection of a State Soldiers'and and Sailors' Monument, or Memorial Hall
         combined, according to the discretion of the trustees in this act provided for, and
         declaring an emergency," and signed Warren G. Sayre, Speaker of the House of
         Representatives, and R. S. Robertson, Lieutenant Governor, was presented to me by the House
         of Representatives for my approval.
        The bill does not conform to the requirements of section 25, article 4, of the
         Constitution, which provides that "all bills and joint resolutions shall be signed by
         the presiding officers of the respective Houses," and its presentation in that form is
         also a violation of the joint rules adopted by both Houses of the present General Assembly,
         which reads as follows:
        RULE 2. After a bill or joint resolution shall have passed both
         houses, it shall be duly enrolled on paper, and the Clerk of the House where it originated
         shall indorse upon the back thereof the House in which it originated, under which he shall
         place his signature.
        RULE 4. Every bill or joint resolution reported to have been duly
         enrolled shall be signed first by the speaker of the House of Representatives, who shall
         send the same to the Senate, then by the President of the Senate, after which it shall be
         presented by the Joint Committee on Enrolled Bills to the Governor for
         his approbation and signature, and the said committee shall report to their respective
         Houses the day of their presentation, which report shall be entered upon the journals of
         each House.
        RULE 5. All bills and joint resolutions shall be signed by the Speaker
         of the House of Representatives and the  President of
         the Senate, in their Houses respectively, when in session, which shall be carefully noted
         on the journals of each House.
        The bill was not indorsed or signed by the Secretary of the Senate in which the bill 
          originated
          originoted
         ; was never sent to the Senate as required by the joint rules, for the signature
         of the presiding officer of the Senate, as required by the Constitution, and did not
         purport to be signed by the presiding officer of the Senate.
        The constitutional provision, which provides that all bills and joint resolutions passed
         shall be signed by the presiding officers of the respective Houses does not mean some
         person who is claiming to be legally entitled to preside, and who is not presiding, but, in
         my judgment, means the officer or person who is actually presiding and discharging the
         duties of the position. There might be two members of the House each claiming to have been
         legally elected Speaker, and in that case the Executive would undoubtedly have to recognize
         the signature of the member who was actually presiding, and whom the House recognized as
         its presiding officer. It is not the province of the Executive to decide who is entitled to
         preside in either House.
        The Executive posesses no such power or authority. When the Executive is notified by each
         House of the General Assembly that it is duly organized, ready to receive communications
         and transact business, the Executive must recognize the organization so reported, and has
         no right to recognize another. The organization reported to me by a committee from each
         House on the 6th day of January, 1887, has remained unchanged up to the present time, and
         has been recognized by each House in the passage through each House of eighteen bills,
         which were signed by the present presiding officers of each House, and approved by me,
         among which are the bills appropriating $125,000 for paying the mileage and per diem of the
         members and other expenses of the General Assembly; for the reorganization and maintenance
         of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Orphans' Home; for the payment of certain
         employes every two weeks, and authorizing certain cities to issue bonds. The present
         organization of the Senate has been further recognized by the passage by the House, during
         each day's session during the present week, of a number of Senate bills and other
         measures. The members of each House have, from the organization of the General Assembly,
         drawn their mileages and per diem upon certificates signed by the present presiding officer
         of their respective Houses.
        If I had approved the bill in the form in which it was presented to me by the House,
         there certainly would be no question as to its invalidity. No court could possibly hold
         that it was signed by the presiding officer of each House when the entire record of the
         Senate shows that Alonzo G. Smith, and no one else, is the presiding officer of the
         Senate.
        I cannot sanction a proceeding which would inevitably prevent the bill from becoming a
         law; and believing that the soldiers and sailors of Indiana, and the people generally,
         desire the legal passage of the bill providing for the erection of a Soldiers' and
         Sailors' Monument, I have caused the bill to be transmitted to the Senate, and it has
         been returned to me for approval, signed by the presiding officer and Secretary of the
         Senate. I have approved the bill and caused the same to be deposited in the office of the
         Secretary of State.
        
         ISAAC P. GRAY,
          Governor.
        
       
      
     
     The resolution was adopted.
    
    
     SOUTHERN PRISON DIRECTORS.
     Mr. 
       WEIR
       WIER
       offered the following:
     
      
       
        Whereas, The report of the Senate Committee on State Prisons shows
         such a state of facts in relation to the Southern Prison as to justify heroic treatment by
         demanding the resignation of the present Board of Directors, therefore, be it
        Resolved, By the Senate, the House concerning, that the Directors be and they are hereby
         each requested to resign as such Directors.
       
      
     
     Mr. MULLINIX: One of these Directors resides in my county. He may not have discharged his
      duty, but outside of that a better Democrat God never let live than he is. I will say now, as
      he told Senator Fowler and myself, he is ready to offer his resignation at any time. It is not
      necessary to censure these men unjustly without a proper investigation to see what they are
      guilty of. But why not go into a joint convention and elect these directors? Why not do
      that?
     Mr. FOWLER: Every Senator upon this floor who was present at the caucus last night must
      certainly be surprised at this resolution coming from the Senator without any intimation; in
      fact I may say; after having been repudiated by the caucus. I am astonished he would take the
      responsibility of introducing a resolution of that character without giving members an
      intimation of it. I am informed by Senators around me they had no intimation of it. I am not
      going to state further than that, what occurred in caucus. This is a resolution that concerns
      not only these two men, but the Democratic party; and I have a right to speak for that party
      as I have a right to speak for those two men. If I believed they were dishonest or intended to defraud the State I would be the last man to raise my
      voice in their favor; but I cannot consent to give my voice or my vote for that
      resolution.
     Mr. SMITH, of Wells: Where a man is guilty of direliction of duty I am not willing to shield
      him; but, as I understand it, these gentlemen are men of good reputation for integrity, and
      their character for honesty is unquestioned. I am in favor of a radical change as soon as it
      can be brought about; and if nothing else will bring it about but to adopt this resolution, I
      will vote for it.
     Mr. 
       WEIR
       WIER
      : The Senator from Owen [Mr. Fowler] says he is surprised. I will state to the
      Senator from Owen that I am surprised. I don't understand there was anything as to to
      this question considered in the caucus. My recollection is there was nothing said as to the
      propriety of requesting these men to resign. It is said these men are honest; I have made no
      attack upon their honesty. It is said these men are going to resign; why don't they
      resign? I say men who are directors of that institution and know so little about it, however
      honest they may be, are unfitted for the position.
     Mr. BAILEY: Is it not true that bill 324, passed by the Senate, covers every possible
      provision of this resolution?
     Mr. 
       WEIR
       WIER
      : Every Senator knows there is no possibility, under the present circumstances, of
      that bill passing the House.
     Mr. BAILEY: Is there any possibility of your concurrent resolution passing the House?
     Mr. 
       WEIR
       WIER
      : That I am unable to say. I propose to give an opportunity if they choose to pass
      it, and if they refuse, the responsibility is with them. I have no feeling about this matter
      at all, but I believe the resolution is proper and ought to pass.
     Mr. RAHM: I believe these three directors are as honest as any one of us on this floor, but
      I say these men are not the men to be any longer in charge of that institution, because it is
      their duty to look after the books and general management of the affairs of the prison, and
      they have not done it. Some men are competent to look after a certain kind of business, and
      entirely unfit to look after another. I think it is due to my constituency--to the Democrats
      and Republicans of Vanderburg county--that I should vote for this resolution. I do not believe
      the Democratic party can afford to pass this over quietly and adjourn.
     Mr. 
       WEIR
       WIER
      : I will ask the Senator if it is not a fact that he has been informed there is one
      of these directors who does not propose to resign?
     Mr. RAHM: That is my understanding, and for that reason I shall vote for this resolution. I
      don't think a caucus or anything else will bind me not to vote for a good resolution.
     Mr. FOWLER: It has been asked by the Senator from Laporte why these directors do not resign.
      I think I can answer that question. The reason why they have not resigned is they do not want
      to embarass their friends of the Democratic party. I want to say I can have the resignation of
      two of these directors by tomorrow noon or night, and I understand the Senator from Floyd [Mr.
      Day] will vouch for the resignation of the other members of that board. These men have
      neglected their duty, there is no question about that.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: If that be the case why not set the resolution down for to-morrow at
      2 or 3 o'clock, and in the mean time--
     Mr. FOWLER: Why not Monday?
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: Well, say Monday. In the mean time let the friends of the directors
      place their resignations in the hands of the Governor.
     Mr. 
       WEIR
       WIER
      : I am willing this resolution shall go over till to-morrow at 2 o'clock, but I
      am not willing for it to go over till Monday.
     Mr. MULLINIX: I move to add to the resolution:
     
      
       
        Provided, This resolution is not intended as the slightest reflection upon the personal
         integrity of the Directors, but is based rather upon their want of care of vigilance in
         looking after the affairs of the institution over which they had charge.
       
      
     
     

     Mr. 
       WEIR
       WIER
      : I accept the amendment.
     Mr. FOWLER: The train Dr. Norvell comes on does not reach here till 4 o'clock in the
      afternoon. There is no telegraph running to his town.
     Mr. 
       WEIR
       WIER
      : I infer from what Senators state these men are ready to resign, and would resign.
      As far as I am concerned my purpose is to secure their resignations. I will say if the
      Senators will be responsible for their resignations, I am willing to make this resolution a
      special order for Monday at 10 o'clock.
     Mr. FOWLER: If they don't resign by that time I will vote for the resolution.
     Mr. MULLINIX: So will I.
     Mr. DAY: I will say so too.
     The resolution was made a special order for Monday at 10 o'clock.

     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     BILLS PASSED.
     Mr. SMITH, of Wells, called up his bill [S. 31] to amend section 5845 of the R. S. 1881
      concerning Clerks of County Courts. It was passed by yeas 26, nays 1; present and not voting

     A MESSAGE FROM THE GOVERNOR.
     Announced his appointment of Thomas McQuade, of Clay county, mine inspector, to succeed
      himself, for a term of two years from January 19, 1887.
     On motion by Mr. 
       WEIR
       WIER
       this nomination was confirmed.
    
    
     COMPULSORY EDUCATION.
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion, called up his bill [S. 12] to regulate the instruction of children
      in this State, on its third reading. He said: I had intended to make quite extended remarks on
      this bill. It asks for no appropriation. We have ten thousand school houses in Indiana, and we
      have fourteen thousand teachers; but there is an offset of between two and three hundred
      thousand chiidren in Indiana who never attend school.
     Mr. 
       WEIR
       WIER
       [interposing]: Where does the Senator get his statistics?
     Mr. THOMPSON of Marion: The lowest estimate I have seen is 15O,000. This bill only asks the
      aid of the law to place the children of the State 
       under
       uader
       wholesome educational restriction. If education is a natural right, there is imposed
      upon the State the duty of seeing that the children of the State are properly educated. I  have talked to a great many educated people about it, and I
      have not heard a man object to compulsory education. It matters not whether we have 200,000 or
      50,000 children who do not attend school, it is the duty of the law-makers to see that every
      child in the commonwealth receives a common school education.
     Mr. 
       WEIR
       WIER
      : I am opposed to the provisions of this bill which would authorize constables,
      sheriffs, and anybody else to stop children on the highway and arrest them. This bill is equal
      to the blue laws of Connecticut 100 years ago, in some respects. A compulsory education bill,
      with proper restrictions, would receive my support, but this bill never will. [He referred to
      objectional features.]
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion: This bill is like the Illinois act almost word for word.
     Mr. BAILEY: This bill is mild in its provisions with regard to its enforcement; it is a bill
      right in principle, and one that will be largely to the advantage of the people off the State.
      I believe this bill ought to pass. If for nothing more, to set a good example.
     Mr. RAHM: I am glad to say the Senator from Marion and myself on this bill will have no
      difference. I was born in a country where every child was compelled to go to school, and I
      think it was a grand law. And every parent there is fined for every day the child is absent.
      We have a good many parents in this State who take their children from school at 10 or 12
      years of age, and put them on the farm to work, or in work-shops, and for that reason alone a
      law compelling parents to send their children to school, would be a good one. This bill may
      have some defects, and I believe it has, from what the Senator from Laporte [Mr. 
       WEIR
       WIER
      ] says, but I believe in passing it, and in two years it can be amended and
      corrected.
     Mr. FRENCH: For a number of years I have thought the principles of this bill were right and
      proper. It is not only a duty of the State, but its highest duty, to educate the children; the
      State can't afford to do otherwise. I undertake to say parents who do their full duty to
      their offspring cannot be affected by any compulsory law. I am willing to trust the Senator
      who says he comes here with a bill copied from our sister State of Illinois, and I am willing
      to cast my vote for it.
     Mr. SMITH, of Wells: I believe both the great political parties in this State have declared
      in favor of preventing children under a certain age working in mines; and unless we enact some
      law that will compel these children to go into the public schools, I fear they will grow up in
      ignorance. I think there should be a law to compel them to go into the public schools. More
      crime is committed by those who do not know anything about books than by those who do, from
      the fact, that, as a rule, when they are educated they earn an honest livelihood. I do not
      fully understand the provisions of this bill. I wish it had been printed and laid on our
      desks. I am willing to vote for almost any kind of a bill that will bring into the public
      schools the boys and girls who are now running loose in the streets and growing up in
      ignorance and crime.
     The bill failed to pass for want of a constitutional majority; the vote stood yeas 20, nays
      6; present and refusing to vote 14--as follows:

     Pending the roll call--
     Mr. HOWARD, of St. Joseph when his name was called, said: I think this is a move in the
      right di- rection, not only to get children from the
      work-shops, where it is injurious for them to be, but also to see that they have an education.
      This bill provides that their education shall be in the necessary branches, and that it may be
      had in the public schools or in private schools. If this bill requires amendment--it is not
      likely it will become a law at this session--but before it does it will have to go to the
      House, and amendment can be made there. I think this is an effort in the right direction, and
      should be encouraged and not discouraged, and therefore I vote "aye."
      Mr. MCDONALD, when called upon to vote, said: There is machinery in this
      bill I cannot endorse, and as it is not likely to become a law, I am constrained to vote
      "no."
     Mr. MULLINIX, in explanation of his vote, said: I believe this is a bill in the right
      direction and ought to become a law. I am satisfied there ought to be legislation on this
      subject, therefore I vote "aye."
      Mr. 
       WEIR
       WIER
       in explanation of his vote, said: As I have stated, I am in favor of proper measures
      for compulsory education. I will not vote for a bill I would not favor under ordinary
      circumstances, when there was a prospect for its becoming a law. There are many provisions in
      this bill of a penal character which would be offensive, and for that reason I vote
      "no."
     Mr. ZIMMERMAN, when answering to his name, said: I am in favor of compulsory education, but
      I don't think we are ready for it yet in this State. I think it would be cruel and
      tyrannical to compel a poor man to send his children to school when he has no means with which
      to buy school books.
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion [interposing]: Where they are not able to buy books they are
      exempted from the provisions of the bill.
     Mr. ZIMMERMAN [resuming]: Compulsory education is right. But I think the State of Indiana
      should furnish text books free to the children; and for that reason I vote "no."
     The result was announced as above.
     So the bill failed to pass for want of a affirmative majority vote of all the members
      elected.
     The Senate adjourned.
    
   
   
    HOUSE OF REPRSENTATVES.
    
     FRIDAY, March 4, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Rev. J. D. Gilbert, of the Methodist church.
    
     BEAVER LAKE LANDS.
     On motion by Mr. DARRACH his bill [H. R. 89] in relation to Beaver Lake Newton county lands,
      was read the third time.
     Mr. DUNN [after giving the history of the title to these lands and the ditching of the
      lake]: In 1857 Mr. Michael G. Bright platted the lake, placed it on record, and claimed the
      land belonged to him. He was security on a bond to the State for $2,600. He proposed the STate
      take one-half of these lands and release him. The State accepted that proposition, so 
       acknowledging
       acknowleding
       that Bright's title was good. The State sold these lands on the title she took
      from Bright, and has seen fit to accept taxes from these lands for 20 or 25 years; thus making
      a continuing acknowledgement that the title was good. By a decision of the Supreme Court they
      wake up to find they have no title to these lands. He favored the passage of the bill which
      authorizes a sale of these lands to the owners for 37½ cents per acre.
     Mr. PATTON: No decision affects the title of the Government to these lands, therefore
      holders of this riparian strip cut no figure in the body of the lake.
     Mr. VAN SLYKE: People who went upon these lands in good faith, raised families and paid
      taxes are now told they have no right to them! Why, such an outrage can hardly be conceived
      of.
     Mr. ROBERTS: There can be no dispute but in 1850 the United States granted these lands to
      the State of Indiana. Condit and Bright bought the tract bordering the lake under the swamp
      land act. In no place is it laid down that in a case of that kind  the doctrine or riparian rights extends the body of the lake. Those
      who took under Bright were bound to know that under the law they took no title to the body of
      the lake. The State accepted his proposition as a dernier resort. Persons have taken
      possession of a portion of these lands. Ninety-five per cent. of them are owned by syndicates
      in Chicago that have made vast fortunes by herding cattle on them, without paying one cent of
      rent-money except a light tax. The syndicates now here were before Congress, which almost
      unanimously decided the title was in the State of Indiana. They seek to defraud the State out 
       of
       ef
       $40,000 by this bill. It is nothing but a bare-faced fraud.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     Mr. MOCK: The questions involved in this case have been settled in the Supreme Court. There
      is no equity in this bill, and there certainly is no legal right.
     Mr. ACKMAN: If these lands belonged to the State by virtue of the swamp land act, why did
      she buy or take them in settlement of a claim? The bill ought to pass.
     Mr. BUCKLES: If I stand by and see you buy my land I am estopped. The same rule ought to
      apply to the State. She stands by and makes no effort to assert her claim, but goes to them
      and says: "Here, you own these lands, now pay me the tax they same as other people pay on
      their lands in the State of Indiana." Is not that a recognition of their title?
     The bill passed by yeas 66, nays 16.
    
    
     EXTRA EMPLOYES AND EXTRA PAY.
     On motion by Mr. SUNMAN, Thomas Green was allowed extra pay for running the elevator.
     Mr. CONGER offered the following:
     
      
       
        Resolved, That W. C. David, Journal Clerk, Z. Hunt, Minute Clerk, and C. S. Wiltse, File
         Clerk, be allowed fifty dollars each for extra services during this session, and the
         Speaker is hereby authorized to draw his warrants therefor.
       
      
     
     It was adopted.
     Mr. SINCLAIR, from the Committee thereon, submitted a report on the affairs of the Southern
      Penitentiary. [It covers thirteen printed pages of the House Journal.]
    
    
     SENATE BILLS PASSED BY THE SPEAKER.
      The SPEAKER: The Speaker has signed enrolled Senate acts 5, 9, 11, 13, 18, 26, 45, 75, 102, 108, 111, 127, 152, 191, 198, 208, 217, 242 and 293. And he will state further that they have been enrolled by the enrolling force of
      the House of Representatives. I have signed the bills, and will have them transmitted to the
      Governor and he can do with them as he likes.
     The House adjourned.
    
   
   
   
    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    IN SENATE.
    
     SATURDAY, March 5, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Rev. Aug. Bessoines, of the Roman Catholic Church.
    
     A MESSAGE FROM THE GOVERNOR
     Announced the appointment of Dr. James S. Shively, [a Senator from the counties of Grant and
      Madison] as a member of the State Board of Health, for four years, from February 28, 1887.
     On motion by Mr. 
       WEIR
       WIER
       the appointment was confirmed.
     The Executive Messenger [Pierre Gray] also read the following:
     
      
       
        To the Honorable, the President of the Senate:--By the direction of the Governor I have
         the honor to transmit herewith Senate bills Nos. 5,
          9, 11, 13, 18, 26, 45, 75, 102, 108, 111, 127, 152, 191, 198, 208, 217, 242 and 293
         received by the Governor from the House of Representatives through the chairman of its
          Committee on Enrolled Bills, each signed Warren G. Sayre, Speaker of
         the House of Representatives, and said bills are herewith transmitted for the signatures of
         the proper officers of the Senate.
       
      
     
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: Will the Secretary answer the Chair a question? Does the Secretary
      know whether these bills are properly correct or not?
     The MESSENGER: No sir.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: The engrossed bills these bills purport to be engrossed from are not
      in our possession, and I will ask the Chairman of the Committee on Enrolled
       Bills [Mr. Fowler] to take charge of these bills and assist the chair making such
      examination as he may be able to do.
     Mr. FOWLER: I will be glad do so and render any aid I can, but I don't know how the
      Committee of the President can arrive at anu satisfactory conclusion that the bills are
      correct unless we have the engrossed bills to compare them with.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: Will the Secretary of the Governor state to the Governor that to the
      end we may not be imposed upon by these bills, and before I sign them, if the Governor can
      consistently do so, to ask the Speaker of the House of Representatives to return to us the
      engrossed bills that we may compare them here?
     The MESSENGER: I will, Mr. President.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: It is a matter of great importance we should know that these bills
      are just as we passed them.
     Mr. FOWLER [some time afterward]: I give notice to Senators who are authors of these bills
      that unless they meet with the Committee I will not
      examine their bills.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: The chair requires that each Senator who examines his own bill shall
      sign the report jointly with the Chairman on Enrolled Bills, and unless that is done the Chair
      will not sign the bill. I suggest that the Chairman call a meeting in the cloak room.
    
    
     LIQUOR LICENSE.
     Mr. SELLERS: I insist upon the Senate taking up House Bill 20. [It was read the second
      time.] I move the constitutional rule be suspended that the bill may be read the third time
      now and put upon its passage.
     The motion was rejected--two-thirds not voting in the affirmative--by yeas 25, nays 4;
      refusing to vote 10.
     Pending the roll call--
     Mr. BAILEY said: I will vote for suspension of the rules, but I am against the bill, and
      will vote against it on its passage.
     Mr. FOWLER explaining his vote: I am opposed to the bill for several reasons. The chief
      reason is I have been opposed to monopolies of every character all my life, and at this late
      day am not going to cast my vote to create a monopoly in whiskey. I shall not vote to favor
      this bill in any measure. I vote "no."
     Mr. HOWARD of St. Joseph, when his name was called, said Some portions of this bill I am in
      favor of, and some I am not. I vote "aye."
     Mr. MCDONALD, when called upon to vote, said: For the reason given by
      Senator Howard I vote "aye."
     Mr. RAHM, in explanation of his vote, said: I don't believe in this bill, and inasmuch
      as the Republicans are ashamed to vote for it or take it up, I will vote "no."
     Mr. SCHLOSS said, when answering to his name: For reasons already sated, though there are
      some provisions in this bill I would vote for; therefore I vote "no."
     Mr. TRIPPETT [explaining]: I am opposed to this bill on principle and every other way
      imaginable. I vote to suspend the constitutional rule only to get a chance to vote against it
      when it comes up on its passage. I vote "aye."
     Mr. 
       WEIR
       WIER
      , explaining, said: I am opposed to this bill in its present form, and I will not
      vote to suspend the rules on a bill that I will not vote for on its passage. I vote
      "no."
     Mr. ZIMMERMAN, when his name was called, said: I am opposed to any increase in the liquor
      license. I believe the present law is a sufficient restriction on the liquor traffic if
      enforced. I vote consistently, therefore I vote "aye."
     Mr. BARRET, when his name was again called, said: I am thoroughly opposed to this bill, but
      if there are Senators who desire to take it up and discuss it, I am willing; and for that
      reason vote "aye."
     The PRESIDENT pro tem, in explanation of his vote, said: I am not very familiar with the
      provisions of this bill with the exception of one perhaps, and that is the local option
      feature. As to that provision, I would be opposed to it at all times and under all
      circumstances; but the bill might be discussed and amended, and to the end that a reasonable
      increase in the liquor license might be engrafted upon this bill and it become an additional
      law, according to the demands of the people in both political parties; and for the purpose of
      having it taken up and considered that those who have promised great reforms in this direction
      may have an opportunity to show their good faith, I will vote to take the bill up. I vote
      "aye."
     Mr. MULLINIX: I vote not to excuse those present and not voting.
     Mr. MCDONALD: I now move that those refusing to vote be recalled.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: The Clerk will direct the re-calling of Senators who has not voted,
      if the Senator thinks it necessary.
     Mr. MCDONALD: I insist on it.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: The Clerk will re-call the names of those present and not voting.
     The motion not to excuse them was agreed to.
     
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the motion to suspend the rules was rejected.
    
    
     BILLS PASSED.
     On motion by Mr. RAHM his bill [S. 61] to appropriate $90,000 for the maintaince of the
      three new insane asylums was taken up and passed by yeas 26, nays 0; present and not voting
      10.
     On motion by Mr. FOWLER Senators present and refusing to vote were not excused. On his
      further motion the mechanics lien bill [H. R. 293] was also passed by yeas 30, nays 0;
      refusing to vote 13.
    
    
     A MESSAGE FROM THE GOVERNOR
     Was announced and read by the Executive Messenger, to wit:
     
      
       
        To the Honorable the President of the Senate:--By the direction of the Governor I have
         the honor to inform the Senate that a message has been transmitted to the House of
         Representatives requesting the House of Representatives to transmit to the Governor, Senate
         Engrossed Bills Nos. 5, 9, 11, 13, 18, 26, 45, 75, 102, 108, 111, 127, 152, 191, 198, 208, 217, 242 and 293, to
         be transmitted to the Senate with Senate Engrossed Bills numbered as aforesaid, for
         comparison, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives has informed the Governor that
         the request will not be complied with.
        
         PIERRE GRAY,
         Private Secretary.
       
      
     
    
    
     DOUGLAS V5. M'CLURE.
     Mr. BAILEY presented the following:
     Mr. PRESIDENT:--Your Committee on Elections, having
      under consideration the matter of the contested election case wherein Laurent Douglas,
      contestor, contests and denies the election of David McClure, contestee, as State Senator from
      the counties of Clarke and Jefferson, in the State of Indiana, at the general election held on
      the 2d day of November, 1886, would respectfully report that they find in favor of said David
      McClure and against the truth of the charges of said Douglas filed in said cause: that said
      charges are wholly unsupported by the affidavits and depositions before them.
     Your committee would therefore recommend that said cause of contest be indefinitely
      postponed.
     The report was concurred in.
     Mr. BAILEY: I move the vote by which the report was concurred in be reconsidered and that
      motion be laid on the table.
     The latter motion was agreed to.
    
    
     DOORKEEPERS PAY.
     Mr. BAILEY offered a resolution, which was adopted, that the doorkeeper furnish a list of
      assistants employed by him, and directing Senate warrants to be drawn for each at a per diem
      of five dollars.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: Will some Senator do me the kindness to call up House Bill 323
      concerning voluntary associations? Friends of mine, distinguished and honorable gentlemen, say
      it is important to have this law changed.
     Mr. SELLERS: I will call it up.
     A The PRESIDENT pro tem: The Senate will call up House Bill 323.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     HOUSE BILLS PASSED.
     Mr. 
       WEIR
       WIER
       called up the bill [H. R. 289] to protect residents of Indian from garnishment of
      their pay in other States. It passed by yeas 26, nays, 4; present and not voting 16.
     Mr. FOWLER saying: On the Senator from Laporte's [Mr. 
       Weir
       Wier
      ] statement of the bill I vote "aye."
     Mr. HOWARD, of Decatur: I prefer not to vote for this bill. I never saw it, never heard of
      it, and know knowing about it. I vote "aye."
     The bill [H. R. 323] to amend the act for the incorporation of mining and manufacturing
      companies so as to provide for the issue of preferred stock in certain cases; [The bill is
      intended particularly to enable the Madison Woolen Mills to hold a meeting immediately for
      re-organization instead of waiting until next January.] was and passed by yeas 30, nays 1;
      present and not voting 16.
     Mr. 
       WEIR
       WIER
      : I think this bill ought to be explained, as the Chair has desired it to be taken
      up.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: It is concerning manufacturing associations. It is a just measure.
      Citizens of the city of Madison have asked me to use some effort to get the bill up.
     Mr. BAILEY, when called upon to vote: Is this a temperance bill?
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: Oh, no. If you don't want to vote on it, I will discontinue the
      roll call.
     
     The bill passed by yeas 30, nays 1; refusing to vote 16.
    
    
     LIQUOR LICENSE.
     Mr. SELLERS called up his liquor license bill [S. 334}. This bill would require every person
      who deals in intoxicating liquors to take out a license, which it increases from $100 to $200.
      Under the law as it now stands the license fee goes into the school fund. Under this bill $100
      would go into the school fund, the other $100 into the the general fund when in the country,
      but if in a city or town it goes into a fund for the improvement of streets or alleys, or
      public grounds. Some are of the opinion the fee ought to be $500. I think doubling it is
      sufficient for the present. Let us test that, and see if that increase will not decrease the
      doggeries.
     Mr. WEIR: I am opposed to any increase in the license fee. I know no reason why drug stores
      that keep a little liquor on hand for medicinal purposes should be compelled to pay $200
      license fee for that privilege, when perhaps many of them would not sell $200 worth in a
      year.
     The bill failed to pass for want of a constitutional majority--yeas 18, nays 11; refusing to
      vote 15.
     Pending the roll call--
     Mr. BAILEY said: If the Republicans in the other branch of this General Assembly had been
      true to their constituency and their oaths, the passage of a reasonable license law might have
      been consummated at this session. But this bill has many unreasonable features in it, and for
      that reason I vote "no."
     Mr. MCDONALD, when his name was called, said: I do not know anything
      about this bill, so I will vote "no."
     Mr. MULLINIX, when called upon to vote, said: House Bill No. 20 called up this morning
      providing for high license and local option is a bill I am in favor of, and I have been
      informed by all these paralyzed Republicans on my right, when that bill came up they would
      support it. We went on this floor and secured enough Democratic members, so if they had voted
      for that bill it would have become a law. I want it known to the people of the State of
      Indiana that the reason House Bill No. 20 did not pass was because these gentlemen failed to
      come up to their promises. This bill doesn't meet my approbation, but it is in the right
      direction, therefore I vote "aye."
     Mr. SMITH, of Wells, when answering to his name, said: I really don't know how to vote
      on this bill. I guess I'll vote "aye."
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion, in explanation of his vote, said: I sometimes think it is of
      doubtful propriety to make liquor too hard to get. I think if we had a little in here to give
      to these silent Republicans they would take it [laughter.] There is evidently a demand on the
      part of the public for high license, and I am sorry the House of Representatives became
      unfriendly with us; but as there is no hope from that quarter; not a particle; I will take the
      best there is; therefore I vote "aye."
     Mr. ZIMMERMAN, when his name was called, said: I have already stated that I am not in favor
      of any increase in the liquor license fee. The license imposed upon the liquor dealers in this
      State is already high, and to increase it would make it oppressive. The liquor men in this
      State have rights the same as other people, and these rights ought to be respected by the
      legislature. I vote "no."
     Mr. THARP, asking that his name be again called, said: If I had any idea of this bill
      becoming a law I would have made an effort to amend it, but I don't apprehend any such
      calamity. My sentiments are in favor of an increase of license, but this bill seems to be
      wrong in some particulars, and right in others. I shall vote "aye."
     Mr. MCCLURE, demanding that his name be called again, said: I vote
      "no." I change my vote.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: Hear the vote: Ayes 30, nays 10.
     Mr. 
       WEIR
       WIER
      : I ask that the roll be called for verification.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: The Clerk will read over the ayes and  noes for the purpose of verification.
     Mr. 
       WEIR
       WIER
      : I call the attention of the Senate to the fact that there are a large number of
      members who have not voted, who are recorded as voting.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: It is not the Senator's business to call the attention of the
      Senate to it. They are in their seats, and if they want to call the attention of the Chair to
      it they may do it.
     Mr. DEMOTTE, [when his name was read by the Clerk as having voted]: I say
      to the public and not to the Chair, as I do not recognize him, I did not vote.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: The doorkeeper will put the Senator in his seat if he does not behave
      himself.
     The vote was announced as above--yeas 18, nays 11, refusing to vote 15.
     So the bill failed to pass for want of an affirmative vote of a majority of all the members
      elected.
    
    
     ARE SENATE BILLS CORRECTLY ENROLLED?
     Mr. FOWLER [Chairman of the Committee on Enrolled Bills,] submitted the
      following:
     Mr. PRESIDENT:--Your Joint Committee on Enrolled Bills
      would make the following report and statement of facts upon Senate Enrolled Acts Nos. 5, 9, 11, 13, 18, 26, 45, 75, 102, 108, 111, 127, 152, 191, 198, 208, 217, 242 and 293, which were sent by the Speaker of the House to the
      Governor instead of transmitting them to the Senate in order that said acts might be compared
      with Engrossed Bills and amendments, if any: That said Enrolled Acts were transmitted by the
      Governor to the Senate for the signature of Hon. Alonzo G. Smith, President of the Senate, and
      at the request of the Senate the Governor transmitted to the Speaker of the House a message
      asking the engrossed bills and engrossed amendments, if any, to said bills that he might
      transmit to the Committee on Enrolled Bills in the Senate such engrossed
      bills and engrossed amendments, if any, but that the Speaker of the House refused to deliver
      or transmit such bills and amendments to the Governor. Your committee, therefore, has not the
      evidence, and can not obtain such evidence, to determine whether said bills are correctly
      enrolled or not, and we therefore return the same to the Senate with a recommendation that the
      President of the Senate sign such bills only as the authors of the same can satisfy such
      President as being correctly enrolled.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: If there is no objection the report will be concurred in and spread
      upon the Journal.
     Mr. SCHLOSS presented the following:
     Mr. PRESIDENT:--Senate bill No. 13 is correct. Senator Bryant and myself
      compared it. Please sign.
     Mr. SEARS presented the following:
     Mr. PRESIDENT:--I have examined enrolled Senate bill No. 152, and hereby
      certify that the same has been correctly enrolled as returned to the Senate.
     
      R. B. SEARS.
     
    
    
     A RECESS OF TEN MINUTES.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: By a motion adopted before noon the freedom of the Senate chamber was
      given to the teachers now attending a Joint Institute of Teachers in session in this city. The 
       Chair
       Chiar
       has been unofficially informed that these persons are present, and they shall have,
      out of respect to their profession, the freedom of the floor for ten minutes.
    
    
     SERVICE-PENSION LAW.
     Mr. MCDONALD called up his resolution to witt:
     
      
       
        Resolved, That it is the sense of this Senate that at the proper time the Congress of the
         United States should pass a proper and well-defined "service-pension law,"one
         that will do equal and exact justice to every good and faithful soldier, who, at a certain
         age, shall be in any way incapacitated in whole or in part from personal support. That such
         law should be in the interests of the really worthy soldiers who are deserving of such
         service-pensions. That such a proper law will meet the full approbation of this Senate.
       
      
     
     He said: I think it my duty as Chairman of the Military Committee of the
      Senate to thank the Senate as we are about to separate, for its kindness to the Soldier
      element of this State. I find the Soldiers' Monument bill passed a Democratic Senate by a
      unanimous vote. The bill separating the feeble-minded children from our orphans, was passed by
      an almost unanimous vote; and you passed thet Soldiers' Orphan's Asylum bill
      practically without opposition. Now I take it upon myself to introduce this resolution. To
      every man who has been a good soldier, and is blind or insane at a certain age, or otherwise
      incapacitated from supporting himself, a proper pension should be  granted. I am not in favor of granting pensions indiscriminately to
      anybody. I do hope no Senator will vote against this resolution.
     Mr. ZIMMERMAN offered the following as an amendment to the resolution:
     
      
       
        Resolved, That the pension laws of the United States should be so amended that rank and
         title should not be taken into consideration in granting pensions, and that in granting
         pensions all soldiers should be equal and share alike; that the only distinction made
         should be in grading disability, and not rank.
       
      
     
     He said: Some months ago the Grand Army Post of Rochester, Ind., unanimously adopted a
      resolution of a similar character to this, notwithstanding that a considerable number of its
      members served as officers in the late civil war. If ever a resolution was offered on this
      floor which is in perfect harmony and accord with the true spirit of our form of government
      this one is. It represents, to my mind, the most vital and essential features of free and
      popular government, namely, justice and equality before the law.
     Our present pension laws are framed in iniquity, and therefore Congress is directly
      chargeable with class legislation of the worst character. Why should an officer, having lost a
      leg or an arm, or having received bodily injuries otherwise, be entitled to ten and twenty
      times the amount of pension the private soldier who has sustained like injuries? Why should
      the rich widow of an officer receive from $3,000 to $5,000 per annum, while the poor and needy
      widow of the private soldier receives the beggarly sum of $144? Why should the claim of the
      dependent widow and mother of the private soldier be less sacred and less binding upon the
      Government than the claim of the dependent widow and mother of the officer? I ask, Mr.
      President, why this unjust discrimination before the law in allowing pensions?
     Officer and private entered the army with one common object in view--to save the Union, to
      bring it about that this country should be one people, having one flag; that there should be
      no distinction, no class, no one rewarded above another, but that all should share equally and
      alike in the glory of a common country. True, during the service the officer was charged with
      greater responsibility than the private, but for it he received greater pay; and he was thus
      enabled to secure for himself such comforts and extras as were denied the private soldier.
      Whilst the private soldier subsisted on pork and beans, the officer--and, especially he of a
      higher rank--partook not infrequently of the luxuries of civil life.
     But when the war was over, and the boys in blue returned to their homes again, officers and
      privates alike were relegated to their usual walks of private life. Then the struggles and
      hardships of warfare, and the dangers and responsibilites connected therewith, were
      practically ended. And now the officer must stand, not above, but equal with the private
      soldier.
     It was contemplated by the founders of our form of government that rank and title should not
      exist among our people in civil life, and it is sad indeed for the American people to know
      that strong symptoms of aristocracy have crept into our system of government. It is
      humiliating for the American people to know that the despicable relic of imperial laws are
      from time to time incorporated into the laws of our country.
     Our present pension laws have a sure tendency to strike cold every impulse of patriotic
      aspirations, and I fear, should the country approach another crisis and the alarm be sounded
      again, the more patriotic and intelligent portion of our citizens will refuse to heed the
      call. Mr. President, I move the adoption of the amendment to the resolution.
     Mr. HOWARD of St. Joseph: I concur in both the amendment and the original resolution. The
      act relating to Mexican Soldiers, I understand, makes no distinction between officers or the
      rank and file. The time has come when there should be pensions for disability at a proper age
      and under proper circumstances.  It is evident and clear
      that pensions should be granted such soldiers as are in need, and incapacitated from taking
      care of themselves. I don't think there is any citizen of the United States who would be
      unwilling to pension such a soldier. I am heartily for the resolution and for the
      amendment.
     The amendment (Mr. Zimmerman's) was agreed to.
     The resolution as amended was adopted.
    
    
     ARE SENATE BILLS CORRECTLY ENROLLED?
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: The Chair at this time desires to announce that certain engrossed
      bills which passed this body were properly, legally, and in a constitutional way transferred
      by the officers of this body to the House of Representatives. There they were acted upon and
      passed as the chair is unofficially informed. The House of Representatives, through its
      organization and Speaker, declined to reutrn the engrossed bills to the Senate, when, under
      all the rules and usages of such bodies, these bills should have been engrossed. The
      originated in the Senate; they should have been enrolled under the supervision of Senate
      officers and Senate enrolling committees. That was denied this House by the arbitary,
      revolutionary and unconstitutional acts and conduct of the Speaker of the House of
      Representatives and its organization. These bills purport to have been enrolled in the House
      of Representatives by the Enrolling Committee and clerks there and
      transferred. signed by the Speaker to the Governor of Indiana, and by the Governor they were
      transferred, accompanied by a proper message to this body. I submit them, as the President of
      the Senate, although many cannot be identified because the engrossed bills are not in the
      possession of the Senate, and in possession has been denied the Governor and Senate when he
      made proper application for them. Having come to the Senate in the manner that they have, as I
      regard it, in the unlawful and unconstitutional circuit that they were compelled to travel to
      get here, still certain of them have been recognized, and the fact is made known that they
      have been passed by the constitutional majority by both Senate and House. Therefore, I
      concluded that the revolutionary acts and conduct of the Speaker of the House of
      Representatives can not and will not be permitted to defeat the operation of law once duly
      passed because they desired to have no further communication with this body. These measures
      thus recognized as being the identical ones transferred to the House, thence to the Governor
      and then to the Senate have been signed by the presiding officer of this body. Among them is
      the bill to establish a school for the Feeble-Minded children. I now make public announcement
      of the fact that as President of the Senate I have signed Enrolled Senate Bills Nos. 5, 9, 13, 75, 18, 102, 108, 127,208 and 152, and the
      record will show these facts. There are others of the same class upon my table. Should I find
      them to be correct, should I find the substance to be the same as of those that were engrossed
      in this body, I shall also sign them, and if there is a mistake growing out of this action in
      the enactment of these bills I want to distinctly announce that that mistake, however grevious
      it may be, however dangerous it may be, shall rest, with all its injurious results on the head
      of the revoluntary branch at the other end of this Capitol.
    
    
     STENOGRAPHER OF THE SENATE.
     Mr. MCDONALD offered the following:
     
      
       
        Resolved, That William H. Drapier be and he is hereby elected stenographer the Senate,
         and instead 
          of
          ot
          a per diem he be allowed for the same number of copies of the Brevier Legislative
         Reports of the present General Assembly, at the same price as has been paid by the State
         for said report since 1867, and for years before, under resolutions and acts in exact and
         identical words as to the price and number of copies, and the President of the Senate is
         hereby directed to issue his warrant 
          therefor
          rherefor
         , as in case of other officers of the Senate. The Bureau of Printing is directed
         to have said Reports bound as heretofore by the 
         State, and said Stenographer is directed to forward ten copies to each member of the
         General Assembly.
       
      
     
     Mr. THARP: I shall not vote for that resolution unless I know how much money is to be paid
      under it. We ought to take intelligent action on this matter, and let that resolution to a
      committee.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: The Chair has been informed that there are a number of persons from
      the Deaf and Dumb Institute, either teachers or students, and in order that they may have an
      opportunity to give an exhibition lesson in the lanugage of the mutes on the floor of the
      Senate, the Senate will be at ease for a few minutes.
     The Senate adjourned.
    
   
   
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
    
     SATURDAY, March 5, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with prayer by Hon. Wiley F. Ackman, a Representative from the county
     of Hancock.
    
     MESSAGES FROM THE GOVERNOR
     Were announced to wit:
     
      
       
        EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT. Indianapolis March 5, 1887.
        
         To the Honorable, the Speaker of the House of Representatives:
        
        Senate Enrolled Bills Nos. 5, 9, 11, 13, 18, 26, 45, 75, 102, 108, 111, 127, 152, 191, 198, 208, 217, 242 and 293 have
         been received by me from the House of Representatives through the Chairman of the
          Committee on Enrolled Bills, each signed Warren G. Sayre, Speaker of
         the House of Representatives, and said bills have been transmitted to the Senate for the
         signature of the President of the Senate and the Secretary thereof.
        I would earnestly recommend the immediate passage by the House of the Loan bill and the
         Appropriation bills, appropriating money for the support of the State Government and its
         several institutions, and if delivered at the executive office, will be by me transmitted
         to the Senate for its action thereon.
        
         ISAAC P. GRAY,
         Governor. 
       
      
     
     
      
       
        EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT. Indianapolis March 5, 1887.
        
         To the Honorable, the Speaker of the House of Representatives:
        
        I respectfully request that you transmit to this office at once the Engrossed Bills,
         numbered 5, 9, 11, 13, 18, 26, 45, 75, 102, 108, 111, 127, 152, 191, 198, 208, 217, 242 and 293, in order that they may be
         transmitted to the Senate with the Enrolled Bills for the purpose of comparison.
        
         ISAAC P. GRAY,
         Governor. 
       
      
     
     The SPEAKER: The Secretary may inform the Governor that the request will not be complied
      with.
     Mr. JEWETT: Mr. Speaker, I move that the Governor's 
       request
       reouest
       be complied with.
     The SPEAKER: The motion is out of order. It is contrary to the orders of this House to
      receive communications from the Senate, even if they do come through the Governor.
     Mr. JEWETT: I appeal from that decision.
     The SPEAKER: There is nothing to appeal from, and the appeal will not be entertained.
     Mr. JEWETT: Then, Mr. Speaker, I desire to enter a formal protest.
     The SPEAKER: The gentleman from Floyd will prepare his protest, and it will be received.
     On motion by Mr. VAN SLYKE it was ordered--yeas 51, nays 34--that when the House adjourn it
      be to meet at 11 o'clock on Monday morning.
     Mr. CONGER, from the Select Committee appointed to consider the claim of
      the State House contractor, for reinbursement for losses sustained by him as contractor,
      submitted a report without recommendation.
     The House adjourned till Monday.
    
   
   
   
    THE BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
    VOLUME TWENTY-FOUR.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    IN SENATE.
    
     MONDAY, March 7, 1887.
    
    The session was opened with a prayer by Hon. J. H. C. SMITH, a Senator
     from the counties of Wells and Huntington.
    The Secretary's minutes of the proceedings were read through for the first time this
     session.
    Mr. SHIVELY introduced a bill [S. 340] to prevent gambling in stocks, bonds and petroleum,
     cotton, grain, provisions, and other produce.
    
     SOUTHERN PRISON DIRECTORS.
     Mr. WEIR called up the special order, being his resolution calling upon the directors of the
      Southern Prison to resign, the question being on the additional resolution offered by way of
      amendment. [See pages 584 and 585 of this book.]
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Take up the resolution and read it.
     Mr. WEIR: I have been shown a dispatch this morning saying these directors do not intend to
      do anything of the kind.
     Mr. SELLERS: I hope the amendment will not be adopted. These gentlemen are criminally
      responsible, or ought to be, because of a failure to discharge their duties to the public. I
      am not in favor of qualifying this resolution; it should be an unqualified demand upon these
      gentlemen to resign.
     The amendment was rejected.
     The resolution was adopted.
    
    
     A MESSAGE FROM THE GOVERNOR
     Announced his appointment of Dr. SAMUEL S. BOOTS, of
      Hancock county, a member of the State Board of Health for four years from February 28, 1887,
      to succeed himself.
     On motion by Mr. WEIR, the appointment was confirmed.
     Subsequently another message from the Governor announced his appointment of Mr. JOHN M. TAYLOR, of Montgomery county, a member of the State
      Board of Health, in place of Hon. James S. Shively, declined, to serve four years from
      February 28, 1887.

     On motion by Mr. HOWARD, of Decatur, the appointment was confirmed.
    
    
     INSANE HOSPITAL INVESTIGATION.
     Mr. FRENCH, from the special committee thereon, submitted a lengthy report on the management
      of the Insane Hospital. [It makes twelve pages of the Senate Journal in much smaller type than
      is usually used in that book.]
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The question is on concurring in the report of the committee.
     
     Mr. MCDONALD: This report is just what I thought it would be; and think,
      in justice to the officers of that institution, in justice to this Senate and in justice to
      the people of the State of Indiana, that report ought to be fully endorsed by the Senate. I
      believe the charges against that institution were made for political effect and nothing more.
      And I believe it to be one of the most diabolical outrages ever perpetrated upon any
      institution in Indiana. The testimony shows it; fully shows it.
     Mr. FRENCH: In the light of the evidence, covering over twelve hundred pages, every
      statement in that report is borne out by the facts in the case, and we are proud to be able to
      report that this institution, one of the largest of its kind in the world, is one of the best
      managed of its kind in the world. All these statements made against it were for campaign
      purposes. We are willing our report shall be scrutinized in the light of the testimony, which
      will prove all these charges false. We so find in our report, and are willing to submit it to
      the people of Indiana that they may see whether we have not stated the truth and the whole
      truth, in regard to this institution. I hope the report will be unanimously adopted.
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion: I am more than delighted at that report.--I have been acquainted
      with the Superintendent since he was a boy, have known him from his youth up, and have always
      looked upon him as incapable of doing wrong, and it rejoices me more and more when I see him
      fully exonorated from the charges made during the canvass. It is terrible that parties yield
      themselves up to falsifying. I would not lie for my party. I would not lie on my neighbor. The
      Senator from Fayette is a man I highly, esteem, and never knew him to do anything wrong till
      latterly when he came into the Senate with his seventeen brethren who became paralyzed--their
      tongues refused to speak; except one--the Senator from Porter, (Mr. DeMotte.) The Senator from
      Porter did rise from his seat and, like a man, spoke out. [See page 594 of this book.] I give
      him my hand; you are an honest, upright and honorable man. [Laughter.]
     The report was concurred in.
     Mr. THOMPSON, of Marion: I understand that silence gives consent; so the eighteen members
      not participating should be regarded as consenting.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: They are standing by the report.
     Mr. URMSTON moved that one thousand copies be printed with the evidence.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The report will be spread on the journal.
    
    
     CLOSING COURTESIES.
     Mr. BAILEY [Mr. SELLERS in the chair] offered the following:
     
      
       
        Resolved by the Senate of Indiana, That we, at this time, desire to express our high
         esteem for the Honorable Alonzo G. Smith, President of this Senate, and to record our
         warmest and most unqualified approval of our admiration for the faithful, intelligent,
         courageous and impartial manner in which he has performed the arduous duties of the
         important office during the present session. The manly and determined attitude which he has
         uniformly taken against all would-be invaders of the Constitution and the people's
         rights, especially meets with our approbation.
        The thanks of the members of the Senate are due and hereby tendered to the said Honorable
         Alonzo G. Smith for the courteous and impartial treatment which they have personally
         received at his hands.
       
      
     
     It was adopted.
     Mr. ZIMMERMAN offered the following:
     
      
       
        Resolved, That the thanks of this Senate are due the Democratic press of Indiana in
         gallantly and vigorously sustaining the patriotic and determined efforts of the majority of
         the people's chosen representatives of the Fifty-fifth General assembly in preventing
         political corruptionists from stealing the United States Senatorship, and more particularly
         in upholding the little heroic band of thirty-two Senators in their firmness and devotion
         to long cherished principles, and maintaining intact the lawful organization of the
         Senate.
       
      
     
     It was adopted.
    
    
     SOUTHERN PRISON OFFICERS.
     Mr. SCHLOSS offered the following:
     
      
       
        Mr. President:--Resolved by the Senate, the House concurring, That it is the sense of the
         Senate and the House that the Attorney General should aid the legal author ities of Clark county, Indiana, in prosecuting and bringing to
         justice any officers or employes of the Penitentiary South charged with violation of the
         criminal laws of the State.
       
      
     
     It was adopted.
    
    
     PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE--ELECTION.
     Mr. WEIR offered the following:
     
      
       
        Whereas, The Hon. A. G. Smith, Senator from the county of Jennings, is now President pro
         tempore, and his term of office will expire previous to the meeting of the next regular
         session of the General Assembly; therefore,
        Resolved, That the Senate do now proceed to the election of a President pro tempore of
         the Senate, selecting a Senator who holds over and whose term of office will continue until
         after the meeting of the next regular session of the General Assembly.
        Resolved, That James F. Cox, Senator from the counties of Morgan, Johnson and Brown, be
         and he is hereby elected President pro tempore of this Senate.
       
      
     
     Mr. BAILEY: The election of a President pro tempore may involve some serious matters. As far
      as the distinguished gentleman named is concerned it meets my hearty approbation, but I think
      it involves some questions that ought not to be jumped at hastily and hurriedly, and I think
      the wiser plan would be to refer these resolutions to a committee of five which might consider
      the legal aspects and bearings such resolutions might have. I therefore make that motion.
     Mr. WEIR: If the Senator will examine the journal of 1883 he will find there was a
      resolution of this kind offered and there was an ineffectual motion made to insert the name of
      Senator Willard, but the original resolution with Mr. Magee's name in it was adopted
      after voting down a motion to postpone the resolution till the afternoon session. [See Brevier
      Legislative Reports, volume twenty-one page 292.] I insist there is no use in referring this
      to a special committee.
     Mr. MCDONALD: I think this matter can be adjusted. There were different
      circumstances existing at the time the resolution was adopted that my distinguished friend
      speaks of.
     Mr. WEIR: Amend to report at three o'clock and I will accept the amendment.
     Mr. DAY. I move to lay the resolution and amendment on the table.
     The Senate took a recess till three o'clock.
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     CONTESTED ELECTION CASES.
     Mr. WEIR introduced the following:
     
      
       
        Resolved, That the contests now pending of the seats of sitting Senators, Simon P.
         Thompson, Senator from Jasper county, and Archibald Kennedy, senator from Rush county, be
         indefinitely postponed.
       
      
     
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The resolution is referred to the Committee on
       Elections.
    
    
     VOLUNTEER MILITIA CLAIMS.
     Mr. SCHLOSS moved the adoption of the following House concurrent resolution (Mr.
      Linck's):
     
      
       
        Whereas, This General Assembly, at a previous session, appropriated certain sums of money
         for the payment of claims of volunteers, minute men, Indiana Legion and militia that had
         been called into service by the Governor of the State; and
        Whereas, There is no way provided by which said claims can be accurately ascertained,
         computed and audited; be it therefore
        Resolved by the House of Representatives, the Senate concurring, That the Governor, or
         his Secretary acting for him, the Auditor or his deputy acting for him, the Attorney
         General or his assistant acting for him and the Adjutant General be and they are hereby
         appointed a commission to proceed to the county seats of the counties in which the
         aforesaid volunteers, minute men, Indiana Legion and militia were raised and mustered, to
         hear testimony as to the actual service performed by said claimants, and audit, compute and
         allow to said claimants such sums as they are entitled to under the law for actual service
         performed, and that the actual and necessary expenses of said commissioners in regard to
         said matter be paid out of the appropriation before mentioned.
       
      
     
     It was adopted.
    
    
     THE ASSAULT ON THE SENATE CHAMBER.
     Mr. BAILEY introduced the following:
     
      
       
        Whereas, On the 24h day of February, 1887, a mob of rioters and law-breakers, headed and
         aided by certain Republican State officers of Indiana and other men prominent in the
         councils of the Republican party, did unlawfully attack the doors of the Senate chamber of
         Indiana, and attempt by force to break them down; and
        Whereas, They were only repelled in their cowardly assault by the courageous resistance
         of Frank Pritchett, Doorkeeper, and his able corps of assistants; and
        
        Whereas, The spirit mob violence was fully participated in by certain Republican Senators
         on this floor; and
        Whereas, Such Senators, forgetting their dignity and manhood, did join with the aforesaid
         rioters in a brutal and cowardly personal assault upon the veteran Union soldier and
         Senator, Colonel I B. McDonald, who was exercising every effort to quell the disturbance
         and avert serious trouble, in which effort he was joined by several of his Democratic
         colleagues; therefore, be it
        Resolved, That this Senate desires to commend and approve the prudent and manly course of
         the said McDonald on said occasion and to denounce and condemn the conduct of all persons
         participating in the disgraceful and riotous attack so wantonly made upon the Senate of
         Indiana and against the peace and dignity or the State.
       
      
     
     It was adopted.
    
    
     ENDORSEMENT--SENATE.
     Mr. URMSTQN offered the following:
     
      
       
        Resolved by the Senate, That the following communication addressed to the Democratic
         members of the Fifty-fifth General Assembly be spread upon the journal:
        "To the Democratic members of the General Assembly of Indiana:
        "As citizens and voters of Fayette county we desire hereby to convey to you our
         hearty indorsement of your course during the eventful session now closing, in preserving
         the majority on joint ballot given you by the clear expression of the people last November,
         and in protecting the exercise of your prerogative in the Senate under the Constitution and
         the laws against the desperate and disagreable assaults of the opposition. Your orderly and
         consistant conduct throughout has been in remarkable contrast with the record of the
         Republican revolutionists who have been babies and bullies by turns; who have dodged the
         courts and appealed to mobs instead, and who have stopped all legislation and squandered
         the time and money of the people in a lawless effort to advance individual and partisan
         interest.
        We are willing and anxious to enter another political campaign upon the history you have
         made.

     The resolution was adopted.
    
    
     THANKS TO THE DOORKEEPER.
     Mr. RAHM: I move that the thanks of the Senate be and are hereby extended to Mr. Frank
      Pritchett, Doorkeeper of the Senate, for his efficient, courteous and trusty manner of conduct
      while such officer.
     This motion was agreed to.
    
    
     ELECTION OF A STENOGRAPHER.
     Mr. MCDONALD called up the resolution for the election of a Stenographer
      of the Senate, and asked for the reading of it.
     The Secretary read it. [See page 596 of this book.]
     Mr. MCDONALD: I think it ought to pass and I think it right that it
      should pass.
     It was adopted.
     Thereupon the following oath of office was administered to the Senate Stenographer by the
      President pro tempore of the Senate:
     You do solemnly affirm that you will support the Constitution of the United States and the
      State of Indiana, and will faithfully discharge your duties as Stenographer of the Senate to
      the best of your knowledge and ability; and this you do under the pains and penalties of
      perjury.

     BLIND AND DEAF & DUMB INSTITUTES.
     Mr. FRENCH offered the following:
     
      
       
        Whereas, The Institutions for the Education of the Blind and for the Education of the
         Deaf and Dumb, situate at Indianapolis, Ind., are two of the noblest charities of the
         State; and
        Whereas, The able, and efficient management of said institutions is of national repute;
         therefore
        Resolved, That this Senate hereby express its full unlimited confidence in the ability
         and integrity of the present board of management of said institutions.
       
      
     
     It was adopted.
    
    
     TO WAIT UPON THE GOVERNOR.
     Mr. SELLERS offered the following
     
      
       
        Resolved, That a committee of three Senators be appointed to wait upon the Governor and
         ascertain whether he had any further communications for this body.
       
      
     
     It was adopted.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem. made the committee to consist of Messrs. Sellers, Tharp and
      Fowler.
     The Senate then took a recess until 7.30 o'clock.
    
    
     NIGHT SESSION.
     SYMPATHY FOR IRELAND.
     Mr. BAILEY offered the following:
     
      
       
        Resolved by the Senate of Indiana, That we heartily sympathize with Ireland and  her friends throughout the world in her manful struggle
         for home rule; that the principles for which the Irish people are contending in this great
         contest are fully recognised everywhere as just and equitable.
       
      
     
     It was adopted.
    
    
     PRESIDENT PRO TEM.--ELECTION.
     Mr. FOWLER: I would like for the committee to report the resolution to go into an election
      of President pro tempore.
     Mr. WEIR: It was referred to the Committee on Elections.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: That resolution was laid on the table.
     Mr. WEIR: I appeal to the record. When I introduced the resolution the Chair at once
      referred it to the Committee on Elections.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair don't understand anything of the kind. Wait a
      moment. The 
       Senator
       Sanator
       from Laporte (Mr. Weir) is wrong. There was only one matter referred to the
       Committee on Elections and that was a resolution to indefinitely postpone
      certain contested election cases. The resolution you have reference to was introduced while
      Senator Sellers was in the chair and it was laid on the table.
     Mr. WEIR: I appeal to Senators here this morning, when I introduced that resolution, if it
      was not very promptly, by the Chair, without a motion, referred to the Committee on
       Elections.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: I appeal to the record where you will find nothing of the
      kind.
     Mr. WEIR: Then the record is not right.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The record is right.
     Mr. WEIR: I ask the Secretary to read the record on that question.
     Mr. BAILEY: I desire to state my recollection of it. The resolution in reference to the
      election of President pro tempore was first set down for two o'clock but afterwards fixed
      for three o'clock by the Senator from Laporte. But on motion by the Senator from Floyd
      (Mr. Day) the resolution and amendment was laid on the table. As to the other motion which
      referred to the election cases of several members, that was very promptly referred to the
       Committee on Elections, and as chairman of that committee I would state we
      have not prepared a report yet, and are not ready to report.
     Mr. SELLERS: There was a maotion made by the Senator from Laporte that his resolution should
      be made a special order for three o'clock. I move that Senate Bill 325 be indefinitely
      postponed.
     Mr. FOWLER: I move to amend by a motion to reconsider the vote by which the resolution to
      elect a President pro tempore was laid on the table.
     Mr. WEIR: I think we are entitled to order on this occasion as well as any other. [Paper
      missiles were being thrown around the chamber.]
     Mr. BAILEY: Not that I am specially in favor of the proposition, but I call upon the Senator
      from White to make a report from the grave-yard committee.
     Mr. FOWLER: I would like to have my motion put.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: I can't put the question unless Senators maintain order.
     Mr. FOWLER: If the Senator can't maintain order he ought to get a doorkeeper there.
     Mr. SELLERS: Under the rules of this Senate it is the duty of the Doorkeeper to maintain
      order.
     Mr. FOWLER: I think the parties who carry on this kind of conduct ought to be excluded from
      the chamber whether Senators or not. It is an outrage on this body. I insist on my motion
      being put.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The question is on taking from the table the resolution that the
      Senate proceed to elect a President pro tempore. The chair can't decide. Call the
      roll.
     The motion was rejected by yeas 3, nays 23; refusing to vote 9.
    
    
     THE BENEVOLENT INSTITUTIONS.
     Mr. SELLERS renewed his motion to indefinitely postpone his bill [S. 325] for the
      reorganization of the Board of Trustees of the Benevolent Institutions of the State.
     
     Mr. WEIR: I think this bill should be left like the others, therefore I am opposed to
      indefinite postponement. I know no reason why an exception should be made of that bill at this
      time.
     The motion was agreed to--yeas 20, nays 8; refusing to vote 9.
     Pending the roll-call--
     Mr. BAILEY said: I am in favor of this motion because this bill seeks for a re-organization
      on a non-partisan basis. As there has been a complete vindication of all the charges made
      against these institutions, I vote "aye."
     Mr. HOWARD, of St. Joseph, when his name was called, said: I think the suggestions made by
      that bill should be carried out.
     Mr. WEIR [interposing]: Does the Senator think this bill requires a non-partisan board? If
      so, I say it does not.
     Mr. HOWARD, of St. Joseph [resuming]: I am very glad of the report to-day showing there is
      no need for a reorganization of these institutions. I think the best way is to have the
      trustees appointed by the Governor. I hope the time will come when the General Assembly will
      not have to elect any officers except its own. I think the officers of the benevolent
      institutions of the State should be appointed by the Governor, therefore I vote
      "no."
     Mr. SELLERS, in explanation, said: I think the principle of this bill is exactly correct,
      but a committee of the Senate which has investigated the conduct of these trustees has
      entirely exonorated them from any blame, and because certain persons have charged that this
      was as a menace and club held over these trustees, I thought it but fair to them, after this
      report has exonorated them from blame, that it should be removed, so that there might not be a
      semblance of finding fault with the gentlemen who are shown to be faithful in the discharge of
      their duties, and not treasonable to the party that placed them in charge of the benevolent
      institutions of the State; and for that reason urged at this bill be taken up and indefinitely
      postponed. It is not because I do not believe the bill is right, but because I know it cannot
      be passed now, and it ought not to be held over these gentlemen to be used by unfair
      politicians hereafter. I vote "aye."
     Mr. SMITH of Wells, when his name was called, said: I presume the Senators have not
      forgotten what I said on this bill when it was being engrossed, and I have not changed my
      mind. I believe it would have been a pleasure for the Democratic legislators to have joined
      the Republicans in joint convention for the purpose of electing Trustees for the State
      institutions and to have elected them in the same way as they elected a United States Senator.
      Seventy-six will defeat seventy-four every time. From the tenor of the report of the Senate
      Committee I infer that the Democratic members of this Legislature would gladly have re-elected
      the same board. But because the Republicans of the House locked the doors of the House against
      the Senate, we have been denied the inexpressible pleasure of again defeating them in joint
      convention. I vote "aye."
     Mr. WEIR: I do not think this bill as it stands is a menace or club that can be made use of
      as against the present trustees of the Insane Asylum. I believe the bill in principle to be
      right; not that there is anything in it against these gentlemen but I am in favor of these
      elections being taken out of the hands of the Legislature and vested in the hands of the
      Governor and get rid of that sort of political strife in the Legislature. I am in favor of
      having the Board of Trustees accountable directly to the Governor and at salaries that will
      justify them in giving their time to it. And if there should be a special session of the
      Legislature this bill should occupy the same position as other bills, so it can be taken up
      then and passed. I vote "no."
     Mr. ZIMMERMAN, when called upon to vote, said: I am surprised at the way most Senators are
      voting. Early in the session I offered a reso- lution
      instructing the Committee on Benevolent Institutions to inquire into the
      advisability of placing the management of the benevolent institutions under one Board of
      Management. This bill provides that. This bill is in the interest of the people and in the
      interest of economy, and therefore I vote "no."
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the bill was indefinitely postponed.
    
    
     EPISODIC.
     Mr. FRENCH: I have never seen such harmony on the Republican side of the chamber as in the
      last ten days. We have heard of nothing coming from the other side of the chamber. All has
      been equanimity. They have set us such an example that we should tender them a vote of thanks,
      so I have prepared a resolution and send it up for adoption by the Senate. [The Secreatary
      read]:
     
      
       
        Resolved, That this body go by the light of the Moon, Harness a Campbell and a Dresser
         upon the garb of Winter. That it then Marshall the silent members of this Senate where
         Macy, mount them on said Campbell, and in company with Huston and his dog, send them home
         to an enraged constituency: further
        Resolved, That should this resolution affect the Republicans in a way that they
         can't Barrett, that merry Andrew whistle a tune while said Republicans Trippet out of
         this Senate Chamber; for be it
        Resolved, in conclusion, that a Fowler set of Republicans has not been seen in this Day
         and generation. [Laughter.]
       
      
     
     Mr. BAILEY: I appreciate the spirit in which this resolution is offered and in which it was
      written, and desire to offer the following amendment: add to the last resolution these words:
      "Because of their absolute silence and stolid indifference to the public interests of the
      State." [Laughter.]
     Mr. SELLERS: It seems to me it has been the rule in deliberative assemblies to refer most
      important matters to wise men, and it has been conceded as true that in silence there is
      wisdom; so the minority of this body must be wise men, therefore I move that these very
      important resolutions be referred to a select committee to consist of the minority of this
      body.
     Mr. FOWLER: Now, Mr. President, is this in earnest or a joke?--which? [Laughter.]
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: The chair will refer the resolutions and the amendment to the
      Senator from Switzerland to embody in one resolution. [Laughter.]
     Mr. FOWLER: I insist the throwing of paper shall be stopped. I think it is an insult to
      Senators here and an outrage on the Senate. I insist it be stopped and every man who
      participates in it if a Senator shall be expelled from this body.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: If the Senator from Owen does not like to have papers thrown at
      him, I will make a special request they will desist from it.
     Mr. WEIR: I suggest, as it is about nine o'clock, that the committee appointed to wait
      on the Governor and enquire whether he has any further communication to make to the Senate,
      make a report.
     Mr. SELLERS: The committee appointed this afternoon to wait upon the Governor is ready to
      report, and has taken the liberty to embody in the report a recommendation that the Senate
      adjourn sine die; but the Senator from Owen (Mr. Fowler) has intimated a desire to present a
      memorial.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: Whatever will suit Senators or the committee will suit the
      chair.
    
    
     A RECESS
     Of fifteen minutes was taken at 9.35 o'clock.
     Mr. FOWLER: I offer the following resolution and memorial, and ask that it be read in
      full:
     
      
       
        ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OF INDIANA.
         On the second day of November last a general election was held in Indiana, for the
         choice of certain officers of State and of members of the General Assembly. Within three
         days after the election was held, the result, as to the Legislature, became known, and the
         Indianapolis Journal published that the Republicans had seventy-four (74) members in the
         two houses, and the Democrats seventy-six (76) members therein, leaving the Democrats two
         majority upon a joint ballot. In this way it was acknowledged by the leading Republican
         newspaper of the State that the will of the people, expressed under the  form of law, had declared that some member of the Democratic
         party should be elected Senator of the United States to succeed the Republican then holding
         that position. This statement, with respect to number of the two parties in the
         Legislature, and the Demooratlo majority of two, was published day after day in the
         Indianapolis Journal, and the fact of the majority of two, and the effect it would have
         upon the Senatorial election, were as well known to every voter in Indiana at that time as
         they are to-day.
        Nevertheless, within a few weeks before the meeting of the General Assembly, the Journal,
         giving tone to the Republican press, and politicians of the State asserted with the utmost
         confidence that General Harrison was to be re-elected to the Senate of the United States,
         notwithstanding there was a majority of two against him in the Legislature; and Mr. Huston,
         a State Senator from the county of Fayette, Chairman of the Republican State
          Central Committee, repeatedly made the same declaration, and had interviews
         published in which he made the same statement. Nothing was said about how this result was
         to be accomplished. There were some intimations that Democratic members, one or two, might
         absent themselves or refuse to vote for the nominee of their caucus, or that the
         Independent Labor members actually preferred Harrison to anyone else for the Senate; but
         this, as it will appear in the sequel, was a mere blind to conceal the real purpose which
         the conspirators, to defeat the popular will, had already formed and prepared for
         execution. How they proposed to accomplish their design was unknown until soon after the
         meeting of the General Assembly.
        The General Assembly met pursuant to law on the 6th day of January, 1887. The House of
         Representions was Republican by ten majority. Cornelius Meagher, a Democrat, had been
         elected Representative from the county of Vigo, by an unquestioned majority of twenty-one
         votes. Such election had been regularly certified and returned, and he had taken his oath
         of office and been assigned to his seat in the House of Representatives.
        On the 14th day of January, 1887, four days before the first vote in the Senatorial
         election, the House, by a strict party vote, passed a resolution unseating Mr. Meagher,
         striking his name from the roll, and declaring that one Dickerson, his competitor, who had
         been defeated by the people of that county, was the Representative from the County of Vigo
         and entitled to act and vote as such.* >This was done upon the flimsy pretext that Mr. Meagher had been elected sometime
         before his election to the House, a Justice of the Peace, an office which had been
         abolished before his election to the Legislature, and none of the duties of which he had
         ever exercised.
        As soon as Dickerson, the minority defeated candidate, was seated in place of Meagher,
         the plan began to develop, the 
          * See this book page 95. plot thickened,
         the conspirators became bold and confident. It was announced, both publicly and privately,
         that General Harrison should certainly return to the Senate of 
          the
          thd
          United States, and that the way to do it was to unseat enough Democrats in the
         House, by whatever methods, to destroy the Democratic majority of two on joint ballot, so
         as to give him at least seventy-six votes for United States Senator.
        This shows very clearly that the Republican House of Representatives thus made a breach
         and struck a fatal blow at the freedom of election, deliberately setting aside the will of
         the people and lending themselves to the purposes of that dark, lawless clique and cabal
         which had conspired at all hazards, regardless of law and regardless of right, to return
         their friend and favorite to the Senate of the United States. It became now very apparent,
         although plain people had not before understood it, how these plotters might elect a United
         States Senator, although there was a Democratic majority of two in the General Assembly
         opposed to his return, and the mask being now thrown off, and concealment no longer
         possible, they stated publicly and privately that their intention was to unseat a
         sufficient number of Democrats in the House to enable them to succeed in the Senatorial
         election. At the same time, Mr. Kercheval, Republican Chairman of the Committee on
          Elections in the House, to whom the contests in that branch had been referred,
         publicly declared that he had nineteen cases of contests before the committee, and when
         inquiry was made of him what evidence there was in support of such contests he answered:
         "What is the use of hearing evidence when our minds are made up already as to the
         course we shall take in these cases."
        The Senate was Democratic by eleven majority.
        Some weeks before the meeting of the General Assembly, the election of William N.
         McDonald, a Senator declared to be elected from the counties of Jackson and Lawrence, had
         been regularly contested by his competitor, Frank Branaman, and testimony taken in support
         of the reasons filed, which reasons were bribery, notorious open and corrupt use of money
         by McDonald at said election.
        The crime of McDonald was one of peculiar infamy. The use by him of money for the purpose
         of votes was clearly shown--so clearly that he himself has never publicly either with or
         without oath, made any denial thereof, although he was specially invited by the committee
         to go upon the witness stand and make such denial. Upon this state of facts and proof, the
         Senate of Indiana declared him unfit, incompetent for, and not entitled to a seat in that
         body, and his acts of bribery having been shown to have been publicly known and notoriously
         bruited among all his constituency, both before the time of his election and at the time
         thereof, the Senate declared his competitor, Frank Branaman, lawfully entitled to the seat,
         and Senator Branaman was sworn in and took his seat 
         as a member of that body on the 17th day of January, 1887.
        This action of the Senate in the McDonald case succeeded the action of the House in the
         Meagher case. The conspirators paused; they felt that they were taken by the throat; they
         came to the conclusion that it would not do any further to interfere with the members of
         the House of Representatives, as the people who had chosen them.
        The two parties by this action were left in the same condition as at the commencement of
         the session, with a Democratic majority of two on joint ballot.
        When the Senate of Indiana met on the 6th day of January, 1887, it had been publicly
         known for many months that General Mahlon D. Manson, who had been elected Lieutenant
         Governor of the State in November, 1884, had, in July, 1886, accepted the appointment of
         the collectorship of the Seventh District under the Government of the United States, and so
         had become incompetent to fill the office of Lieutenant Governor. In the absence of the the
         Lieutenant Governor and his inability to discharge the duties of presiding over the Senate,
         the Senate was organized by the Hon. James H. Rice, Auditor of State, and by the Hon.
         Alonzo G. Smith, Senator from the counties of Jackson, and Jennings, who, at the request of
         the Auditor of Sate, occupied the chair during the organization of the Senate, while that
         officer called the roll of new Senators, who were sworn into office by one of the Judges of
         the Supreme Court, whom the Auditor had also requested to attend for that purpose. The
         Senate then proceeded to the election of its officers, and chose Webster Dixon as Principal
         Secretary, John D. Carter as Assistant Secretary, and Frank Pritcbett as Door-keeper, and
         also elected the Hon. Alonzo G. Smith, one of their number, President of the Senate, in the
         absence of the Lieutenant Governor.
        Both parties had, at the November election, 1886, voted for their candidates for the
         office of Lieutenant Governor, notwithsatanding the fact that the Governor had not
         proclaimed a vacancy in said office, and had made no appointment to fill the same. Many
         citizens of the State believed that no vacancy existed, and that no Lieutenant Governor
         could be elected at that time, among whom was President Smith of the Senate, who was,
         however, at all times willing to submit the question of his rights as President of the
         Senate to the courts of the State, and had, in the first instance, before the meeting of
         the Legislature, instituted a suit against William R. Myers, Secretary of State, to enjoin
         him from delivering to the Speaker the returns of the election, which suit Mr. Smith
         prosecuted both in the Circuit and Supreme Courts, but was beaten therein in both courts
         upon the around that they had no jurisdiction to determine the question or to grant the
         injunction prayed by him. Afterward, Mr. Smith instituted another suit in the Marion
         Circuit Court, the object of which was to test the question as to whether the person who
         claimed to be elected Lieutenant Governor at the November election, 1886, was duly elected
         as such, and could, therefore, preside over the Senate, or 
          whether
          wheeher
          the Senate had the right to select its own President. Mr. Smith was then. under
         his election had on the 6th day of January, 1887, acting as President of the Senate, having
         be elected to said oficee by the Senate, and has ever since acted and is now acting as
         such.
        Beside the principal suit instituted to try the question of the title of the office of
         President of the Senate, Mr. Smith had applied in his case for an injunction to prevent the
         person claiming to be elected Lieutenant Governor in November, 1886, from disturbing or
         interfering with him in the present discharge of his duties as President of the Senate. To
         this application for an injunction the pretended Lieutenant Governor made but one defense,
         and that was that he lived in Allen County and could not be sued in Marion County.
        The Hon. A. C. Ayers, Judge of the Marion Circuit Court, after full hearing and argument,
         decided against this defense; that there was no lawful election holden for Lieutenant
         Governor in November 1886, and granted an injunction agant the claimant of that office to
         prevent any disturbance by him of President Smith in the discharge of his duties as such.
         This injunction was issued and in force on the day before the two housce met in joint
         convention, and it became a question between the two houses as to how the joint convention
         should be held. The House claimed that the pretended Lieutenant Governor should preside
         over it; the Senate claimed that it should be presided over by the President of the Senate,
         the highest legislative officer actually present. Under these 
          circumstances
          ccreumstances
          an agreement was made by way of comnpromise,* substantially providing that the joint convention,
         when its session was held, should be called to order by the President of the Senate; that
         the President of the Senate should direct the call of the roll of the Senate in voting;
         that the Speaker of the House should direct the call of the members of the House in voting;
         that the proceedings of the joint convention otherwise should be conducted by the Speaker;
         that the result of the vote should be announced by the President of the Senate; that the
         joint convention should be adjourned by the Speaker; that this agreement should be in force
         until a United States Senator was elected; and the joint convention of the two houses was
         held each day when in session, under the terms of this agreement, from the 19th day of
         January until 2d day of February, on which day David Turpie was elected Senator of the
         United States, and the joint convention then adjourned sine die.
        In the meantime the pretended Lieutenant Governor had appealed the case in which he had
         been beaten upon the application for an injunction before the Judge of the Marion Circuit
         Court, to the Su- 
          * See this book page 131.
          preme Court of INdiana, and the case was there
         pending. That court, after full argument and advisement, decided that the suit was
         improperly brought in Marion County, and should have been brought in Allen County, where
         the claimant of the office of Lieutenant Governor resided. This decision was rendered on
         the 23d day of February, 1887. The judges also delived separate opinions, two of the
         Supreme Court, Howk and Mitchell, deciding that no election for Lieutenant Governor could
         have been holden lawfully in November, 1886; three of the Judges holding that the court had
         no jurisdiction of the subject matter of the suit; one of the Judges, Niblack, deciding
         expressly that the Senate had the right, as between two adverse claimants, to determine for
         itself who should be its presiding officer. This opinion and these opinions were hurriedly
         certified to and distributed at large by the Clerk of the Supreme Court, who was a
         Republican, among members of the Legislature. The House of Representatives, on the
         direction of its Republican Speaker, Mr. Sayre, took up and made a special order of what he
         might have called: "This message from the Supreme Court." It was made the special
         order. And before any of the very lengthy and learned opinions could have been at all
         studied or considered, the Republican majority in the House passed, without debate, and
         under the previous question, the following 
          resolution
          resoultion
         :
        
         
          
           Resolved by the House of Representatives, That until the House shall be officially
            informed that Robert S. Robertson is in the actual and peacable discharge of the duties
            of his office as such presiding officer, the House of Representatives must regard the
            Senate as illegally and unconstitutionally organized, and no official communication can
            be had with them, in order to the due preservation of the just rights and
            responsibilities of this General Assembly.
          
         
        
        This resolution was passed notwithstanding the fact that there was nothing in either of
         the opinions to support the claims of the pretended Lieutenant Governor. Three of the
         judges in fact--the Hon. Alexander C. Ayers, Circuit Court Judge, and Judges Howk and
         Mitchell, of the Supreme Court--had decided that he was utterly without right. No judge of
         any court, at any time, had given the least opinion in support of his title. Yet the House,
         over the protest of the Democratic members thereof, by this summary, inconsiderate and
         wholly unparliamentary action, cut itself off from communciation with the Senate,
         obstructed legislation, and prevented the discharge of public business for the remainder of
         the session. The fact is, they deliberately established themselves and declared themselves
         to be an insurgent body, an insurrectionary mob, no longer having connection or intercourse
         with any coordinate branch of the government.
        The next day after the passage of this resolution by the House, the pretended claimant of
         the office of Lieutenant-Governor, having taken means clandestinely to assemble a large
         number of thugs, bullies and bruisers for the occasion, under the auspices of the
         Republican conspirators, against the law, peace and dignity of this Commonwealth, entered
         the Senate Chamber and made an attempt to take the chair of the President and to address
         the Senate upon what he called "his claims."* The mob outside, meanwhile, being engaged, urged
         and encouraged by Republican State officers and other leaders to force an entrance into the
         hall of the Senate to compel the President thereof to abandon his rightful authority and
         position. At the same time, Republican members of the Senate, with few exceptions, were
         employed in aiding and abetting Robertson in his attempt, by force, to seize the duties of
         the Chair, and in countenancing and encouraging the gang of ruffians on the outside in
         their attempt to break into the Senate Chamber. These attempts failed. The claimant was
         expelled from the Senate Chamber, the mob was repulsed, and the Senate, after great risk,
         danger and hazzard, was restored to order and quiet, with President Smith in the chair.
        The pretended Lieutenant Governor was not struck at all. The only person who received a
         blow in the melee was an old Union Soldier,--an old member of the Legislature--Senator
         McDonald from Allen and Whitley, who, with great dignity, refused then and there to resent
         it and told the Republican Senator who had struck him, that that was not a proper place to
         settle difficulties between gentlemen. This scene of disgraceful violence offered to the
         members and officers of the Senate of Indiana, was the direct result, the outgrowth of that
         Republican conspiracy which had resolved that at all hazzards, and in disgregard of every
         law, to obtain control of the Legislative bodies. There was nothing in the opinion of the
         Supreme Court to justify it or cause this base-born insurrection against authority. That
         opinion had determined nothing against the rights of Smith as President of the Senate, and
         had added not a jot or tittle to the value of the worthless pretensions of the person who
         claimed to be Lieutenant Governor.
        The question rested, at the time this scandalous gang of miscreants attacked the Senate
         Chamber, just where it did at the very commencement of the session. One party claimed that
         there had been a lawful election in 1886; the other claimed that there was none.
         Republicans claimed that the spurious Lieutenant Governor had been inducted into office;
         the other claimed that his pretended induction was a fraud supported by an undeniable
         forgery to which the Speaker of the House had given the sanction of his name in stating
         that the Senate and House had met for the purpose of canvassing the votes for Lieutenant
         Governor, when, in fact and in truth, he knew, and every person else knew, who was present
         at the time, or at all attempted to ascertain what the facts were, that only nineteen
         Senators had at- 
          * See pages 510, 511 of this book. 
          tended that meeting, and that the Senate had refused
         and absolutely declined to attend any such meeting, the Senate having adjudged, as it had
         the right to do, that there had been no election of Lieutenant Governor, and that there
         were no votes to be counted. In this, the action of the Senate was supported by the
         unbroken precedence in Indiana, and by usage in all the other States which have such an
         officer as Lieutenant Governor; for in none of such States is there ever a vacancy in such
         office filled by popular election. Also, by the usage of the Federal government ever since
         its organization in the case of Vice President, a vacancy which is never filled by popular
         election, but always by succession by the President of the Senate. As now, Senator Sherman,
         of Ohio, is succeeding Vice President Hendricks.
        When it became known to the Senate, and to the Democratic members of the House, that the
         majority of the House had, by its resolution of secession, expelled itself, as far its own
         action could do it, from any further participation in legislation by its refusal to
         recognize the Senate as a co-ordinate branch of the government, every effort was made to
         have the factious majority in the House leave faction and attend to the public business of
         the State. The Senate went on in regular order, and passed the following bills:
        Senate Bill No. 27, to protect political purity, and authorizing the holding of primary
         elections.
        Senate Bill No. 29, an act to regulate mining of coal and manner of weight same.
        Senate Bill No. 58, an act prohibiting County Auditors from drawing warrants on County
         Treasurers in violation of law.
        Senate Bill No. 172, an act to prohibit children under the age of fourteen years in
         mining coal or other minerals, manufacturing steel or iron.
        Senate Bill No. 286, an act authorizing the contracting of a loan by the State to meet
         casual deficits in the revenue and to pay interest on the State debt, so as to provide
         funds to complete the various State buildings now in the process of construction, and thus
         avoid the necessity of discharging the large number of employes engaged thereon.
        Senate Bill No. 324, an act to provide for the government and discipline of the State
         Prison North and the State Prison South by one board of directors; and determining the
         officers and the directors of the State Prison South.
        Senate Bill No. 337, an act making appropriations for the State government and its
         institutions for the fiscal years commencing November 1, 1886, and ending October 31,
         1888.
        Senate Bill No 335, an act making annual appropriations for the State government and its
         institutions for the fiscal year beginning November 1, 1887, and ending October 31, 1888,
         and each year thereafter beginning on the 1st day of November and ending the 31st day of
         October of each year; directing the application of such appropriations, requiring accounts
         to be kept of the same, and other matters connected therewith.
        Senate Bill No. 134, an act authorizing the issue of graduated drainage bonds by the
         Board of Commissioners, for the payment of assessments in drainage.
        An act amending the mechanics' lien law.
        An act to prevent the unjust garnishment of the wages of laboring men.
        An act to appoint a Live Stock Sanitary Commission to prevent the spread of
         pleuro-pneumonia and other contagious and infections diseases among the live stock of the
         State.
        Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 2, a joint resolution proposing an amendment to section
         2, of article 6, of the constitution, providing that all county officers shall hold their
         term for four years and be ineligible for re-election in any term of eight years.
        These bills and the joint resolutions, together with many others needed by the people,
         required by the public welfare, were passed by the Senate and transmitted in due course,
         under the rules of the two houses, to the House of Representatives, which was duly notified
         of their having been passed; but the House of Representatives, in pursuance of their
         resolution of obstruction, and deliberately persisting in their determination to defeat and
         destroy all further legislative action, refused to receive usch bills, or to take any
         notice of the Senate messages declaring that they had passed, and the same were referred to
         the Senate and yet remain upon its files.
        These bills were passed by the vote of the Democratic members of the Senate, and by the
         further record thereof, showing that Republican members of the Senate were present during
         the time the vote was taken upon the passage, and refused to vote; for the Republican
         members of the Senate, after the passage of the House resolution of obstruction to
         legislation, conceived themselves to be bound by the action of their co-conspirators in the
         House, and declined to vote on any of these measures. They occupied their seats after the
         25th of February the same as they had done before. They maintained very strict quiet and
         order. They sat in silence like deaf mutes. Several of them, however, drew their pay by
         virtue of vouchers signed by President Smith, an officer whose authority they otherwise
         declined to recognize. In so doing, these Senators did recognize him in the most positive
         manner as President of the Senate; and as these vouchers were presented to Bruce Carr, the
         Republican Auditor of State, and warrants drawn up by him upon them, he recognized
         Smith's authority; and as the Treasurer of State paid such warrants, he recognized
         Smith's authority. The Speaker of the House, after the 25th day of February, still
         continued the consideration of the Senate Bills upon his files, certified to be passed by
         the signature of Smith as President of the Senate; and the Speaker of the House, together
         with the insurrectionary majority and revolution- ary
         mob, which had pretended to usurp the functions of legislation, if they recognized nothing
         else, they recognized Smith's authority as President of the Senate in considering the
         bills which had been transmitted to them verified by his signature. One of the measures
         passed by both Houses, coming into the hands of the Speaker after the 25th of February, was
         that appropriating a sum of money--$200,000--for the erection of a Soldiers' Monument
         by the State of Indiana. To this bill Speaker Sayre attached his signature, and afterward
         procured the spurious pretender to the office of Lieutenant Governor to attach his
         signature thereto, and then transmitted the bill to the Governor for his action. The
         Governor, declining to recognize the signature of the pretended Lieutenant Governor,
         directed its erasure, and asked that the bill be signed by Smith as President of the
         Senate, which, being done, the Governor promptly approved the same and filed it in the
         office of the Secretary of State, and sent the following message to the House of
         Representatives therein:
        
         
          
           
            EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,
            
            INDIANAPOLIS, March 3, 1887.
           
           
            To the Honorable, the Speaker of the House of Representatives:
           
           Senate Bill No. 3, entitled "An act to
            provide for the erection of a State Soldiers' and and Sailors' Monument, or
            Memorial Hall combined, according to the discretion of the trustees in this act provided
            for, and declaring an emergency," and signed Warren G. Sayre, Speaker of the House
            of Representatives, and R. S. Robertson, Lieutenant Governor, was presented to me by the
            House of Representatives for my approval.
           The bill does not conform to the requirements of section 25, article 4, of the
            Constitution, which provides that "all bills and joint resolutions shall be signed
            by the presiding officers of the respective Houses," and its presentation in that
            form is also a violation of the joint rules adopted by both Houses of the present
            General Assembly, which reads as follows:
           RULE 2. After a bill or joint resolution shall have passed both
            houses, it shall be duly enrolled on paper, and the Clerk of the House where it
            originated shall indorse upon the back thereof the House in which it originated, under
            which he shall place his signature.
           RULE 4. Every bill or joint resolution reported to have been duly
            enrolled shall be signed first by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, who shall
            send the same to the Senate, then by the President of the Senate, after which it shall
            be presented by the Joint Committee on Enrolled Bills to the Governor
            for his approbation and signature, and the said committee shall report to their
            respective Houses the day of their presentation, which report shall be entered upon the
            journals of each House.
           RULE 5. All bills and joint resolutions shall be signed by the
            Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate, in their Houses
            respectively, when in session, which shall be carefully noted on the journals of each
            House.
           The bill was not indorsed or signed by the Secretary of the Senate in which the bill
            originated; was never sent to the Senate as required by the joint rules, for the
            signature of the presiding officer of the Senate, as required by the Constitution, and
            did not purport to be signed by the presiding officer or the Senate.
           The constitutional provision, which provides that all hills and joint resolutions
            passed shall be signed by the presiding officers of the respective Houses does not mean
            some person who is claiming to be legally entitled to preside, and who is not presiding,
            but, in my judgment, means the officer or person who is actually presiding and
            discharging the duties of the position. There might be two members of the House each
            claiming to have been legally elected Speaker, and in that case the Executive would
            undoubtedly have to recognize the signature of the member who was actually presiding,
            and whom the House recognized as its presiding officer. It is not the province of the
            Executive to decide who is entitled to preside in either House.
           The Executive posesses no such power or authority. When the Executive is notified by
            each House of the General Assembly that it is duly organized, ready to receive
            communications and transact business, the Executive must recognize the organization so
            reported, and has no right to recognize another. The organization reported to me by a
            committee from each House on the 6th day of January, 1887, has remained unchanged up to
            the present time, and has been recognized by each House in the passage through each
            House of eighteen bills, which were signed by the present presiding officers of each
            House, and approved by me, among which are the bills appropriating $125,000 for paying
            the mileage and per diem of the members and other expenses of the General Assembly; for
            the reorganization and maintenance of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Orphans'
            Home; for the payment of certain employes every two weeks, and authorizing certain
            cities to issue bonds. The present organization of the Senate has been further
            recognized by the passage by the House, during each day's session during the
            present week, of a number of Senate bills and other measures. The members of each House
            have, from the organization of the General Assembly, drawn their mileages and per diem
            upon certificates signed by the present presiding officer of their respective
            Houses.
           If I had approved the bill in the form in which it was presented to me by the House,
            there certainly would be no question as to its invalidity. No court could possibly hold
            that it was signed by the presiding officer of each House when the entire record of the
            Senate shows that Alonzo G. Smith, and no one else, is the presiding 
             officer
             fficer
             of the Senate.
           I cannot sanction a proceeding which would inevitably prevent the bill from becoming a
            law; and believing that the sol- diers and sailors
            of Indiana, and the people generally, desire the legal passage of the bill providing for
            the erection of a Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, I have caused the bill to
            be transmitted to the Senate, and it has been returned to me for approval, signed by the
            presiding officer and Secretary of the Senate. I have approved the bill and caused the
            same to be deposited in the office of the Secretary of State.
           
            ISAAC P. GRAY,
            Governor. 
          
         
        
        It is being thus shown that three Judges of the courts, that the Governor, the Auditor of
         State, the Treasurer of State, Mr. Speaker Sayre, and ever member of the House of
         Representatives had recognized Mr. Smith as President of the Senate, both before and after
         the 25th day of February, it remains for the Republican plotters in this conspiracy to give
         some reason why they organized and led at the front, on the 24th day of February, an
         atrocious and utterly lawless attack upon the government of the State, an attempt by force
         to revolutionize the government and to prevent by violence, one of the branches of the
         law-making-power from proceeding in the peacable, quiet, orderly discharge of its duties as
         such. And it would be well enough to recollect, also, that this attack upon the Senate was
         made in the interest of a claimant who had never, at any time, resorted to the courts to
         assert his rights or sanction his authority; one who had constantly refused and declined to
         submit the ques-question of his claims to the judgment of the courts, and had taken refuge
         in the fact merely that he was a resident of Allen Count, and that the Courts of the
         Capital of the STate could not hold him to answer for his attempted acts of arbitrary
         usurpation. Notwithstanding all this, after the passage of the resolution of obstruction by
         the insurgent faction, which constituted the majority of the House, the Democrats of the
         House and Senate made every effort and left nothing undone to adjust in some peacable
         manner, upon the merits, the questions at issue between the parties. Mr. Jewett, of the
         House, introduced a resolution offering to disregard every other question in the case and
         to submit it alone upon the right of the claimant under the election in 1886, to discharge
         the duties of the office of President of the Senate.
        
         
          
           "Whereas, At the general election held November 4, 1884, Mahlon D. Manson was
            elected Lieutenant Governor of this State, and afterwards qualified and discharged the
            duties of such office; and,
           "Whereas, Prior to the last general election, November 2, 1886, said Mahlon D.
            Manson had ceased to be Lieutenant Governor of this State; and,
           "Whereas, At the general election, November 2, 1886, the electors of Indiana
            voted for candidates for the office of Lieutenant Governor, and Robert S. Robertson, a
            citizen of this State, and eligible to said office, received the highest number of votes
            for said office, and has been declared elected thereto by the Speaker of the House of
            Representatives, and has taken the oath of office as Lieutenant Governor; and,
           "Whereas, The Senate of Indiana denies the right of said Robertson to act as
            Lieutenant Governor, and to preside over the Senate, which refusal arises out of a claim
            by the Senate that at the last general election no vacancy existed in the office of
            Lieutenant Governor which could be filled at such election; and,
           "Whereas, The question as to whether there was or was not a vacancy in the office
            of Lieutenant Governor that could be filled at the last general election threatens to
            seriously endanger the welfare and credit of the State, and to hinder and prevent
            legislation at the present session of the General Assembly; therefore,
           "Be it resolved by the House of Representatives, the Senate concurring: 1. That
            it is the sense of this General Assembly that such question as to the right of said
            Robert S. Robertson to such office should be determined at the earliest day possible by
            the Supreme Court.
           "2. That in order to secure a decision thereon a case should at once be made up,
            which will fairly present such question, and the same be forwarded with all possible
            dispatch to a final decision.
           "3. That such case should limit the decision of the Supreme Court to the single
            question as to whether there was, at the last general election, any vacancy in the
            office of Lieutenant Governor which could be filled at such election, and that all
            question as to the manner of canvassing the vote and declaring the result, should be
            waived or admitted in favor of said "Robertson." 
          
         
        
        This resolution was received with jeers and absolutely rejected by the insurrectionists
         who held seats in the House.
        In the other branch, Senator Bailey, a Democrat, introduced a resolution offering to
         leave the question to the Supreme Court Judges as arbitrators, and to abide by their
          decision.*
        This resolution was introduced and adopted, but no notice of it was taken by those who
         ruled in the councils of the conspirators. At the same time, the Senate, by two separate
         resolutions, acquainted the House with its willingness and readiness to take up, consider
         and pass the necessary appropriation bills and other measures pending so much required and
         needed for the welfare of the people of this Commonwealth: but, by order of the Speaker of
         the House, the doors of that branch were shut in the faces of the Senate messengers, and
         the resolutions were returned unread, unnoticed to the branch of Legislature in which they
         had originated. Mr. Speaker Sayre, as the instrument and organ of the cloud of conspirators
         in ambush behind him, has become most prominent in this disgraceful attempt to retard and
         obstruct the legitimate business of the session. To this end he has repeatedly violated
         every known principle of parliamentary law and usage, refusing a call of the 
          * See pages 523 and 524 of this book.
          House at its opening each day, as has been made since
         its first assemblage, although often moved for. He has refused a call of the ayes and noes
         when regularly asked for and seconded. He has refused to entertain appeals on matters of
         vital importance when respectfully asked and seconded, and when the House was regularly
         organized in open session. He has put questions to a vote while the members of the House
         were on the floor discussing them. He has refused to allow bills and other papers to be
         read in full, even when requested. He has given his consent to an enormous and unnecessary
         increase of employes of the House, and to extravagant allowances for their payment. Yet,
         Mr. Speaker Sayre and his employes, his petty parasites, down to the veriest
         spittoon-cleaner are drawing their pay to-day under an appropriation bill attested by Mr.
         Smith as President of the Senate. The Constitution of Indiana provides that no money shall
         be drawn from the Treasury except by appropriation made according to law. Which is worse in
         Mr. Speaker Sayre and his confederates, that they should rob the State Treasury by
         abstracting money therefrom contrary to law, or that he should decline to receive and sign
         Senate bills transmitted to him, attested in the same manner in the regular course of
         legislative business? To the ignominy of one of these two alternatives, alike shameful and
         dishonorable, his own acts commit him. But the most remarkable effect of Mr. Speaker
         Sayre's conduct has not been felt in the House, which he dishonors by his presence,
         still more by his presidency, but in the Senate, altogether outside of his tyrannical
         jurisdiction. When he announces the passage of the revolutionary resolution of obstruction
         by the House eighteen Republican members of the Senate were stricken speechless. This
         appalling misfortune has heretofore fallen upon certain offenders in miraculous token of
         the Divine displeasures upon John the Baptist's father for his unbelief. It is
         something new, very strange, that in our time it has been inflicted by a single stroke of
         the gavel in the hands of a mere mortal. The day is not far distant when the voice and
         power of the people of Indiana will cast these dumb demons forth. Their places will be
         tilled by gentlemen clothed in their right minds, ready and willing to do their duty as
         members of the Senate.
        None of these attempts at a peaceable and legal settlement of the issue between the two
         Houses has met the approval of Mr. Speaker Sayre or the claimant to the office of
         Lieutenant Governor. All of them have been thoroughly disregarded, and this thing shows and
         proves that these insurrectionists, their aiders end abettors, both in the Legislature and
         out of it, never desired any lawful or peaceable adjudication of their rights, but from the
         beginning had, constantly intended, by force or fraud, to subvert the lawful authority of
         one of the Legislative Departments of the State Government. One of the most determined and
         earnest efforts to advance the business of the session was made by Senator Barrett, of
         Allen County, immediately after the passage of the resolution of obstruction by the House,
         who offered for adoption the following Senate Concurrent
          Resolution No. 13:
        
         
          
           "Whereas, The session of this General assembly is drawing to a close; and,
           "Whereas, The State House Commissioners have ordered a suspension of work upon
            the new State House, thereby discharging a large force of employes, on account of the
            failure of the necessary appropriations to continue the work, and which failure will
            entail upon the State the expense of the State House Commissioners for two years longer
            than necessary to complete the work if such appropriations were made; and,
           "Whereas, It is highly important that the needful legislation be had making
            provision for the erection and maintenance of the Soldiers' and Sailors'
            Orphans' Home; for the completion of the Hospitals for the Insane, and the State
            House; for the erection of the Asylum for the Feeble-Minded Children, so that they may
            be separated from the soldiers' orphans; for providing means to divert the current
            and extraordinary expenses of the State, for the maintenance of the educational
            institutions; for the building of the Soldiers' Monument; and,
           "Whereas, The prompt passage of these necessary measures will avoid the necessity
            of an, extra session, thereby saving many thousands of dollars to the tax-payers of the
            State; therefore, be it
           "Resolved by the Senate, the House of Representatives concurring therein, That
            the measures above named shall receive immediate consideration in both the Senate and
            House of Representatives, and be promptly passed."
          
         
        
        In reference to another measure, one of the most important bills passed by the Senate,
         heretofore alluded to, Senator Trippet, on the 25th day of February, 1887, introduced the
         following Senate Resolution No. 83: [See page 515 of this boog.]
        The same obstructive course was taken in reference to the bill of Mr. Foster, of Madison,
         a Democratic member of the House, having for its object the graded reduction of the fees
         and salaries of county officers, under the constitutional amendment adopted a few years age
         for that purpose. This bill was introduced, adopted and considered in the House and passed.
         The Speaker and the Clerk, under the direction of the Speaker, wholly refused to transmit
         the same to the Senate for its consideration, and the measure so much needed by the people,
         in consequence, totally failed.
        This Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 13, above
         referred to, was considered and passed in the Senate and transmitted with an accompanying
         message to the House one the 28th day of February, 1887: but the person in charge of the
         Senate message was refused admittance to the House, and was informed by the subordinate
         that he met at the door that he was acting under the instructions of the Speaker and the
         House in making such refusal. This was  a wanton act
         of unauthorized power on the part of the House, wholly unparliamentary and unprecedented in
         the history of legislative proceedure in Indiana or elsewhere. It was a ruthless violatlon
         not only of the rules of the two Houses, but of the laws of ordinary decency and propriety
         governing official intercourse between the two branches of the same legislative assembly.
         This act did not proceed upon the theory that the House of Representatives would dictate to
         the Senate its presiding officer, which would be a position sufficiently absurd and
         untenable; but this act proceeded upon the theory that the House of Representatives could
         judge rightly of who should be the presiding officer of the Senate, and in what manner the
         messages of the Senate should be transmitted to the House, a proposition still more
         unreasonable. The Senate would have as much constitutional authority to dictate to the
         House who should be the Speaker thereof, and how its messages should be sent to the other
         branch as the House had in this instance to instruct the refusal of such messages.
        In addition to this, on the 5th of March, 1887, just before final adjournment, Mr.
         Speaker Sayre, having himself signed them, sent to the Governor nineteen Senate bills
         enrolled, for the signature of the Governor, instead of transmitting them to the Senate,
         and having them there signed by the presiding officer of the Senate; but they were
         submitted to the Governor for signature, and even after he had transmitted such bills to
         the Governor and that officer had requested the engrossed bills for the purpose of
         comparing them with the enrolled bills, the Speaker refused to furnish the Governor with
         the engrossed bills for purposes of comparison. Said bills were thereupon sent by the
         Governor to the Senate, and as many of them as could be verified from recollection by the
         authors thereof, the engrossed copies thereof not being procurable, received the signature
         of President Smith and were transmitted to the Governor.
        Other bills of great importance failed to became laws on account of being unable to
         verity them, not having any record evidence to do so. This proceeding on the Speaker was
         wholly irregular and unparliamentary.
        Another act of unparalleled arbitrary conduct of the Republican House was its adjournment
         at 10 o'clock A. M., on Saturday, the last day on which bills might have been passed,
         until 11 A. M., Monday. This was done for the purpose of preventing the Governor
         communicating with the House, and also to prevent the possible passage of the loan and
         appropriation bills. In the whole history of the State no such action has ever before taken
         place.
        The result of this interference by one body with the organization and offices of the
         other would be absolute anarchy and misrule. As deplorable as this condition is, it is one
         which has been forced upon the people of the State by the action of the Republican
         factionists in the General Assembly. They have undertaken unlawfully to seat their
         pretended Lieutenant Governor. We have resisted their attempts.. We have offered, at all
         times, lawfully to adjudicate the question. If evil result from the insurrectionary course
         of these Republican conspirators we wash our hands of it.
        Our constituency shall judge between us. It will certainly be found, upon an examination
         of the conduct, acts and facts in the history of this legislative session, that the
         somewhat helpless and unfortunate condition in which public affairs of the commonwealth are
         left at our adjournment, is due and due only to the factious obstruction of necessary
         legislation by the Republican majority in the House of Representatives; and it will also be
         certainly discovered that the principal motive for their official malfeasance and
         misfeasance, and disregard of constitutional duty, was the desire on their part to be
         revenged upon the majority in the General Assembly for their disappointment in failing to
         elect their candidate for Senator of the United States.
        We have, by our action, carried into effect the will of the people, supported and
         defended the constitution of the State against the assaults of revolutionary violence, and
         in so doing the true and permanent interests of this commonwealth have been faithfully
         maintained and secured.

         Senate.
       
      
     
     Mr. FOWLER I move that the resolution and memorial just read be adopted and spread upon the
      records.
     The PRESIDENT pro tempore: It will be so ordered unless there is some objection.
    
    
     ADJOURNMENT.
     Mr. SELLERS, in behalf of the special committee thereon, submitted the following:
     Mr. President:--Your special committee appointed to call upon the Governor and ascertain
      whether he had, any further communications to transmit to this body, has discharged that duty,
      and hereby begs  leave to report that it was informed by
      His Excellency that he had no further communications for the Senate. Your committee,
      therefore, recommends that the Senate does now adjourn, sine die.
     The report was concurred in.
    
    
     THE PRESIDENT'S VALEDICTORY.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem: Senators will take their seats. [After a pause.] Senators of the 55th
      General Assembly of Indiana: The hour appointed by the Constitution for the dissolution of
      this General Assembly has arrived. When the last sound of the gavel shall have been heard we
      will separate, never, perhaps, to meet again in the capacity in which we have been associated
      for the last sixty-one days; and when we depart from this Chamber we will leave behind us the
      strife and toil of the most memorial Senate that has ever met on American soil. Your hitory is
      written in a contest for Constitutional right and political supremacy, and the more thoroughly
      the people become acquainted with the real merits of this eventful session the more closely
      they will become wedded to your cause.
     Sixty-one days ago when I assumed the position which I now occupy, I believed that I was the
      constitutional presiding officer of this body. If I had not believed so I should not have
      assumed the duties of the office. But there was another man who contested with me the right to
      preside over this body. I have at all times desired that there should be a judicial
      determination of the constitutional question involved.
     With reference to the gentleman who claims to have been elected Lieuenant-Governor, I have
      this to say, that at no time did he listen to principle or fail to throw obstruction in the
      way to prevent a judicial solution to the constitutional question that has been stirring us
      and thep eople of the State during the past sixty-one days. On every occasion I have attempted
      to have that question settled, but it has not been settled. Two Judges of the Supreme Court of
      Indiana have decided that there was no election held for Lieutenant-Governor, and that no
      election could have been held for Lieutenant-Governor in November, 1886. To that extent,
      whatever decision there has been, the constitutional question has been decided in my favor. I
      feel that my position throughout this General Assembly has been one of great moment, one of
      great responsibility, and one that I felt called upon me to exercise all the judgment and all
      the discretion and all the learning that I possessed. I have tried to the best of my ability
      to perform that duty. How well I have performed it is for others to say and not for me. It is
      sufficient for me to say that I have done the best, under the existing circumstances, that it
      was possible for me to do. I am myself content with the record I have made. I am satisfied
      with every act I have performed. If I have made a mistake, it is a mistake of the head and not
      of the heart.
     For my associates on the floor of this Senate I have to say that I part with them on this
      occasion in a spirit of peace on earth and good will toward men. [Applause.]
     Of the thirty-one Democratic Senators who have stood bye me like a stone wall, who have
      stood between me and danger, who have stood between the rights of the people and organized
      conspiracies, I say that the history of the world has never written the character of men
      greater, nobler and braver than they. [Cheers.] The Spartan band that held the pass of
      Thermopylæ were not grander and nobler men, or braver and truer patriots than these thirty-one
      Senators who sit before me to-night. To them my love will go out, and as the scenes of the
      last sixty-one days grow older I can repeat the lines of Burns in his "Mary in
      Heaven." As they grow older they grow brighter:
     
      Still o'er these scenes my memory makes
      And dwells with miser care,
      Time but the impression stronger makes,
      As streams their channels deeper wear.
     
     As they grow wider they will grow deeper, and they will plant themselves in my heart in such
      a manner that they never can be eradicated, nor can my love and affection for these thirty-one
      Senators.
     
     As to the eighteen Republican Senators who have been here during these eventful days, I want
      to say personally that they have treated me kindly, and our association has been pleasant in
      everything except politics. In that respect I do not blame them. I know what my political
      faith is, and I have had the courage to assist it, and they have done likewise. To them I
      return my thanks for the kind acts they have shown me personally. That we have met them and
      their friends over in the other branch of the legislature and defeated them on every political
      issue that came before us, is to the credit of the Democracy of Indiana. [Applause.] And I now
      can say in all confidence, and I believe every word I repeat, that the Democracy of Indiana,
      by the action of the Democrats of this General Assembly, are infused with new life and new
      vigor; and at the next general election in Indiana our conduct will be approved by a majority
      never heard of before in the history of the State. [Cheers.]
     And now I lay down the gavel with the utmost kind feeling to every Senator upon this floor,
      be he Republican or Democrat, and wherever I meet him--under whatever circumstances we shall
      meet, I am ready to extend to him the right hand of fellowship and bid him welcome to my
      humble home to partake of whatever I have there to give him.
     I now declare the Senate of the Fifty-fifth General Assembly of Indiana adjourned sine die.
      [Cheers and applause.]
     And so the Senate adjourned sine die.
    
   
   
    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
    
     
       MONDAY
       MOMDAY
      , March 7, 1887.
    
    
     THANKS TO THE SPEAKER.
     Mr. ROBERTS [Mr. Gardiner in the Chair] offered the following:
     
      
       
        Resolved, That the gratitude of the members of this House is due, and is hereby tendered,
         to the Hon. Warren Grover Sayre, Speaker of the House, for the able, impartial and
         dignified manner in which he has presided over its deliberations, and our earnest wishes
         for his future prosperity and happiness in life will follow him to his home and the society
         of his constituents.
       
      
     
     It was adopted.
    
    
     TO WAIT UPON THE GOVERNOR.
     Messrs Thompson and Gordon were appointed a committee to wait upon the Governor and
      ascertain wheter he had any further communications to make to the House.
    
    
     INSANE HOSPITAL INVESTIGATION.
     Mr. GROSE, from the special committee appointed to investigate charges against the
      management of the Asylum for the 
       Insane
       Inasne
      , submittd a report mnaking twenty-one printed pages in the Journal of the House.
     Mr. GORDON objected to the reading of the report because the resolution authoring the
      investigation provided that the evidence should be printed before the House took any action
      upon the report.
     Mr. GROSE: It is true, as the gentleman from Putnam (Mr. Gordon) says, but I suppose it is a
      matter before this House, and I suppose we can proceed and read the report. I therefore move
      that the report be read.
     Mr. GORDON: This thing can not be done without a reconsideration of the resolution under
      which we are acting, and 
       that
       hat
       can not be done except on the day or the day followig its adoption. Further, this
      evidences has not been put upon the desks of members, consequently members can not vote
      intelligently upon either of these reports. It seems to me the point of order is well taken
      that neither of these reports can be received.
     Mr. GARDINER: In view of the fact of the lateness of the session, I move, notwithstanding the resolution heretofore adopted, that these
      reports be read.
     The SPEAKER: This is simply the introduction of a report which is like a motion or a
      resolution. The report can be received and read.
     Pending the reading of the majority report--
     Mr. JEWETT presented the following:
     
      
       
        PROTEST OF DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS.
        MR. SPEAKER:--The undersigned members of the House of Representatives do enter the
         following protest against the unfair and illegal action of Hon. Warren G. Sayre, the
         Speaker of this House, in the following matter pertaining to the business of the General
         Assembly, viz:
        At ten minutes before eleven o'clock of this day, March 5, 1887, the Governor
         transmitted through his Secretary a message, which was read by the Secretary as
         follows:
        
         
          
           EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,
             INDIANAPOLIS, March 5, 1887.
           
            To the Honorable, the Speaker of the House of Representatives:
           
           I respectfully bequest that yous transmi this office at once the Engrossed Bills
             Nos.5, 9,
             11, 13,
             18, 26,
             45, 75,
             102, 108,
             111, 127,
             152, 191,
             198, 208,
             217, 242
            and 293, in order that they may be transmitted to
            the Senate for the purpose of compilation.
           ISAAC P. GRAY,
            Governor.
          
         
        
        Thereupon, the Speaker directed the Secretary to inform the Governor that the request
         would not be granted.
        Mr. Jewett moved that the request be granted and the engrossed bills be transmitted to
         the Governor for the purpose indicated in the message.
        The Speaker declared the motion out of order.
        Mr. Jewett appealed from the Speaker's decision, but the Speaker refused to
         entertain the appeal.
        We are in the minority and are powerless to prevent the outrageous action of the Speaker,
         backed, as he is, by a majority of the members of this house. We can only protest against
         such action, which in effect, is a denial of the right of member under the rules of this
         House and the Constitution of the State, discourteous to the Governor, destructive to
         legislation, and forbidden by every consideration of law, justice and decency.
        
         [Signed,]
         CHARLES L. JEWETT,
         Representative from Floyd County.

         W. H. SHAMBAUGH,

     INSANE HOSPITAL INVESTIGATION.
     Mr. GORDON, from a minority of the special committee appointed to investigate the charges
      against the management of the Insane Asylum, submitted a report covering nearly sixteen
      printed pages of the House Journal; which was read at the beginning of the
    
    
     AFTERNOON SESSION.
     Mr. GRIFFITHS [when the reading was concluded] moved that the reports be now considered, and
      on this motion demanded the previous question.
     Mr. JEWETT protested earnestly against the indecent haste which the House was making, and
      denounced it as cowardly and dishonest.
     Mr. GORDON raised the point of order that such summary action on the reports was
      unpalriamentary and in direct violation of the rules of the House.
     The SPEAKER held that the point of order was not well taken.
     The House seconded the demand for the previous question, and the main question was ordered
      to be now put by yeas 55, nays 36.
     The motion (Mr. Griffith's) was agreed to by yeas 55, nays 34.
     The question being on the substitution of the minority for the majority report--
     Mr. GRIFFITHS demanded the previous question.
     
     The House seconded the demand, and the main question was ordered by yeas 54, nays 34.
     Mr JEWETT saying, when called upon to vote: Because these two reports differ so widely, and
      because I am unable to say which report speaks the truth and which does not; because I believe
      that no one's character should be smirched by a vote that is not based upon a knowledge
      of the facts, because of these things I protest against the indecent and unnecessary haste
      with which this is being done. Because I attended one meeting of this committee on
       benevolent institutions when this matter was under debate; because I saw the
      chairman refuse to entertain a motion when all the members there present asked him to do it, I
      am compelled to say that the conduct of the committee was unfair. I vote "no."
     The question then being on the substitution of the minority for the majority report, the
      House refused to substitute the minority for the majority report by yeas 38, nays 52.
     Pending the roll call--
     Mr. ACKMAN said: Because the author of the minority report, and every member on this floor
      on that side, has opposed the consideration of these reports from the beginning, has led me to
      conclude that the minority report is not correct, and I therefore vote "no."
     Mr. COX of Miami [explaining]: This is certainly a very important matter, and I do not want
      to go wrong about it. If the Insane Asylum has been mismanaged I do not believe in defending
      the management that has mismanaged it. If it has been improperly managed I do not believe in
      concealing that matter from the people. The resolution authorizing this investigation requires
      the evidence to be presented before any action can be taken on thereports; but it has not been
      presented, and we are left without any evidence. I know that the charges that were made during
      the last campaign were made for a selfish purpose. I know that General Harrison went through
      this State talking about cholera hogs, and making political capital for a party. I know the
      majority of this House came here prejudiced against that institution, and I know when they
      commenced this investigation, they did it to make political capital. I vote
      "aye."
     Mr. GORDON said: It seems to me that this minority report should be adopted if for no other
      reason than that it is straightforward and tells the truth, and the majority report is
      untruthful and scarcely to be believed either in general or in detail. I vote
      "aye."
     Mr. GRIFFITHS, when his name was called, said: I am opposed to the substitution of the
      minority report because to my certain knowledge it is asolutely false. The language as used
      there with reference to myself is absolutely untrue, and I say it upon the floor of this
      House, and the gentlemen who signed that report knew it was untrue or did not investigate. The
      majority report has kept strictly within the line of the evidence in this case. I vote
      "no."
     Mr. HARRELL [in explanation]: I understood from the resolution that before any action could
      be taken on these reports that the evidence would be taken and printed and laid upon the desk
      of the members of this House. The majority of this House, have seen proper to violate that
      rule. They have seen proper to come in here and smirch the character of men connected with
      that intitution. One side of this House says that the minority report is correct, and the
      other that the majority report is correct. Believing that some of the things are prepared in
      this report simply for campaign republican lies, I have no faith in what they report in that
      report. I vote "aye."
     Mr. IBACH: In explaining my vote I must say I am not satisfied that I shall record my vote
      aright, as I believe there is great wrong and injustice done in the Asylum for the Insane. It
      is the wrong growing out of the Brown bill. The Republicans assisted him, and I believe they
      are in the wrong now. I do not believe in smirching men's characters without  hearing any proof. I therefore vote "aye."
     Mr. JEWETT, when called upon to vote, said: I protest against this withholding of the
      evidence from the House. I say when it was promised that this testimony should come here, and
      when this cowardly House on Saturday ran away at 11 o'clock when that time ought to have
      been put in hearing this testimony read on this floor. But you were afraid to do it, you were
      afraid of Isaac P. Gray. It was to be expected that the cowardly House--the House that had
      refused to receive messages from the honest Governor--would close its career with
      "slander, scandal and forgery," such as had been the outcome of the partisan
      investigation. When you ask me to convict men without the evidence, I am compelled to conclude
      that the evidence cannot be produced. This is a question of veracity. I vote for this minority
      report because I am refused the evidence. I vote "aye."
     Mr. LINCK, when answering to his name, said: I am surprised at the ignorance of the
      gentlemen on the other side of this House. The facts have been published in the papers
      throughout the State, and every honest man, woman and child can know them. The State has been
      disgraced by that institution, and yet men will stand up here and talk as if these were good
      men. Talk about us being cowardly! Before this investigation was made I made these charges,
      and gentlemen on the other side of the House asked me if I knew they were true, and I told
      them I thought they were, and now I know that they are true. The worst thing that has been
      said about that institution has been said by the gentlemen they speak of so highly. I vote
      "no."
     Mr. MONTGOMERY of Owen said, in explanation: I am in favor of substituting this minority for
      the majority report. I believe the facts as set forth in the minority report are the facts of
      the case, and therefore vote "aye."
     Mr. NIBLACK, when his name was called, said: The majority of the committees have had plenty
      of time during this session to put all the evidence before the House. The evidence ought to
      have been here, but it is not, and I regret it very much, for I am sure the members of this
      House would be ready and willing to admit in the light of the testimony that the majority
      report was untrue and made for personal purposes. On the contrary the facts set out in the
      minority report are true. I vote "aye."
     Mr. NOLIN, in explanation of his vote, said: The members on this side of the House say that
      the facts in the majority report are true. If they are untrue the party that made them must
      fail. I believe that the Republicans are willing to go before the people. They are ready to
      show you that in 1888 there will be about 67 seats in this Hall set aside for the Republicans.
      Therefore I vote "no."
     Mr. PARKER explaining his vote: For 31 or 32 days an investigation has been going on under a
      resolution requiring that the evidence as well as the report was to be laid before the House.
      I say it is a cowardly attempt to perpetrate an outrage upon the minority. It compares well
      with the cowardly act last Saturday. I cannot and will not vote for the majority report
      because I believe it is an outrage, to attempt to pound this down the throats of the minority.
      I am not here to defend the benevolent institutions of the State of Indiana if they have been
      wrongly managed. I vote "no."
     Mr. PIERCE, when his name was called, said: As a member of that committee I will say to each
      and every member of this House that the chairman of that committee has never at any time
      suffered the minority of this committee to examine the majority report, and at no time have
      they ever consulted us upon the preparation of this majority report except once for about five
      minutes. They knew it said things that were not true. I say to you that I know as a member of
      that committee, I know from the evidence, and I heard it, there is not another institution in
      the United  States the size of that that is better. I
      want it to go broad-cast over the State of Indiana that I cast my vote for the minority
      report. I vote "aye."
     Mr. PLEASANTS, in answering to his name, said: At the time the resolution to appoint a
      committee to make this investigation was pending, I offered an amendment requiring the
      evidence to be reported because I did not think the Republican members intended to do the fair
      thing. I offered that amendment in order to obtain a pledge of fairness. But now they come in
      on the last day of the session and make a report without giving us the evidence as they were
      instructed to do. I shall vote against this report for the reason that we have not evidence
      before us and don't know positively which is right and which is wrong; and from the
      conduct of the majority I am satisfied we cannot expect anything from them. Knowing the good
      reputation of the gentlemen who constitute the minority of that committee I am satisfied their
      report states nothing but the truth, and for that reason will vote "aye."
     Mr. ROBINSON, when called upon to vote, said: I was unable to hear or understand the reading
      of either the majority or the minority report, and because of the previous question I have not
      had the privilege of hearing these reports discussed, and not desiring to vote on a question
      of this importance without a proper understanding of the subject, I ask to be excused from
      voting upon this proposition.
     Mr. PATTON: I move the gentlemen be given time until the next session to read the
      reports.
     The SPEAKER: Time will be given him till after the roll-call is finished.
     Mr. ROBINSON [resuming]: If I must vote without hearing the evidence I am disposed to give
      the benefit of the doubt to the minority. I will vote "aye."
     Mr. SCOTT [in explanation]: If it is true that charges of this kind were made during the
      last campaign, that does not decract a whitt from the value of the evidence. General Harrison
      did go over the State showing to the people the wrongs practiced in the institutions of this
      State. But General Harrison didn't tell all, because he had not discovered all. It took
      an investigation by the committee of this legislature, to discover all the corruption and
      dishonesty in the management of the Benevolent Institutions of the State. Just as soon as we
      got the evidence we put it before the people. I vote "no."
     Mr. VAN SLYKE, when his name was called, said: Charges were made against this Institution
      during the last canvass. The committee had endeavored to go to the bottom of it, but they have
      only just opened the reeking, stinking rottenness that lies still further down. I vote
      "no."
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the House refused to substitute the minority for the majority report.
     The majority report was then concurred in by yeas 52, nays 37.
     Pending roll call--
     Mr. JEWETT, when his name was called, said: I desire to express my regret that partisan
      politics seems to be the rule by which this question is to be decided. I cannot vote for this
      majority report because I do not know from any evidence that has been submitted to me that it
      is true. If I believed that these charges were true; if I did not know that they were false, I
      would be one of the first to denounce those guilty of the offenses charged. I cannot vote to
      send out to the people of the State a statement unsupported by any testimony, which if true
      would carry sorrow to thousands--perhaps 10,000 hearts. It is cowardly in the majority to
      thrust down the throats of the minority that which they know is not true. I vote
      "no."
     Mr. KELLY of Boone [explaining]: I am a resident of the county in which the president of
      this institution lives. I have known him ever since he was a boy. Until I was twenty years of
      age I lived near him. I know his family relations, and know that in the brief period of my
      life his history has was never been out of my knowledge, and  I expect to-morrow to go home, and I want to say that so far as the
      people of Boone county are concerned they believe the report is correct. I vote now knowingly
      and knowing that I go to the man's home and am no coward. I vote "aye."
     Mr. PIERCE: I desire briefly to explain my vote. The Republican party is endeavoring to-day
      at the final and closing hour of this session to whoop up a campaign document to be used in
      1888. That is my sincere conviction gentlemen. I know it. I say I know it. I vote
      "no."
     Mr. SELVAY, when called upon to vote, said: I am paired with Mr. Reynolds of Wayne.
     The vote was announced as above.
     So the majority report was adopted.
    
    
     STATE PRISON NORTH.
     The Committee on State's Prisons submitted majority and minority
      reports on the management of the Northern Penitentiary, the latter recommending the abolition
      of the present system of contract convict labor. [They make nine pages of printed matter in
      the House Journal.]
     On motion by Mr. PLEASANT the reading of the reports was dispensed with.
     Mr. PARKER: The majority report was adopted unanimously, except the paragraph which states
      we do not feel like recommending any change in the present system of convict labor. The
      majority did not feel like reporting that it be abolished, for no other method has been proven
      superior. I think the report should stand as it is.
     Mr. IBACH: I shall vote for the minority report because the majority report does not meet
      the question as it should be met. Let us show to the people of the State of Indiana that we
      are opposed to the contract system as it is now managed in our prisons.
     Mr. MORSE: We know this is one of the greatest evils that we have in our prison system.
      During our investigation in the Prison North we found that these contractors paid on an
      average about 60 cents a day. And their testimnony was to the effect that men who were doing
      the same kind of work were getting from $1.25 to $2.00 per day. We found by the testimony that
      their expenses are very small. It seems to me gentlemen on this floor who are supposed to have
      studied this matter should not say that they cannot recommend any change. We feel that in the
      course of time this system will be abolished, and the question is to find a remedy.. The
      minority report proposes to find a remedy gradually. The majority report don't recommend
      anything except the present system.
     Mr. GRIFFITH demanded the previous question.
     The House seconded the demand and under its operations the minority was substituted for the
      majority report by yeas 79, nays 8.
     Pending the roll call--
     Mr. PARKER, when called upon to vote, said: I would not vote against anything in the
      interest of the labor element, but the adoption of the majority report does not convey any
      such meaning. The limited time the committee had did not enable it to go into the details and
      bearings that convict labor has upon outside labor. We only found that under the system in
      vogue now that the prison was not only self-sustaining, but that it puts into the State
      Treasury annually $19,000; so in our report we did not feel like advocating the immediate
      abolishment of the present system, but we believe a committee ought to be established to
      investigate and recommend some other system whereby these penal institutions can be managed
      without coming into competition with outside labor. For that reason I will sustain the
      majority report and vote "no."
     Mr. THOMPSON, when his name was called, said: when we can substitute something better for
      our contract-convict labor system, then I will be in favor of it. There is very little labor
      done in our State Prisons. The material manufactured there is furnished entirely outside of
      the prison. I pronounce this question a hum-bug going through the country. On this question I
      vote "no."
     The result was announced as above.
     
     So the minority report was substituted for the majority report.
     The majority report as thus amended was adopted. It is as follows:
     
      
       
        Mr. SPEAKER:--The undersigned, a minority of your
          "Committee on Affairs of State Prisons, Northern," having
         dissented from the report of the majority of said committee in so far as it relates to
         "convict contract labor," most respectfully submit the following as their views
         upon that question:
        We are satisfied that the constract system should be speedily abolished, notwithstanding
         the fact that managed as this institute is, in a pecuniary sense profitable to the State,
         it is in no manner a system calculated to reform a prisoner. It should not be the amount in
         dollars and cents to be derived from these institutions which should actuate us in our
         dealings with them, but the best interests of society, by the reformation of the criminal,
         should be the end desirable of attainment. The State should not deal with its criminals in
         the mercenary spirit which controls the monopolist or capitalist in his dealings with human
         labor--everything for gain, nothing for reform. While we believe the cost of the
         maintenance of all our penal institutions ahould be accepted as a part of the cost of good
         government, and, if necessary, should be provided from the public treasury in the same
         manner as are charitable institutions or courts of justice, we do not mean that the
         convicts should be kept idle, but, on the contrary, demand that they should be employed in
         such a manner as would aid in their reformation, and bring their labor the least in
         competition with that of honest men outside the prison walls, even if the profits to the
         State are not as large as at present. And further, we do not suggest the propriety of
         purchasing expensive power machinery, for we believe the banishment of all such from the
         prisons would be conducive to the best interest of the convict, that he might be employed
         at manual occupations so when his term of service has expired he may be possessed of a
         trade which would be of benefit to him in after life. Let the shoemaker, the cooper, the
         harness maker, the chair maker, or any other occupation, be taught his trade that he may be
         master of it, and not only capable of doing the small portion of it required under the
         present system of teaching.
        We do not recommend the immediate and utter abolishment of the contract system, but, as
         the contracts of those now bound expire, no new ones shall be entered into, and this,
         during the coming two years, will amount to but a small per cent. of those so contracted
         for. During the present year, in the Northern Prison, 140 prisoners will be released from
         the contractors by the expiration of their contracts, and during the year 1888, 75
         additional will be so released. So, for the two years, 215 of the 695 let out to
         contractors now, will be subject to the orders, as to labor, of the Warden. Let the
         experiment be tried, and the next meeting of the General Assembly, in 1889, will find our
         State far in advance in reform in this direction. Let those released from their contracts
         be placed at work by the Warden for the benefit of the State, and let the other State
         Institutions be the purchasers of the product. Respectfully submitted,
        
         JOHN SCHLEY,
         PHILIP KLEIN,
         CHARLEY HARLEY,
         WILLIAM MORSE.
        
       
      
     
    
    
     BRIBERY IN ELECTION OF SENATOR."
     Mr. COVERT from the Committee thereon, submitted the following:
     
      
       
        Mr. SPEAKER:--Your committee appointed under House Resolution No. 12,
         introduced by Mr. Covert, to investigate charges of bribery in connection with the vote for
         a Senator in the Congress of the United States,--[see pages 326 and 327 of this book,]--beg
         leave to report that they have had the matter under consideration, and so far as they have
         been able to examine, they have not found sufficient evidence to warrant them in finding
         that there was corruption upon the part of any member of the General Assembly in connection
         with his vote for a United States Senator.
        We herewith submit the following evidence:
        
         [Signed,]
         JAKE COVERT,
         Chairman,
         JACOB L. WHITE,
         ELISHA PIERCE,
         W. R. GARDINER,
         SAM E. KERCHEVAL.
       
      
     
     Mr. GARDINER: It is a report of the evidence taken by the committee; there is no conclusion
      drawn from it by the committee; therefore I suppose it is unnecessary to read it. I move that
      it be on the table and be printed.
     The motion was agreed to.
     Mr. ROBINSON [subsequently]: I rise to a question of privilege. I do not undersand the
      committee which investigated these charges of bribery have made a full report. I suggested
      that some witnesses be examined. The chairman knows I asked that Mr.  be examined, and he has not been examined. Fairness has not been meted out to me. There was
      evidence produced that has not been examined by that committee. I want to repeat what I said
      the other day--what seemed to shock the modesty of some gentlemen--that I have had and have
      clean hands in this matter, and I have a clear conscience.
    
    
     SYMPATHY WITH IRELAND.
     Mr. GARDINER offered the following:
     
     
      
       
        Resolved, That this House of Representatives deeply sympathize with the Irish people in
         their struggle for liberty and their earnest and patriotic efforts to establish for
         themselves that principle in government so clear to every American heart--Home Rule.
       
      
     
     It was adopted.
     The House took a recess till 8 o'clock.
    
    
     NIGHT SESSION.
     EXTRA PAY TO EMPLOYES.
     Resolutions were adopted by yeas 44, nays 34, granting extra allowances to several clerks,
      also to pay "Journal Clerks for a period of several days" after the Senate
      adjournment.
    
    
     CONTRACT CONVICT LABOR.
     Mr. SCHLEY offered the following:
     
      
       
        Whereas, In view of the fact that much complaint and agitation has arisen from the
         present system of contract convict labor in our penal institutions, and the abolishing of
         this plan is desired by a very large class of manufacturers, dealers and workingmen in this
         State,
        Whereas, The strained condition of the relation of the two branches of the present
         Legislature, now nearing its close, render it beyond hope that anything of a definite
         character, by bill or otherwise, can be accomplished to affect the result; and,
        Whereas, It being deemed necessary that some heed should be taken of the complaints above
         referred to, and inquiry made as to the best manner of conducting the labor of the state
         Prisons; and;
        Whereas, several states in the Union have adopted laws abolishing the contract system in
         their State Prisons; therefore, be it
        Resolved, That three members of this House of Representatives be appointed by the Speaker
         to thoroughly investigate the present system of contrast convict labor, and report the
         result of their investigation at its session in 1889.
        Resolved, further, That said committee shall be empowered and is hereby authorized to
         visit the penal institutions of other States where contract convict labor has been wholly
         or partially abolished, and shall be allowed their necessary expenses in conducting said
         investigation.
       
      
     
     It was adopted.
     The SPEAKER subsequently announced this committee, Messrs Covert, Morse and Schley.
    
    
     SENATE BILLS PASSED.
     On motion by Mr. GORDON the bill [S. 203] to pay Andrew Steffin, assignee of Griffith and
      Williams for a claim against the State, was passed under a suspension of the rules, by yeas
      55, nays 15.
     Mr. HARRELL [about 10 o'clock] moved that the House adjourn sine die.
    
    
     THE SPEAKER'S VALEDICTORY.
     The SPEAKER: Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:--Sixty-one days ago, from this
      place, I thanked the majority of this House for doing me the signal honor of choosing me
      Speaker. I then bespoke the forbearance of all of you, and have had it in generous measure.
      This has been an eventful session. It has dedicated to the law-making power the new State
      House. It had witnessed a struggle unprecedented in Indiana for the United, States
      Senatorship, with a result that is now doubtful. It has witnessed an unheard of attempt--so
      far with apparent success--to deny to a man an office to which a majority of the people, on a
      remarkably full vote, had elected him. It has seen the two houses of the General Assembly
      laboring from day to day, to pass laws, yet maintaining absolute non-intercourse, so that
      their labors are fruitless, the one house seeming to fear that usurped power could not be
      maintained in full sight of the people; the other seeming to be guided by a determination not
      to recognize what a majority believed to be the result of a crime against the people's
      rights.
     It has seen the Governor of the State of Indiana appoint a day to read to the two Houses, in
      Joint Assembly, his biennial message, and then, without excuse or explanation, sending his
      message in writing to the two Houses separately, leaving to surmise only his real design. It
      has seen the Senate purposely adjourn to a day beyond the time appointed by the Constitution
      to canvass the vote for Lieutenant-Governor, publicly declaring by such conduct, by less than
      two score of men, that the will of two hundred and thirty-three thousand could be made
      unavailing. It has seen investigation set on foot and concluded that has exposed frightful
      corruption, in the public service of the State, and while it is a matter of lamentation that
      such exposure could be made,  yet the people are to be
      congratulated that the further continuance of corruption has been certainly arrested. It has
      seen the Senate refuse to go into Joint Convention to select officers of the penal and
      benevolent institutions, although required so to do by positive law; and when one political
      party derives a so-called benefit from such refusal, the reason is not hard to divine.
     In the midst of all these controversies, the same persons, as members of the General
      Assembly, have vied with each other in the drudgery and detail of legislation with an industry
      and zeal not excelled at any time in the past. Personally and socially, the truest friendships
      have been made and maintained, and now, in returning thanks for the many kindnesses received
      at the hands of each member, I wish you each a long and happy and prosperous life, and hope
      that in time to come I may have the honor and pleasure of welcoming each of you to my home. I
      now declare this House adjourned sine die.
     So the House, of Representatives adjourned sine die.
    
   
   
   
    IN SENATE.
    
     FRIDAY, February 11, 1887.

     BENEVOLENT INSTITUTIONS INVESTIGATION.
     The Senate, having under consideration a resolution for the appointment of a committee of
      five Senators to investigate the conduct of the several benevolent institutions of the State,
      in and near the city of Indianapolis,--
     Mr. KENNEDY said: I think this resolution is right, and I believe it ought to pass, and I
      believe it is the disposition of Senators generally that it shall pass. But this discussion
      has got considerably away from the subject under consideration.
     It is the duty of any set of officers, belonging to any party, to serve the public
      faithfully, and when slanderous reports are circulated about them it is the duty of the proper
      authority, and it is due to such officers, to have them investigated, and see whether the
      charges are true or false. If true, the officer ought to be turned out, and if they prove
      themselves to be in the right and honest, it will redound to their credit. So, I think the
      resolution ought to pass; and as there is certainly not much dispute about that, I want to
      reply to some things said by the Senator from Jennings [the Pres. pro tem.], and my old friend
      over there [Mr. Shively], and my friend across here [Mr. McDonald]. Now, they are all fair
      men, and I will say I can't ask better treatment from any presiding officer than I have
      received from the present presiding officer. And I have been treated the best kind by my
      friend who has jest taken his seat [Mr. McDonald], who is always fair and open in discussion.
      And I meet my old friend over there [Mr. Shively] in the committee room, and we are especial
      friends. But the Senator from Jennings, intimates that this resolution is a good thing. He is
      a gentleman belonging to the Democratic party, and he pronounces the Democratic party just;
      and if he is to pronounce the sentence, the whole thing ought to have died right then and gone
      to glory. [Laughter.] It was a clean sheet then, and they will never have it so clean again, I
      don't believe. He says all the dirt that has ever been done was done by the Republican
      party.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem (interrupting). What would have become of the Republican party if it
      had died?
     Mr. KENNEDY (resuming). I wouldn't like to say; we would go where this gas comes from,
      I suppose. [Laughter.] If you were to be judged by him, we would go back to Gen.
      Jackson's day. These old men will remember Swartwout, who was a defaulter to a large
      amount. But in these modern times we have great swindlers in our government. I have not
      forgotten Wm. Tweed, who stole more money than the republican party was ever accused of
      stealing, if it was all put together. You will find that the city of New York is a hundred and
      fifteen millions in debt; that was a democratic steal, and Tweed died in the penitentiary for
      the crime.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem. That's where we put them.
     Mr. KENNEDY (continuing). If you will take the whole State debt of Indiana, and every county
      and municipality, the amount stolen by Tweed will be six times as much as all put together.
      Well, they talk about the Democratic party in the army! I have heard it stated that, the
      Democratic party had more soldiers in the service than the Republicans in the last war; and I
      always believed it, because they had all one side and part on the other. [Laughter.] But my
      Democratic friends who  went from here every time they
      shot, they shot a Democrat; they never shot at any other man than a Democrat. Who was it that
      did the firing on fort Sumpter? Who was it fired on the ship Star of the West? Why, it was
      Democrats. Who was it that was taken up in the State of Indiana as leaders of the Golden
      Circle and condemned to death?
     The PRESIDENT pro tem.: The same man who ran for Representative two years ago in Huntington
      county as a Republican. [Laughter.]
     Mr. KENNEDY (resuming). Well, I haven't heard his name yet, there is so much
      confusion.
     Mr. FOWLER .His name is Miligan--Lambdin P. Milligan.
     Mr. KENNEDY. Oh yes, he has reformed; [cheers and laughter] this Golden Circle thing was
      done while he was a Democrat; the other when he became a republican. Now, talk about your
      Democrats. In September 18, 1872, Barney Conroy was sent to the penitentiary. June 11, 1877,
      he confessed himself guilty and was sent there again. August 8, 1879, arrested for robbery.
      And here we find:
     
      
       
        We, the undersigned, most earnestly request the proper person for making the appointment
         to appoint Barnard Conroy to the position of transfer agent for transferring the mails at
         the Union depot, Indianapolis. We have known Mr. Conroy for a long time as an earnest
         worker in the cause of Democracy; one who is at the polls early and late. He is a
         hard-working citizen, and he has never before asked an appointment, we think him worthy of
         recognition now:
        
         Isaac P. Gray, Governor; John J.
          Cooper, Treasurer of State; S. P. Sheerin,
          Clerk of Supreme Court; W. E. Niblack,
          Supreme Judge; James H. Rice, Auditor of
          State; Francis T. Hord, Attorney General;
          W. R. Myers, Secretary of State; and Oscar
          B. Hord.
       
      
     
     This is the kind of Democrats--
     The PRESIDENT pro tem [interrupting]: This same man is now a political ward bummer of the
      Republican party.
     Mr. BAILEY [interposing]: And isn't it true that this same man was put out of office by
      Democrats upon the discovery of these things?
     Mr. KENNEDY [resuming]: It is strange they didn't discover it before appointing him,
      when he had been twice in the penitentiary.
     Mr. BAILEY [interrupting]: Isn't it true that the Republicans on the 19th day of
      January, in Joint Convention, made him one of the assistant doorkeepers, when we went into the
      Joint Convention to elect a United States Senator?
     Mr. KENNEDY: I never followed up his history after he left the post-office service. And now
      in regard to my old friend (Mr. Shively) who went back to the old story of 1878, and talked
      about stealing the Presidency. Why, that history is not forgotten--
     The PRESIDENT pro tem [interposing]: It never will be, either.
     Mr. KENNEDY: No; nor those Barnum's mules either. (Laughter.) Why didn't they send
      for ten of those mules? (Renewed laughter.) But we are in a minority here, and are like the
      fool who jumped on the mule's back and it started across the prairie. He met a man who
      knew him, and who said to him: "Hello Bill; where are you going?" He swore he
      didn't know. "Ask the mule." (Laughter.) And here we are riding the wild mule,
      and pernitted to go as far as the mule will let us. (Laughter.) That is the way we have been
      permitted to go on; we are at the mercy of the mule. (Roars of 
       laughter
       lauhgter
      .) I don't mean anything personal to the President, (laughter) the gentleman has
      been kind to me. It is not in reference to him at all. (Continued laughter.) But that is the
      situation we are in here. I say when you talk about stealing the Presidency, you forget that
      it hasn't been but a few weeks since over 3,000 majority of the people of Indiana decided
      that we should have a Lieutenant-Governor; and the Democrats stole the office from us, and
      there sits the man (pointing to Mr. Robertson) who was chosen to preside over us, and he has
      been deprived of it by you Democrats.
     The PRESIDENT pro tem [interrupting]: You couldn't stop the mule; that's the
      trouble.
     Mr. KENNEDY: No, we couldn't stop the mule, but we are going to get a bridle to put on
      him. [Cheers.]

     WEDNESDAY, March 2, 1887.
    
    [Omitted from page 556.]
    
     THE STATE UNIVERSITY.
     The Senate, as in Committee of the Whole, was considering the bill [S.
      337] for the maintenance of the State Government for the year ending October 31, 1888.
     Mr. DAY moved to strike out the annual appropriation of $25,000 to the State University.
     Mr. DUNCAN, of Brown: A fire destroyed the college library in 1883, since which time the
      Trustees have been accumulating another. They have succeeded very well so far, and by the
      expiration of another year they hope to have one equal to the library destroyed. They are
      compelled to place the library in recitation rooms where you will find it in open cases
      standing about.. There is no place provided for its safe keeping and custody. The institution
      is compelled to have a library for the benefit of its students. It is desired a building shall
      be constructed by this item that will afford a safe and secure protection in case of future
      fire. I hope the motion of the Senator from Floyd (Mr. Day) will not prevail; but that this
      item will be allowed to stand in the bill as printed.
     Mr. TRIPPETT declared the State University is a disgrace to the State.
     Mr. FRENCH The amount asked for is reasonable. The fire burned up books and other things
      that can never be replaced, from the fact that the State has not taken care of them.
     Mr. WEIR moved to amend by making the appropriation $10,000.
     Mr. HOWARD, of St. Joseph: The State should make this institution an honor to the
      commonwealth. If it is desired that it should be a credit to the State, the Legislature ought
      to deal liberally with it. I am opposed to the amendment. A great State Institution cannot be
      kept up in this way.
     Mr. MCDONALD moved to amend the amendment by inserting $12,000.
     Mr. COX: I only want to say a few words on this subject. It does seem to me we ought to be
      proud of our State University. We know, as a matter of fact, that we cannot erect a building
      that will be a credit to the State of Indiana for much less than $25,000. I, therefore, hope
      this motion to strike out will not prevail, but that we will appropriate $25,000 as asked for
      by those who are most interested in this matter, and who know better than we how much it will
      take to erect this building. The Senator from Dubois (Mr. Trippett) is  the first person I ever heard say our State University is a
      disgrace to the State of Indiana. I want to say I know that is not true, and I believe that
      every member on this floor knows that it is not true. I do not believe it is just, or that it
      is right, to came here and say that our State University is a disgrace to the State of
      Indiana.
     Mr. TRIPPETT: I will explain my situation. My situation is simply this: that ever since the
      State University has been erected, it has been a rule that no person can attend unless he
      follows a certain prescribed course. No student can select his own studies; and everybody is
      barred but those who take the course adopted by the management.
     Mr. FOWLER [interposing]: Do you regard as a disgrace to the
      State?
     Mr. TRIPPETT: He is perhaps an exception; but the people of the State of Indiana, and of the
      United States, were disgraced on account of a President of that college.
     Mr. COX: I want to say, and I know whereof I speak, that there is not a Professor in our
      State University who is a disgrace to the State of Indiana. It is true that Prof. Moss did, to
      some extent, disgrace himself and perhaps the University, but the University will not be
      disgraced by the indiscreet acts of one man. I think I understand the Senator from Dubois. I
      understood him to say that the State University was a disgrace to the State of Indiana. I know
      he was mistaken when said that. I believe every citizen of Indiana can justly feel proud of
      that institution. I hope this motion to strike out will not prevail, and that we will
      appropriate this $25,000 to erect a building there that will be a credit to the State of
      Indiana. I say that our State University is not second to any educational institution within
      the State of Indiana, but that she stands head and shoulders above any other institution of
      the kind in the State.
     Mr. DUNCAN, of Brown: I hope these various amendments will not prevail, but that the Senate
      will leave the amount as it is in the bill. I apprehend every Senator on this has been
      astonished at the statement of the Senator from Dubois (Mr. Trippett). He seems to have a
      monopoly of information that pertains to educational affairs. I say upon the floor of this
      Senate that if we had all our State institutions together in one place, we have as many
      professors standing as high in the estimation the people of the country as they have at Ann
      Arbor. And we would have as fine buildings, perhaps. I am convinced the Senator from Dubois
      knows nothing about the educational interests of the State--especially the University at
      Bloomington. I hope Senators will vote upon this question in the interest of the educational
      institutions of the State, and that you will vote for the erection of buildings that will
      stand for a long time, and a less amount than $25,000 as stated in this bill, cannot possibly
      supply that demand.
     The amendments were rejected.
     As was also the motion to strike, out.

    COMMITTEE REPORT.
    INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    IN SENATE.
    
     SATURDAY, March 28, 1885.
    
    [Omitted from the top of page 108, vol.23.]
    
     BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
     Mr. SMITH, of Jay, from a special committee, returned the claim for Brevier Legislative
      Reports heretofore authorized, ordered, accepted and bound by the State, [see Senate Journal
      of 1885, page 398*], and, also,
      the bill [S. 336],† to pay for the
      same, with a lengthy report thereon, which was printed under an order of the Senate. It is as
      follows:
     MR. PRESIDENT:--The undersigned, members of the
      Special Committee to whom was referred Senate Bill No. 336, with instructions to inquire into
      and report the facts concerning the liability of the State to Mr. Drapier for the compilation
      of the Brevier Reports for the years 1879, 1881 * Senator BAILEY presented a claim of William H. Drapier for Brevier
       Legislative reports of the debates and proceedings of the 51st, 52d and 53d General Assembly,
       heretofore ordered and authorized, amounting to $18,778.81, which was referred to the
        Committee on Claims.--See Senate Journal, 1885, page 398.
      † See pages 546, 647, of
       this book. and 1883, which includes the Fifty-first, Fifty-second and Fifty-third
      General Assembly of the State of Indiana; and, also, the facts as to the value of the said
      Brevier Reports, beg leave to report as follows:
     The committee have taken the testimony of W. R. Myers, Secretary of State, and of Mr. W. H.
      Drapier. The committee has also caused a compilation of the resolutions passed from time to
      time in relation to the State taking such reports, and have caused the pages of the House and
      Senate Journals since 1857 to be set out, and herewith make the evidence and copy of
      resolutions a part of this our report.
     From the facts, as we get them, we are of the opinion that there is no legal binding
      contract between Mr. Drapier and the State, whereby the State agreed to take the reports. Mr.
      Drapier, however, has reported the debates of the Legislature since 1857, and has received
      therefor the uniform price of two-thirds of a cent per page per volume, up to 1879, which has
      been paid by the State, on resolution adopted at the close of the session, except where, in
      some instance, the resolution empowered the Doorkeeper to employ Mr. Drapier to make such
      reports.
     We are unable to give the value of the reports, as such reports are not put on the market
      for sale.
     We are of the opinion, that by resolution passed by the General Assemblies of 1879  1881 and 1883, it was the intention of the Legislature to
      take such reports at two-thirds (⅔) of a cent per page per volume, and that by mistake in the
      form of resolution the same was not paid, and, also, because of the failure of the specific
      appropriation bill.
     We find that Mr. Drapier has placed the reports in the office of the Secretary of State, and
      that the claim, so far as the thirteen thousand one hundred and ninety-eight dollars and
      forty-four cents ($13,198.44,) is concerned, is the amount found due Mr. Drapier, provided the
      resolutions had been in the form of concurrent resolutions.
     We also find that the State has caused some of said report to be bound, and that it paid for
      said binding.
     We further find that no resolution has as yet passed in this General Assembly authorizing
      the payment for said reports for this Legislature, but we would recommend the passage of the
       resolution* introduced at this
      session of the General Assembly.

     House Resolution No. 83, by Mr. Mosier:
     MR. SPEAKER:
     I move that the Secretary of State is hereby directed to send to each member of this House,
      officers and clerks thereof, five copies of the Brevier Reports, and each of the House and
      Senate Journals, as soon as they are pritned and bound, and the acts of the present
      session.
     Mr. Heffren offered the following amendment: Amend by inserting "The acts of the
      present session."
     The amendment was agreed to.
     And the resolution as amended adopted.
     I, S. W. Edwins, Principal Clerk of the House, hereby certify the above resolution
      authorizing the Brevier Reports, &c., was passed the House of Representatives this 5th day
      of March, 1883.
     S. W. EDWINS, Principal Cl'k House of
       Representatives.
     WM. D. BYNUM, Speaker House of
       Representatives.
    
    
     EVIDENCE BY W.R MYERS, SECRETARY OF STATE.
     Question. what, if anything, do you know, either personally or by the records on file in
      your office, about any contract, written or oral, between the State and Wm. H. Drapier
      concerning the compilation and publication of the Brevier Legislative Reports?
     Answer. I know of nothing except the joint resolution of the House and Senate of 1883,
      authorizing the publication of the Brevier Reports of that session. I have heard further
      contracts discussed by other State officers and Mr. Drapier, but know nothing of my own
      personal knowledge.
     Q. Did the State at any time within the six years last past receive from Mr. Drapier any of
      such reports, and, if so, under what circumsatances were they received; state fully?
     A. My understanding is that Mr. Drapier has for a great many years published the Brevier
      Reports, and they have been received by the State, and that there is a very considerable
      difference of opinion between the State officers and Mr. Drapier as to the amount of money due
      him for said reports. Of this I have no personal knowledge other than the action of the
      Legislature from time to time in regard to the same. The Legislature of 1883, by resolution of
      each branch of the same, authorized the publication of a certain number of copies, the exact
      number of which I cannot tell without reference to the resolution. These reports Mr. Drapier
      published, and, as I understand, presented his claim or bill for to the Auditor of State, who
      refused to audit the same, and the matter was then referred to the courts, and was decided
      adversely to Mr. Drapier. In the meantime Mr. Drapier presented to me his Brevier Reports, the
      number of which I can't remember, which I declined to receive, for the reason that I did
      not, in any way, wish to implicate the State. I did, however, permit Mr. Drapier to deposit
      the same in the basement of my office, where they now remain.
     Q. Did the State at any time within the last six years have any of these reports bound, and
      if so, for what purpose?
     A. I found in my office a number of copies bound in paper covers, the same as those now
      deposited, of the Fifty-third General Assembly. As to whether the State authorized the binding
      I know nothing
     Q. Were any of the Brevier Reports of the Fifty-third General Assembly delivered to the
      Secretary of State, and if so, what was the number of copies, in what condition, under what
      circumstances, and by whom were they delivered?
     A. Mr. Drapier now holds a certificate from me showing the number of copies of the Reports
      of 1883, which were deposited in the basement of my office, as stated above, all of which is
      more fully answered in the reply of the second question.
    
    
     EVIDENCE BY WM. H. DRAPIER.
     Question. How long have you been compiling these reports?
     Answer. Twenty-seven (27) years.
     Q. How many reports, on an average, have been furnished each General Assembly?
     A. Seventeen hundred and fifty (1,750) copies uniformily, making a fraction over eleven (11)
      copies to each member of the General Assembly.
     Q. Has the General Assembly, by resolution from time to time, since the commencement of the
      compilation of these Re-  ports by you, authorized the
      publishing of and the payment for such reports by the State?
     A. Yes, as shown by tabulated statement herewith submitted and marked Exhibit "A,"
      made a part of this answer.
     Was there a resolution offered and adopted by the General Assembly of 1881 and 1883,
      authorizing the publishing and payment of these reports?
     A. Yes, as shown by Exhibit "A."
     Q. Does the exhibit made and filed by you as a part of answer three (3) show the pages of
      the Journal of the Legislature from time to time, where such resolutions ocurr.
     A. Yes.
     Q. Was there at any time since the commencement of the compilation of these reports any
      contract, written or oral, between you and the State by which you were to compile and furnish
      such reports to the State, and for which the State agreed to take the same at any stipulated
      price?
     A. Yes, there were a number of contracts as the statement marked "A" will
      show.
     Q. Has there at any time, been any objection on the part of the General Assembly to your
      appearing on the floor of the House or Senate, and reporting and compiling the reports of the
      proceedings and debates of the different sessions of the Legislature, in the forms in which
      the Brevier Reports have been made?
     A. Never in all these twenty-seven (27) years.
     Q. What has been the uniform price for these reports, and by whom has it been paid?
     A. The uniform price paid is two-thirds (⅔) of a cent per page, per copy, and has always
      been paid by the State.
     Q. Do you sell copies of these reports to any person or persons, other than the State?
     A. Never, excepting perhaps in a half dozen instances, and then only as a custodian.
     Q. Do you mean by the last answer the whole number of volumes published in any one year?
     A. No, I mean that I have sold only single copies and I can not now recall but three
      instances of this kind,--not to exceed perhaps, half a dozen, as stated in my answer to the
      last question.
     Q. Is there any instance in which no price has been fixed for these reports?
     A. In every order the price is uniformly stated, as the tabulated statement will show.
     Q. What is the reasonable value of these reports?
     A. Compared with the compensation received by me for similar services, during my
      professional life of 35 years, the Brevier Reports are worth more than double the price the
      State has ever paid me for them.
     Q. How much is due you, from the State, for these reports for the year 1879, for the regular
      and special sessions of the Fifty-first General Assembly?
     A. My claim for the regular and special sessions of 1879--volumes 17 and 18--is five thosand
      six hundred and forty-seven dollars and forty-two cents ($5,647.42).
     Q. How much is due you, from the State, for these reports for the year 1881, for the regular
      and special sessions of the Fifty second General Assembly?
     A. My claim for the reguar and special sessions of 1881--volumes 19 and 20--is six thousand
      eight hundred and eighty-eight dollars and fifty-five cents ($6,888.55).
     Q. How much is due you, from the State, for these reports for the year 1883, for the regular
      session of the Fifty-third General Assembly?
     A. My claim for the regular session of 1883--volume 21--is four thousand and eighty-two
      dollars and thirty-eight cents ($4,082.38).
     Q. What did the Court find to be due you for these Reports at the time of adjudication, in
      the Marion Circuit Court?
     A. Thirteen thousand one hundred and ninety-eight dollars and forty-four cents
      ($13,198.44.)

        This to Certify, That Mr. W. H. Drapier has this day deposited in this office what he
         claims to be l750 copies of what he terms the Brevier Legislative Reports of the General
         Assembly of 1883.

        Under the foregoing resolutions I presented my claim as heretofore set forth to the
         Auditor of State and demanded a warrant therefor. The 
          Auditor
          Audidor
          questioned the legality of its payment under the resolutions, and refused to draw
         his warrant for any part thereof. To obtain an interpretation, and to determine whether I
         was entitled to receive a warrant, I commenced anaction by mandamus in the Marion circuit
         Court against the Auditor. The Court gave me judgement for the several amounts, less
         interest, charges for binding, etc., embracing only the number of days of each session and
         the number of pages of each volume at the usual and customary price of two-thirds of a cent
         per page per copy for the 51st, 52nd and 53d Assemblies--being volumes 17, 18, 19, 20 and
         21; that is to say:
        
         
          For the regular session of the 51st Assembly
          $2,903 04

        The State by her Attorney General Appealed to the Supreme Court, and that Court, in 95
         Ind., p. 33, held: First, that by reason of said Senate resolution not being concurrent
         with the House resolution; Second. That for said 53d General Assembly the amount not being
         a liquidated or stated sum; and, Third. That said 53d General Assembly could not pay out of
         its appropriation for expenses of that session for services rendered it at a preceding
         session; that therefore the relator could not recover.
        I therefore ask the 54th General Assembly to make an appropriation for such Brevier
         Legislative Reports as have been authorized, ordered and sanctioned heretofore by the
         General Assembly as shown by the Senate and House journals for twenty-seven years past, at
         the same price uniformly paid by the state since 1857, conformably to the usage and custom
         of the Indiana Legislature for a quarter of a century.

        Received, June 22d, the above 19½ signatures, for binding.

     And Whereas, on mandate proceedings in the Marion Circuit Court to determine questions
      thereon raised, said Court did give judgement for the sum of $13,158 44, for the number of
      pages only at ⅔ of a cent per page per copy, the uniform price heretofore paid therefor,
      embracing the debates and proceedings of the Regular and Special Sessions of the 51st, 52nd
      and 53rd General Assembly of the State of Indiana, being vols. 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21.
     And Whereas, on an appeal therefrom by the State, the Supreme Court has held that such
      action by said Senate and House, should have been concurrent, for the then present session,
      for the payment of said Brevier Legislative Reports, of their debates and proceedings, and
      further, that said Assembly, neither by its Senate or House could appropriate by resolution,
      moneys in payment of legislative expenses of preceding sessions. Therefore,
     Section 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Indiana:
     That the sum of (13,158 44) thirteen thousand one hundred and fifty-eight dollars and
      forty-four cents, be and the same is hereby appropriated out of any moneys in the Treasury not
      otherwise appropriated, in full payment to William H. Drapier, Stenographic Assembly Reporty
      for the Brevier Legislative Reports of the debates and proceedings of the Regular and Special
      Sessions of the 51st, 52nd and 53rd General Assembly of the State of Indiana.
     Sec. 2. An emergency existing for the immediate taking effect of this act, it shall be in
      force on and after its passage.

       JAMES H. RICE, Auditor of

     Among the record of proceedings had in the Circuit Court of the county of Marion, in the
      State of Indiana, in the above entitled cause, are the following:
     On the 14th day of September, 1883, that being the 17th judicial day of the August term,
      1883, of said Court, before Hon. Joshua G. Adams, sole Judge thereof, the following
      proceedings were had herein:
     And the Court being fully advised in the premises, doth thereupon order and direct that the
      defendant, Auditor of State, keep and retain, subject to his warrant as such 
       Auditor
       Audiior
      , on the Treasurer of State, the sum of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) of the
      amount appropriated by the Fifty-third (53rd) General Assembly of the State of Indiana to
      defray the expenses of said Assembly convened at the Capital of said State, January 4th,
      1883.
     And the said Auditor of State is hereby enjoined and restrained from directing or causing
      said sum of money, or any part thereof, to revert to the General Fund of said State in the
      office of the Treasurer of State until final proceedings may be had in the above entitled
      cause, and until the further order of this Court.
     And afterwards, to-wit: On the 22d day of September, 1883, that being the 24th judicial day
      of the August term, 1883, of said Court, before the same Honorable Judge, the following
      proceedings were had herein, viz:
     Comes now the relator by Oliver M. Wilson his counsel, and comes the defendant James H.
      Rice, Auditor of State, by Francis T. Hord, Attorney General of the State of Indiana, and this
      cause is submitted to th Court, for trial, finding and judgment, and the Court having heard
      the evidence and arguments of counsel, and being fully advised therein finds that the
      allegations of plaintiff's petition are true, and assesses his claim and damages at the
      sums and figures following, that is to say: for the regular session of the 53d General
      Assembly begun January, 1883, the sum of three thousand six hunddred dlollars ($3,600); for
      the regular session of the 52d General Assembly begun January, 1881, the sum of three thousand
      three hundred and thirty eight dollars and eighty-six cents ($3,338.86); for the special
      session of the 52d General Assembly begun March, 1881, the sum of two thousand and ninety-five
      dollars and forty-two cents ($2,095.42); for the regular session of the 51st General Assembly
      begun January, 1879, the sum of two thousand nine hundred and three dollars and four cents
      ($2,903.04); for the special session of the the 51st General Assembly begun----,1879, the sum
      of one thousand two hundred and twenty-one dollars and twelve cents ($1,221.12).
     It is therefore considered, adjudged and ordered by the Court that the plaintiff recover of
      the defendant, Auditor of State, the said several sums so assessed, to-wit: the sum of $3,600
      for the regular session of the 53d General Assembly, 1883; the sum of $3,338.86 for the
      regular sesion of the 52d General Assembly, 1881; the sum of $2,095.42 for the special session
      of the 52d General Assembly, 1881; the sum of $2,904.04 for the regular session of the 51st
      General Assembly, 1879; and the sum of $1,221.12 for the special session of the 51st General
      Assembly, 1879; and said sum writ herein is made peremptory upon said Auditor to pay the same,
      and it is further considered, ordered and adjudged by the Court that said Auditor of State
      draw his warrants for the respective sums herewith and herein awarded and declared to be due
      plaintiff herein in obedience to the command of said writ.
     And it is further considered, ordered and adjudged by the Court that the said plaintiff,
      William H. Drapier recover of the said James H. Rice, Auditor of State, the sum of thirteen
      thousand ninety-eight dollars and forty-four cents in full of said several claims and amounts
      so founad adjudged as due and owing together with his costs herein laid out and expended,
      taxed at----dollars.
     In the evidence of the relator is the following question and answer:
     Q. What was that five hundred dollars allowed you for in 1877 for your services in the
      session of 1875?
     A. I considered it as paying me for attendance as stenographic reporter--simply ply
      attendance at ten dollars a day--which would amount to six hundred dollars; and I considered
      the five hundred dollars--if it has to go in that way--would go as such, for attendance; and
      so I wrote under my name on the warrant the word "protest;" I protested against
      receiving that, as was stated in the resolution, in full; I had written the resolution myself
      for the entire amount--
     The following is all the evidence of John Carton in his examination-in-chief:
     Q. State your name and profession?
     A. John Carton; printer.
     Q. State what if any printing you did for the State for the Fifty-first and Fifty-second
      General Assembly?
     A. I don't know as I did any printing; I did some binding for them.
     Q. I mean binding?
     A. I bound--I think it was for the Fifty-first and Fifty-second Assembly.
     Q. What did you bind?
     A. The Brevier Reports.
     Q. How many copies of each, do you remember?
     A. I don't exactly know; I think it was somewhere near fifteen or seventeen
      hundred.
     Q. On whose order did you bind them?
     A. The order or the Secretary of State.
    
    
     SUPREME COURT DECISION.
     Considered in the most favorable light to Drapier, the complaint presents the case of an
      unliquidated and uncertified claim against the State, for the payment of which no provision
      has been made by law, and which cannot consequently be paid without further legislation.--See
      195 Ind. p 47.
    
   
   
   
    BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS, OF THE INDIANA LEGISLATURE.
    PROSPECTUS--To the 56th General Assembly:

    The undersigned proprietor of the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE
      REPORTS respectfully represents That thirty-one years ago we organized and
     executed a plan of independent unpartizan Legislative Reporting (the first ever attempted west
     ofthe Alleghanies having regard to fullness and completeness as to the matter and the
     parliamentary forms) upon which we have printed our Reports at a cost to the State less by
     one-half than any similar job of the State's printing: That our work proved acceptable to
     the General Assembly and received acts for authorization and pay; That it has been maintained
     and has received similar acts of endorsement by every General Assembly since; and we
     respectfully submit that under this usage of the General Assembly we have a fair constructive
     permission and invitation to continue our independent work of elaborating and offering the BREVIER REPORTS.
    Volume twenty-five of the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS of the Proceedings and Debates of the Indiana Legislature will cembrace
     reliable short-hand sketches of the Journals, Proceedings and Debates of both Houses of the
     Fifty-6th General Assembly of the State of Indiana, convened at Indianapolis city, in regular
     session, the 10th day of January, A. D. 1889. It will contain imporant motions, and verbatim
     sketches of the Debates,--presenting without partizan bias the position of every member on the
     floor, with the yeas and nays in every question of moment on which they shall be ordered and
     taken.
    The coming session will without doubt, be usually interesting and the BREVIER REPORTS will be, as it has been for 31 years the only source
     froma which reliable reports of the Debates of the Legislature can be obtained. This has been
     found to be the best and most economical means of presenting to the people an intelligible
     journal not only of what is done, but of what is said in the General Assembly, together with a
     reliable account, in proper legislative forms, of the order of the doings and sayings of the
     people's representatives.
    W. H. DRAPIER,
    Indianapolis, Indiana.

    

    Your attention is specially directed to that paragraph in this Prospectus which challenges
     any one to point out a partial report in any of the twenty-four volumes printed. And while
     thinking about the impartiality of these Reports, consider also how difficult a thing it is for
     men to write about questions of great public interest without indicating their own individual
     opinions, and you can then pardon the pride with which the compiler of the Brevier Reports
     points to their stern integrity in every page of the twenty-four volumes which have been
     printed.
    More than a quarter of a century's experience has determined that the publishing of just
     parliamentary reports of the Proceedings and Debates of the General Assembly, such as are found
     in the Brevier Reports, is practicable, desirable and valuable. Twenty-three volumes of the
     Brevier Reports have been published without the protection of copy-right, and this alone
     demonstrates the fact that the price which has been uniformly paid by the State for the Brevier
     Reports is so very small it does not and has not in all these thirty-one years invited
     competition. And so the claims made in the Prospectus that this is by far the cheapest job of
     work of the kind ever done for any State should go unquestioned.
    In this life-work of the compiler he has striven to perform a service for the State that will
     become more and more valuable with the lapse of time; and, expecting some future General
     Assembly to authorize the publication of an abridgement of his report of the sayings and doings
     of her representative men when ranking as the fifth State in the Union, he is content to work
     for such consideration and such a monument, though the pecuniary compensation is small.
    For nearly two score years it has been a cherished desire of the compiler to see the citizens
     of Indiana kept as fully, if not better, informed of the doings of their immediate
     representatives than the people of any other State in the Union. And in furtherance of that
     idea, he has hoped the General Assembly would authorize the printing of the Brevier Legislative
     Reports of its Debates and Proceedings every night, and a order passed authorizing each member
     to furnish a list of 20 or twenty-five names--including every newspaper office, every reading
     room, every county Clerk's office, every Cross-Roads Post-Office, and every country Inn,
     Tavern or Hotel in the State--to which these Reports shall be sent by the Printers, their
     voucher to be the Postmaster's receipt, as provided by law.

    Not a line of the Brevier Reports of Debates of the 56th Assembly will be made up from the
     columns of any newspaper, but from the short-hand notes of our own corps of reporters.
    The undersigned submit that these Reports are indispensable to the history of legislation in
     the State, of great value to the people at large, especially to politicians, and every public
     man; and that their value is increased by time.
    We propose to pursue the publication of our BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS. But there is now this difficulty about our work:
     we are unable to contract with either of the morning papers in this city for the daily printing
     of our Reports of the Session in their newspaper.--Therefore, since our Reports of the coming
     Session cannot appear in the papers, and to provide against restrictions of space in the daily
     papers by which the reports were heretofore marred and excluded, we propose to contract for
     printing outside of the daily press, so as to insure a complete and satisfactory record. These
     contracts involve an inevitable expense of money on our part, which is barely justified by the
     State's authorization of the purchase of the number of copies of the Reports which have
     been ordered for thirty-one years in the Specific Bill or by resolution of every Assembly since
     1857.--The price is less than one-third which is paid by the State for the work of the Reporter
     or the Supreme Court.
    The past, we think, teaches plainly enough, that unless the General Assembly were to
     establish a special Bureau for Reporting and Printing, involving new offices and additional
     public expensiveness, which should be avoided by all means consistent with reasonable
     carefulness for the information and welfare of the supervising people been accepted by every
     General Assembly for thirty-one years is the best, and certainly it is by very much the
     cheapest way to escape the evils of partial Reporting in the interest of rings and factions. We
     think, also, that the general acceptance of our Reports thirty-one years justifies the
     expectation that the Legislature will not now forego the advantages of these contributions to
     the history of its work.
    So, pledging diligence and fidelity for completeness and impartiality, larger space and
     improved facilities for printing, we hope you will regard it as respectful, and but the part of
     common prudence for us to ask members of the Gen'l. Assembly for some expression, in
     advance, in favor of the continuance of these Reports, upon which we may proceed with the
     printing of another--the 25th--volume of our Reports.

    The Compiler of the Brevier Legislative Reports deems it reasonable that, along with the
     announcement of another volume the twenty-fifth--he should declare some of the considerations
     which encourage him to make it. His father--who, with him, originated this work--was of the
     staff of writers organized for Verbatim Reports in Congress at the expense of the treasury in
     1848, which gave to history the Congressional Globe, and the Congressional Record. In 1857,
     seeing the general appreciation of these national works, and with some notion of their value,
     these reporters adventured their hands in connection with the local daily press, for reports of
     Proceeding and Debates in the Indiana Legislature. This connection with the daily press has
     proved unfortunate, though the demand for the Brevier Reports has protracted it, under all the
     difficulties involved, until the close of the last Session of the General Assembly.
    These difficulties conisist principally, perhaps, in the unfitness of the vanishing newspaper
     for any complete historical depository: but there were others which appeared at once, and
     increased with the growing municipality of Indianapolis. Whilst the Brevier Reports could not
     pretend to absolute completeness as to the records of proceedings and debates, its completeness
     has proved to be too much for the newspaper: and the newspaper worked against the Reports by
     restricting the space for the Reports. So the connection was made sometimes with the newspaper
     of one political bias, and sometimes with that of another bias, but always with the same result
     of unfitness and clashing of interest and whims.
    Gathering from these experiences, that it has become a purpose accepted and determined by the
     people of the State to continue the Brevier form of their legislative records as the cheapest,
     the best, and the best provocative and sign of the popular demand for more acceptable
     legislative reports by the press at large, the undersigned has made an arrangement to publish
     another--the twenty-fifth volume.
    These Brevier Legislative Reports have been acceptable to the Legislature for more than a
     quarter of a century. The work has stood sternly on its merits with each particular session
     since; and it is offered again with the ability and desire to make an abridgement of the State
     Legislative Record in the best form and at the cheapest rate. The principal thing is the
     requisite readiness, energy and ability of the party to undertake it, and to hazard the
     expensiveness of the reporting, printing and submission of the work.
    W. H. DRAPIER, Stenographer,
    Indianapolis, Indiana.

    

    In this submission of the Brevier Reports we have not been mistaken as to
     the common and growing public demand for just and intelligenst public records. We have tried to
     meet that demand, and to provoke parties abler than we are to supply it as it ought to be
     supplied. And we still suppose that the representatives of the people know what they want in
     this matter--know whether it is better to do everything here at the Capitol by memory and word
     of mouth than to I stand upon a fair and open record for history.
    We have proceeded strictly upon the presumption that the people's representatives know
     what is due to the country and to themselves in this matter of a record of their legislative
     action. And if there is any consideration against the continuance of the Brevier except that of its cost, the same conceit is as much against the lobbies and
     open doors for the sessions of the General Assembly; and it is at least one hundred years too
     late for secret sessions.
    The work can not be done by jobbers for the money that has been paid for it; and as to the
     standing contract price of the work, it carries that on every page: for "two-thirds of a
     cent a page per copy" it is furnished to the proper accounting officers of the State in
     printed sheets, procured in every item of its cost at our own expense.
    The Brevier Legislative Reports have been acceptable to the Legislature
     and the people for thirty-one years. The work has stood sternly on its merits with each session
     since 1857 and it is offered again with the ability and desire on the part of these reporters
     to make such an abridgment of the State Legislative Record in the best form and at the cheapest
     rate.
    Considering the difficulties and opposition incident to such a work; the contingencies of
     failing health and failing purse, and failing at length to make an acceptable offering of the
     work, there is nothing in the offering of it on our part but hard work, and the good name of
     unswerving workers, much very delicate personal responsibility, and some pecuniary
     hazard.--(large for our means--) and, last and at the best, but small pay.
    Inasmuch as the Indiana General Assembly for 31 years has authorized the publication of the
      Brevier Reports, it is regarded respectful and a duty to continue a proffer
     of the service that has been acceptable to the Legislature for so many years.
    None in the State are so competent to make a Legislative Record as the projectors of the Brevier Reports because the lives of no other Indianians have been passed in
     such like service.

    The issuing ofa Prospectus for the twenty-fifth volume of the Brevier Legislative Reports of
     the Proceedings and Debates of the General Assembly of the State of Indiana, combining the
     facile newspaper sketch with the most authentic record of the action had upon every important
     measure of the session, presents occasion for stating, that, it is part of their design to show
     the practicability of reforming the fashion of journalizing employed in most of the
     Legislatures of the Union; to suggest, that the Minute Clerk of each House of the General
     Assembly shall be a Stenographer, or all be required to employ such reporting force as may
     enable him to sketch every proposition in its order and in due form, with the debate and action
     thereon, and that he be required to contract for the printing of his journal in some newspaper
     printed in the town of Indianapolis, the day after the date thereof, conditioned that it shall
     not exceed a given reasonable amount of matter; the volume of the Journals of the two Houses to
     be but one book, made up from the columns of the newspaper. Let one copy be placed on the desk
     of each member of the Assembly every morning, so that if errors be detected they can be pointed
     out to the Stenographer before the noon recess, and the corrections made in the types before
     the printing is done for the book form of the Journals. And then let it be ordered simply, that
     a manuscript copy of the said Journal be filed with the Secretary of the State, as the law now
     is. Thus a saving of thousands of dollars, the cost of printing and binding the clumsy
     Journals, wou1d be induced, without adding anything to the expense of the clerkships; a
     readable and authentic journal of our legislation would be secured to the Public Archives and
     the newspapers throughout the country, instead of the awkward, unprofessional, unreliable
     matter which now passes for that; and the volume would then be in the binders hands complete
     and ready for distribution the day after the final adjournment of each and every session.
    In announcing to Assemblymen when the Brevier Reports have been ready for distribution, the
     Compiler has taken the liberty to suggest that "each member is expected, upon consultation
     with his colleagues, (in order to avoid sending two copies to the same place) to distribute
     these books in his District among the County, Township, Law Associations and other Public
     Libraries and Reading Rooms, County Clerks and Newspaper Offices, and such other places as may
     be deemed best."

    The particulars of Legislative expenses for the extra session of 1872, itemized in the
     Specific Bill approved Dec'ber 21, 1872, justifies our statement that the Legislature
     found the cost of the newspaper subsidies for legislative reports in this city to exceed that
     of the authentic Brevier.--The cost of newspapers for that session above that
     of the Brevier Legislative Reports was $356.73. The newspaper vanished, but
     the Brevier is extant with all its contributions to history.
    The Legislature finding that the cost of their newspaper subsidies exceeded that of the
     authorized BREVIER REPORTS, the subsidy was cut of by the
     act of December 19, 1872. By that act the newspaper became justly and legally recognized as but
     "stationery" for the people and their representatives, and, by implication, as
     unfitted and unworthy to be intrusted and authorized at the public expense as the depository of
     their solemn legislative records.
    The Brevier Reports have done for the people what the newspapers are unfit
     and unable to do in the matter of a just and stern legislative record; and the work has been
     done cheaper than the newspaper charges which have been paid out of tthe treasury for their
     partial, personal, restricted and unreliable matter called "Legislative
     Proceedings."
    The BREVIER REPORTS contain a record that is
     impartial,--not single partial report can be found in any one of the twenty-four volumes
     issued.
    The BREVIER Reporters in the 31 years of its publication have been careful
     chiefly to make their work here a good record, and rest its claims to the cherishment of the
     Legislature upon that alone. They have gone before no Committee, lobbied none, received no
     approaches for individual favor, nor shaped their work at any time with sinister or partizan
     objects. It has rested solely and all the time on its merits, its integrity and its fairness;
     and for these it has all the time received the favoring notice of the Legislature.
    As compensation should always be regulated by the skill required, there can be no question
     but that the pay for service but few are competent to perform should largely exceed the pay for
     labor that many are able to do. These Brevier Reports, in each page, contain
     more than three times as much matter as there is in one page of the Supreme Court Reports, yet
     the Brevier Reports are furnished to the state for two-thirds of a cent a
     page, while the Reporter of the Supreme Court has received three-quarters of a cent per page,
     besides the copyright.

    About the delay in paying for this work.
    The only history of legislation in Indiana since 1857 is found in the Brevier Legislative
     Reports. The same history shows that where one session or Assembly failed to make provision for
     the payment of any legislative expense, or other debt, the suceeding Assembly, by House or
     Senate, directed such debts to be paid out of such funds, at that present session appropriated,
     as either body might direct.
    It is no time to object to the payment for these Reports after they have been received by
     Legislators by Whose sanction and authority they were authorized and distributed. That they
     were not then paid for, was not Mr. Drapier's fault. They were authorized by the agents of
     the State, fully clothed with authority to bind the State by their actions which they have
     done. There was no law needed to institute them nor perpetuate them. The sanction of either
     House was a sufficient law unto itself to establish their character and impose upon the State
     the duty of paying for them, as an incident to legislation. This they have done, either
     separately or collectively.
     Whatever either branch of a Legislature declares, whether by resolution, order or vote,
     concerning its own rights or priviledges, is as much a law to it, to be executed, as its
     enrolled act is effective upon the people. Its orders are as obligatory, whereever and upon
     whomsoever directed, as the law it may make shall bind the subject.
    It would be a humiliating spectacle--a travesty upon the dignity and high privilege of either
     House, for one to ask approval of the other to pay its officers, or those whom it employed, and
     especially would it be perfunctory for the Senate to announce to the House: "We have paid
     the Stenographic Reporter, you needn't do it." If either House, as either may, direct
     him paid for what he does for the Assembly, that is sufficient notice to the other.
    It must be apparent to a fair judgment that in the exercise of its power, either House may,
     in providing for itself, direct also, as in this and many other cases, provision for the other
     House. Take even the orders for printing during each session,--in fact whatever is done in
     either House in the course of aid to legislation, is done with a purpose always of providing
     for the same wants and necessities of the other branch of the Assembly.
    The Senate makes an order for its payment upon the fund appropriated for its Legislative use,
     because it is one of the contracting parties, and its order is sufficient to recognize the
     debt, and its command or order in its own affairs is equivalent to any law made by the
     Assembly.
    It will further be noted that the Stenographer of the Senate is to report the proceedings of
     the present session. For whom? The Assembly, as shown by the order. He is to be paid, per page,
     for such reported matter. He is not required to bind them into so many volumes. Why? Because:
     First, this requirement is not made: and, second, it has ever been the custom and practice of
     the State's Representatives to recognize these Reports as Legislative records, as much as
     within the authority of the Constitution, directing the Legislature to keep a record of its
     proceedings as the records of any department or tribunial, and accordingly they, being the
     property of the State, the Secretary of State has in many cases been authorized to
     "procure the same to be bound," and where the authority has not been specially given,
     as State matter they have been bound and circulated with the laws and journals, and generally,
     when possible, distributed with them by that officer.
    Again, "The intention of the law-makers is to be derived, if possible, from the act
     itself, or from that, when considered in connection with other statutes upon the same subject,
     or from these things together, with cotemporaneous construction of, or usage under said
     statute."--17 Ind., p. 564.
    Nor are we without other statutes or precedents for this action of the Senate and House, as
     shown by their journals for the thirty years last past made in favor of Mr. Drapier, and upon
     which he has been paid without a single question of their validity, the State, in every
     instance, taking the printed sheets and binding the Reports.
    "In all legislation they [the two Houses] are practically one assembly as much as if
     they sat in one chamber."--May, etc., 20. "They are independent of each other, and
     sole judges of their rights and privileges." 4 Parl. Deb. 215. "Whatever is done in
     either House, is, in law a proceeding in Parliament, and an act of that high court at
     large."--May, etc., 161.
    Here are Legislative Reports running through several sessions, made at the instance of
     successive Assemblys, of purely legislative matter, the payment of which has by the parties in
     interest--the Assemblys--been "unprovided for." Shall it be said that because one
     Assembly did not pay for what it assumed to authorize, the debt is lost, and a succeeding
     Assembly cannot pay such debt? It is not a personal debt, it is that of the State, the
     consideration of which has been received by the factors, and shall not that State by its
     Representatives, whenever chosen, pay that debt? To do so it adopts a means by making an
     appropriation of so much money  to pay legislative
     expenses. What power is given under the Constitution to take from either House the right to say
     how, and for what legislative expenses that money shall be expended?
    The State has received her goods, but because of the failure of action at the last preceding
     sessions, at the end of each session, when only the Reports could be completed, and a demand
     made therefor, an order was given for their payment by the sessions of 1881 and 1883; the
     latter Senate recognizing the debt in full as just, due and unpaid, declared, as a trustee
     thereof, that payment shouid be made in full "for what may be due him" for the
     Brevier Legislative Reports. To argue that such action must be concurrent is equivalent to a
     doctrine, that liberty of action can only be exercised in a child after both parents have
     consented, when the consent of either is sufficient to bind the parent, in law, morals, and
     ethics.
    Not even they House, its co-ordinate branch, can interfere or question its right of
     expenditure, nor question its declaration of what it may consider an expense or debt due, nor
     the order and time of its payment. One House does not have to ask the other for permission to
     form its own judgment.
    If the Brevier Legislative Reports are not a part of these expenses of legislation, history
     is falsified since 1857, as many politicians can attest to their sorrow.
    The General Assembly, therefore, recognizing, and in obedience to the Constitutional
     provision, Sec. 21, Art, 1, that reads: "No man's particular services shall be
     demanded without just compensation," proceeds to appropriate a sum of money to pay for
     such services as it may require. It is to be supposed that this duty is faithfully performed at
     every session, especially where the service is of the importance to claim especial
     attention.
    The State has uniformly heretofore paid Mr. Drapier for his Brevier Legislative Reports of
     the debates and proceedings, two- thirds of a cent per page per copy. He was in this manner
     compensated, designated in the Senate's order as the "Stenographic Assemb1y
     Reporter." He was employed by the Senate--for their use, as well as for the Assembly. The
     Rouse received likewise the benefit of his labors in reporting its proceedings. The Senate
     provided for paying for these, what become, when united, Assembly reports.
    Mr. Drapier has been so long identified with the Legislature in connection with the Brevier
     Legislative Reports (for thirty years) that he has come to be recognized as the official
     Stenographic Assembly Reporter. No question has ever been raised against him occupying, as such
     reporter, the privilege of the floor. He has always been considered a necessary part of every
     session, and the Brevier Reports a part of the Legislature. He is there by sanction, and
     permissive authority, as a matter of course, and under section 10, article 4 of the
     Constitution, that reads, "Each House when assembled shall choose its own officers,"
     he is as much chosen, by their sanction of his presence, to report the proceedings of the body,
     as though pro forma elected. Because the pay of an officer is not commensurate with the
     services of a Legislative Stenographer, his compensation comes in the way shown by the Senate
     resolution, for which there are precedents for thirty years past.
    Sec. 2, Art. 15 of the Constitution, confers upon the Legislature the power to create
     officers not provided for in the Constitution.--33 Ind. 527. If it can so create a public
     office, each House can certainly provide for its own interests. Not only in the Senate did he
     become the Official Reporter, but in the House likewise, by an assistant performing like duties
     there. It is immaterial at what time during the session he is recognized as an officer; if from
     the first day of the session, the Senate and House, by silence, or any other way, with a full
     knowledge of his professional character and intentions, consented to their proceedings being
     thus stenographically taken, prepared and kept by him, and during the session gave their
     approval and sanction thereof, by their respective orders and resolutions for their payment and
     distribution to themse ves as members at the end of the session, they each severa ly affirmed
     his character and purpose and constituted him as much an officer of the Assembly as any one
     formally chosen for other and specific duties; and their resolutions and orders for his
     compensation became as obligatory as the act itself setting apart a legislative fund from which
     to pay such expenses.--"Such adoption relates back to the original transaction and places
     it on the same footing as if the authority had been conferrerd before the
     transaction."--Lawrence v Taylor, 5 Hill, 107, 113; Reynolds v. Dothard, 11 Ala. 431; 12
     N. H. 205. (Authorities are too numerous and unnecessary to mention, in support of this
     principle of law. If desired, they may be found ad infinitum in any work on Contracts, Title,
     Ratification, Agents.)
    Mr. Drapier, as Stenographic Assembly Reporter since 1857, in person superintended and
     compiled the Brevier Legislative Reports of both House and Senate, while in person he gives his
     special presence in the Senate. Will the Senate, therefore, permit her recognized officer to
     give his services without according to him "just compensation?" Because at a former
     session there was a failure to compensate him, does it follow that this Senate, or either
     House, is powerless to pay him and may disregard the labor of that session, or prior sessions,
     and refuse to pay him, though the half of that old Senate is present, and though previous
     Assemblys have received the fruit of his labors? Is it not a continuing debt, and is it not of
     such a character that it is almost impossible to provide for its payment, unless in the form of
     the  resolution usually adopted? For who is to determined
     but that Senate (or the House, as well), what it may owe that officer, under whose supervision
     those services were rendered, as well for the House as the Senate--and he cannot know until the
     reports are entirely completed and indexed--and who shall say when and how that officer shall
     be paid, other than either House; and who shall draw a dividing line in that appropriated fund,
     if the Senate o House does not, if the debt upon its face can describe the fond from which it
     shall be paid? Who can or shall estimate the debt but the Senate or House, the tribunal where
     this officer conducted his work?
    No concurrent action is required for either branch of the General Assembly to pay for its
     proceedings. Suppose the proceedings likewise of the House are embraced in the Reports; they
     thereby constitute the proceedings of the Assembly, and either House may secure and pay for
     what embraces their own proceedings, whatever else they may contain.
    The Senate declares, and the House recognizes by its orders for distribution of these
     Reports, that Mr. Drapier is the Stenographic Assembly Reporter; that is enough.
    While the State has allowed and paid interest on relator's claim, and though the law
     gives interest--Sec. 5200 R. S. 1881--the finding of the Court below was for the pages only,
     made for each session, at two-thirds of a cent per page, comformably to the legislative custom,
     usage and mode of paying therefor, and judgment was rendered for the several amounts.
    The resolution of the Senate is sufficient evidence not only of the recognition of this
     Stenographic Assembly Reporter, but as authority for his presence.
    "Where an agent is amployed generally to do any act, and there is a known usage of trade
     applicable to the particular case, the law raises a duty on his part to follow that usage to
     preference to any other course."--Chitty on Contracts, 19.
    "When such invariable usage is proved, it is to be considered as the basis of the
     contract between the parties, and their respective rights and liabilities are held to be
     precisely the same as if, without any usage, they had entered into a special agreement to the
     like effect."--Per Lord Ellenborough, Raitt v. Mitchell, 4 Camp 149. 1 Smith's
     Leading Cases, 305 et seq. in notes; Mixer v. Coburn, 11 Metcalf 559; Rogers v. Mechanics'
     Ins. Co., 1 Story C. C. 607, 608; Crosby v. Fitch, 12 Conn. 422.
    In a case before Best, C. J., in Sewell v. Corp., 1 Carrington & Payne Rep 392, it was
     held, that "if there be a general usage applicable to a particular trade or profession, a
     person employing another in such trade or profession will be taken to have dealt with him
     according to that usage."
    "There are also cases in which the law will imply a promise or contract to pay money,
     from the fact of there being a legal obligation to pay it, although the transaction in its
     origin was totally unconnected with contract and there has been no promise in
     fact."--Chitty on Cont. 23, citing 3 Bl. Com. 163; 1 Coit. Pl., 5th ed., 126, and other
     authorities.
    When the Senate, by its resolution, directed the payment of this debt it constituted such a
     legal obligation--upon a good and valid consideration. It thus constituted an agreement with
     the Stenographic Reporter to pay him for not only what he had already done for them, but for
     what he was then doing, at the uniform, usual price.--See Osborne & Rogers, 1 Saunders 264.
     85 Ind. 306.
    "The true principle of sound ethics," says Kent, 5th Ed., 556-557, "is to give
     the contract the sense in which the person making the promise believed the other party to have
     accepted it." * * "to search for the precise meaning and one requisite to give due
     and fair effect to the contract."
    The very sense and language of the resolution expresses a knowledge of the usage and custom:
     "the same price," as "uniformly paid," * the "number of copies" *
     * the "same as heretofore published"--words used in like resolutions at nearly every
     session for thirty years, would signify that there was a custom or usage known to both parties
     at the time the resolution was passed, and that such knowledge existed in the minds of both
     parties, and that both acted in reference to it.--see Bliven et al v. New England Screw Co., 23
     Howard 420, et seq.; Murray v Spencer, 24 Maryland Reps. 524; Foley et al. v. Mason et al. 6
     Maryland Reps. 43 et seq., wherein the above principles of law are affirmed.--Many other like
     authorities might be cited in addition to these.
    Again, it is a presumption of law that the parties to a simple contract bind not only
     themselves, but their personal representatives.--Mills v. Murray, 4 Exch. 843-865. Who did the
     resolution of '81, continuing these Reports, bind, if not themselves only, but the State,
     whose representatives--legislative agents, they then were?
    If in its wisdom either House sees proper to establish an officer in its assembly to so make,
     report and publish its Proceedings and Debates with an accuracy that only skilled and expert
     stenographers can attain, it is answerable only to those from whom it holds its power under the
     Constitution--the electors of the State--as representatives.
    Either House may compensate its own officers and employees under the law and under the
     Constitution, which gives each House full power as an independent body to regulate and govern
     its own proceedings and deliberations.
    
    Concerning the Claim against the State for Brevier Legislative Reports heretofore authorized,
     ordered, accepted and bound by the State:
    The unequivocal order for the publication of these Reports is of instant record on the
     Journals of both the Senate and the House of Representatives, and even where an order is made
     by one House only, a debt is incurred and the obligation to pay is as binding as if the order
     was made by concurrent action of both Houses; which is the fact in this case as to the binding
     in leather by order of the State Commissioner of Public Printing of four of the five volumes
     embraced in this claim, which binding was was paid for by special law; and these Reports were
     delivered to members of the Assembly, as is evidenced by receipts signed by them. A judgment
     for the principal sum named in this bill as payment for the five volumes was rendered in the
     Marion Circuit Court. The average cost of these five volumes of the Brevier Reports does not
     equal the sum paid for the Calendar of Business printed for the General Assembly, which is
     absolutely worthless five days after its date.
    Senate Bill No 233 [1887] proposes to pay for five volumes of the Brevier Reports ordered by
     a Senate resolution passed April 15, 1881, and a Senate and House resolution passed March 5,
     1883. The State bound four of these volumes by order of the Commissioners of Public Printing
     and Binding; the binding was paid for by special law, and members of the General Assembly have
     received and individually receipted for them. The Circuit Court of Marion county rendered a
     judgment for the principal of the sum named in this bill, and a bill passed the Senate of 1885
     allowing the same amount, but it remained in the hands of a House Committee till the last hour
     of the last legislative day.
    
     
      
       SENATE BILL NO. 333 [1887.]
       An Act election a State Legislative Stenographer, and declaring an emergency.
       Section 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Indiana, Insasmuch as
        William H. Drapier has acted as such Stenographic Reporter for the last twenty-nine years,
        he is hereby elected State Legislative Stenographer, to serve so long as he shall faithfully
        discharge the duties of the office, and as compensation for such services the Auditor of
        State shall issue warrants on the State Treasury, payable out of any moneys not otherwise
        appropriated, for what may be due him for the same number (1,750) of copies of Brevier
        Legislative Reports, at the same price as heretofore paid, two-thirds (2-3) of a cent per
        page per copy, as has been uniformly allowed and paid to him by the State for said Reports
        since 1867, and for years before, under resolutions and acts, in exact and identical words,
        as to price and number of copies.
       Section 2. The Bureau of Printing is directed to have said Reports bound, as heretofore,
        by the State, and said Stenographer is directed to forward ten (10) copies to each member of
        the General Assembly as soon as possible.
       Section 3. Whereas, An emergency existing for the immediate taking effect of this act, it
        shall take effect and be in force on and after its passage.
      
     
    
   
   
    ERRATA:--The oath of the official Stenographer will be found on page 966 of the Senate
     Journal of 1887--not page 996 as erroneously printed on page 2 Brevier Legislative Reports vol.
     XXIV.
