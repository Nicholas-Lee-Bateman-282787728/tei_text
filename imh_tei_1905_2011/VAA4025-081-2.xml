                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in the spring and summer of 1861, members of a small denomination known as the
                    Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, were beset with an agonizing moral quandary. Their
                    longstanding adherence to the peace testimony—that all wars were unlawful in the eyes of
                    God—stood in marked contrast to the great moral issue of liberating the slaves. For years
                    Quakers, who inaugurated the antislavery movement, had toiled relentlessly to ameliorate the black
                    man's impoverished existence. Now, their fervent commitment to the bondsmen's
                    emancipation and their love of country competed with their traditional pacifist beliefs.</p>
            <p>Although this conflict of conscience confronted Quakers all over the nation, this essay concentrates
                    on those Friends who lived in Indiana during the war years, 1861–1865. Indiana provides
                    fertile ground for an examination of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> responses to war. In the aftermath of Fort Sumter this midwestern state, under the
                    adroit leadership of Governor Oliver P. Morton, enthusiastically supported President Abraham <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s efforts to restore the Union. Men flocked by the thousands to enroll for
                    military duty, and citizens in scores of Indiana communities aided the military venture through
                    voluntary donations of money and materiel. Caught up in the wartime excitement, the Quakers of
                    Indiana could hardly ignore the martial spirit which had engulfed their neighbors and friends. As a
                    group, the Quakers composed less than 2 percent of the total population of the state on the eve

                    organized into monthly, quarterly, and yearly meetings, resided in approximately thirty Indiana
                    counties. (See appendix.) In addition to personal correspondence, cemetery records, public
                    documents, and secondary references, church records of fifty-five monthly meetings in twenty-seven
                    counties were consulted in the preparation of this essay. (See appendix.) Analysis of these rich
                    primary sources focuses upon those Friends who challenged two centuries of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> thought on war and took up arms in defense of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>From the onset of war, two of the yearly meetings to which Hoosier Quakers
                    belonged—Indiana Yearly Meeting and Western Yearly Meeting—steadfastly urged
                    Friends to adhere to Biblical teachings and abstain from all war-related activities. Quakers were
                    encouraged to follow the Gospel and do all things that made for peace: "Blessed are the
                    peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> As the
                    conflict progressed, however, some Friends joined the armed forces. In response, the admonitions of
                    Indiana Yearly Meeting concerning military service increased in intensity and earnestness of
                    condemnation. In 1862 Indiana Yearly Meeting expressed regret at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> military involvement in the war. Although Friends felt much sympathy for these men, the
                    yearly meeting warned them not "to give way to do what your conscience
                        condemns."<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Two years later the same body recorded its
                    "emphatic disavowal of all such services, as contrary to the Gospel of Christ, and ... our
                    religious society."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Similar statements also came from the yearly
                    meetings in <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Dublin</settlement>
                    </placeName> and from the editors of <placeName>

                    </placeName> publications.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Unquestionably, the wording of these sharp and

            <p>Assertions of the traditional belief that war is un-Christian have led historians erroneously to
                    assume that few Friends actively participated in the Civil War. Margaret H. Bacon, historian and

                    Indiana Yearly Meeting of 1862 received reports that one hundred of their members from five monthly
                    meetings had volunteered for the army; a "considerable number" from ten additional
                    meetings also served. Had there been even two hundred serving from the latter ten congregations, the
                    author declared, the total would have remained at only three hundred soldiem<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>In a study of the attitude of the northern clergy toward the South during the war years, historian <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chester</settlement>
                    </placeName> Dunham wrote that when actual fighting commenced, Quakers maintained their pacifistic
                    principles just as they had since colonial days. Quite simply, Friends believed that war was
                    irreconcilable with the teachings of Christ and refused to participate in the hostilities.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Historian Emma Lou Thornbrough recorded that "some" Quakers
                    volunteered for military duty, and Stephen Weeks wrote only that some young Friends in the North
                    joined the Federal army.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Eminent <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> historian Rufus Jones commented that while deviations from the peace testimony occurred
                    more frequently than expected, the total number of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> soldiers "appears small." Possibly three hundred members of Indiana
                    Yearly Meeting, asserted Jones, took up arms in the Civil War. Moreover, of those Quakers who joined
                    the armed forces more came from urban areas than from rural meetings.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> Elbert
                    Russell and Peter Brock, both of whom relied heavily on Jones's work, reached the same
                    conclusion: only a small number of Friends enrolled for military duty.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

            <p>But the preceding historians, as with most historical scholars, did not undertake systematic studies
                    to determine how many Quakers took up arms in the conflict. Heretofore, generalizations on the
                    numbers of Quakers in uniform during the Civil War have been based on "probabilities and
                    surmise rather than statistical fact."<hi rend="sup">11</hi> As a matter of fact, Jones

            <p>Just how many Indiana Quakers joined the northern armies between 1861 and 1865? And how did the
                    monthly meetings deal with these veterans during the war years and after they returned home from the
                    battlefield? Because the question of the number of Friends who enrolled for military duty is
                    inextricably intertwined with the treatment of Friends by the monthly meetings, the latter question
                    must be addressed first. In the midst of the war virtually all monthly meetings, recognizing that
                    some of their members had violated the peace testimony, attempted to extend care to those
                    individuals. Once each year, in response to the annual questions, or "queries," on
                    the religious and moral health of the meetings, most congregations reported that some Friends had
                    strayed from the principles of peace and were guilty of engaging in military services. Never was the
                    name of an individual listed in such statements, but a few of the meetings did include the specific
                    number of Quakers who they believed had violated church discipline. In September, 1861, for example, <placeName>

            <p>Despite the fact that they were often solicited and were frequently a prerequisite for remaining a
                    member of the Society of Friends, condemnations reveal that some Quakers admitted fault for having
                    enrolled in military service. Moreover, there was no feeling of triumph for these men; many were
                    truly sorry for their military actions. Early in the war a professor at Earlham College wrote that
                    some of the Quakers who had returned home from the battlefield "look with sorrow on their
                    past course and are striving to justify themselves."<hi rend="sup">27</hi> In all,

            <p>A large number of veterans from virtually all monthly meetings whose records were examined, however,
                    refused to admit wrongdoing for their military involvement. If Quakers denied any wrongdoing in
                    their martial actions, the committee that dealt with them reported the soldiers as "treated
                    without satisfaction." After a period of deliberation the meeting either extended
                    additional care to those Quakers, in hopes of eliciting acknowledgments, or disowned them. If the
                    monthly meeting chose the latter course of action, "testifications" of disownment
                    were written and read at a subsequent meeting. The committees later informed the ex-soldiers of the
                    decisions against them. The following disownment was excerpted from the <placeName>

                    partial explanation for what appears to have been contradictory, inconsistent, and anomalous
                    behavior. Several themes emerge from these introspective personal accounts in regard to what factors

            <p>Some Friends joined the army for patriotic reasons. Quakers repeatedly asserted that they loved their
                    country and were willing to obey the laws of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> government under which they had been guaranteed religious freedom. Many Quakers
                    ardently believed that, by enlisting in military service, they were not only loyally following their
                    country but serving God as well. These Christian soldiers, convinced that the federal government was
                    justified in taking offensive measures against the Confederacy, expressed confidence that God would
                    exonerate <placeName>

                    </placeName> soldiers contended that there was a "right" war and just cause for

                    </placeName>, Indiana, was an exemplary patriotic warrior. He, as with some Friends who joined the
                    military, invoked the deity not only to justify or perhaps rationalize his own and the
                    government's militaristic actions, but to give guidance to those in command of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    motives," unite the country, and extinguish the "unholy rebellion." To
                    him there was no course of action except to stand by President <placeName>

                    </placeName>—anything less would most certainly lead to failure. He insisted that he had
                    acted from pure and patriotic motives since the inception of the war and had not had "one

                    quelling the insurrection. The other rationale could be called national patriotism, also a strong

            <p>Some Friends also volunteered, no doubt, because they were very young and could not comprehend the

                    uniform ranged from twelve to fifty-nine, the largest age group of Friends (and non-Friends) who
                    served in the Civil War from Indiana were the eighteen-year-olds. But at least one hundred <placeName>

                    recruitment, public rallies, parades, and picnics—replete with brass bands and speeches
                    filled with patriotic jargon—were held in cities and towns across Indiana in and near <placeName>

                    swayed even the most devout Friend to join the struggle to save the Union. Newspaper advertisements
                    of such gatherings were often printed in bold-faced type to catch the eyes of virtually every
                    reader. Some of these youthful Friends may also have been influenced to bear arms by a brother or
                    brothers already in the service. Examination of <placeName>

                    the use of bounties in recruitment were powerful incentives to financially distraught Friends in
                    Indiana. Although the pay was low (thirteen dollars per month for infantry privates throughout most
                    of the war), the first few months of the hostilities were beset by depression. Intermittent
                    joblessness faced many men until 1863; furthermore, farm and factory wages remained low. Army life
                    offered the assurance of an income, although small and dependent upon the continuation of the

            <p>Several Quakers also enrolled for military duty for defensive purposes when Confederate General John
                    Hunt Morgan invaded the state of Indiana in the summer of 1863. Morgan's raid into southern
                    Indiana, late in the evening of July 8, created much excitement, fear, and conflicting and
                    exaggerated rumors—prompting Governor Morton to issue a call for citizens to organize for
                    defense. In less than forty-eight hours 65,000 men volunteered to repulse Morgan's daring
                    raid. These "Minute Men" were organized into thirteen regiments and numerically
                    designated from the One Hundred and Second to the One Hundred and Fourteenth inclusive.<hi rend="sup">70</hi> Companies in which Quakers volunteered, frequently titled by colorful names
                    such as Buck Tails and Liberty Tigers, were found in nine of these regiments. Although only the
                    southern counties were imminently threatened, Quakers from central Indiana also responded to
                    Morton's call. Quakers from the counties of <placeName>

                    crossed the Indiana border into Ohio five days later, the crisis subsided and the Minute Men were
                    mustered out of service.<hi rend="sup">71</hi>

            <p>Only a few Quakers entered military service as draftees and substitutes—and for good
                    reason. Like most of the Union soldiers who answered the call to arms and enrolled in the armed
                    forces through voluntary enlistment, Quakers also sought to avoid the stigma of forced service and
                    to receive the bounty money given only to volunteers.<hi rend="sup">72</hi> Clearly, Quakers viewed

                            Buckner, which was in a perilous position in 1863. Morgan ignored direct orders to operate

            <p>Quakers who remained on the homefront cited antislavery sentiments as a motivator for military
                    service. As noted earlier, a few letters and some of the histories of monthly meetings indicated
                    that some Friends saw nothing wrong with utilizing war to help free the slaves; by taking up arms
                    they compromised one <placeName>

                        <region type="county">Hamilton County</region>
                    </placeName>, wrote early in the war that Quakers were entering the army inspired with abolitionist
                    enthusiasm. Convinced that the war would terminate the institution of slavery, Elliott, who later
                    volunteered for military service, declared that "it is my duty to abolish this curse from
                    the nation."<hi rend="sup">76</hi> Similarly, James O. Bond, author of an unpublished

                    </placeName> Civil War veteran, implied that fear of the spread of slavery to the whole nation
                    prompted Quakers to bear arms.<hi rend="sup">77</hi> John W. Griffin, a Friend from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spiceland</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>

                    of the federal government. Thus, Griffin asserted that neither the New Testament nor the early
                    writings of the church fathers required rigid adherence to the doctrine of pacifism.<hi rend="sup">78</hi> Finally, historian Thomas Drake declared that Friends saw the Civil War as Gods way of
                    punishing a nation of slaveholders. He also noted that the abolitionist Levi Coffin believed that
                    the war would continue until slavery was abolished.<hi rend="sup">79</hi>

            <p>Interestingly enough, the idea that freeing the slaves prompted Quakers to enroll in the armed forces
                    was conspicuously absent from the letters written by the soldiers themselves. Some <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> correspondence, nevertheless, indicated that these combatants were curious about blacks
                    and at least one soldier was convinced that slavery had brought on the war. Early in the conflict
                    one <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in response to his parents' inquisitiveness about the
                    "darkies," wrote home that he had not yet seen any blacks; they had all been
                    "run farther south."<hi rend="sup">80</hi> Several weeks later he wrote that the

            <p>The collective military record of the Society of Friends in the Civil War undoubtedly is linked to
                    the question of motivation. Evidence suggests that the reasons for the initial enrollment are indeed
                    similar to the incentives for reenlistment, acceptance of promotion to higher rank, and completion
                    of terms of service. As one <placeName>

                    </placeName> soldier struggled with the same predicament. Ultimately, he decided that, since he had
                    withstood the hardships thus far and borne the responsibility for the safety of his friends back
                    home, he could harbor no thought of leaving his regiment. This man chauvinistically wrote that he

            <p>In all probability, however, a thorough analysis of the question of motivation can neither be fully
                    determined nor clearly understood. Indeed, many of the soldiers themselves may not have comprehended
                    the complex issues behind the commencement of hostilities well enough to know why they were
                    fighting. The abolition of slavery, preservation of the Union, and, of course, patriotism were
                    exceedingly emotional, if not simplistic, concepts that overshadowed the points of dispute between
                    the North and the South. Too, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> concept of the Inner Light, the inward spirit that granted each individual the freedom
                    to follow his own conscience and that seemingly could have vindicated Friends' military
                    actions, fails to provide the historian with a satisfactory answer to the perplexing inquiry.</p>

                    the armed forces.</p>
            <p>First of all, significant numbers of men, caught up in the "prevailing excitement,"
                    saw the "lure of far places" as a way to seek change in their lives. The war and
                    military service, then, could broaden the horizons of those who had never had the opportunity to
                    travel. Once the fighting began, Friends and associates already in the service coaxed those at home
                    to join the hostilities. In 1863 the federal government adopted the first conscription plan,
                    providing an additional impetus to enlistment. In order to avoid the "stigma of forced
                    service" and to obtain the bounties awarded to volunteers, thousands of men rushed to
                    enroll for military duty. In particular, the expectation of economic rewards served as an incentive
                    for financially distressed men. Furthermore, some veterans indicated that love of country and
                    "hatred of those who seemed bent on destroying its institutions" impelled them to
                    join the fight for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Wiley also noted that a desire to emancipate the slaves spurred some men to enlist in
                    the army, although very few soldiers actually expressed this motive. Finally, preservation both of
                    the Union and the country's system of government prompted many men to participate in the
                        war.<hi rend="sup">91</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Clearly, the writings of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> soldiers evince much of the feeling and flavor discovered by Wiley in other
                    manuscripts. It appears that the motives of Quakers differed insignificantly from those of the
                    soldiers of Wiley's massive study. Once the war was set in motion at Fort Sumter, the
                    incentives for enlistment transcended the religious scruples of those Friends who were determined to
                    fight. <placeName>

                    soldiers."</p>
            <p>One final consideration needs to be addressed. In the broader context of <placeName>

                    </placeName> history in the Civil War era, the fact that 1,198 Friends bore arms and that 596
                    remained undisciplined may be indicative of a loosening of the strict code of behavior to which
                    Quakers had been bound. Research shows that church discipline had begun to weaken during the years
                    of the Civil War and that deviations from the code were not uncommon. Throughout the decade of the
                    1860s many Friends faced charges for a wide number of violations such as: marrying a non-Friend, not
                    attending meeting, using profane language, departing from plain speech and dress, and drinking. Some
                    of these Quakers lost their memberships <list type="footnotes">

                    "the application of the Discipline to the lives of Friends became increasingly
                    relaxed." Not only was disownment for violations of the peace testimony gradually
                    abandoned, but punishment for nonadherence to other <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> beliefs also abated. By the end of the nineteenth century, except for "serious

            <p>Historian Daniel Boorstin wrote that the greatest failure of the Society of Friends in America was
                    its rigidity of beliefs and unwillingness to compromise. Writing specifically about the period
                    before the American Revolution, Boorstin noted that "Quakerism had many qualities which
                    would have suited it to become the dominant American religion."<hi rend="sup">99</hi> But
                    Friends' increasingly uncompromising dogmas throughout the first half of the eighteenth
                    century laid the foundation for a wall that was built around the Society, by the mid-1750s. As
                    Quakers gradually withdrew from society, their chances for growth waned, too. The <placeName>

                    </placeName> story in America, then, according to Boorstin, was "one of the greatest lost

                    </placeName> monthly meetings after the Civil War perhaps show that Friends tried to compromise to
                    avoid further loss of membership. Since Friends had been reluctant to proselytize before and during
                    the Civil War, membership lists were shrinking. Needing to stave off this decline, the Society
                    increasingly reduced the penalties for violations of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> discipline. Indeed, historian John William Buys's assessment that the
                    "Civil War proved a watershed ... [for] the Society of Friends" may be correct.<hi rend="sup">101</hi> Elbert Russell would have agreed with Buys. Russell asserted that the Civil
                    War "made a definite break in the history of American Quakerism." The war forced
                    the Society out of its "official isolation," which was brought on by adherence to
                    the peace testimony, and compelled many Quakers to reexamine the pacifist tradition.<hi rend="sup">102</hi>

            <p>Rufus Jones viewed the enlistment of <placeName>

                    </placeName> soldiers as part of the weakening of the peace testimony rather than as part of the
                    overall loosening of the code of behavior. Jones noted that at the time of the Civil War the rank
                    and file membership possessed little more than a "traditional adherence" to the
                    antiwar stand. Quakers gave little serious thought to war, and for most Friends it was an
                    "unexamined inheritance." Although the formal position of the Society was one of
                    opposition to all wars, in the "lives of individual members, however, ... [the
                    incompatibility of war with Christian ideals] had not become a settled, dominant, first-hand

            <p>Indisputably, the Society of Friends was faced with a serious moral dilemma when the Civil War began

                    the North and the South. Even possible estrangement from both family and the religious community
                    failed to convince these men that they had made the wrong choice. And while the percentage of
                    Quakers in service was low in comparison to the percent of all Indiana men who enrolled for military
                    duty, this author's findings show that virtually all historians who have written about
                    Quakers in the Civil War have erred in their estimates.</p>
            <p>As Henry Steele Commager wrote, the war did not "come to an end, psychologically or
                    emotionally, with <placeName>

                    Friends was again confronted with an ethical quandary. The need to solve this dilemma compelled each
                    monthly meeting to decide what should be done in regard to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> military service. Statistics show that opinion was anything but unanimous on the
                    treatment of ex-soldiers. Unquestionably, then, the impact of the Civil War was felt not only by
                    active <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> participants but also by those Friends who remained at home during the war and who,
                    upon cessation of hostilities, sat in judgment of their brethren. The larger ramification is that
                    violations of the peace testimony appear to reflect a general breakdown of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> discipline and signal a gradual relaxation of the code's application over the
                    next five decades.</p>
            <p>Thus, far more Quakers from Indiana fought in the Civil War than has been generally known. In itself
                    this finding is profoundly important. This powerful evidence dispels the myth that has been
                    perpetuated by historians for over one hundred years that Quakers, at least in Indiana, refused to
                    fight in the Civil War. It is hoped that this investigation, while limited in scope, may provide the
                    needed incentive to probe more closely the activities of Friends in other states during the Civil
                    War. Only then can historians adequately assess <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> participation in the war and the war's impact on the entire Religious Society
                    of Friends.</p>

                        Margaret E. Hirst, author of <hi rend="i">The Quakers in Peace and War</hi>, asserted that the
                        number of Friends could be as high as 20,000 by the time of the Civil War. Rufus Jones, <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                        </placeName> historian and author of <hi rend="i">The Later Periods of Quakerism</hi>, wrote
                        that the membership of Indiana Yearly Meeting, which at the time of the Civil War also included
                        Friends who resided in <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                        </placeName>, was in excess of 20,000. According to the Indiana Yearly Meeting Minutes of 1857,
                        1,800 Friends (male and female) from the ages of 15 through 19 resided in Indiana. The
                        percentage of this age group in the entire state of Indiana, according to the Federal Census of
                        1860, was 11.41, computed by dividing 1,350,428, the total population of Indiana, into 154,085,
                        the total number of persons in the 15–19 age bracket in Indiana. Dividing 1,800 by
                        1141 yields 15,776, the approximate number of Quakers in Indiana belonging to Indiana Yearly
                        Meeting circa 1860. For convenience sake this figure has been rounded to 16,000. Another Yearly
                        Meeting was established in Indiana in 1858—-Western Yearly Meeting. Therefore, the
                        estimate of 1857 includes those Quakers who, one year later, became attached to Western Yearly
                        Meeting. In addition to the previous numbers, a small group of Quakers called Hicksites lived in
                        Indiana for whom the author has no population figures. This group of Friends separated from the
                        main body (called Orthodox Friends) in the late 1820s and formed seven meetings in six Indiana
                        counties. The author will not distinguish between Orthodox Friends and Hicksite Friends in this
                        article. Although there were doctrinal differences between the two groups, the Hicksites
                        retained the peace testimony as part of their discipline. Unless otherwise noted, the term "<placeName>

                    <p>According to Willard Heiss, then, the fifty-five sets of monthly meeting minutes enumerated above
                        are the ones known to exist for the years 1861–1870. Admittedly, some Quakers have
                        not been counted in this survey. Due to the incompleteness of the birth and death records, some
                        soldiers who escaped disciplinary action may not have been counted. In addition, the minutes of

                        produced offerings or were disowned by their respective meetings for military service were
                        identified by a close reading of the monthly meeting minutes for the years 1861–1870.
                        In cases in which the monthly meeting minutes were not available, the author consulted

                        (also included in the Heiss work) of the monthly meetings. The soldiers' lists were
                        either obtained from county histories or from the eight-volume compilation of the war in Indiana
                        by W. H. H. Terrell, <hi rend="i">Report of the Adjutant General of the State of Indiana</hi>.
                        Since the birth and death records of the monthly meetings are far from complete, the author also
                        examined cemetery records of the counties in which Quakers lived. The Archives Division, Indiana
                        Commission on Public Records, has a file called "Veterans Graves
                        Registration," an alphabetical card catalogue, by county, of Civil War veterans buried
                        within the state of Indiana. This index, compiled for approximately fifty of Indiana's
                        ninety-two counties, was also checked against the birth and death records compiled by Heiss. The
                        counties that were researched by this method include Grant, Morgan, Howard, <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Huntington</settlement>

                        </placeName>, and Parke. The remaining cemetery records, encompassing a wide range of
                        completeness and also checked against soldiers' lists, were either found in county
                        libraries or the Genealogy Division of the Indiana State Library. County records researched by
                        this method include <placeName>

                        of Civil War veterans within their respective counties. Finally, a few names were discovered in
                        letters written by Quakers. This correspondence frequently included names of relatives and
                        friends who had joined the army.</p>

                        before the outbreak of hostilities was not included in the total of 1,198. In the course of the
                        author's research between 100 and 200 names were deleted for this reason. The only
                        exception to this was if the <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                        </placeName> was reinstated after the war or was buried in a <placeName>

                        appearing in the birth and death records who joined the Society of Friends after the war have
                        not <pb n="130" id="VAA4025-081-2-036"/> been included in the total number. To insure additional
                        accuracy the names and service records of all soldiers were compared with the official record of
                        military service kept by the Archives Division, Indiana Commission on Public Records, at the
                        Indiana State Library and Historical Building, <placeName>

                        </placeName>. If the age listed on the official record was not the same as the age determined
                        from the <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                        </placeName> birth and death records, that soldier's name was deleted. This way
                        soldiers with common names could be distinguished as Quakers or non-Quakers. One exception to
                        this was when the <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                        </placeName> soldier was under the legal military age of 18. Obviously some <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                        </placeName> soldiers lied about their age in order to enroll for military duty. Thus, their
                        official military record lists them as age 18 when in reality they were not yet of legal age. In
                        any case when there was doubt as to whether a soldier was a <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                        </placeName> or not, the name was dropped. Thus, the total number of 1,198 that the author has
                        documented is the minimum number of <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                        </placeName> soldiers in Indiana. Simple addition shows 1,200 Quakers in military service. Two
                        soldiers from <placeName>

                        military service and later died in the war. Hence, the number should be 1,198.</p>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, by Robert S. and Helen Merrell Lynd, says very little about the
                    town's small Jewish community. Indeed, the only specific indication that such a community
                    even existed comes as a kind of footnote to the prevailing Protestantism in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The Lynds mention that the Jewish merchants whose stores lined Walnut Street, the
                    major thoroughfare, faced a dilemma because the biggest shopping day of the week was Saturday, the
                    Jewish Sabbath, and retail stores generally closed on Sunday. The Lynds then note that there was no
                    uniform Jewish solution to this dilemma; some owners opened on Saturday, others closed their stores
                    on Friday afternoon for the entire weekend.</p>
            <p>The failure to study the Jewish community is not surprising given: (1) the intent of the sponsors of
                    the Lynds' work, the Institute of Social and Religious Research; (2) the criteria used for
                    selecting a town to survey; and (3) the Lynds' assumptions about the nature of both
                    American religion and society. The Institute of Social and Religious Research planned to survey an
                    entire community's religious practices, with the long-term goal of uniting all Protestant
                    churches in the country.<hi rend="sup">l</hi> In choosing <placeName>

                    Union Theological Seminary, he viewed traditional religion as a relic of preindustrial society,
                    doomed to die as society modernized. He did not regard religion as significant in itself but
                    conceived of it as a refuge for workers from the pressures of an industrial system.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Finally, to compound the problem, Lynds model of society was almost exclusively an

            <p>An opportunity to remedy this oversight came in 1979 when a local businessman, Martin D. Schwartz,
                    commissioned Ball State University professors Warren Vander Hill and Dwight W. Hoover to begin an
                    oral history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Jewish community. Schwartz was anxious to record the memories of the older
                    members of the commmunity since he feared these might soon be lost (a fear which was justified as
                    already three of the interviewees have died and several memories have faded). Nineteen persons,
                    ranging in age from sixty to ninety-three, were interviewed. The interviewers used as a guide a
                    questionnaire devised by the Indiana Jewish Historical Society, which was modified to include more
                    questions on social and physical mobility and family relationships. The intent was not merely to
                    record disparate memories of individuals and their families but to find a coherent pattern, if one
                    existed, in the total group experience. The next step was to compare this experience with that of
                    other groups in other cities and to compare the attitudes of Jewish citizens of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> with those explored by the Lynds in their classic work. In order to accomplish all
                    these goals, it was necessary to reinterview some persons and to obtain data from printed sources,
                    such as city directories and county histories, to supplement the information originally obtained.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            <p>The most striking quality of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Jewish population was its restlessness, as individuals moved in and out of
                    town searching for greater economic opportunity. The attraction to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> was usually the offer of a partnership in a scrap business or a job clerking in a
                    clothing store; the person making the offer was often a relative, either by blood or by marriage.
                    But the attraction was not strong enough to ensure permanent residence, as the migrant often moved
                    out again. Neither success nor failure assured that permanence. If successful as a partner or clerk,
                    the recently arrived migrant might open his own business in another, larger city. If unsuccessful,
                    he might seek a more promising future elsewhere. City directories and cemetery records provide
                    evidence of this mobility. Indicative of the restlessness of the Jewish population is the experience
                    of the Moses Cohen family. The Cohens moved in and out of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> so frequently that none of them stayed long enough to be buried in the town until the
                    death of Moses' great-grandson.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> The restless movement from town to
                    town in the nineteenth century certainly paralleled that of the typical urban migrant who, according
                    to Stephan Thernstrom, "moved through three or more communities before he settled down
                    around middle age."<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although individuals came and went, businesses often remained. An entrepreneur would come to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, often from a larger city such as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> with a significant Jewish population, and would establish a business. That person would
                    then employ other members of the family who would help expand the store. The original owner might
                    sell the store to one of these persons and move on. The name would change, reflecting the new owner,
                    but the business would not.</p>
            <p>This pattern of movement applied to Jewish migrants generally, regardless of national origin. While
                    most of the early migrants to <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the last decade of the nineteenth century. The first Schwartz to arrive was one of
                    three brothers. A native of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-lir">Lithuania</country>
                    </placeName>, Samuel Schwartz peddled shoestrings and shoelaces, then clerked in a shoe store before
                    opening the Economy Shoe House in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>. His brother Morris arrived in town about the same time to work as a salesman in a
                    clothing store. While Samuel settled permanently in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Morris did not. He left <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> and went to <placeName>
                        <country reg="aku">Alaska</country>
                    </placeName> where he promoted prize fights, among other things, and then returned to Matthews,
                    Indiana, to take advantage of the gas boom by manufacturing glass chimneys for kerosene lamps. While
                    there he employed the third Schwartz brother, Leo, to sell the glass chimneys. When the gas supply
                    dwindled, Morris returned to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> to open the Moxy Clothing Store, which specialized in expensive men's clothes.
                    His brother Leo worked as a traveling salesman for paper companies until 1920, when he too came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> to open a wholesale paper supply company. Here he remained until his death, but Morris,
                    ever restless, left two years later for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York City</settlement>

            <p>Another Polish-born migrant in the 1890s reversed the common tendency to change from scrap dealer to
                    clothing store owner. Abraham Feinberg moved to <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, in 1898. After selling clothes for two years, he went into the scrap
                    business, which he used as a stepping stone to a manufacturing career. He eventually owned <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> Cap and Set Screw Company and was reputed to be the richest Jew in <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>

            <p>The history of the temple best shows the division which existed in the 1920s between those who had

                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> had a Reform congregation. Perhaps it was because of the close proximity to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which provided both business and religious connections. In the beginning, as now,
                    Temple Beth-El relied upon student rabbis from Hebrew Union College because its size made a
                    full-time rabbi beyond its means. Perhaps the reason for its being a Reform congregation was a
                    conscious decision that this best suited Jews in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> since the situation in the town prevented practicing Jewish rituals.</p>
            <p>When interviewed by Whitney Gordon, the members of the Jewish community in the 1960s believed that
                    the temple was founded by "a very high calibre of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> Reform members. And that only later, especially after World War II, did the Orthodox,
                    Eastern European element intrude."<hi rend="sup">26</hi> Contrary to these beliefs, there
                    had been a considerable number of Orthodox, Eastern European Jews in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> at the time of founding. Further, none of the very old people who were interviewed by
                    Vander Hill and Hoover had come from the Reform tradition; there were even four whose fathers had
                    been Orthodox rabbis or who had studied for the rabbinate in <placeName>
                        <country reg="pl">Poland</country>
                    </placeName>. Even the survey which Gordon made to determine the religious roots of the community
                    belied the comments of those he interviewed. He found that 67 percent of the population had grown up
                    in Orthodox homes, 18 percent in Reform ones, 11 percent in Conservative ones, and 1 percent from
                    Sephardic, Christian, or nonreligious homes<hi rend="sup">27</hi> Yet the Jewish population of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> was a declining one in the 1960s according to the same persons; there had not been a
                    significant population transfer which would account for the large proportion of persons who had come
                    from Orthodox homes. The suggestion that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> Reform members were solely responsible for founding the temple thus appears untrue
                    since the Orthodox Eastern European element had such deep roots in the community.</p>
            <p>What appears to have happened was that Jews who came to the town, whatever their origin or religious
                    background, joined the congregation if they stayed long enough. Membership in the temple was a sign
                    of integration into the community, both the Jewish and the larger one. This process is illustrated
                    by the fact that when the congregation finally undertook to construct its own building in 1922, the
                    president of the congregation was Charles Indorf, a Polish-born Jew who was the only Jew who was
                    prominent in local municipal politics. The majority of the members had roots in Eastern Europe as
                    well.</p>

                    motivated primarily by religious considerations. One informant recalled that the Dobrows tried
                    unsuccessfully to convert the congregation to Orthodox late in the 1920s.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
                    Despite the early resistance on the part of the Golds and Dobrows, later both families joined the
                    temple. They had become more a part of the community and no longer looked elsewhere for support. As
                    a son-in-law of the Golds put it, they had mellowed.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

                    </placeName>. Few Jews refrained from working on Saturday or kept kosher homes. Burle Plank claimed
                    his father never worked a Saturday in his life nor did his mother violate dietary laws, but the
                    Planks were in the scrap metal and auto parts business which was somewhat removed from the center of
                    town and was less dependent upon Saturday business.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> A Jew selling clothes on
                    Walnut Street had more pressure to stay open on the main shopping day of the week. Similarly,
                    keeping kosher was difficult. Those who did, the Planks, Golds, and Dobrows, had to obtain the

                    Commerce, and the initial membership was largely middle-class. The Klan organizers soon broadened
                    the base of membership to include members from the working class, and, by 1923, the Klan claimed a
                    membership of thirty-five hundred, which would mean that 10 percent of the population had joined.
                    The Klan exerted more influence than even these substantial numbers might suggest because members of
                    the secret society held important positions in local government and law enforcement. The chairman of
                    the Board of Public Safety, Philip W. McAbee, was a Klansman, as was the Chief of Police, Van

            <p>While membership in the Klan was supposedly secret and the power exercised by the informal network of
                    Klansmen concealed, the Klan's presence was highly visible because of its staged public
                    spectacles. The most spectacular of all of these was a parade of two thousand members in June, 1923.
                    This display of strength, however, backfired when Klan members attempted to coerce bystanders into
                    showing respect for the <placeName>

                    persons who felt physically threatened were two prominent Munsonians, a former congressman, George

                    its more respectable members and, along with a schism in the ranks, marked the beginning of the

                        You know the [Klan's] idea of Americanism was to have a big fat gal seated on a white
                        draft horse with the American flag draped over its rump ... [with her] sitting on it. That was
                        the 100 percent Americanism of the day. In retrospect, I never felt that it was any threat to my
                        parents because [if it had been] I don't think we'd have gone up to see the

                    built by the YMCA in the 1920s with funds donated by the Ball family.</p>
            <p>The camp attracted Jewish boys who succeeded in winning scholarships. Alan Burgauer testified as to
                    his experiences at Camp Crosley: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Well, I got interested [in community affairs] by going to a Christian camp. I was eight years

                        <p>This is a peculiar circumstance as the school had what was called Bible study. When I was in
                            school, maybe a Freshman or Sophomore, I signed up for that [course]. I didn't know
                            what it was but ... it had a lot to do with Christianity. Course, I guess we didn't
                            believe in that, but I took a test and won. Bernard Freund did, too, a week to Camp Crosley
                            free. We got a 100 on the test.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>

                    </quote> Surprisingly enough, there was little parental objection to either participation in the

                        <p>My parents were a little bit concerned ... as to whether I should be studying the New

                    </quote> Part of the reason for lack of concern over participation in Christian exercises was the
                    perception that the values taught were close to those held in Jewish homes, or so Martin D. Schwartz
                    thought.</p>
            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>I would say that our home values were basically middle-class American. Great stress was placed on
                        the virtues of thrift and of work; the work ethic was extremely strong [as was emphasis on
                        learning]. The latter may or may not have been a middle-class value, maybe that was where Jewish
                        values came in. That was very important.... There was a lot of emphasis on bodily cleanliness
                        and mental cleanliness. A lot of this I suppose, if I think about it, could have been Protestant
                        or Puritanical. Yes, I'd say some of these values were Jewish, but there was an
                        enormous emphasis in my family on personal integrity, that you didn't lie, that you
                        were morally straight, the kind of things that H. A. Pettijohn used to teach us at the YMCA.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>

            <p>The case of Harry Pazol paralleled that of Anna Winick. His father, like hers, was a rabbi who

                    his son could not imagine anyone being more religious. To Harry, though, this goodness appeared to
                    go unrewarded. In his old age Harry's father journeyed back to the Old World with the
                    intention of visiting his birthplace, as well as Palestine: he died aboard ship before he even got

                            history, Jewish religion, and Jewish background. Of course, as I grew up a lot of this was
                            passed on to me, and my values are based on the religion, philosophically, which

            <p>The later arrivals from Eastern Europe were not the only Jews for whom religion had a low priority.
                    Those from Western Europe were equally secular. Rachel Lipp characterized her family in this
                    fashion: "Well, we were not Orthodox Jews. The background was completely <placeName>

                    unlike Rachel Lipp's: "The [Jewish] values were there; my parents observed them;

                    where anti-Semitism was openly articulated by the Ku Klux Klan. It meant residing in a community
                    permeated by Christian values, although these values did not appear completely alien. Despite the
                    discrimination and the pressures, Jewish Munsonians regarded themselves as little different from
                    their non-Jewish neighbors. Perhaps, in the end, the Lynds were partially justified in excluding the

            <p>In October, 1732, Jean-Charles d'Arnaud, a twenty-six-year-old officer in the Troupes de la
                    Marine, was appointed by New <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>'s governor general, the Marquis de Beauharnois, as commandant of the French
                    and Miami Indian post in the vicinity of modern <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Within two weeks of his arrival at the Miami post, d'Arnaud was to
                    participate in a chain of events that have been misinterpreted to this day, despite his observations
                    and conclusions.</p>
            <p>In the fall of 1732 d'Arnaud observed a mysterious illness that caused the deaths of some
                    three hundred Miamis and related Ouiatanon and Piankeshaw Indians in what is now the state of
                    Indiana. The inception and progress of the fatal affliction and the cure of several of the victims
                    were reported in writing in October of that year to Beauharnois by d'Arnaud. Although the
                    report contains sufficient information to support the officer's conclusion that the deaths
                    were the result of a "subtle poison" in the brandy that the Miamis had purchased

                    and their relatives died from a poisonous substance in the brandy.</p>
            <p>Despite his youth, d'Arnaud had been an officer for ten years and had served in a number of
                    the western posts, including an assignment as second in command at Fort Frontenac on the
                    northeastern shore of Lake Ontario in the late 1720s. Most recently he had been at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> where he had performed his duty "marvelously," in the words of the
                    governor general.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> At the time d'Arnaud assumed his first command at
                    the Miami post, the French were making desperate efforts to stop the Miami and other western nations
                    from trading with the English, particularly at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oswego</settlement>
                    </placeName> on Lake <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The French feared that the trade at this post, which commenced in 1724, was
                    "capable of causing the entire ruin of <placeName>

                    goods offered there by the Anglo-Americans proved irresistible to the French-allied Indians. Hardly
                    had the young officer arrived among the Miamis when a flotilla of their canoes returned from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oswego</settlement>
                    </placeName> with a large supply of brandy. D'Arnaud related the subsequent
                    "astonishing" events in an official dispatch to Governor General Beauharnois on
                    October 25, 1732: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The day after I had arrived at my post fifteen or sixteen Miami canoes arrived from <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Oswego</settlement>
                            </placeName> loaded with four hundred casks of brandy. Five or six days later they knocked
                            one in, in which there was the complete skin of a man's hand. This news spread
                            through the village and surprised them immensely. However, it did not put a stop to their
                            drunkenness; after three days two individuals who were fine in the evening were buried the
                            next day at eight in the morning. Then for more than three weeks, at least four died each
                            day. My statements to them that they had no decent food whatever in their village, and that
                            by dispersing in the woods they would find meat which would give them strength to fight off
                            the disease combined with the foul air (which the great number of bodies which surrounded
                            them created) persuaded them to go off to their winter quarters from which I have heard that
                            several were dying from time to time but not in as great numbers as in their village. (The
                            number of dead is presently one hundred fifty persons.)</p>
                        <p>The first did not astonish me at all; I attributed it to the excessive drinking. But the rest
                            astonished me more. I had the dead stripped and examined, and the conclusion for me was that
                            it was a poison as subtle as it was crafty, only taking effect after a rather considerable
                            time. I wanted to have more certain proof of this: a war chief of this nation who had become

                            I gave him a strong dose of orvietan which saved his life. In the same way I saved several
                            with this medicine, but not having any more, those who were deprived of this help all died,
                            and not one of those who used it perished.</p>
                        <p>The Miamis are not the only victims of this poison. The Ouiatanons came one hundred thirty
                            strong to perform the dance of the peace pipe. The brandy was not held back from them, but
                            after their return home, the same sickness overtook them and several letters from that
                            location informed me that almost all of them had died.</p>
                        <p>After their departure the Piankeshaws also came to visit the Miamis. The number of dead being
                            considerable, I told them about the desolation we were experiencing, informing them at the
                            same time that we were undergoing this disaster only because of the brandy that my Indians
                            had brought from the English. I added that coming to celebrate with their brothers it would
                            be unfortunate if they were to place themselves among those whom we were obliged to mourn
                            daily, and that the way to avoid it was not to stay long, but considering their expressions,
                            the brandy was a bigger chief than I, and thus they did not escape the sickness, since I
                            have received word that every day some of them were dying.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>Several modern historians familiar with d'Arnaud's report and findings have
                    concluded nevertheless that a smallpox epidemic decimated the Miamis and their relatives, the
                    Ouiatanons and the Piankeshaws. Including her translation of d'hrnaud's report in
                    her "Ouiatanon Documents," Frances Krauskopf writes: "The Miami, Wea, and
                    Piankeshaws all suffered many deaths in 1733 <hi rend="i">[sic]</hi>. Although the commandant at the
                    Miami blamed the casualties on a subtle poison which the English had added to four hundred kegs of
                    brandy the Indians had brought from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oswego</settlement>
                    </placeName>, it is much more probable that they died from smallpox, which was reported to be raging
                    among them."<hi rend="sup">4</hi> In a footnote to her translation of the report, Krauskopf
                    reiterates: "Probably the many deaths were caused by a smallpox epidemic; at any rate the
                    reports for the following year talked about the ravages of the disease in the Miami
                        country."<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Referring to d'Arnaud's conclusion she
                    concedes that there is a possibility, although unlikely, that poison was responsible for the deaths
                    of almost three hundred Miamis and their relatives. Her judgment is based on official correspondence
                    from Governor General Beauharnois written in 1733, which unequivocally reports the spread of
                    smallpox from the Five Iroquois <list type="footnotes">

            <p>What evidence, then, justifies reopening this case to challenge the smallpox theory? The first bit of
                    evidence is the nostrum that d'Arnaud administered to the Indians he saved. He specifically
                    named the medication "orvietan" in his account of the disaster, which Krauskopf
                    translated merely as "a very strong nostrum." Hoping to discover the nature of the
                    illness that d'Arnaud said orvietan cured, this author located and examined a number of
                    seventeenth-, eighteenth-, and early nineteenth-century pharmacopoeias describing this
                        medication.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> The <hi rend="i">Pharmacopée Universelle</hi>

                    most of these operators touted orvietan and "the marvelous efficacy of this infallible
                    antidote for all poisons and all venoms." Several tests of orvietan's
                    effectiveness as an antidote were recorded in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, but the judging and the procedures (administering poison to a pair of dogs and then
                    giving orvietan to one of them as an antidote) were of questionable character. One such instance in
                    1771 seems to have demonstrated orvietan's success, while another in 1697 proved
                        inconclusive.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, the five orvietan formulas examined in this research differ
                    widely in their composition, ranging from twenty-five ingredients in the 1697 <hi rend="i">Phurmopée Universelle</hi> to over fifty in the 1758 <hi rend="i">Pharmacopoea
                        Parisiensis</hi>. Four of the five, including Leméry's, contain an opiate.
                    If the orvietan used by d'Arnaud did indeed contain an opiate, the success of his cure may
                    well have been in controlling nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which might have been caused by a
                    toxin or poison in the brandy.</p>
            <p>A second piece of evidence appears in the commandant's report about his examination of the
                    stripped bodies of the dead victims. Obviously he was looking for skin lesions or other external
                    signs of a disease. The French in 1732 were well aware of the mortal danger of smallpox in the St.
                    Lawrence-Great Lakes region because of the periodic epidemics during the preceding one hundred
                    years. It is quite clear that d'Arnaud stripped the dead in order to search for indications
                    of this dread disease.</p>
            <p>If smallpox had been the cause of the deaths, d'Arnaud would have observed its unmistakable
                    symptoms. After an incubation of about twelve days, a moderate case of the disease is characterized
                    first by a very high fever (102 to 106°F), headache, severe backache, abdominal pain, and
                    vomiting. Three or four days later the focal eruption begins with painful ulcers on the mouth and
                    macules (reddish spots) which appear first on the face and forearms. These macules rapidly become
                    papules (pimples) which increase in number and spread from the face and distal extremities to the
                    trunk. In three or four more days the papules progress to vesicles (blisters) which become pustular
                    a few days later. The fever recurs with the formation of the pustules, which dry into foul-smelling
                    crusts and scabs that usually fall off three weeks <list type="footnotes">

            <p>It has been suggested that the French officers might have covered up an outbreak of smallpox;
                    however, the official correspondence previously cited shows otherwise. Governor General
                    Beauharnois's communique to the minister of marine, Jean-Frederic Phelypeaux de Maurepas,
                    on May 1, 1733, not only reports the spread of smallpox from the Iroquois to the Miamis and
                    Pot-awatomis, but adds that "the brandy that they had gone to get from the English also
                    contributed to their loss, and I must, My Lord, inform you of what was communicated to me by the
                    commandant of the Miamis about the extraordinary effects of this drink."<hi rend="sup">15</hi> Further, d'Arnaud himself reported a smallpox epidemic among the Miamis and
                    Ouiatanons on May 30, 1733, a message that Beauharnois transmitted to the minister of marine on July
                    24, 1733, and again on October 10, 1733.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> There are no indications of a
                    cover-up by the officers. Since the fort commander observed no classic smallpox or other external
                    symptoms, since a poison antidote saved all the sick treated with it, and since an opiate such as
                    orvietan could not have saved smallpox victims, the historians' distrust of
                    d'hrnaud's report is unjustified. Even if smallpox did strike the Miamis <hi rend="i">after</hi> the events described by d'Arnaud, a mass poisoning in 1732 cannot
                    be ruled out.</p>

            <p>An intriguing detail reported by the fort commander that adds to the likelihood of toxin in the
                    brandy is the presence of the complete skin of a man's hand in one of the brandy kegs,
                    suggesting that someone had tampered with the liquor. Most of the liquor traded by small merchants

            <p>This author consulted medical authorities who were unanimous in concluding that it was highly
                    unlikely that the skin as a contaminant could have produced the catastrophic effects. Further,
                    infectious or contagious diseases appear not to have been involved, and the introduction of a toxic
                    substance into the brandy remains the most likely cause of the Miamis' deaths.
                    D'Arnaud intimates that the poison ("as subtle as it was crafty") was
                    intentionally introduced into the kegs by the English ("we were undergoing this disaster
                    only because of the brandy that my Indians had brought from the English"); however, there
                    is no conceivable reason why the Anglo-Americans would want to kill their good customers, the
                    Miamis, who were becoming increasingly friendly with them and ever more disenchanted with the

            <p>It is obvious from the foregoing that a motive existed for disgruntled French traders or agents to
                    kill some of their erstwhile trading partners to discourage other western Indians from going to <placeName>

                    first, the Indians would be afraid to drink (and trade for) English liquor; and second, the blame
                    could be assigned to the English, not the French.</p>
            <p>While hard evidence for intentional poisoning is lacking, there is sufficient documentary evidence to
                    establish a motive for such an act, and d'Arnaud's contention cannot be lightly
                    discarded. At the same time, one cannot disregard the possibility of an unintentional contamination
                    of the brandy due to the undoubtedly unsanitary practices of the Anglo-American traders, who
                    regularly diluted the liquor at <placeName>

                    possibility is strengthened by Peter Wraxall's record of the Iroquois's statement

            <p>Whether the poisoning was intentional or unintentional, Governor General Beauharnois did not hesitate
                    to turn d'Arnaud's report to his colony's economic and political

                            whom he had it read decided to no longer trade with the Acadians who have English
                            merchandise and asked him to thank M. de Beauharnois and to ask the governor general to send
                            a large boat to them every year for trading, since they no longer want to do business with

            <p>In sum, a review of the evidence supports d'Arnaud's conclusion that the Miamis

                        <settlement type="city">Oswego</settlement>
                    </placeName> and not from smallpox, as other historians have written. At best, the contamination

                    catastrophe that struck down hundreds of Indians in what is today the state of Indiana. But whether
                    or not the poisoning was intentional, the case against smallpox as the cause of the deaths is
                    convincing. D'Arnaud's report is worthy of far greater credibility than that which
                    historians have assigned to it thus far.</p>

            <p>The preface to <hi rend="i">The Shawnee Prophet</hi> reveals how R. David Edmunds, a careful student
                    of Indian society and culture, gradually changed his views on the leadership contributions of the
                    two Shawnee brothers, Tenskwatawa (the Prophet) and Tecumseh. The author's examination of
                    manuscript sources relating to tribal affairs in the Old Northwest is very impressive. Edmunds
                    recounts that when he examined documents for the period 1805 to 1810, Tecumseh's name
                    hardly appeared. In contrast, the author mined several historical nuggets concerning the role of the
                    Prophet. He concludes that the Shawnee religious leader served as the "catalyst for the
                    Indian movement sweeping through the Old Northwest" (p. 92). Edmunds champions the role of
                    the Prophet, yet he concedes that after the Treaty of <placeName>

                    movement. Tenskwatawa and Tecumseh allied themselves and their followers with the British in the War
                    of 1812. Indian and British fortunes were dealt a heavy blow with Tecumseh's tragic death
                    in 1813 at the Battle of the Thames. The Indian cause never recovered. The British and American
                    governments refused to support the Prophet after the conflict. In summary, the religious
                    leader's life drifted for the next twenty years. Edmunds's narrative of the
                    Prophet's last two decades is little more than a sketch. About forty pages relate to the
                    period 1815 through 1836, the year of his death.</p>
            <p>The author has done much to rehabilitate the Prophet and to establish his true role as an Indian
                    religious leader. Yet upon Tecumseh's death, the Shawnee brother tried to become a
                    political leader but failed. While others maintained tribal positions of leadership,
                    Tenskwatawa's opportunism and self-doubt shadowed him constantly. His former influence was
                    gone, and he could never regain it.</p>
            <p>Edmunds maintains that the Prophet has always been in the shadow of his brother. He is correct that
                    Tecumseh has appealed to generations of white Americans because of their proclivity toward political
                    and military leadership. It is true, however, that Americans have also recognized religious and
                    cultural leaders who raised and maintained a faithful following or altered the direction of their
                    culture. A more detailed comparison of the <pb n="[171]" id="VAA4025-081-2-077"/>

            <p>George Rosen and Paul Starr, in their respective books, provide new and interesting insights into the
                    history of American medicine in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Although both authors focus
                    on the economic and social history of medicine rather than on the traditional history of
                    therapeutics, Rosen's book is written from the perspective of a historian, whereas
                    Starr's work is written from that of a sociologist.</p>
            <p>George Rosen's study of the structure of American medical practice was originally part of
                    the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>'s Richard H. Shryock lecture series. Rosen had intended to expand his lectures
                    into a book, but died before completing this important volume. The task of editing the manuscript
                    fell to Charles E. Rosenberg. Since Rosen left no text for his lectures on the period between 1941
                    and 1975, Rosenberg decided to publish Rosen's existing manuscript with the addition of a
                    bibliographic essay and a concise and well-written prologue summarizing American medicine in the
                    early nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>In the late nineteenth century, as Rosen explains, changes in both society and within the profession
                    radically altered medicine and the way it was practiced. Early nineteenth-century physicians
                    practiced their art in the patient's home and used therapeutics understandable to the
                    patient. By the end of the century, the treatments, which had become increasingly complex, were
                    administered either in the doctor's office or in an impersonal hospital setting. During
                    this same period, the profession also witnessed the growth of specialism, the improvement of medical
                    education, and the rise of public health services. Yet, despite the transformation of
                    medicine's structure, physicians only adopted those changes that safeguarded the private,
                    fee-for-service, solo practice of medicine. For example, doctors willingly opted for office practice
                    over home practice because they viewed the former as a method of economizing on their time and
                    resources. Physicians, however, opposed lodge and contract practice, dispensatories, and public
                    health clinics because they believed these forms of medicine undermined the private practice of
                    medicine by providing unfair <pb n="173" id="VAA4025-081-2-079"/> competition in the medical
                    marketplace. In short, Rosen claims that physicians controlled the market conditions of supply and
                    demand, which enabled them to shape the structure of medicine so that it encouraged professional
                    autonomy.</p>
            <p>It is indeed unfortunate that Rosen was unable to complete this well-researched economic and social
                    history of medicine to 1975. Although Rosen's work represents a significant contribution to
                    the understanding of American medical practice from 1875 to 1941, the book has a few shortcomings.
                    Rosen's coverage of the beginnings of the struggle for compulsory health insurance is
                    meager. Moreover, Rosen fails to explain how physicians gained the authority necessary to oppose
                    successfully alternative forms of medical practice. It is in the discussion of these latter two
                    topics that Paul Starr in his work on the history of American medicine is so successful.</p>
            <p>In his comprehensive, two-part work on medicine from 1760 to 1980, Starr masterfully incorporates the
                    techniques of sociology with methodology of social, economic, and public policy history to explain
                    the medical profession's rise to a position of prominence in the late nineteenth and
                    twentieth centuries. In his analysis of the medical profession, Starr draws upon a vast amount of
                    primary and secondary literature. His purpose is not only to sketch a history of the transformation
                    of medicine during this period, but also to examine the following questions: how were physicians
                    able to achieve cultural authority and power; why did hospitals, rather than public organizations,
                    become the major institutions for providing medical care; and why was there never a system of
                    national health insurance in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>In the first part of his work, Starr describes the physicians' attempts to achieve
                    professional sovereignty, or "cultural authority." During the eighteenth and much
                    of the nineteenth centuries, the medical profession was severely divided, financially insecure, and
                    lacking public esteem. In the late nineteenth century, discoveries in science and medicine helped
                    establish "legitimate complexity" in medicine. The demand for physicians increased
                    with improved transportation and the invention of the telephone. Yet, as Starr notes, these
                    developments alone did not guarantee physicians cultural authority. To gain authority and insure
                    their sovereign status, doctors had to end professional infighting, secure effective licensing
                    legislation, and limit the number of medical schools and medical school graduates. Systematically,
                    physicians were either able to eliminate or accommodate the many threats to professional
                    sovereignty. For example, in the middle and late nineteenth century, homeopathic medicine had become
                    popular and thus posed a serious threat to regular practitioners <pb n="174" id="VAA4025-081-2-080"/> Physicians initially excluded homeopaths from membership in the American Medical Association, but
                    soon realized that by including this group in their regular ranks, they would increase their chances
                    of securing licensing legislation. In the twentieth century, hospitals and other health care
                    organizations had become central to the practice of medicine. These institutions, too, served as a
                    potential menace to the sovereignty of physicians. Although doctors easily could have become
                    employees of hospitals, they were able to maintain their sovereignty while using the hospitals to
                    enhance their professional status. Thus, Starr, like Rosen, argues that physicians were able to
                    shape the structure of medicine—a structure that insured professional autonomy.</p>
            <p>In his second part, Starr examines medicine's transformation into a vast industry and
                    studies the role of the corporation and state in that industry. Starr thoroughly explores the
                    movement against compulsory health insurance, the structure of private medical insurance, and the
                    rise of Medicare and Medicaid. Starr notes that even as medicine became a giant industry in the
                    twentieth century, physicians were able to maintain their professional sovereignty. But, as Starr
                    adds, whether physicians will be able to maintain that sovereignty in the future is uncertain.</p>
            <p>Although Starr's work is more comprehensive than Rosen's, both books should be
                    required reading for medical historians and social historians, as well as anyone interested in the
                    health care industry.</p>

            <p>As the title indicates, this is a collection of essays on the general theme of the growth of federal
                    power in American history. What makes it rather unusual is that all the authors of these articles
                    are English or Scottish scholars who, with the exception of one or two, teach <placeName>

                    </placeName> history in English or Scottish universities. Although this collection is not a
                    festschrift in the usual sense of the word, all the authors are former colleagues, students, or
                    friends of William Brock, who pioneered in the teaching of <placeName>

            <pb n="175" id="VAA4025-081-2-081"/>
            <p>The format is twelve, twelve-page essays, each dealing with a different chronological period,
                    sandwiched between introductory and concluding essays by editors Bruce Collins and Rhodri
                    Jeffreys-Jones. Each author deals with some aspect of growing federal power or, nearly as
                    frequently, with the evolution and significance of a rationale in opposition to it.</p>
            <p>A point of view that most of the authors have in common is an implicit approval of the expansion of
                    federal power. As editor Jeffreys-Jones observes, this perspective may well stem from an English
                    trust in a powerful central government. Indeed, by way of an essay on Henry Carey, editor Bruce
                    Collins finds his modern American bête noire in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName> Friedman, whom he accuses of misusing history in his arguments against the welfare
                    state.</p>
            <p>As is usually the case with such collections of essays, the value of the works varies considerably,
                    and space does not permit an extended critique of each. It might be noted, however, that at least
                    two essays, those on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, D.C., race riots of 1919 by Adriane Cook and on the Peace Corps by Gerard T. Rice,
                    contribute nothing to the discussion of federal power. On the other hand, particularly stimulating
                    and sophisticated are the essays by David Turley on the abolitionists, by Anthony Badger on recent
                    historical research on the relationship of localities and the New Deal, and by Harold Hyman on the
                    current debate on the nature and value of federalism. All the essays indicate a familiarity with
                    pertinent recent scholarship, and a number show evidence of considerable research in archival
                    sources.</p>
            <p>For the most part these essays are worthwhile reflections on a significant topic. Their audience,
                    however, will be limited largely to professional historians and political scientists.</p>

                    (1958) does. This is pure institutional history. Admittedly, it is rather unique institutional
                    history—the history of General Motors or IBM would not read the same way—but
                    it is as close to being history in a vacuum as one could imagine for an organization that is so
                    complex and subject to outside forces.</p>
            <p>These are not negative comments. Indeed, Weigley's book is essential for anyone trying to
                    understand how the army works. By isolating that organization from society as a whole, Weigley has
                    been able to examine it from the inside, looking at the philosophies, struggles, successes, and
                    failures of the men who have shaped the army since the Revolution. In so doing, he follows the
                    argument that has existed throughout American history—whether to maintain a large
                    professional army or to rely on a citizen army to be raised when needed. There have been several
                    works detailing the ongoing debate within American society that balances concern for the cost of a
                    large standing army against the perceived need for sufficient military power to deter possible
                    aggressors. But few works have treated the army establishment's feelings on the matter.
                    Weigley does this well. As would be expected, most of the military leaders favored the professional
                    approach, subscribing to the philosophy of General Emory Upton in their disdain for the citizen
                    soldier and in their warnings of dire consequences if the nation did not maintain a large
                    professional army. Interestingly, however, not all leaders felt this way. There grew up, especially
                    after World War II, a large influential minority, led by the ideas of John McAuley Palmer, who
                    believed that the citizen soldier, if properly trained and led, could be as reliable as the
                    professional soldier. This belief not only made good sense to the American public and hence to the
                    politicians, but was also the only acceptable philosophy within the American tradition. The army
                    might work to strengthen its forces and hone its skills, but only inside the parameters imposed on
                    it by political reality.</p>
            <p>Weigley carries this discussion through his last chapter, which he added more than fifteen years
                    after the first edition. In dealing with the army and its problems during and after <placeName>
                        <country reg="vm">Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName>, Weigley concludes that the army would do well not to neglect its reserve forces.
                    Although a Soviet invasion of Europe would have to be fought and contained initially by the highly
                    professional and highly trained regular army with its extremely sophisticated weapons, Weigley
                    foresees an eventual stalemate developing that would necessitate quick involvement of the reserve
                    forces and the conscripted citizen soldier.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Explorers: Nineteenth Century Expeditions in Africa and the American West</hi>.
                    By Richard A. Van Orman. (Albuquerque: University of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName> Press, 1984. Pp. xiii, 243. Illustrations, maps, notes, index. $19.95.)</head>
            <p>During the past decade interest in comparative history has grown steadily, and <hi rend="i">The
                        Explorers</hi> is another contribution to the field. In it the author compares
                    nineteenth-century explorations in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> with those of the British in Africa. His general theme is that three types of ideas and
                    concerns motivated the explorers. These were a genuine interest in science and learning, a growing
                    nationalism, and the moral obligation to bring "civilization" to the so-called
                    backward peoples of the two continents. The author finds that, while acting on these interests, the
                    American and British explorers actually advanced the process of imperialism and colonialism.</p>
            <p>Considering the issues topically, Van Orman discusses the myths surrounding the American West and
                    much of Africa. Then he considers the native peoples, the environment, the explorers, and the
                    results of their actions. He shows that, for outsiders, Africa represented danger and death, while
                    the American West appeared as something positive, even idyllic. Another difference was that American
                    explorers observed mostly vacant parts of their own territory, while British expeditions trekked
                    across foreign lands on a heavily populated continent. Third, British activities in Africa tended to
                    be much more violent than those of American parties in the West.</p>
            <p>Although he moves between American and English explorers easily, Van Orman gives little evidence of
                    any comparative structure or method. At the same time, his study lacks focus. When considering myths
                    or objectives, he ranges well beyond the chosen time period, thereby weakening the impact of his
                    ideas. A related difficulty is that the reader never gets a clear idea of who all of the major
                    explorers were, where they went, or what they accomplished. Yet there are sensitive portraits of
                    some individuals and events in the narrative.</p>
            <p>At the same time the book brings together a broad range of ideas and information. Regarding American
                    explorations, the people, events, and ideas have appeared in the work of Robert Berk-hofer, William
                    Goetzmann, Donald <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and others. For British activity in Africa, Van Orman offers an interesting portrait
                    of major figures much less familiar to American readers. Throughout, the narrative is clear and
                    interesting, and well-designed maps help the reader follow the action. The tasks Van Orman set for
                    himself are compelling, and to have succeeded he needed at least <pb n="178" id="VAA4025-081-2-084"/> twice the space of the present volume. Nevertheless, this book is a good effort at bridging the
                    scholarly gap that so frequently separates the continents.</p>

            <p>For most Americans the word <hi rend="i">stagecoach</hi> evokes images of Wells Fargo and John Wayne
                    riding shotgun in the Far West. <hi rend="i">Stagecoach East</hi> reminds readers that there was an
                    earlier and equally important period, in which the American stagecoach lines played a vital role in
                    linking the East together economically, socially, and culturally. Relying mainly on newspapers,
                    travel journals, diaries, and government records, the authors trace the development of
                    "staging" from the early eighteenth century through its golden decades,
                    1820–1840, to its decline in the East in the two decades before the Civil War. The work
                    is a scholarly attempt to fill a major gap in the history of American transportation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Stagecoach East</hi> endeavors to cover every important aspect of staging in the East
                    from the stagecoach builders and drivers to the types of taverns along the routes. Among the most
                    interesting chapters are those dealing with the ties between the federal postal system, newspapers,
                    and the stagecoach lines. Until the advent of the railroads, the stagecoach was the principal
                    carrier of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> mail and newspapers. The postmaster general, through his power to grant federal
                    contracts, played a major role in scheduling routes and thus exercised a degree of regulatory power.
                    Moreover, by requiring the lines to carry the newspapers at the lowest rates, the government could
                    promote the Jeffersonian ideal of a literate informed public. On the other hand, travelers and
                    commercial interests helped to subsidize the newspapers by paying higher rates. Indeed, the fourth
                    estate enjoyed certain advantages.</p>
            <p>Despite its originality and thorough research, <hi rend="i">Stagecoach East</hi> is not without some
                    defects. Since staging required a fairly well-developed network of roads, the authors rightly
                    concentrate on the Northeast and Southeast. However, seven pages cannot do justice to the importance
                    of staging in the Old Northwest. Also, a work that describes in detail the various trunk and branch
                    lines throughout the East should assist the reader by including more <pb n="179" id="VAA4025-081-2-085"/> than one map, especially when that one is a barely discernable copy of
                    an 1804 print. Anyone interested in the history of American canals will be surprised to find no
                    mention of this mode of transportation, even though canal packets were competitors of the stagecoach
                    lines before the railroads came into existence. The authors offer no solid statistical evidence that
                    the stages carried more passengers and freight than the nation's waterways or even its
                    roads. Finally, there are a few obvious errors. For example, one learns that hostilities in the
                    American Revolution did not begin until 1776!</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, <hi rend="i">Stagecoach East</hi> merits the serious attention of anyone interested in
                    studying a neglected and significant aspect in the history of American transportation.</p>

            <p>This is a daring book. It addresses major issues in social theory. It ventures into many different
                    subfields of American history: politics, urban life, labor, religion, economics, intellectual life,
                    and reform movements. It is a tour de force in the varieties of evidence that it considers and
                    methods it uses to analyze and interpret them. It makes skillful use of twenty-two illustrations,
                    and its accounts of parades and festivities are both dramatic and insightful. <hi rend="i">Chants
                        Democratic</hi> is also beautifully composed, with its title drawn from Walt Whitman, with
                    passages from Whitman's poetry introducing each section, and with a conclusion explaining
                    the poet's description of <placeName>

                    </placeName> as "the most radical city in America." The book is a welcome
                    exception to the complaint that too many historical works, especially revised dissertations, are
                    cautious and overspecialized.</p>
            <p>Sean Wilentz has constructed an impressive account of the changing conditions of work and changing
                    purposes of working-men's—and sometimes
                    workingwomen's—organizations in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>. The scope is so wide and the argument so carefully fashioned that a brief review can
                    recognize only a few important features of the work. Among the most significant is the delineation
                    of a process of "metropolitan industrialization" undermining the
                    "republican" virtues that artisans, in the enthusiasm of the Revolution, had
                    learned to associate with their trades. Wilentz does <pb n="180" id="VAA4025-081-2-086"/> not
                    oversimplify this process; he stresses that it created a "labyrinth of factories and tiny
                    artisan establishments, central workrooms and outworkers' cellars, luxury firms and
                    sweatwork strapping shops," and he takes pains to follow all the chambers and corridors of
                    this "maze." If Wilentz admires radicals protesting the degradation that the wage
                    relation imposed on workers' lives, he also offers fair-minded accounts of street
                    preachers, temperance reformers, and other urban types. Many pages are devoted to increasingly
                    confident proponents of competition and uplifi, such as one who proclaimed in 1837: "In our
                    bounteous land individuals alone are poor; but they form no poor class, because with them poverty is
                    but a transient evil."</p>
            <p>Although Wilentz is properly critical of others who have used the term <hi rend="i">class
                        consciousness</hi> without historical sensitivity, his own use of the term to describe the
                    attitudes of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>'s workingmen in the 1850s is not entirely convincing. Sometimes the
                    documentation for strikes and violent confrontations seems too sketchy to warrant generalizations
                    about workers as a class. Toward the end of the book Wilentz lumps together "the
                    city's workers and labor radicals" in a manner inconsistent with his previous
                    demonstrations of the confusing, labyrinthine process that was transforming <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>. Nevertheless, he convincingly recaptures a radical republican outlook at odds with
                    Jacksonian political parties and Whig benevolence. In so doing, he offers exciting challenges to
                    much of the conventional wisdom about antebellum society and politics.</p>

                    </placeName>: University of Wisconsin Press, 1984. Pp. xvi, 264. Tables, notes, note on sources,
                    bibliography, index. $29.50.)</head>
            <p>Daniel Feller sets out three objectives for this study: to examine the origins and evolution of the
                    controversy over federal land policy during the Jacksonian era; to relate that controversy to other
                    issues; and to demonstrate how it contributed to political alignments and the emergence of the
                    second party system. After reviewing the background of land policy to 1821, Feller gives a detailed
                    account of congressional debates on a wide variety of measures for disposing of the federal domain.
                    The debates centered on such questions as the minimum unit and minimum price for land offered for
                    sale by the government, federal credit for land purchases, preemption rights, graduated price
                    reductions on unsold land, and cession of federal lands to states. They pitted those who saw public
                    lands as property of the people, believed that <pb n="181" id="VAA4025-081-2-087"/> landownership
                    was a right, and favored rapid alienation of land at low prices against those who saw public lands
                    as a capital fund for financing federal projects, believed that landownership was something one
                    earned, and favored controlled disposition of land at market prices. Although legal and moral
                    principles, for the most part, comprised the argument on each side of the controversy, they were
                    only a thin veneer overlaying motives of self-interest; agricultural spokesmen pushed for a liberal
                    land policy, commercial and manufacturing spokesmen for a more restricted one. Neither side won, but
                    Congress's progressive reduction in the minimum purchase unit, maintenance of a low minimum
                    price, numerous land grants to states, acceptance of preemption rights, and eventual adoption of
                    graduation testify that agrarian interests and their allies got the better of the contest.</p>
            <p>If the catalog of questions included in the controversy tended to blur congressional alignments, so
                    too did the relationship between land policy and other issues. Since income from federal land sales
                    might render the tariff redundant, might subsidize education and internal improvements, or might be
                    distributed among the states, land policy became linked with these issues, often producing unnatural
                    congressional coalitions and strained legislative logic. Generally, though, throughout the 1820s
                    sectional identification defined the division and informed the rhetoric over land policy, with East
                    cast against West. But presidential elections in 1828 and 1832, the removal of the tariff from
                    political contention with the Compromise of 1833, and the fight over the Second Bank of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> weakened geographical cohesion and paved the way for the formation of national parties
                    in the 1830s. From then on, land policy was a party rather than a sectional matter, as Democrats
                    championed cheap lands and easy acquisition, and Whigs insisted on using the federal domain as an
                    endowment for social and economic betterment.</p>
            <p>Feller deftly charts the complex course of federal land policy from 1821 to 1837, explaining clearly,
                    if not always succinctly, congressional deliberations and actions. Moreover, he carefully examines
                    the joining of land policy to related issues, analyzing better than other historians how the tariff,
                    internal improvements, and fiscal policy influenced congressional views on the management of the
                    federal domain. He is less successful, however, in showing how land policy figured in the rise of
                    political parties. Simply to demonstrate that land policy changed from a sectional issue in the
                    1820s to a partisan issue in the 1830s is not enough to sustain the argument that it was
                    instrumental in shaping party ideologies and programs, or that it was a factor in determining party
                    constituencies. On that subject, the ethno-cultural thesis remains more convincing.</p>

                    social change in nineteenth- and early twentieth-century America. Yet, few of the many books devoted
                    to railroads venture far beyond the local right-of-way or the corporate boardroom; railroad
                    literature is too often a myopic enterprise that deprives its subject of its broader significance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Metropolitan Corridor</hi> is the antithesis of such literature. It provides a broad
                    overview of the impact of railroads on American society from 1880 to 1930. John Stilgoe's
                    focus is on all sides of the track as he attempts to show how the railroad shaped American concepts
                    of travel and luxury, and how the technology born of the industry was the preeminent force in
                    engineering and planning for more than half a century. Though the impact of the industry was broad,
                    Stilgoe shows that it was gathered in force in the corridors that formed along the rail lines
                    linking major American cities. These were avenues of civilization and progress, dominated by the
                    machines that traversed them, governed by the electricity that provided power and manipulated
                    communications, and peopled by a variety of actors ranging from the hobo to the construction
                    engineer. Settlements apart from the corridor languished, while those situated along it, or linked
                    to it by branch lines or interurbans received their food, news, and ideas almost solely from it.</p>
            <p>Stilgoe ranges widely in his discussion of the corridor, considering such areas as electrical
                    generation, factory design, track-side beautification, interurban railroads, popular literature,
                    cinema, and trackside subcultures. His style is lucid and makes for enjoyable reading. His use of
                    quotations from popular fiction adds much to the literary quality of the work, while also advancing
                    his thesis, which is well argued in most areas of the book. It is only when Stilgoe leaves the
                    corridor for the final two chapters that the work begins to weaken. These deal with the slow decline
                    of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> hill towns not linked to the corridor and the decline of the railroad industry itself
                    in the 1930s. While the chapter on the hill towns is well-written and informative, both still appear
                    as a hasty and awkward coda to the book—perhaps because both subjects deserve studies
                    unto themselves.</p>
            <p>This is, however, a minor problem in a volume that deserves the attention of academic and amateur
                    alike (it should be required reading for the rail buff with single track vision). Indianans who <pb n="183" id="VAA4025-081-2-089"/> remember the busy times along the <placeName>

                    with much of this volume and in it will find an explanation for events and institutions that were a
                    familiar part of everyday life only decades ago.</p>

                    </placeName>: McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1984. Pp. xiv, 412. Illustrations, notes, bibliography,
                    index. $17.95.)</head>
            <p>A dual biography of Robert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant is an exceptionally good idea. Very different
                    in background, style, and personality, they became the principal military antagonists of the Civil
                    War. As the author of this book suggests, in many ways each was typical of his cause: the
                    aristocratic and anachronistic Old South, a strange mixture of gentility and brutality, versus the
                    industrializing, rough-and-ready, egalitarian North. Admirably organized around the counterpoint
                    suggested by its protagonists, the book traces their origins and careers. The author plays no
                    favorites; an effort is made to characterize both men fully. A prolific and successful trade writer,
                    Gene Smith writes very well. Granting all of these positive points, the book is significantly
                    flawed.</p>
            <p>In the first place, Smith relies entirely on secondary sources. Regardless of the general
                    acceptability of this method, it appears that Smith has consulted them indiscriminately. (His
                    imprecise method of footnoting adds to readers' doubts.) Thus, he has overlooked well-known
                    authoritative historians (Bruce Catton and K. P. Williams, for example) and turned instead to such
                    doubtful sources as W. E. Woodward and Sylvanus Cadwallader. The truth is that Smith is far from
                    home in dealing with the military history of the Civil War. He has grabbed whatever was handy to
                    advance his manuscript and apparently had neither the knowledge nor the time to evaluate his
                    sources.</p>
            <p>The author's research base shows up in a number of ways. For example, he accepts
                    Cadwallader's account of Grant's binge during the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vicksburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> campaign. Smith is presumably unaware of K. P. Williams's persuasive
                    destruction of this story. He characterizes other Civil War personalities with dubious stereotypes.
                    His treatment of General Henry Halleck, for example, shows that he has made no inquiry into the very
                    complicated role of that very complex man.</p>
            <pb n="184" id="VAA4025-081-2-090"/>
            <p>Numerous outright errors about the war also appear, of which the following are simply examples: it is
                    not accurate to say that Fort Donelson is "11 miles downstream from Fort Henry"
                    (p. 113); Grant had not "committed his last reserves" on the first day at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shiloh</settlement>
                    </placeName> (p. 121); it is not true that "almost as one man the right wing of
                    Hooker's army turned and ran" at Stonewall <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s attack on the Eleventh Corps on May 2, 1863, at Chancellorsville (p. 160);
                    Hooker did not "turn and run for it" on the morning after <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s stroke at Chancellorsville (p. 161)—there was fighting on May 3,
                    4, and 5, and the retreat took place on May 6; James Longstreet was not "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s replacement" in any meaningful sense (p. 164); to state that Grant
                    expected no great results from Benjamin F. Butler's 1864 campaign below <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> (p. 188) is simply wrong; the "entire course of the war" did not
                    devolve on the two forces opposed in the final Virginia campaign (p. 211), and the statement
                    reflects and promotes a misunderstanding of the war; Lee did not "have to" invade
                    Pennsylvania in 1863 (p. 163) and to say that he did moots a question that a biographer should
                    address.</p>
            <p>Each of the men was an enigma, and each is ultimately a tragic figure. Lee opposed slavery and
                    secession; he was one of the few who foresaw the horrors of the war and its ultimate outcome.
                    Somehow he converted his position of not <hi rend="i">opposing</hi> Virginia into the role of the
                    slaving Confederacy's aggressive and bloody point man. He could write during the war that
                    "the warmest instincts of every man's soul declare the glory of the
                    soldier's death." In the name of his own honor, he clung to the war long beyond
                    his own awareness of any practical possibility of success, although every day intensified the agony
                    of his beloved Virginia and all the people, North and South. These undisputed facts make Lee a
                    tragic hero. They also suggest his unique and anomalous place in American history. Other historical
                    figures are evaluated with reference to the ultimate morality of their acts, but history is
                    curiously neutral where Lee is concerned. Universally credited with purity of motive, he is somehow
                    therefore absolved of the destructive and inhumane consequences of that motive. Grant has surely not
                    enjoyed Lee's immunity from history's inquiries and judgments, but his tragedy
                    appears in the aftermath of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Appomattox</settlement>
                    </placeName> when he exhibited his moral obtuseness in regard to postwar gifts from wealthy friends;
                    his perception of the presidency as a "sinecure," a gift from the people because
                    of his wartime service; and his role in "Grantism," the awful corruption of
                    American politics during the Gilded Age.</p>
            <p>In short, there is much to say about Grant and Lee, but, in view of its defects, this book poses the
                    classic question: is there <pb n="185" id="VAA4025-081-2-091"/> validity to this kind of popular
                    history? On the one hand, such works may be the general reader's only source of history. On
                    the other hand, the commercial imperatives seem to require broad brush oversimplification,
                    exaggerated and categorical characterization when the truth is highly uncertain, and the publishing
                    of outright error—so that what the general reader gets is erroneous or distorted
                    information.</p>
            <p>The best seller lists notwithstanding, people who take their history seriously have cause to be
                    disappointed with this book.</p>

            <p>The man who wrote the correspondence in these two volumes was described in 1864 as ordinary,
                    scrubby-looking, with a slightly seedy look. This description does not fit the image of a successful
                    military leader. In Ulysses S. Grant's case, appearances were deceiving. Grant was an
                    outstanding military leader and the greatest American military strategist of the nineteenth century.
                    Grant understood modern warfare as it developed in the Civil War. No longer could victory be
                    obtained by checkmating the enemy army or capturing enemy cities. The opposing army had to be
                    destroyed, and the will of the enemy populace subdued. These harsh goals could be achieved only by
                    bringing all resources to bear on the enemy. Of all the major participants in the Civil War, only
                    Grant, William T. Sherman, and Abraham <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> understood these concepts.</p>
            <p>These two volumes document the period from June 1, 1864, to November 15, 1864. On June 1, 1864, Grant
                    was at Cold Harbor, a battle which he regretted because of heavy Union casualties. These casualties
                    so distressed Grant that on June 5, 1864, he wrote Robert E. Lee proposing that both sides send
                    unarmed men between the skirmish lines to tend the wounded whenever the battle ceased. The, North
                    had superiority of men and materiel over Lee's Confederates. Since Lee could not replace
                    men and materiel as fast as the North, such battles wore down the Confederacy's strength.</p>
            <p>Grant's humor shows through in a letter to his wife, Julia, dated July 18, 1864, where he
                    remarks that General William S. Rosecrans "never obeyed an order in his life that I have
                    yet heard of." In addition, many letters to his wife illustrate Grant's great <pb n="186" id="VAA4025-081-2-092"/> love and longing for his family. The multitude of orders to his
                    generals and letters to President <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> indicate the efficient operation of his command system as well as his complete grasp of
                    the strategy and tactics needed to defeat the Confederacy. Grant's real concern for the
                    wounded and prisoners of both sides is exhibited in his correspondence with Lee.</p>
            <p>Both volumes are handsomely produced. The annotations are sufficient to place the correspondence in
                    context. A helpful chronology has been included at the beginning of each volume as well as a
                    calendar at the end. The Grant correspondence—much of it printed for the first
                    time—makes fascinating reading and portrays the likeable, human side of a great military
                    leader.</p>

            <p>In this book, Professor George C. Rable of Indiana's Anderson College offers the most
                    complete study to date of violence in the post-Civil War South. Informed by social-scientific
                    studies of violence and historical studies of the general course of revolutions, Rable enlarges the
                    context in which he assesses the phenomenon. Feeling powerless to control their fate after <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Appomattox</settlement>
                    </placeName>, southerners experienced the sort of concentrated and prolonged frustration that social
                    scientists say produces aggression in humans, Rable writes. "Conditions that a
                    twentieth-century psychologist might describe as a combination of alienation and anomie resulted in
                    anger among the region's traditional leaders" (p. 9).</p>
            <p>Rable generally organizes his study chronologically, describing the early race riots of 1866 in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Memphis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and moving to the relatively unfocused violence of 1868 to 1870, the activities of the
                    Ku Klux Klan, and finally to the southern Democrats' adoption of violence as a calculated
                    strategy to regain political power. However, Rable's decision to provide a full description
                    of violence in every southern state compels him to violate his chronology in order to limn
                    developments in particular states. This tends to obfuscate his most important points—the
                    way violence in one area led to violence in another and the development over time of a conscious
                    strategy of violence.</p>
            <p>Rable offers a number of informative insights. His comparison of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Memphis</settlement>
                    </placeName> riot to the antiblack riots of 1919–1920 in the North is innovative and
                    persuasive (although his comparison of them to the black riots in Watts, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newark</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the <pb n="187" id="VAA4025-081-2-093"/> late 1960s is not). His consistent
                    attention to the social science literature is similarly informing. Of great significance is
                    Rable's conclusion that the violence associated with the elections of 1874 in the South
                    amounted to a testing of the effectiveness of violence as a political strategy. The failure of
                    southern Republicans and the national government to counteract it convinced white southerners to
                    employ violence systematically in the 1875 and 1876 campaigns that overthrew Republican governments
                    in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>, <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>, <country reg="scu">South Carolina</country>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName>. Finally, Rable notes the implications of his study for historians' arguments
                    about the radicalism of Reconstruction. Refuting those historians who stress the conservatism of
                    Republican Reconstruction policy, Rable points out that it was its radicalism that led to a white
                    counterrevolution. He joins Herman Belz in dismissing the possibility of any further radical effort
                    in the face of such widespread and bitter white southern resistance.</p>
            <p>Altogether Rable has made a significant contribution to the historical understanding of
                    Reconstruction. Written primarily for scholars, but accessible to a more general intellectual
                    audience, the book is an important resource for those with a serious, scholarly interest in the
                    problems of post-Civil War America.</p>

            <p>In 1946 Arthur S. Link published an article, "The Progressive Movement in the
                    South," which challenged the vague northeastern orthodoxy that southerners had not actually
                    participated in the Progressive Era. Since that time Link has been joined by numerous other scholars
                    urging this "revisionist" perspective on the early twentieth-century South, and
                    one of the most influential of these is Dewey W. Grantham. In <hi rend="i">Southern
                    Progressivism</hi>, Grantham delivers an encyclopedic treatment of the subject—a product
                    of some twenty-five years of inquiry. The reader emerges from the work not only convinced, once and
                    for all, that there was indeed a Progressive Era in the South but that it had some of the
                    overarching characteristics of a movement.</p>
            <p>Grantham perceives southern progressivism as in many ways an extension of the New South creed. One of
                    the chief characteristics of the New South mind of the late nineteenth century was <pb n="188" id="VAA4025-081-2-094"/> its determination to embrace modernity without rejecting that
                    "vital nexus" with traditional social values of the antebellum era. Likewise,
                    Grantham views progressive leaders of the South as constantly seeking some blend,
                    "balance" (p. 418), or "reconciliation" (p. 410) between
                    progress and tradition. As with New Southerners of the 1890s, many progressives had more than a
                    subconscious experience with this problem. Analytical and articulate, many southern reformers, for
                    example, sought to expand educational opportunities in ways that appealed to many segments of the
                    southern population yet did not transgress sacred social traditions. Ultimately, therefore,
                    progressivism in the South was conservative—much as it was nationwide. What probably made
                    it more conservative in Dixie than in other places, besides the noted factor of race, was the
                    southerners' historic stake in the notion of section. Defensive and aggressive about their
                    subculture, southern progressives sought reforms that would enhance their traditional sense of
                    sectional community and virtue while still advancing social progress and the cause of North-South
                    reconciliation. Less shackled by the past, progressives from other sections felt more at ease than
                    southerners in advancing reforms not in precise harmony with nineteenth-century values.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, Grantham's story of southern progressivism also emphasizes certain
                    commonalities with the national reform experience. He clarifies the stages of southern reform by
                    showing how progressivism changed from an initial process of revealing particular problems, e.g.
                    railroad abuses, to formulating institutionalized (usually governmental) solutions to these
                    problems. As on the national scene, southern reformers called on local and state offices first, then
                    turned to the national political and governmental arena. Akin to Robert Wiebe's
                    progressives "searching for order," many of these southern reformers also moved
                    from individualistic, moralistic solutions to collective, bureaucratic,
                    "scientific" initiatives (p. 227).</p>
            <p>Thus, Grantham gives the impression that progressivism in the South represented more than an era; it
                    had signs of being a movement. Despite its variegated interest groups and inner stresses, southern
                    progressivism had cohesiveness and momentum that prevailed to some degree even into the 1920s. The
                    understanding of this movement would perhaps be clearer if the author had kept the New South strain
                    in his plot line more visible. Yet Grantham's powerful display of
                    scholarship—history blending the inferential insights of the humanities with those of the
                    social sciences and written with flowing, often poetic sentences—stands as a major
                    contribution to the literature of American reform and of the South.</p>

                        1900–1915</hi>. By James E. DeVries. (Ur-bana: University of Illinois Press, 1984.

            <p>This is an unusual history of urban blacks, because it deals with black history in a small midwestern
                    town (population 6,893 in 1910) and with a very small population of blacks (sixteen in 1910, or 0.22
                    percent). Between 1840 and 1920 the largest number of blacks enumerated was forty-four (in 1880).
                    The author, professor of history at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe County</region>
                    </placeName> Community College, is especially interested in exploring the nature of the black
                    identity in an overwhelmingly white milieu, and, despite the size of black <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName>, argues that the experience was typical. "<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName>'s values, behavioral norms, and cultural understandings were national in
                    nature.... [T]he black experience in Monroe provides a lens through which a national theme, racism,
                    can be clearly viewed"(p. xii). "Monroe was not an atypical situation in the
                    American black experience in the Midwest" (p. 154).</p>
            <p>The author seeks to re-create the black kinship networks that he contends were the means whereby
                    blacks, lacking numbers and therefore such devices as churches and clubs, coped with racism. Cast as
                    either childlike or brutal, they were unable to fit naturally into the life of even the small
                    communities. "The basic normative and cognitive framework which Monroe whites brought to
                    interactive contexts was racist, and the ego needs of any Afro-American could not possibly have been
                    met within the context of the larger community" (p. 135). Despite some evidence of
                    mobility, the "pervasiveness of racism" robbed Monroe blacks "of their
                    cultural and, as time passed, familial base" (p.154).</p>
            <p>Despite extensive research in primary materials and some interesting efforts at family
                    reconstitution, this work leaves the reader unsatisfied. Why the author chose the years
                    1900–1915 is unclear. He argues that this period represents the earliest time
                    "for which the memories of its living citizens were still accessible" (p. xi).
                    Much of the work, however, treats the nineteenth century, and, given the population increase after
                    the 1920s, one would think that a more extensive study of this small group of blacks in a small town
                    would have been possible and fruitful. This is one of the reasons that the argument for typicality
                    is hollow—not that there is no need to explore black history in such places, but that the
                    small population would make more comprehensive efforts possible. How different, for instance, was
                    the black experience after 1930? Another reason is that, despite the presence of racism, blacks in
                    this part of the Midwest were, for example, far less <pb n="190" id="VAA4025-081-2-096"/>
                    constrained than blacks in the Ohio Valley. Black and white baseball teams competed in the town in
                    1911; the shooting of a white sheriff by a black in 1910 did not lead to an outbreak of violence
                    against blacks; Monroe blacks belonged to white churches and attained a fairly high occupational
                    level in the community. Certainly the factor of racism united Monroe blacks with others in the
                    region, but the manner in which that racism was expressed, especially given the integrationist
                    tradition in the northern Midwest, did not. The absence of comparisons with other small black
                    communities and the size of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName>'s black populace also undercut the argument for typicality.</p>
            <p>Until the last page, the author does not raise a fundamental question—why did a black
                    community fail to take root here. His answer is that "the presence of an adequate
                    population was missing.... A black community would begin to take form in the 1930s..." (p.
                    154). Combined with the typicality argument, this conclusion significantly weakens the efforts of
                    the author. What we are left with is a disappointing book.</p>

            <p>In a paper delivered at the 1963 meeting of the American Historical Association, Professor Joe B.
                    Frantz of the University of Texas asserted: "The truth is that the federal government is
                    the major stockholder and underwriter of the American West and that most of those portions of the
                    West which hum with economic excitement are constantly being replenished with federal
                    funds." Richard Lowitt's study of the New Deal in the West amply confirms
                    Frantz's statement for the years from 1932 to 1940. Two federal departments, Agriculture
                    and Interior, headed by Henry Wallace and Harold Ickes, largely determined the West's
                    destiny. The author quotes extensively from Lorena Hickok's reports to Harry Hopkins, the
                    Federal Relief Administrator, to delineate in human terms the economic collapse in the region as the
                    New Deal was beginning.</p>
            <p>The Department of Agriculture attempted to translate into reality President F#2 D.
                    Roosevelt's view that there were "Acres Fit and Unfit" for agriculture on
                    the drought-stricken Great Plains by retiring crop lands and increasing pasturage. Unfortunately,
                    the New Deal's response to the problems afflicting the area was fragmented. Although soil
                    conservation work of great significance was accomplished, "a consistent, concerted,
                    cooperative <pb n="191" id="VAA4025-081-2-097"/> effort was not to be" (p. 55). With the
                    return of adequate rainfall and the onset of war in Europe, the government's emphasis
                    shifted to expanding production.</p>
            <p>The land between the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra <placeName>
                        <country reg="nvu">Nevada</country>
                    </placeName> range, the Great Basin, was the territory primarily of the Department of the Interior.
                    Ickes and his allies viewed the Inland Empire largely in terms of expanding horizons, chiefly
                    through the development of water facilities, especially hydroelectric power. The Bonneville and
                    Grand Coulee dams along the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> River were designed to achieve the promised land for the people of the Pacific
                    Northwest. The Indian New Deal, with the goals of economic sufficiency, cultural freedom, and civic
                    responsibility, was a "mixed success" (p. 132), although Lowitt's overall
                    assessment is positive.</p>
            <p>The one serious blow to the New Deal's conservation ethic in the West occurred in mineral
                    policy. Roosevelt needed the support of congressmen from the oil and silver producing states, so
                    production policies prevailed. In California the New Deal got a late start, and, embedded in
                    controversy, enjoyed few successes.</p>
            <p>Lowitt's richly documented and illuminating book should be required reading for western
                    conservatives who pride themselves on their free, anti-big government spirit, serving to remind them
                    that from start to finish the West has been subsidized by Uncle Sam.</p>

            <p>Designed to celebrate the centennial of Eleanor Roosevelt's birth in 1884, this volume is
                    part of a series on women's contributions to the human enterprise. These essays by a number
                    of able scholars and writers are full of praise and sympathy for their subject, yet these qualities
                    are amply balanced by critical detachment. It is a book of distinction, a "good
                    read," and worth the price for readers of many backgrounds. In four sections, the authors
                    describe Roosevelt's political education, what is called her "politics of
                    conscience," her political friendships, and the paradoxes that emerge from a study of her
                    political activities. <hi rend="i">Without Precedent</hi> is overwhelmingly a guide to
                    Roosevelt's political career, a vocation focused on working for individual equal
                    opportunity and on setting a personal example of response to moral issues.</p>
            <pb n="192" id="VAA4025-081-2-098"/>
            <p>Without being the wife of F#2 D. Roosevelt, would Eleanor Roosevelt have had an impact on American
                    politics? Most of the essayists agree with William H. Chafe that Eleanor Roosevelt sought personal
                    political influence "in place of, rather than because of an intimate personal relationship
                    with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>" (p. 11). Lois Scharf writes that "the pace of her life happily
                    coincided with many of [FDRs] needs, but the prime motivation was the personal need to build an
                    emotional life and create physical space of her own" (p. 250). After the bitter sadness of
                    discovering <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s affair with Lucy Mercer, she began seeking autonomy in 1920, before <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s crippling bout with poliomyelitis. Thus, Eleanor had political interests and
                    activities apart from her role as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s wife. During the 1920s, she developed networks of friends, gained experience
                    of leadership as a lobbyist and organizer, and worked hard in local and state politics.</p>
            <p>When <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> was elected governor, she began to develop a new, less visible style that became her
                    trademark during the years of FDRs presidency. Sponsoring fact-finding tours, assisting in the
                    securing of choice administrative posts for women, and linking herself with other capable women,
                    such as Democratic campaign planner Molly Dewson, Eleanor honed the skills that made her an
                    unprecedented First Lady in the White House. While Susan Ware describes Eleanor's
                    participation in Democratic party politics, Martha Swain and Ingrid Scobie discuss her relationship
                    with the talented New Deal administrator Ellen Woodward and explore Eleanor's promotion of
                    the congressional aspirations of Helen Gahagan Douglas. Other writers—Winifred Wandersee,
                    Joanna and Robert Zangrando, and Blanche Wiesen Cook—comment on her stance regarding
                    American youth, Afro-American civil rights, and foreign affairs, respectively. Richard Kirkendall
                    suggests that the decline of her influence was partly responsible for the substitution of Harry
                    Truman for Henry Wallace as vice-presidential candidate in 1944. The potential role as powerful
                    politician inhered in the role as wife of FDR, but Eleanor's exploitation of the
                    possibility was due to her own chemistry.</p>
            <p>Was Eleanor Roosevelt a feminist? Lois Scharf s excellent essay answers with a "qualified
                    no." Eleanor was definitely a "reformer," however. When she and
                    "the sisterhood in the administration" had a choice "between passage and
                    implementation of social welfare programs on the one hand, and specific attention to the position
                    and treatment of women within them on the other," they chose the former. Certainly, Eleanor
                    Roosevelt's career illustrates the limits of courageous individualism and of unique moral
                    example as promoters of social justice. Yet, the editors offer a reminder that "we might
                    well envy a time when women activists <pb n="193" id="VAA4025-081-2-099"/> actually believed most
                    foreign and domestic problems could be solved by well-intentioned individuals acting for the common
                    good"(p. xix). Movements are made of people who think that the individual matters.</p>

            <p>Museums were not always the public institutions they are today. It was only in the past two hundred
                    years that they evolved from closed private collections into open and accessible facilities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Museum Masters</hi> treats twelve men and women styled by Edward P. Alexander as
                    imaginative museum leaders, the men and women who created the modern museum. The twelve represent
                    Europe, Great Britain, Scandinavia, and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. These are people "who gave thought to the purposes of museums and took the
                    institutions with which they were connected in new directions that have significance today"
                    (p. 4).</p>
            <p>They are a varied and fascinating lot, as befits museum directors with strong personalities. Some,
                    like Charles Willson Peale, worked for a popular museum. He was "the first great American
                    museum director, warm, personable, and outgoing; creative and driving" (p. 48). A showman,
                    like so many of the great directors, Peale had ideas for exhibit openings that would attract
                    attention today. The opening of his Mammoth Room was publicized by the museum handyman dressed like
                    an Indian riding a white horse, and preceded by a trumpeter. Here is ample precedent for new job
                    descriptions for museum employees!</p>
            <p>Dominque Vivant Denon sought to make the Louvre the symbol of national glory. Alexander relates that
                    he labored during the day and "No one pursued social and erotic pleasures more ardently
                    than he at night, in salon, cafe and boudoir" (p. 85). No doubt he simply sought further
                    recognition and appreciation of the museum! Denon also understood a director's role in
                    drawing to his staff experts to advise him on particular subject areas.</p>

                    </placeName> Goode, an Indiana product, devoted his efforts to the Smithsonian Museum, deserving in
                    Alexander's opinion "to be known as the father of the modern American
                    museum" (p. 305). One of his thoughts that is pertinent today is often ignored:
                    "The degree of civilization to which any nation, city or province has attained is best
                    shown by the character of its public museums <pb n="194" id="VAA4025-081-2-100"/> and the liberality
                    with which they are maintained" (p. 299). How many museum directors would like to have this
                    thought carved on their museum portals?</p>
            <p>Here are creators of moated zoos (Carl Hagenbeck), open-air museums (Arthur Hazelius), historic house
                    museums (Ann Pamela Cunningham), botanical gardens (William <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> Hooker), science and technology (Oskar van Miller), community service (John Cotton
                    Davis), the British Museum (Sir Hans Sloane), and the decorative arts (Henry Cole). In their diverse
                    personalities may be found the roots of virtually all museum trends today.</p>
            <p>The book affords a clear view of the importance of personality to museums, and of the need for
                    creative thinking, unfettered by convention. These men and women stand as examples of the importance
                    of sudden change, not just gradual evolution, in museum work. They are also a reminder that there is
                    much truth in the saying that all is old wine in new bottles, for the ideas they espoused are ideas
                    that are very current. Alexander's is a well-written book, which for the reader not
                    familiar with museum history will open avenues to its fascinating development. For those in the
                    profession, perhaps John Cotton Davis's words ring truest of all, "I've
                    had a lot of fun.... A whole lot of fun.... I am going ahead as fast as money permits..."
                    (p. 399). It is a book well worth reading.</p>

            <p>After thirty-five years of active practice by historians, schoolchildren, and community groups, oral
                    history seems to have come of age. This anthology simultaneously represents and celebrates that
                    event. In the preface, the editors explain the book's genesis: "At one time the
                    greatest need [in oral history] was for basic procedural manuals for beginning
                    practitioners." That need having been more than adequately met at the present, they
                    continue, "our goal was the upgrading of the oral history process and end product"
                    by aiming the collection "at a broad spectrum of already initiated individuals"
                    (p. xv). To this end, they sifted through the now voluminous literature on oral history and selected
                    thirty-seven articles for inclusion here.</p>
            <p>Most of the major figures in the field are represented, from Allan Nevins, universally acclaimed as
                    the father of oral history <pb n="195" id="VAA4025-081-2-101"/> in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>; to folklorist Richard Dorson, outspoken advocate of the relationship between folklore
                    and oral history; to schoolteacher Eliot Wigginton, creator of the <hi rend="i">Foxfire</hi>
                    project; and writer Alex Haley whose <hi rend="i">Roots</hi> spawned an enthusiasm for oral history
                    and genealogy among Americans at large. (Ronald Grele, Alice Kessler-Harris, and even pop
                    practitioner Studs Terkel are conspicuous omissions.)</p>
            <p>The selections are organized into six sections, with each section introduced by the editors and each
                    essay preceded by head-notes. The first five articles, in the section entitled "The Gateway
                    to Oral History," provide the reader with an overview of the development of oral
                    history—the history of oral history, as it were. Section II, "Interpreting and
                    Designing Oral History" (is this not putting things in reverse order?), comprises eleven
                    essays that address theoretical issues such as the reliability, significance, and ethics of oral
                    history, as well as the practicalities of organizing and carrying out an oral history project. The
                    third section, "Oral History Applied," includes general discussions of projects
                    among blacks and other ethnic groups, women, workers, and families. The relationships between oral
                    history and other disciplines that rely on oral historical data, such as folklore, anthropology, and
                    gerontology, are explored in six articles in Section IV. Sections V and VI deal respectively with
                    oral history in the schools and in libraries. An appendix presents the guidelines for setting up,
                    conducting, and evaluating oral history projects adopted by the Oral History Association in 1968.</p>
            <p>There are several strengths to the book, among them the recognition of the interdisciplinary uses of
                    the oral history method. The coverage of subjects, with a few glaring exceptions, is even and
                    presents a well-rounded and well-organized picture of the current state of oral history. Perhaps the
                    strongest point of the book, however, is the care with which the essays have been arranged. Both the
                    section introductions and the headnotes provide the reader with a thread to follow from one
                    selection to the next and from one division to the next, so that the book has a coherence usually
                    lacking in anthologies.</p>
            <p>Now for its limitations. The essays are overwhelmingly North American in their orientation, and thus
                    give no indication of the state of oral history elsewhere in the world. A second, and potentially
                    more serious, deficiency is that the book contains no consideration of the nature of the oral
                    history interview as a historical document. This critical issue is mentioned in passing in several
                    of the essays, but treated in depth in none. The editors themselves call attention to a third
                    limitation—there is no discussion of the legal aspects of oral history. A thorough and
                    definitive treatment <pb n="196" id="VAA4025-081-2-102"/> of the subject, they state, has yet to be
                    written. Finally, it is odd that the editors did not include a few case studies, demonstrating how
                    oral history actually works. Perhaps the essays in Section III were meant to serve this purpose, but
                    they are too broadly conceived to do so effectively.</p>
            <p>Despite these shortcomings, the book is a welcome addition to the oral historical
                    bookshelf—or, for that matter, to folkloristic, anthropological, or general historical
                    collections. The quality of the essays is consistently high, yet none is so bogged down in jargon or
                    technicalities as to be indecipherable to readers with little or no background in the subject. The
                    book, in fact, should serve as an excellent introduction to oral history for any reader,
                    "initiated" or not.</p>

                    itself is dispersed. The Indiana Historical Society's 1984 exhibit on medicine in
                    antebellum Indiana is no more, but Katherine Mandusic McDonell's catalogue will endure as a
                    succinct but insightful description and analysis of medicine in pioneer Indiana. McDonell builds on
                    the earlier work of Madge E. Pickard and R. Carlyle Buley, on more recent research in American
                    medical history, and on her own extensive work in primary sources. She presents in contexts of time
                    and place such subjects as fevers, cholera, smallpox, milk sickness, bloodletting and harsh drugs,
                    surgery without anesthesia, medical education, home remedies, and patent medicines. She effectively
                    demonstrates the conflict and conservatism that permeated Indiana medicine before the Civil War. <hi rend="i">James H. Madison, Indiana University, <placeName>

                    index. $49.95.) The impressive physical appearance of this book first catches the reader.
                    William Zimmerman's original paintings beautifully depict 165 species of birds, along with
                    wildflowers and trees of their habitats. The color, detail, and skill of these paintings alone make
                    the book worth the price. But unlike coffeetable books there is also abundant written substance.
                    Russell E. Mumford and Charles E. Keller have prepared essays on each species that provide basic
                    information on past and present status in Indiana. These species accounts are written from the
                    expertise of much hard work and many obviously enjoyable years spent in the field and in contact
                    with other bird watchers. They are a delight to read. Historians will find particularly interesting
                    the many instances of changing bird populations as a consequence of human activity, from the
                    slaughter of passenger pigeons and Carolina parakeets in the nineteenth century to the introduction
                    of wild turkeys in the twentieth century. <hi rend="i">The Birds of Indiana</hi> is a remarkable

                    University Press's Library of Indiana Classics. All three novels were widely read in the
                    early twentieth century and ranked among the best of Indiana's golden age of literature.
                    Doubtless there are many adults today with vivid memories of Little Balser's fight with the
                    one-eared bear on Blue River; of Ralph Hartsooks struggles in the Flat Creek schoolhouse; of Elnora
                    Cornstock's moth hunting on the edge of Limberlost swamp. In reprinting these novels the
                    Indiana University Press offers its judgment that they are not worn-out classics but rather deserve
                    to be read by young Americans of the late twentieth century. It is a correct judgment. In the midst
                    of watching rock video and filling in the blanks of school workbooks, young Hoosiers can also be led
                    to these Indiana classics. There is even the possibility of reading these books aloud in the home
                    and in school. My unscientific experiment conducted on two nonrandomly chosen children proved the
                    case—to the pleasure of the children and the adult reader. <hi rend="i">James H. Madison,

                    Pp. xi, 307. Illustrations, genealogical chart. $20.00). This book chronicles the lives
                    of advertising executive Ward Canaday (1885–1976) and his wife, Mariam Canaday
                    (1883–1974). Ward Canaday was born and raised in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana. After graduating from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he began his rise in business in the sales and advertising department of the <pb n="199" id="VAA4025-081-2-105"/> Hoosier Manufacturing Company of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Castle</settlement>
                    </placeName>. After eight years with Hoosier Manufacturing, Canaday moved to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Toledo</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>,
                    where he founded the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Advertising Corporation. Later, Canaday also served as president and board chairman of
                    Willys-Overland Motors, Inc. (makers of the World War II Jeep), as publicity director for the
                    Federal Housing Administration, and as a member of various government commissions under Harry S.
                    Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and John F. Kennedy. Doreen Canaday Spitzer, the only child of the
                    couple, has based her book on a wide range of primary materials as well as her personal
                    recollections. However, the historian looking for a business biography of Canaday, or information on
                    the development of the advertising industry, or turn-of-the-century <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Castle</settlement>
                    </placeName> will be disappointed because Spitzer focuses her book on the relationship between her
                    parents. Spitzer analyses her parents' marriage in great and intimate detail. While her
                    tone and analysis is objective, even detached, it is obvious that her book was designed primarily to
                    answer Spitzer's own, personal questions about her parents. <hi rend="i">Thomas E. Rodgers,

                    mid-1830s he began carving tombstones as a sideline. For more than a decade Reding carved sandstone,
