                    set forth his understanding of the three aims for which his company had striven in its twenty years
                    of existence: first, the building of the most nearly perfect product possible; second, the training
                    of the manpower of the community, not only to be good mechanics, but also to be Godfearing and
                    useful citizens; third, a non-paternal but very earnest interest in the welfare of the workers, with
                    a management so concerned about men that the company would never thrust out upon society its broken
                    and its aged.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The secondary aims relating to the size to be attained, quality

                    and in Europe, and inventor of the distinctive features of the leading high-speed diesel engine in
                    America.</p>
            <p>As early as 1908, Clessie Cummins, then twenty years old, began to drive the Irwin automobiles during
                    the seasons when the roads were good. He had an intense interest in anything mechanical, and by 1913
                    had determined to go into the automobile repair business. William Irwin entered into an agreement by
                    which Cummins was to have the use of a part of the garage plus wages of $30.00 per month.
                    He was to keep the family cars in operating condition and to serve as chauffeur whenever asked by
                    any member of the family. He also agreed to keep the elevator and other mechanical devices about the
                    house in order. Clessie was to use the space allotted him in the garage for his repair work. Irwin
                    agreed to buy the necessary tools.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> The auto repair business flourished. By
                    1916, Clessie was making close to $150.00 a week, and had four men working with him.</p>
            <p>With the outbreak of war in Europe, Cummins secured orders for small parts for British munitions,
                    thanks to the willingness of Irwin to write many letters soliciting business.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                    Then came the day of which <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>

                    twenty-four hours a day, manufacturing hubs for American army wagons. The shop was promptly moved
                    out into a larger building and the automobiles were returned to the home garage.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

                        chamber.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> During the suction stroke of the piston the proper amount of fuel
                    was delivered into the small cup. On the compression stroke, combustion occurred first in the cup
                    and then continued in the main chamber. This engine represented an attempt to eliminate the air
                    injection of fuel found in most diesels of that period. Since the Hvid engine provided a means of
                    using a less expensive fuel than gasoline, Cummins became interested. He learned that the engine
                    could be manufactured under a license plan. The license fee was $2500.00 and the royalty
                    was $5.00 per engine.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Later in 1918 Cummins' salesmanship won out over Irwin, who agreed to furnish support. The
                    Cummins Engine Company was incorporated in February, 1919, and a license was obtained from the Hvid
                        Company.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> Some twenty of Cummins' friends signed the original stock
                    subscription. By April of 1919 the first Cummins engine was finished. Of a single cylinder, it was
                    rated six horsepower at 600 rpm. Leading diesel authorities in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> had held for some time that 600 rpm was the maximum speed at which fuel oil could be
                    injected and burned. Therefore, the Cummins Company was derided at the start of its operations for
                    having built an extreme design.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> Several hundreds of these one cylinder engines
                    were made and sold, some going as far as <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="at">Australia</country>
                    </placeName>. The first model was, within the same year, followed by a 11/2 h.p. and a 3 h.p.
                    design. Both of these smaller engines ran at 900 rpm in defiance of the experts.</p>
            <p>Before the end of 1919, big business seemed assured for Cummins and associates, though they scarcely
                    realized that trouble lay ahead. A contract was signed with Sears, Roebuck and Company by which
                    Cummins would manufacture 4500 engines of the three sizes.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Since no service
                    was available, the engines had to be sold on Sears' rigid money-back <list type="footnotes">

                    fifteen per day. But they were poorly designed and contained some defective parts. Soon engines
                    began to arrive at the freight station. On some days, fifteen new engines were shipped and ten to
                    twelve were returned.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> The company fell far behind in its orders. A Sears
                    representative visited <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> in September, 1920, and reported plenty of trouble: piston ring failures, inability to
                    secure parts, and operational breakdowns. By then the company was able to average only slightly
                    better than four engines per day. He wrote: "Mr. Cummins is gradually building up an
                    organization, but I don't believe he realizes the importance of the position he is in as he
                    is holding some 400 of our orders, the oldest of which dates back to the 14th of January and yet
                    this condition does not seem to worry him in the least."<hi rend="sup">13</hi> In spite of
                    improved output and price reductions which practically wiped out the profit, the engines were not
                    successful, and in 1922 the contract was cancelled, after some 3000 of the 4500 units had been
                    delivered to Sears.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> The future appeared to be dark. Several hundred thousand
                    dollars were lost in the three years, and little was left. There were, however, two rays of light to
                    comfort Clessie Cummins. In the first place, the experience was valuable from the standpoint of
                    engineering, management, and production. Cummins later wrote: "We learned a great many of
                    the things that must not be done or could not be done." Further, much had been learned
                    about company organization and managerial policies from the great mail-order firm. When it was
                    finally decided that the engine contract was hopeless, "both parties took the financial
                    beating which naturally had resulted and called the whole deal off, and parted the best of
                        friends."<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A second source of comfort to Cummins was the attitude taken by his principal supporter, Irwin. When
                    Cummins, in 1921 or 1922, went to Irwin and told him that the engine was not a success and that it
                    appeared that all the money invested was lost, Irwin asked if there were no hope of salvaging
                    something from the wreck. Cummins replied that there <list type="footnotes">

                    "He tried to explain the idea to me with the result that when he told me that it would cost
                    $10,000 to prove the idea, I told him I would furnish the money. The idea turned out to
                    be an improvement, but it was not good enough; so he got another idea and another $10,000
                    and these ideas and the 10,000s continued for quite a period until he made a discovery for which he

            <p>As Cummins expressed it several years ago, "All down the line of developments, we were
                    usually able to ‘pull a rabbit out of the hat’ about the time that we were out
                    of money and offer him sufficient encouragement to carry on a little further."<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 1922, with the cancellation of the Sears contract, Cummins also cancelled the Hvid agreement. It
                    was not until 1926 that a settlement was reached with Hvid, and it cost the Cummins Company
                        $13,200.00.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A comment is in order as to the method by which the company was kept alive during the trying days of
                    the 1920's. Though personally willing to lend thousands of dollars, Irwin refused to do
                    this in a way which would obligate the stockholders. Therefore he and Cummins, as joint
                    stockholders, organized the Oil Engine Development Company, with a capitalization of but
                    $20,000.00. It was Cummins' hope that $10,000.00 would suffice to pay
                    for the development work. Actually, the Development Company alone absorbed approximately
                    $100,000.00. The Development Company paid the Engine Company in full, with cash, for all
                    labor, material, and overhead expended for the Development Company by the Engine Company. The
                    Development Company licensed the other company to build engines, without a license fee, but for a
                    nominal royalty on each engine. All patents applied for by Clessie Cummins were to be the property
                    of the Development Company. Thus a means was found by which the Irwin money could be poured into the
                    development of the engine and the manufacturing company was able to survive.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

            <p>After the wreckage had been cleared away, following the Sears, Roebuck debacle, Irwin insisted that
                    Clessie's engine company try to sell no more engines until they were proved commercially
                    practical and sound. Therefore, there was no factory production worthy of the name for at least six
                    years, though engines of great significance in the Cummins story were being developed and were being
                    sold to widely scattered customers. Cummins was convinced by 1922 that better engines could be
                    produced only by increasing speed and horsepower and at the same time decreasing the weight per
                        horsepower.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Out of some of the parts of the Hvid 6 h.p. engine Cummins
                    built a single cylinder engine in late 1922. He was able to sell an engine to a shrimp packer in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>; rather, Clessie Cummins virtually pressured the customer into letting him install the
                    unit on a trawler. After much opposition from the shrimp fishermen, the engine performed well and
                    about half a dozen more engines were sold. Cummins spent about six months in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                    </placeName> fishing fleets. Finally, the engines began to fly apart, and by the end of 1923 Cummins
                    had to stop and plan a new attack upon the problem of the high-speed diesel.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This second set-back confirmed Clessie's belief in an idea that he had been nursing for many
                    months: that the critical part of the diesel engine was the fuel injection apparatus. Differences in
                    engine temperatures, in fuel volatility, and in compression caused ignition to occur at a point
                    varying over many degrees of crankshaft rotation. The result of poor timing in the ignition was high
                    pressures which caused broken parts and high cylinder wear. Furthermore, the individual measuring of
                    the fuel to each cylinder was not desirable because of the difficulty of synchronizing perfectly.
                    Cummins and his engineers began to hunt for a method of metering the fuel which would be absolutely
                    fool-proof and would send an equal charge to every cylinder. The second major task which Cummins
                    undertook was to find a means of heating <list type="footnotes">

                    1927 some 3,000 separate injection methods were tried. Engines were being sold during this period,
                    though until 1925 or 1926 every conceivable kind of difficulty was encountered. In 1926, practically
                    all the engines being built were going for marine use: to private owners, to fishing fleets, the
                    Shipping Board, the Lighthouse Service, and the Coast Guard.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By 1925 it was clear to Irwin that Cummins' business would probably increase. He wrote a
                    friend: "I am trying to plan now for a real plant for economical operation. Clessie
                    approves the location I have chosen for it, but we are both agreed that there will be no moving
                    until we are absolutely crowded out of where we now are. There is not going to be any money put into
                    bricks and mortar until we just cannot get along without putting it in. We may not make quite so
                    much in the beginning by following this plan, but I believe in the end we will be further along and
                    then we will know better what we need."<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the fall of 1925 the payroll at the plant was running $1400.00 per week, and production
                    averaged two 4-cylinder engines per week.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That same year, Clessie had another idea. He began talking to Irwin about putting an engine into an
                    automobile, for publicity purposes, and driving the car from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>. He estimated at the time that the fuel cost would not exceed sixty cents. Irwin
                    exulted: "We can have a bit of front page advertising free with that kind of a
                        performance."<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With the very small capacity of the plant, however, and with a few orders coming in every week,
                    Clessie was kept so busy that he could find no time to work on the automotive engine. But a time was
                    soon to come when business declined and the work was taken up.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

                    shovels and earth-moving equipment. Probably 100 4-cylinder engines were sold before it was
                    discovered that the dirt and dust of shovel operations were too much for the engine, which had many
                    of its moving parts outside the engine. The result was the introduction, in 1928, of the
                    world's first completely enclosed diesel. Not a single moving part was exposed. Not a
                    single paft was hand lubricated. This was also the first diesel to be rated at 1000 rpm.</p>
            <p>By 1929 the fuel injection problem was practically solved, but that of metering the fuel took a few
                    years longer. The result of the research was the Cummins system, which is a distributor-type pump
                    very similar in principle to the distrib- utor mechanism in the electrical system of every gasoline
                    automotive engine.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

            <p>When the depression struck, in 1929, the company's busi- ness was chiefly in the marine
                    engine field. A large proportion of the engines were going into pleasure boats. The market suddenly
                        disappeared.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> Cummins, Irwin, and their engineers decided to enter the
                    automotive and industrial fields. This necessitated the development of a new engine, lighter in
                    weight and of a higher rpm.</p>
            <p>The greater part of the American public was completely unaware that such a thing as a diesel existed.
                    Clessie was the one who could wake them up. He launched upon what he has called the "Barnum
                    and Bailey days." For about five years Cummins put on a three ring circus of racing,
                    transcon- tinental runs, bus and truck records, and assorted stunts. Ringmaster was Clessie Cummins,
                    though he was ably assisted by certain other genial daredevils. When the circus days ended, the
                    American public was wide awake to the significance of the diesel.</p>
            <p>In November, 1929, Clessie and his chief engineer purchased "a big old Packard limousine
                    sedan" in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and drove it back home. The work of installing the engine began. The men used the model
                    U, the one developed in 1928, which has already been described as the first completely en- closed
                    diesel. It was impossible to put the engine in place <list type="footnotes">

                    Clessie drove the car to the Irwin home on Christmas, 1929. He was soon as excited as was
                        Clessie.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> Within a few days, Clessie left for <placeName>

                    great delight:"They undoubtedly got very well acquainted. Clessie, among other things, told

                    roadster chassis. In March, 1930, Cummins and cronies set an official mark of better than 80 miles
                    per hour at Daytona Beach. The old marine engine, built for 800 to 1000 rpm, was pushed as high as

                    the Cummins product. In 1932, the first truck customer, a grocery chain on the Pacific Coast,
                    managed to persuade a manufacturer to sell a truck minus the engine. A Cummins engine was installed,
                    but the truck manufacturer refused to do the work. When the first diesel truck continued to roll
                    smoothly and efficiently, other trucking firms became interested. They soon learned that the only
                    practical way of getting Cummins engines was to remove worn-out gasoline engines from trucks and
                    replace them with diesels.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> Then, finally, a number of truck manufacturers
                    arranged to install Cummins engines in new trucks.</p>
            <p>The diesel engines in the heavy trucks on the Pacific Coast were so efficient that within a short
                    time the engine company was bustling with activity. Incidentally, the diesel industry was one of the
                    few industries that gained ground during the depression, especially from 1933 on. This is easily
                    explained: diesel power provided an effective means of lowering costs.</p>
            <p>Records of the Cummins Company show that from 1919 to 1937 no profit was made, though the company
                    broke even from 1933 on. From 1919 to 1928 was a period of testing and trial, of experimentation and
                    heavy losses. From 1928 to 1932 was a period of struggle to gain recognition, to establish a
                    business, and to live down the failures of the past. From 1932 the company was concerned with the
                    problems of growth, not all of them pleasant.</p>
            <p>In September, 1933, William Irwin wrote his sister, Linnie. Clessie had been in to see him to get
                    approval for the purchase of more machinery. They had called the bank, and to their surprise had
                    discovered that the company had a balance of over $9,000.00. Now, it appeared, Clessie
                    was no longer losing money. Irwin continued: "It has been a long, long pull. During the
                    past ten years, I have had to have constantly in my mind the thought that I would have to provide
                    money for his use at almost any time. If business can continue as it is now, and grow gradually, it
                    seems to me now that we may get through without having to put up more money. This does not mean that

            <p>During the last quarter of the nineteenth century, America began to make some serious contribution to
                    the art of the world. The greatest artistic achievement of the century was the creation of the
                    modern landscape. In <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> the outstanding exponents of nineteenth century art were members of the Barbizon
                    school. Following these were the Impressionists. Both had important effects on American painters,
                    specifically upon the Hoosier artists. The Centennial Exposition of 1876, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, showed to many Americans for the first time the really great art of the world; and
                    shortly after, the return of American students from the studios of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Munich added new perspective to artistic thought and expression of this country.
                    Among those students returning from European studios after 1876 were a number of Indianians who made
                    a valuable contribution to the American school of art which was developing at that time.</p>

                    </placeName> with no art school, though there were a few individual artists with established
                    studios. Jacob Cox had been the principal painter since 1844, and after 1860 he found enough
                    patronage to enable him to turn from his tinner's trade and devote his time wholly to
                        painting.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Other artists in <placeName>

                    Mrs. Lottie Guffin. Though Cox had painted some landscapes at that time, there was greater demand

                    </placeName> in this earlier period, the city taken as a whole was probably not exceedingly
                    beautiful by architectural standards. There was commonly little city planning in this period,
                    individual architects being responsible only for individual buildings, resulting in a
                    "disorderly urban mass." A progressive industrial civilization had no need for
                    art; therefore, one need not expect the factories to be beautiful.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Values were
                    uncertain, and the quantitative standard governed. Thus, fine architecture was a matter of size and
                    expense, while the common buildings possessed no human standards, becoming cheap, niggardly, and
                    cramped. What architectural style there was indicated a mixture of early baroque with the
                    traditional medieval.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

                    almost the only artist in the city. Starting business there as a tinsmith, he later found enough
                    demand for his portraits and landscapes that he could devote his entire time to painting. A writer

                    paintings hung in at least three hundred homes in the Hoosier capital. Many of these pictures
                    portrayed local scenes, for, as Cox said, material at home was as good as could be found anywhere,
                    nature was familiar, and the public more sympathetic.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Thus was set the trend

            <p>Dull times which had followed the panic of 1873 affected artists' sales, but Cox continued
                    to paint his landscapes and figure pieces. In 1875 portrait painting was improving, and by 1877, in
                    addition to that of Cox, studios were maintained by ten or twelve professional artists, among them
                    Dewey Bates, John Love, Mrs. Lottie Guffin, and T. C. Steele. But as the oldest of them, Cox was
                    said to be "as much an <placeName>

                    repute our city could claim in an esthetic way."<hi rend="sup">12</hi> Though not highly
                    regarded as a teacher, he rendered valuable assistance to William Miller, Joseph 0. Eaton, John
                    Niemeyer, and William M. Chase, the latter in turn assisting Barton S. Hayes.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

                    $10,000.00, shares to sell at $50.00 each. Tuition for the school was set at
                    $10.00 per month, and courses would be offered in portrait and landscape painting;
                    engraving on wood, stone, and steel; architectural drawing; modeling in clay and wax; and various

                    year of study in the Indiana School of Art. Tuition, the public was reminded, would be
                    $100.00 for the year (a saving of $20.00 if paid by the year).<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

            <p>The second exhibition of the school got under way January, 1878, including the latest and best works
                    of home artists, among them the work of Cox, Steele, Dewey Bates, and A. E. Sinks, together with
                    work of prominent painters from other cities. The bust of Oliver P. Morton by John Mahoney, and
                    crayon work of pupils of the art school were also displayed.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> Judges of the
                    students' work were Dr. W. B. Fletcher, T. C. Steele, and H. Lieber.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
                    Other art exhibits followed at intervals, lending some aspect of permanence to the new art school.
                    At least two characteristics may be observed which emphasize the nature of public regard for art in
                    this period: admission was charged, usually twenty-five cents per person, and the exhibits were
                    always opened with some sort of popular program, usually including refreshments. This entertainment,
                    for such it was intended to be, would be one of popular appeal, including music. <placeName>

                    small intimate teas or dinners for members of a salon inaugurate a new exhibit, and admission is
                    free during the entire showing; but at that time the art association needed both money and patronage
                    and a bit of fanfare was both appropriate and desirable. Though these affairs became social events,
                    still some basis for taste in art was being built up in the public mind. The entertainment feature
                    thus seemed prominent in the shows of the Art Association; but when such affairs were <list type="footnotes">

                    But this was said to be no real art exhibition at all, for its stated purpose was to make money to
                    furnish the organization's social club rooms. Thus, the Y. M. C. A. was said to care only

            <p>An exhibit was held in April, 1878, one in May, and another in July. In May it was reported that the
                    opening of the exhibition was a "crushing success," for the halls were jammed. The
                    band performed, and it was "an event in the history of the city." About two
                    hundred paintings and numerous sketches and casts were shown, but a critical view of them was
                    impossible due to the crowds. "<placeName>

                    is kith and kin with them as an assemblage of objects of real art, and judging from last night the
                    people of this city are well aware of it and will avail themselves of it."<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

            <p>But with all this fine beginning, the school was doomed to financial failure. Public interest was not
                    yet widespread enough to insure sound financial backing for such an enterprise. Gookins resigned
                    first, and Love, no business manager, struggled for a time; but finally Love was forced to give it

            <p>During the period of this first Indiana School of Art, there were other influences operating to
                    increase the taste for art; yet there seemed to be no united, concentrated effort of any group, and
                    so it appeared that Gookins and Love were working more or less alone in their effort to make art a

                    balance of money needed was to be raised by solicitation. All this was to be done under the law
                    regulating voluntary associations. Rev. S. M. Vernon, J. W. Love, George P. Anderson, Rev. N. A.
                    Hyde, W. A. Ketcham, John A. Finch, L. A. Kiefer, Rev. O. C. McCulloch, and John C. New were chosen

            <p>The yeoman service rendered by the H. Lieber store in this field should not be overlooked. Selling
                    artists' supplies as well as pictures themselves, Herman Lieber had a practical as well as
                    an esthetic interest in the art school and also in the welfare of individual artists. It is
                    well-known that Lieber lent a friendly hand to T. C. Steele, perhaps even to the extent of financial
                    assistance to enable him to go to Munich to study art at the Royal Academy.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>

                    and other art necessities. He had chosen to establish this art store in a period when much more
                    practical things were a necessity, and often found it difficult to keep his business going. But he

                    taste for them in the homes of the time. We find the John Rogers groups prominently displayed in
                    most of the better homes. "To Americans of the second half of the nineteenth century one
                    mark of artistic, social, and financial respectability was the possession of one of the small pieces
                    of statuary known as Rogers Groups. These figurines occupied a post of honor in many a parlor,
                    placed on a table, a whatnot, or more frequently, on a pedestal in the bay window."<hi rend="sup">38</hi> These groups were extremely popular, being available also in stereoscopic
                    views, magic lantern slides, albums of photographs, and even amateur performances of
                    "living statues," posed by actors in white make-up and white costumes against a

            <p>Whether people of the period had a genuine feeling for this form of art, or whether they placed the

                    is a moot point, as it must be in considering the true cultural values demonstrated by the patronage
                    of any form of art. There was no doubt considerable imitation and copying of the prevailing

                    season totalled $1,500,000.00.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> In 1875 some of the building permits

            <p>In February, 1876, it was stated that prospects for building were not so promising as in the
                    preceding year due to hard times, and that capitalists hesitated to invest in business blocks or
                    costly manufacturing enterprises. Still, plans were announced for the building of at least three
                    churches and three business blocks. Lewis Shively planned the construction of a brick residence on
                    North <placeName>

            <p>In 1876 it was announced that the panic had caused so much financial embarrassment to J. O. Woodruff
                    that he was unable to complete plans for Woodruff Place before that time. Woodruff was no doubt
                    something of a visionary, and the Place was too great a distance from the business district to
                    attract many persons, since transportation was neither swift nor convenient enough to make commuting
                    desirable at that time. Therefore, Woodruff's real estate project languished and it became
                    necessary for him to offer lots for sale at a great sacrifice in order that he might realize
                    something on his investment.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>

            <p>Building materials of this period were chiefly brick and wood, with somewhat limited use of stone.
                    Iron was sometimes used for the facade of business buildings, but a destructive fire which occurred
                    in 1874 caused some architects and businessmen to question the wisdom of using such material. The
                    Exchange Block on the west side of <placeName>

                    under way, the building was four stories high, partly of brick, with an iron facade which was
                    supposed to give added support to the wall. As the flames roared up, the iron became red-hot,
                    buckled, and brought down whatever of the wall remained standing. The intense heat remained in the
                    iron work for some time, preventing any immediate examination of the ruins to determine the cause of
                    the fire. Some declared themselves to be disgusted with iron fronts and said future buildings must
                    be entirely of brick or stone which would withstand heat.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> The owners lost
                    heavily from this fire, for the loss was estimated at $255,000.00, only

                    affected by fire." Evidently there were two diverse schools of thought regarding the
                    advantages of iron used in building construction. Edwin May designed this building in "the

                    Third Empire, it was done in the grand manner, and was more for show than use. Its red granite
                    columns came from <placeName>

            <p>The State House, its cornerstone laid in 1880, was built during the next eight years, but plans were
                    made and approved in the seventies. Edwin May's plans were chosen, but he was later
                    replaced by his draftsman, Adolf Scherrer, who executed the plans.<hi rend="sup">55</hi> The
                    opposition to May apparently stemmed from disappointed architects living outside the city, and from
                    those who objected to the building of any sort of new State House, which they felt would be a
                    needless expense.<hi rend="sup">56</hi> The old State House, built at a cost of
                    $60,000.00, had begun its service with the 1835 session of the state legislature. There
                    seems no doubt that there was need for a new State House, if we may believe a contemporary newspaper
                    item. It says that the old State House, when new, was "really rather a handsome and
                    impressive structure, except as to its dome, which was a misfit in style and a mistake in
                    proportion. But the stucco didn't stick, and the Bluff slate in the basement rotted like
                    buckeye chunks in a swamp, and the plaster never would look like stone, and the zinc roof peeled off
                    in a tornado, and the ladder up the dome rotted and broke, and the vault in the house hall fell in,
                    and when the whole affair came down it showed that brick-work was not done more honestly then, nor
                    with better material, than now."<hi rend="sup">57</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In spite of petty bickering and indignation sessions of competitors whose plans were not chosen,<hi rend="sup">58</hi> work moved forward. In 1879 a scaled model of the State House, made by H. A.
                    Garvey, complete in every detail except for statuary and bas-relief work, was exhibited at Circle
                    and Market streets, and caused considerable comment. Illuminated at night it created a grand

            <p>"The perfect house" of the period was that of George D. Emery on North <placeName>

                    </placeName> Street, designed by R. P. Daggett It was most unusual, and its features seem remarkably
                    modern. Built in Queen Anne style, of Ellettsville stone, pressed brick and red mortar, it was
                    without the usual gingerbread decoration, being all plain and massive with only one piece of carved
                    stone in the whole exterior—the window cap. The interior was finished throughout in solid
                    woods native to Indiana, except for maple from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName>. Each room was finished in a different wood, such as black walnut, cherry, or mahogany,
                    with furniture made to order of the same type of wood. Emery, owner of a lumber yard, had been
                    selecting these choice woods from his stock for a half dozen years. Ceilings displayed oak rafters,
                    and walls were papered with "East Lake" paper. No nails were visible anywhere in
                    the construction. Its completeness was evidenced by such features as electrical communication, a
                    burglar alarm, speaking tubes, large closets, cedar chests, linen presses, store rooms, and bath
                    rooms, while in the cellar was a laundry complete with soapstone tubs and a drying room. House walls
                    were double, making a cushion of air between the inside and outside, giving excellent insulation.
                    Each room possessed a register for the hot air furnace, and a fireplace with andirons. Sliding doors
                    and deadened carpeted floors gave an air of quiet dignity to the whole. Outside the house, asphalt
                    carriage drives led to a complete stable at the rear of the house.<hi rend="sup">62</hi>

                            of the city will be opened Monday, April 25, as free schools." The first trustees
                            of the common schools, H. P. Coburn, Calvin Fletcher, and H. F. West, had been selected on

                    two languages, while the majority was taught in but one. The chief objection, furthermore, as named
                    in the school trustees' report, was the lack of means on the part of the city in its
                    present condition to establish such a school when new school houses were needed and the school
                    treasury was empty. The report was ordered tabled.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Several months later, a

                    <hi rend="i">Freischule</hi> was accomplishing much more than the public schools. It was the opinion
                    of the <hi rend="i">Telegraph</hi> that pedagogs would be convinced, by looking over the

            <p>The editorials bore fruit; among the bills introduced into the house at the afternoon session of the
                    legislature, February 11, was one, No. 265, by William E. McLean of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, pertaining to the introduction of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> language into the elementary schools of the state.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> While the bill
                    was pending, the editor of the <hi rend="i">Telegraph</hi> continued his series of discussions on
                    the subject of the introduction of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> language into the public schools. In these he reviewed the origin of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> language, took up its relation to other European languages and to English, emphasized

                    </placeName> people, and extolled its vigor and beauty. Even though much that he said was addressed
                    to the educated class, and no doubt was over the heads of some of the subscribers to the <hi rend="i">Telegraph</hi>, the articles show the tenacity with which the Germans held on to their
                    language and give an insight into the fight which they were willing to wage in order to have their

            <p>Before the series was completed, an unexpected blow fell. The bill to amend the school law had been
                    handed over to the Committee on Schools and Education of which McLean was chairman, and Emil Bischof

                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> representatives in the assembly, all three of whom were opposed to the bill as they
                    said for two reasons: they wanted only the English language taught to the youth of the country and
                    they considered the present law sufficient for all practical purposes.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> Most of
                    the blame for the opposition fell upon Bischof, who openly confessed that he was against the McLean

                    amended at the same time. He added that he himself was a friend of education and of the introduction

            <p>From now on the <hi rend="i">Telegraph</hi> was merciless in its criticism of Bischof, charging

                    Bischof. An editorial in the <hi rend="i">Telegraph</hi> of March 9, 1867, ran thus:
                    "Letters are pouring in upon us from all sides, expressive of the profound indignation felt
                    by the Germans of Indiana at the outrageous conduct of Emil Bischof with regard to the immigration
                    question and especially to the amendment to the school law. It is no wonder that our countrymen
                    should be so highly incensed at him. For several years past there has been entire unanimity among
                    the Germans of Indiana as to the necessity, of promoting immigration to the state by the most
                    vigorous measures, and of so amending the school law to give our public schools their full value in
                    the eyes of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> population. With regard to these two questions there has been no difference of opinion
                    among <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> Democrats and Republicans, and we know that no <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> in Indiana would have deemed it possible that one of their own number, when trusted
                    with a seat in the legislature, should so degrade himself as to frustrate the to him well-known
                    wishes of the entire body of his countrymen. We know further, that every <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> in Indiana almost without exception regarded it as a matter of course that the Germans
                    elected to the legislature would deem it their bounden duty, nay an honorable task of theirs, to
                    stand up for their countrymen, and to be the special advocates of their just and moderate

            <p>The present school law, Bischof to the contrary, did not meet the needs of the Germans in the state,
                    primarily for two reasons: first, because it explicitly stated that all subjects had to be taught in
                    English, and therefore <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> children would have to learn their mother tongue in English; and second, it did not

                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName>, because the introduction of languages other than English was directly dependent upon

                    a call to certain Germans over the state to join this movement and influence the legislature with
                    petitions. The letter concluded that if the legislature were convinced that a majority of the

                    those present, all marched to the senate chamber. According to the newspaper accounts, the
                    habitués of the State House were dumfounded at the flood of Germans. The senate was not
                    yet organized for business. The purpose of the delegation was explained to several senators. Hastily
                    the senate convened and, after a vote of suspension of rules, the school bill was third on the
                    agenda. The two other bills were read and discussed; there were messages; also pages running back
                    and forth; but the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> delegation had said it would not leave the place until the bill had been voted upon.
                    Finally it was in order. It was read and the battle started. There was much debate. Amendments were
                    introduced, relative to teachers, to having a majority of parents of the pupils petition instead of
                    but twenty-five, to having French and Spanish included, etc. The arguments for the bill seemed to be
                    more forceful, however, than those against it, and so it came to a vote and as the <hi rend="i">Telegraph</hi> expressed it "many a Saul became a Paul." Thirty-seven votes
                    were cast in favor of the bill and only three against it. The members of the <placeName>

                    539 in the sixth. "The average number who continued the study through the entire year was,
                    in the Sixth, 350; in the Ninth, 292; and in both, 642. Four teachers had been employed full time
                    for this purpose; they labored hard, and as a class were second to no others in the
                    schools." In concluding his report the superintendent said: "It affords me
                    pleasure to report the comparatively prosperous condition of this department of our school system.

            <byline>Joseph S. Karol, S. J.∗</byline>
            <p>For over a hundred years, since William Bowles built the first French Lick Springs Hotel in 1840,
                    French Lick, Indiana, has been a mecca for thousands of seekers of health and pleasure. Few of
                    these, however, know the history associated with this famous valley in southern Indiana. The early
                    Indians, George Rogers Clark, the pioneers, the War of 1812, William Bowles and the Knights of the
                    Golden Circle, and, in a later era, national business and political conventions—all have
                    made this playground of society a microcosm of American history.</p>
            <p>An interesting aspect of the history of French Lick is that which deals with the origins of its name.
                    When or how it received the name French Lick has not been established; a clue exists, however, which
                    may indicate that the place was known by that name in 1786.</p>
            <p>On September 19, 1786, a group of soldiers clad in buckskin moved along a woodland trail. Some of the
                    men rode horses, but most were on foot. At the head of this small army was General George Rogers
                    Clark, the hero of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>

            <p>The place Gaines mentioned in this letter was probably what is now French Lick, Indiana, for it is
                    situated near the site of the ancient overland trail that Clark and his army were following, about
                    midway between Clarksville, at the Falls of the <placeName>

                    when the incident of which Gaines wrote occurred there. Perhaps Gaines, writing years later, used
                    the name that was in well-established use by 1833, when he wrote his account.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

            <p>How did this famous resort town, nestled among the rugged hills of southern Indiana, get its name?
                    The term "lick" comes from the fact that long before the advent of the white man
                    to the area, wild animals, especially deer and buffalo, came in great numbers to what is now the
                    French Lick Valley, attracted by the same springs that were one day to bring thousands of
                    health-seekers to the famous hotels in the valley. "Pluto" and
                    "Sprudel," with their high salt content, gushed out of the earth and spread over
                    the rocks and ground surrounding the springs. The mineral waters evaporated, leaving the salt
                    encrusted on the ground; this deposit the animals licked—thus the area was called a
                    "lick."</p>
            <p>The buffalo that frequented the springs were part of the great herds of buffalo that roamed the
                    territory east of the <placeName>

            <p>Many of the first roads used by the pioneer settlers in the French Lick vicinity were buffalo trails.
                    Whether the numerous trails through the hills near the lick were also made by the buffalo who came
                    to the springs, has not been positively determined. Yet it is quite likely that they were; for these

                        followed it. Thus, it was known as Clark's Trace and the General Harrison Trail; but it

                    of buffalo that bore down on them; they killed one animal and wounded another. In the evening the
                    party encamped to feast on buffalo meat. Heckewelder wrote that the "salt spot, several

                    entire woods are for miles around quite bare. Many heads and skeletons of these animals are to be

            <p>Among people around French Lick the tradition has been that the French were driven out of the lick by
                    hostile Indians and that the last of the fleeing French threw a large number of kettles and other
                    articles into the river. It has been said that search was several times made for these kettles by
                    the first settlers. But there is no reliable account of this story.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A discovery made on the site of the French Lick Springs Hotel some years ago caused quite a flurry of
                    excitement locally and added the detail of a French and Indian battle to the legend. Foundations for
                    a new section of the hotel were being dug about 1900. On the spot where the bathhouse now stands,
                    the workmen found some skeletons in the ground. At once someone deduced that these skeletons were
                    the remains of the French and Indians who had fought in the "Battle of French
                    Lick." This detail was part of the legend until investigation showed that the workmen had
                    merely broken into a pioneer cemetery which had been located near the Ranger fort, built at the lick
                    as a protection for frontier settlers.</p>
            <p>Thus, the reason the principal lick in Indiana, called variously the "Great Lick,"
                    and the "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Buffalo</settlement>
                    </placeName> Salt Lick," came to be known as French Lick still has not been established.
                    The origins of the name remain a patchwork of tradition and circumstantial evidence. Until more
                    substantial evidence is found, the question of whether the French were ever at French Lick must
                    remain unanswered.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

                    </placeName> realized that if their town's initial growth were to be continued and
                    accelerated, the advantages of its favorable river position would have to be exploited to full
                    measure. This they knew could best be accomplished by establishing a commercial interdependence
                    between the town proper and the areas beyond its immediate geographic boundaries. No one knew what
                    the limits of this hinterland were, or what they were to become. The merchants of New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, like those of dozens of other infant communities, set their ambitions as far as the
                    most optimistic eye could penetrate, and then reached out to fulfill those ambitions. Every young
                    settlement in Indiana could not become a <placeName>

                    </placeName>. But in 1830, the race toward urbanization was open to all comers, and it was believed
                    that the degree of greatness achieved by a town depended largely on the alertness and enthusiasm of
                    its promoters.</p>
            <p>Expansion meant movement, and movement could take place only if there were facilities to channelize
                    and direct it. A rich farm country was of little benefit to a town without adequate means for
                    interchange between the two. Thus a keynote of New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s history from 1830 till after the Civil War was its persistent effort to
                    establish railroads and turnpikes to the north, the east, and the west, in order to round out its
                    pattern of transportation which naturally pivoted on the river. A few successes, more failures, and
                    the frequent upsurges of rivalry with other similarly ambitious communities marked this stormy
                    period of New <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s attempt to make a reality of its commercial dreams.</p>
            <p>The first really organized effort of the many towns in the state to reach out for the wealth of the
                    countryside was the elaborate internal improvements project of 1836, the pretentious scale of which
                    eventually bankrupted the state treasury and gave Indiana an unsavory reputation throughout the

            <p>Developing beyond the confines of a local project, the outward prosperity of the road daily
                    increased. Its business boomed as the increasing farm output sought its market in the many villages
                    scattered along the line. And at the bottom of this funnel was the town of New <placeName>

                    established. This was in part but an acceleration of a trend that had begun years earlier; but the
                    extent to which the commercial activity increased in the first few years after the establishment of
                    the road lends credence to the contention that the New <placeName>

                    contribute what they could to start the grandiose project on its way; but the town's chief
                    financial contribution was in the form of a $100,000.00 purchase of stock, this amount to
                    be raised by increasing the general tax rate.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> By 1856, when the line had been

                    not entirely reciprocate their benevolent feelings. There had to be two ends to a railroad, and the
                    funnel was open at both ends. Too, dozens of in-between towns awakened by the new railroad began to
                    share in commercial activities that a short while before had been handled at a few larger places

                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> was how the railroad could be so prosperous and yet be so poor. The receipts of the
                    road for the year 1855 were $645,827.00, and for the following year
                    $739,704.00. During the first six months of 1856, the road received
                    $150,405.00 for freight, $170,699.00 for passengers, and $16,275.00
                    for mail. Yet, the company reported that "the earnings have not been sufficient to enable
                    the directors to go on with the necessary improvements, and have sufficient left to meet existing
                    engagements." The solution recommended by the directors was: "$500,000
                    of income bonds to be issued, secured by a mortgage on the rolling stock of the company and such
                    other property as had not before been pledged, and propose to the holders of the second and third
                    mortgage bonds to receive these bonds instead of cash, for two and a half year's interest;
                    and the holders of the first mortgage bonds to receive them for one year's

                    look around for possible railroad projects in other directions. From 1853 there were at least three
                    railroad proposals that came under serious consideration, none of which was carried to completion.

            <p>Everything in the form of a railroad proposal that came their way the New Albanyians grasped and
                    attempted to turn into a reality. When they had the various propositions down on paper and had

                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s attention at this time was centered on the Sandusky road. Since New <placeName>

                    </placeName> from the Indian tribes who held it, it was opened for settlement to the pioneer white
                    settler by runs for land, in which the settlers, starting on a signal, raced to find land to their
                    liking and staked claims to it. The first of these races for homesteads took place in 1889. Each
                    opening of territory in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName> brought from all over the country a new influx of people, eager to claim land and
                    establish homes and farms. On September 16, 1893, the Federal government opened the Cherokee Outlet,
                    including the Tonkawa and Pawnee reservations. A native Hoosier, Louis A. Mossier, born in Corydon,
                    Indiana, in 1862, went from Indiana to participate in that great race, choose farm land, and take up
                    residence in the West. Mr. Mossier here describes his part in the historic run:</p>
            <p>"In this account of the opening of the Cherokee Strip in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName> to settlement September 16, 1893, I shall begin with my leaving my home near Corydon,
                    Indiana, about September 1. Accompanying me on this trip were Mrs. J. T. Pfrimmer and children Pearl
                    and Frank, who lived at Crescent, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName>. Also in the party were four Pfrimmer boys, my wife's brothers, George, Elias,
                    John, and Marian, who were also planning to make the run for homesteads. Upon our arrival we made
                    our headquarters at Jesse Pfrimmers' who had a home in what was known as Old <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The boys had previously procured their horses so the first thing for me to do upon arrival was to
                    find a suitable one; was fortunate in finding a $900 cow pony that had previously run two
                    races, knew the game, and was as hard as nails. A period of training and gaiting our five horses
                    together was the next order of business. For the next ten days we put them through intensive
                    training and had them in excellent shape for the race.</p>

            <p>On Wednesday of the second week we started for <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Orlando</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
               </placeName>, where the
                    land office was located. Arriving there about 3:00 P.M. we found a company site, and watered and fed
                    the horses. We found the land office located on a strip of land set apart by the government. It was
                    a part of the first quarter section which ran the length of the 300 mile strip on the south. A
                    similar strip ran along the north side of the area opened to settlement.</p>
            <p>On arriving at the land office we found many others there ahead of us. Three lines had been formed,
                    two for men and one for women, about 175 people being in each line. However, during the night two
                    more lines were formed and more registrars added to the force; so that the sight that greeted our
                    eyes at dawn were five lines of eager, expectant men and women, despite the fact that they had been
                    in line all night. In spite of the great crowd which was hourly being increased, it was an orderly,
                    serious-minded group of people assembled.</p>
            <p>Elias Pfrimmer narrowly escaped serious injury when his horse ran over a seven wire fence, breaking
                    three ribs and almost breaking his neck. Since Elias was so sore he could scarcely sit up, a bed was
                    made in the wagon for him. To get him through the lines for registration was a problem, but by
                    arranging with a company directly behind us to take one of his brother's place, the feat of
                    registration was accomplished. But to make the race on horseback was a bigger problem to be reckoned
                    with.</p>
            <p>After registration we returned to camp Thursday evening. Friday evening we made final preparation for
                    the run and turned in early. We were up at dawn Saturday morning, finishing breakfast just as the
                    sun was coming over the horizon. I think I have never seen such a beautiful sunrise. Saddling our
                    horses and making last minute preparations, we decided to ride around and find a more advantageous
                    position—a place where people were fewer.</p>
            <p>After riding several miles during which time we crossed several small streams, and noticing fresh
                    tracks into the strip, we decided to go back and start from our camp site. After giving our horses
                    their noon meal, which consisted of oats and a small drink of water, we still had fifteen minutes to
                    wait.</p>
            <pb n="169" id="VAA4025-050-2-081"/>
            <p>By this time the whole company was in a hustle and bustle getting placed in line. People on
                    horseback, in vehicles of every kind and description were milling about, lining up, edging this way
                    and that, seeking a better position.</p>
            <p>About five minutes before 12:00 o'clock, when a pistol was to be fired by a soldier as a
                    signal to start, we noticed the lines to the west of us moving, not leisurely but at full speed.
                    Someone shouted to the soldier to let us go, but before he did someone gave a whoop and away the
                    crowd dashed, taking everyone along. Just as we passed the soldier ha fired the gun, then turned his
                    attention toward keeping from being run over and trampled by the crowd. As far as one could see east
                    and west, people were going at full speed. After about the first mile the crowd began to widen out,
                    giving more room. Dust was thick and stifling, but luckily there was a little side wind and the
                    horses were able to keep abreast of the thickest of it.</p>
            <p>By this time the horses were warmed up and our attention was centered on seeing that they keep the
                    pace at which we had trained them. Good horses were passing us on the left and right and the
                    temptation to let ours go was great. However, we knew this was a race of endurance rather than
                    speed. The Pfrimmer boys were nervous about this, but I told them we soon would be doing the passing
                    when the other's horses had given out. Soon drops of sweat as large as hulled peas began
                    forming around the edge of the saddle blanket. The horses' breathing all the while was easy
                    and regular, which was very important.</p>
            <p>People began dropping out of the race for one reason or another. By the time we had gone perhaps five
                    miles I looked ahead and saw a very unusual and peculiar sight—a rather small man riding
                    a fine-looking bright bay, brown running horse. He was riding without a saddle or blanket. But more
                    peculiar than this was the way the horse, by throwing his head down would pull the rider up on his
                    weathers. The man would regain the proper riding position but only for a few seconds, when the
                    performance would be repeated. Both the horse and rider were completely worn out, when we came up to
                    him and exchanged a few words. I asked him where he was from and he answered, "From <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>." Then he said, "How will you trade horses?" I replied,
                    "No time to trade horses now." That was one of the fast horses that had got off to
                        <pb n="170" id="VAA4025-050-2-082"/> such a seemingly good start but couldn't keep up
                    the pace—out of the race after five or six miles, while my little cow pony did sixteen
                    miles in one hour flat and was in good shape at the finish.</p>
            <p>Now we could see on either side of the trails men and women on horseback and vehicles slowing up,
                    dismounting, and driving stakes, signifying their choice in a home site. Since we had not yet found
                    the kind of land we wanted, we rode on. Ahead of us suddenly was plainly visible a cloud of smoke,
                    and we soon came to a prairie fire. Because of the short grass and the side wind the horses jumped
                    it easily. It was generally supposed that the men who came into the territory the night before the
                    run and who bore the name of "Sooners" set the fire. In a speech made by Governor
                    Ferguson at Billings, three years later, he complimented the people of the strip on their good
                    citizenship and on the strides they were making in the improvement of the territory. He said in
                    part, "It's true that some of them were soon and others a little sooner, yet they
                    are doing a good and great work in the improvement of the new territory."</p>
            <p>Elias Pfrimmer, one of our party who had been injured by a fall on registration day, was in no
                    condition to make the run, but by sheer determination did ride for six miles, where he got off and
                    staked a claim. His wife and son, following us in a wagon with supplies, stopped to care for him.</p>
            <p>People continued to drop out on the right and on the left, presumably to stake claims. Some were
                    successful while others were not. At one point in the race a hack broke down while crossing a small
                    stream and other vehicles were forced to wait in line until the way could be cleared. The
                    horsebackers, however, never slackened their speed, but crossed on either side of the stalled line.
                    From this place we had about a mile of upgrade to the level of the flat between Warren Creek and
                    Black Bear Creek. Looking off to our right we could see horseback riders riding at top speed to the
                    north. We knew they had not passed us so concluded they were responsible for the
                    "Sooner" tracks we had previously seen in the dry creek bed. They kept going to
                    the north and west and were probably headed for Red Rock, Chicasky, or Salt Fork.</p>
            <p>George Pfrimmer decided to go toward Red Rock or Salt Fork so set out on a trail toward the
                    northeast. This left John, Marian, and me in the group.</p>
            <pb n="171" id="VAA4025-050-2-083"/>
            <p>Finally John said, "Louis, I believe you had better get off here soon for I believe the
                    places we wanted are already taken by the ‘Sooners.’ You have been to quite a
                    lot of expense and I would hate to see you miss getting a claim." But I decided to risk it
                    a little longer. I soon came to a spot that looked good to me. "Well, boys, I believe this
                    is good enough," I said, as I dismounted and drove my stake.</p>
            <p>As the brothers rode away they promised to be back by night so that we could all go to Perry the next
                    day to file our claims at the land office. Night came and the boys had not returned. Nine
                    o'clock and still they had not come. My preparation for the night consisted of unsaddling
                    my horse, tying the reins to the saddle horn, spreading the blanket on the saddle for a pillow, and
                    stretching out, but not to sleep. The horse was restless and kept pulling at the saddle.</p>
            <p>Other strange prairie noises, together with my excitement and anxiety about the boys not returning,
                    kept me from sleeping, except for a few cat naps. Thus passed my first night on my new farm.</p>
            <p>Sunday morning as the sun was coming up I saw a sight I shall never forget. A deer with her fawn came
                    bounding out of the sunrise, stopped forty yards to the north of me, stood there for perhaps five
                    minutes before scampering away to the northwest.</p>
            <p>The boys still had not returned so I decided they had gone to Perry. I later learned that they had
                    tried to return to my location but because of the darkness of the night and the unfamiliar
                    surroundings, they had gone a mile too far to the east.</p>
            <p>Since I had not eaten since Saturday morning, my greatest concern was to find the chuck wagon. I rode
                    to a big watering hole, watered my horse and drank all I could hold. I found a man with some corn so
                    I bought a feed for my faithful pony. After riding all the remainder of the day, I found George and
                    Elias and the chuck wagon, two miles north and two east. Needless to say, I was glad to see some
                    food. I have never since had to go without food for that long.</p>
            <p>George had staked a claim four miles north of me, Elias seven miles south, John two miles north, and
                    Marian in the northwest section with John. All of us made straight filings except John, who filed a
                    contest against a U.S. marshal.</p>
            <pb n="172" id="VAA4025-050-2-084"/>
            <p>When we arrived in Perry the town site was teeming with people from all parts of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. There stood a tent city of ten thousand population, where the day before had been only
                    prairie. Filing companies were formed which took several hours. It was necessary to stay close
                    together in order to file when the company was called. If you weren't there when called,
                    you had to go to the end of the line and join another company, which caused delay.</p>
            <p>John and Marian decided to stay and file immediately even though it caused additional expense, while
                    George and Elias and I waited until later to get our numbers at the land office.</p>
            <p>It was five weeks before the papers announcing, announced ours. We were lucky in getting to file the
                    same day we went to the office. During the five weeks' wait, we did some work on our
                    homesteads.</p>
            <p>We all got better than average farms while John got one of the best bottom farms in the country. I
                    later bought it from John and still own it.</p>
            <p>All business being finished here I returned to Indiana, where I made a sale of personal property that
                    couldn't be brought with us. I left Corydon with my wife and two children, Sadie and

            <p>On May 9, 1865, eight persons went on trial before a military commission in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, charged with complicity in a plot to assassinate President Abraham <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> and other high personages in the government. Charges were also presented against
                    Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States, and certain Confederate agents. A staff of
                    court reporters, headed by Benn Pitman, took down the record of the trial. When it ended, early in
                    July, four versions of the court proceedings were rushed into print. Two of them, published
                    respectively by Barclay &amp; Co. and T. B. Peterson &amp; Brothers, both of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the one a mere summary and the other frequently inaccurate, scarcely merit our
                    attention. The other two have been our chief sources of information as to what went on behind the
                    closed doors of the courtroom.</p>
            <p>The first of these, edited by a well-known <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> journalist, Ben: Perley Poore, and published by J. E. Tilton and Company of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>, first in a ten-volume wrapper-bound edition and then in three volumes in hard covers,
                    reproduces the interrogations and the replies of the witnesses in chronological order; but lack of a
                    table of contents and an index makes it inconvenient to use. Moreover, both the wrapper-bound
                    edition and the third volume in hard covers are now rare.</p>
            <p>The final version, and the one we are here concerned with, has been reproduced in facsimile by the
                    present publishers by means of a photographic process. Published originally by Moore, Wilstach
                    &amp; Baldwin of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York City</settlement>
                    </placeName>, it is in some respects the most useful edition for students. For Benn Pitman, the
                    editor, who was chief of the court reporters at the trial, so organized his material as to bring all
                    the testimony concerning each of the conspirators together, and he implemented his volume with a
                    complete table of contents and an alphabetical index of witnesses. A map of Booth's <pb n="174" id="VAA4025-050-2-086"/> escape route, a diagram of the stage of Ford's theater
                    together with a map of the vicinity, and a floor plan of the courtroom are other features of his
                    book. Besides the testimony, moreover, he also printed the orders convening the military commission,
                    the rules for its guidance, its findings, the sentences, and the arguments of counsel, none of which
                    are to be found in Poore's version.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the superiority of Pitman's book in these respects, however, it also has
                    defects and limitations. Both Pitman and Poore were obliged to omit some of the testimony in order
                    to obtain permission to publish from the War Department. And Pitman omitted still more of it
                    according to his own standards of relevancy, triviality, and repetitiousness. Furthermore, his
                    method of organization made it necessary for him to depart from the chronology of the trial, though
                    he always gives the date of the witnesses' testimony. And to save space, he often omits the
                    questions and consolidates the answers of the witnesses. For the general reader and even for most
                    students these are not serious defects, but those who must work meticulously may find it necessary
                    to use Poore along with Pitman.</p>
            <p>Since the publishers must expect a narrow margin of profit on a venture such as this, one should
                    perhaps forgive them the use of a printing process, which, through reproduction of the original
                    minuscule two-column type, endangers the reader's eyesight. And they are to be commended
                    for adding a splendid and informative introduction by Philip Van Doren Stern.</p>

            <p>In the nineteenth century the American public learned its history from such great scholars as John L.
                    Motley, George Bancroft, William H. Prescott, and Francis Parkman. These men knew their subjects,
                    and could write readable prose. In the twentieth century, however, hardly any American historians
                    have attained a popular following. Allan Nevins, perhaps; and possibly Henry Steele Commager, Samuel
                    Eliot <pb n="175" id="VAA4025-050-2-087"/> Morison, and Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. It would almost
                    seem, then, that Charles A. Beard, who died in 1948 and undeniably was a popular historian, lived
                    out of his proper time. His nearly fifty books sold the astonishing number of 11,352,163 copies. He
                    also wrote innumerable articles, essays, and reviews. There is no doubt about the quality of this
                    writing, either; "Uncle Charley" had his poor moments, but generally maintained a
                    very high level of excellence. Sometimes a few pet phrases or ideas reiterated themselves into
                    cliches, occasionally the thinker nodded while the prose rattled on; but the sharpness of language
                    and acuteness of thought almost always took the reader irresistibly to the conclusion that Beard had
                    in mind.</p>
            <p>It was peculiarly fitting that this extraordinary historian should have come from a farm near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spiceland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. Beard never forgot his farm experiences in Indiana, nor his college training
                    at DePauw in the 1890's. Neither the intellectual refinement of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName> nor the academic assembly line at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> could change his Midwestern views. His utter sincerity, droll wit, and homely approach
                    to all problems, great and small, made his personality tremendously attractive to generations of
                    students. This present volume of tributary essays indicates the effectiveness of his teaching and
                    scholarship.</p>
            <p>There are some brilliant essays here, especially those by George S. Counts, on "Charles
                    Beard, the Public Man," Merle Curti, on "Beard as Historical Critic," and
                    Eric F. Goldman, "Charles A. Beard: An Impression." The editor, Howard K. Beale,
                    has written well of Beard as historian. Beard's own academic interests divided along lines
                    generally true of American scholarship of his time. With one exception, the symposium covers these
                    interests very adequately: around the turn of the century Beard concerned himself with local
                    government, chiefly its institutions; his interest then broadened to American federal government,
                    culminating in his notable volume on the Constitution and an extraordinarily perceptive study of the
                    economic origins of Jeffersonian democracy (these works marked Beard's search for the
                    underpinnings of politics, which he found to be essentially economic); in the 1920's he
                    turned to the history of American civilization, writing his greatest work, <hi rend="i">The Rise of
                        American Civilization</hi>; in the thirties his mind turned to economics again, although this
                    time to a search for a way out of the Great Depression; <pb n="176" id="VAA4025-050-2-088"/> and in
                    the 1940's he faced the problems of world war and American foreign policy.</p>
            <p>Now it seems that Beard's work during the 1930's for the first time showed marked
                    signs of tendentiousness. The wish was constantly father to the thought, and his literary production
                    so suffered that by the end of the decade he had turned to pamphleteering. <hi rend="i">The Open
                        Door at Home</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Idea of National Interest</hi> are not very competent
                    books, in argument or literary finish, and the tracts which Beard published just prior to American
                    entry into the second World War—<hi rend="i">Giddy Minds and Foreign Quarrels</hi> and
                        <hi rend="i">A Foreign Policy for America</hi>—are unfit products of historical
                    scholarship. After the war Beard set out to show fatuousness and bad faith on the part of President
                    F#2 D. Roosevelt, in two books which were, again, not searches for truth but vindications of
                    positions taken in advance. Beard's writing in the 1930's and 1940's grew
                    from his great concern for the future of the Republic. Yet wishing could not make America safe. He
                    could not return the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> to the carefree era before the first World War, and it was of little avail to ransack
                    history to prove what essentially was a false theory: that isolation (or
                    "continentalism," as he liked to call it) was possible in the twentieth century.
                    This impossible quest brought him much unhappiness; even his tremendous personal influence upon
                    American scholarship and American popular thought could not make his point of view prevail.</p>
            <p>The present symposium unfortunately does not face up to this tragedy of Beard's later years.
                    A problem deserving at least three or four essays in a book as long as this is given only
                    one—"Beard and Foreign Policy," by George R. Leighton. A member of the
                    staff of the Republican Policy Committee of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senate, Leighton in some sense is disqualified as an objective critic. Although
                    unfavorable criticism is not frequently found in memorial volumes, surely Beard himself would have
                    wished its inclusion. His reputation is solid enough to have withstood some adverse appraisal.</p>
            <p>Withal this symposium comes off quite successfully. The editor deserves congratulation for the high
                    quality of the contributions, which with minor exception are worthy of their subject.</p>

            <p>In a pleasant and readable style John D. Forbes has told, for the first time, the story of William
                    Tinsley's life. What could have been a prosaic biography has turned out to be lively
                    narrative, interspersed with interesting anecdotes and useful information about the problem that
                    faced the average architect in the nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>Tinsley was not the most famous architect of his generation nor the leader in any of the new
                    movements, but he was more than average in artistic stature. For us he is of considerable
                    significance because of his activity in Indiana and the importance we attach to some of his
                    buildings.</p>
            <p>As fascinating as any chapter in Forbes' account is that dealing with Tinsley's
                    formative years in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName>. With his customary painstaking approach, the author apparently submerged himself in
                    the lore of southern <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName> and in the activities of the people with whom Tinsley came in contact. He even refers
                    to the countryside of County Tipperary with such intimacy that the reader unconsciously feels that
                    Forbes has, himself, often travelled the road from Clonmel to Cashel and knows intimately such
                    landmarks as Knockevan House and Tullemain Castle.</p>
            <p>As the story unfolds and the author follows the architect to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> and then to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Tinsley's professional and domestic problems interweave in such a way as to
                    keep the narrative on a high plain of interest. Tinsley was forty-seven when he arrived with his
                    family in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the autumn of 1851, and the competition for the proposed North Western Christian
                    University (later <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> University) brought him to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> soon after. His winning of that contest led him to change his residence to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where he remained, except for professional activities in nearby mid-western cities,
                    for almost twenty years. He died in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1885.</p>
            <p>Tinsley was principally a designer of institutional buildings—colleges, courthouses, and
                    churches—and among the best-known examples still standing are Center Hall at Wabash
                    College, Bascom Hall at the University of <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Of the last the author writes: "This handsome little church is
                    Tinsley's finest ecclesiastical building in America."</p>
            <p>Characteristic of nineteenth-century architects as a group, William Tinsley was an eclectic. He
                    borrowed principally from two earlier historic styles, sometimes resorting to one and at times to
                    the other, but always adding his own imagination and touch in adapting them to the problem at hand.
                    Those sources of inspiration were sources for most of our buildings, civic and domestic, in the
                    mid-nineteenth century: English Tudor (Gothic) buildings and Italian Renaissance villas. On one
                    occasion he turned to the Greek temple as a prototype, and at another time he experimented with the
                    Romanesque (the Henry Probasco house in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>), in which he was anticipating a movement that swept the country in the

                    reviewed the story with considerable detail and in the present edition lets it stand in its original
                    form with the exception of a few corrections in its chronology and orientation. He does, however,
                    change his observation with reference to the authenticity of the alleged <placeName>

                    it," in 1954 he is confident that "historians are practically unanimous in
                    rejecting it." After a tradition has been discredited it does not appear as if objectivity
                    in biography or history can best be achieved by continuing to utilize erroneous data in the body of
                    an argument, especially when the author may express his lack of faith in its dependability. One of <placeName>

                    he knew to be absolutely false, yet his only ground for so doing was that it contained such

                    adverse criticism of the book which might be raised may be almost entirely due to the period of
                    inflation which has engulfed us. The 1934 volume adorned with a beautiful buff colored buckram cover

                    appointed to the Supreme Court by a Republican president, Benjamin Harrison, in 1892, and
                    voluntarily stepped down from the Court in 1903. Shiras entered a Court that contained amongst
                    others that venerable titan, Justice Stephen J. Field of <placeName>

                    Jr. was nominated to the Court by President Theodore Roosevelt. Shiras' term on the Court
                    represented a decade in which the foundations were laid for that
                    "businessman's" majority on the Court that was to be dominant right up to
                    the Court Revolution of 1937. In the middle of Shiras' term of office, for example, the

                    economic doctrines which prevailed about fifty years ago, and a wholesale prohibition of what a

            </p>
            <p>It is easy to see in the judicial opinions of a patriarch like Field, with a varied and exciting
                    professional career in the frontier society of the West Coast as a background to his appointment to
                    the Court, the influence of pioneer notions of individualism and self-help. But Shiras belonged to a
                    later generation of justices, the generation of corporation lawyers; and the temptation is rather
                    strong, especially to critics of the Court around the time of the Court Revolution of 1937, to see
                    in these men's decisions on the Court the rationalizations, conscious or otherwise, of the
                    preferred interests of their former professional clients.</p>
            <p>As a professional lawyer, Shiras is not too readily distinguishable from countless other corporation
                    lawyers of his time. He graduated from Yale College, class of 1853, and thereafter studied briefly
                    at the Yale Law School before electing the more direct method of entry into the legal profession
                    through apprenticeship in a law office. He was admitted to the Allegheny, <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>, being so successful that by the 1880's his professional income was estimated
                    at $75,000.00 per year. He was even mentioned briefly as a Republican candidate for the
                    Senate in 1881. When Justice Joseph P. Bradley died in 1892, it was accepted that his successor
                    should, like Bradley, come from the third <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    President Harrison. Notable among the Shiras supporters were the members of the Yale class of 1853,
                    a fact which secured for Shiras important bi-partisan support, one of the members being Democratic

                    forgotten, even by legal historians. What saves him from this fate is the controversy over his role
                    in what Charles Evans Hughes was later to characterize as one of the Supreme Court's
                    "self-inflicted wounds"<hi rend="sup">4</hi>—the income tax cases of

                    tax legislation, had announced its invalidation of certain portions only of the legislation,
                    including the tax on rents and income from real estate; at the same time Chief Justice Melville
                    Weston Fuller indicated that the Court was evenly divided (necessarily by a four-four vote, Justice
                    Howell Edmunds <placeName>

                    </placeName> being absent on account of illness), upon certain other questions, principally the
                    question whether the whole act was void because the tax on income from real estate had been declared
                    invalid (the "severability" issue) and also the question whether the tax on income
                    from personal property was also invalid. The Court directed re-argument on these issues. At the
                    rehearing, Justice <placeName>

                    tuberculosis and dropsy long enough to attend and vote in favor of the legislation. The result was
                    that the remaining portions of the federal income tax legislation were now invalidated also, by a
                    five-to-four vote (Fuller C. J., Field, Gray, Brewer, Shiras, in favor of invalidation; Harlan,

                    had now switched his vote so as to favor invalidation. However, since the Court's
                    conferences are held in camera and since Chief Justice Fuller had, for some reason, made no
                    announcement at the first hearing of how the four-four tie was made up, it was impossible to say
                    with any certainty just which judge had now changed his vote. Judges, of course, are technically
                    entitled to change their minds; nevertheless, popular opinion at the time greeted the
                    Court's final decision with extreme bitterness as being an example of a judicial decision
                    dictated by conscious solicitude for the special interests of the privileged and wealthy classes. An
                    indignant public seems immediately to have fastened upon Shiras as the guilty party in the switch of
                    votes, and though Shiras seems to have accepted the public fury and clamor with outward calm, there
                    is little doubt that he felt the charge very deeply. The authors of the present volume advance the
                    thesis at some length that it was not Shiras who switched his vote at all, but some other
                    justice—a conclusion, it should be noted, to which Charles Evans Hughes also seems to
                    have inclined.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the evidence seems to be as inconclusive as ever and quite incapable of basing any hard-and-fast
                    proposition as to whether Shiras did change his vote, or whether he did not. What can, however, be
                    said in Shiras' behalf is that there is no justification on the known facts for singling
                    him out in preference to any one of the remaining members of the court majority at the second
                    argument—Chief Justice Fuller, and Justices Field, Gray, and Brewer—as the
                    justice who changed his vote. And this is enough, in passing on the merits of the charge against
                    Shiras, to warrant not merely the somewhat ambiguous Scottish jury verdict of "not
                    proven" but also the more affirmative common law jury formula of "not
                    guilty."</p>

                    their psychology and mental reactions, their religious myths, and their legends—in short
                    their human characteristics, and not the shell they assume when in the presence of strange white
                    men."</p>
            <p>Good and bad information is mixed together in such a way that it is difficult to make an overall
                    criticism. The general picture of the American Indian that emerges is pretty orthodox, although
                    there are some passages that will make the professional anthropologist squirm.</p>
            <p>Most of the material in the book has a familiar ring, reflecting standard publications, but no credit
                    is given to major sources. The rather short first chapter, dealing with the origin and racial
                    make-up of the Indian, is the worst. Discredited theories are mixed with generally accepted facts, a
                    few straw men are set up and knocked over, and standard viewpoints are misinterpreted.</p>
            <p>Once the historic horizon is reached, the material becomes much more acceptable.</p>
            <p>In his introduction the author gives a long list of Indian friends who presumably helped him in
                    formulating the book, but in only a few chapters containing personal anecdotes does this help seem
                    apparent. Most of the myths from various tribes are attributed to particular Indians, who are named.
                    In some instances at least, these individuals would seem to have had access to anthropological
                    publications. Compare, for instance, Looks to the Moon's tale of The First Fire, with the
                    myth bearing the same title published in "Myths of the Cherokee, by James Mooney, in the
                        <hi rend="i">19th Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology</hi>, or Smiling
                    Girl's story of The Origin of the Thunderbird Clan, with the "Origin Myth of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Winnebago</settlement>
                    </placeName>," published by Paul Radin in the <hi rend="i">37th Annual Report.</hi> Rarely
                    do myths recounted by different individuals at different periods show such detailed correspondence.</p>
            <p>The last third of the book consists of two parts, a "Glossary of the Principal Tribes now
                    Living in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>," and "Brief Biographies of Famous Indians."</p>
            <p>Both of these sections, alphabetically arranged, are taken almost verbatim from Bulletin 30,
                    "The Handbook of American Indians North of <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName>," a few words being changed or transposed as a rule in each item, and some of
                    the longer handbook articles being somewhat condensed. Nevertheless <pb n="185" id="VAA4025-050-2-097"/> in his introduction the author states: "in the Glossaries I
                    have given brief condensed descriptions of every existing tribe in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and brief biographical accounts of the majority of Indians of history and fame or who
                    have attained to noteworthy prominence. This never previously has been done, as far as I can
                    ascertain."</p>
            <p>In spite of all this, the general reader will get a pretty accurate picture of the Indian, both
                    aboriginal and acculturated, on reading <hi rend="i">The Real Americans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Much of the criticism of the book as a popular account could have easily been eliminated by a
                    paragraph or two in the introduction acknowledging extensive use of published source material and by
                    naming the sources.</p>

            <p>The first edition of the <hi rend="i">Guide to the Manuscript Collections in the William L. Clements
                        Library</hi>, compiled by Howard H. Peckham, then Curator of Manuscripts, appeared in 1942 and
                    described the 172 collections in the library at that time. New accessions in the intervening years
                    have increased the holdings to 304 collections, ranging in size from one to about 300 volumes and
                    amounting to a total of more than 200,000 pieces.</p>
            <p>The present edition of the <hi rend="i">Guide</hi> compiled by William S. Ewing, now Curator of
                    Manuscripts, incorporates much of the information from Peckham's <hi rend="i">Guide</hi>
                    and adds to it descriptions of all materials acquired since 1942. The descriptions follow the
                    concise form recommended in the tentative rules for cataloguing manuscripts recently issued by the
                    Library of Congress. These rules have been prepared in cooperation with curators of manuscripts from
                    other libraries to provide a uniform system for reporting holdings to the proposed National Register
                    of Manuscripts at the Library of Congress. Each entry carries a description of the types of papers
                    and documents in the collection; a list of writers of letters and <pb n="186" id="VAA4025-050-2-098"/> signers of documents in the collection; a reference to the longer descriptions in the first
                    edition of the <hi rend="i">Guide</hi> for collections listed there; biographical data for personal
                    papers; a record of publication of groups of letters or separate pieces from the collection;
                    references to descriptions in sales catalogues; information on provenance when known; and a
                    statement of the size of each collection.</p>
            <p>A feature of the <hi rend="i">Guide</hi>, which will prove of great value to historians, is the Index
                    of some 18,000 names, which lists all writers of letters and authors and signers of documents
                    represented in the manuscript collections. As an aid to identification, birth and death dates are
                    given after each name when known or lacking these a date at which the person was active. Recipients
                    of letters in a number of the collections are listed in a manuscript catalogue in the Clements
                    Library.</p>
            <p>The library's emphasis on the American revolutionary period is well known, but its other
                    areas of collecting are perhaps less generally realized. Its field is Americana. There are no date
                    limits, but few of the manuscripts are before 1700. The collections can be divided geographically
                    into two groups, those of British origin and those of American. The former fall into three
                    divisions: the prerevolutionary collections; the papers of political and military leaders of the
                    Revolutionary War period; and the collections relating to British politics at the turn of the
                    nineteenth century and the War of 1812.</p>
            <p>The collections of American origin complement the British collections for these same periods. In
                    addition the library possesses important concentrations of papers of later date on the genesis of
                    the anti-slavery movement, the history of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, the Spanish-American War and the emerging imperialism of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and the collecting of Americana. Hispanic American and Philippine history are also
                    represented. Only the fields of major manuscript strength of the library are indicated here. Many of
                    the smaller collections deal with other periods, and any student of American history may find it
                    well worth his while to consult the index of the <hi rend="i">Guide</hi> for manuscripts of possible
                    interest to him in his own particular area of study.</p>

            <p>The leading article represents an assembled history of Sanborn County. The account is based mostly on
                    reminiscences and personal accounts that were compiled, collected, and placed in the hands of the
                    Historical Society as a permanent record. The work of assembling, rewriting, and rechecking was
                    performed by Will G. Robinson, the secretary of the society and editor of its publications, with the
                    assistance of several leading citizens of the county. The narrative includes such topics as first
                    settlers and settlements, county seat fights, ghost towns, schools, churches and the usual gamut of
                    frontier experiences ranging from weather to disasters of various sorts. Biographies of leading
                    families are likewise included. Such an account of pioneer times in <placeName>

                    upon Yankton, the territorial capital and metropolis. In his history of Fort Sully, Steven Hoekman
                    presents a comprehensive and illuminating study of a frontier military post which existed from 1863
                    to 1894.</p>
            <p>In an article on promoters and promotion literature of Dakota Territory, William H. Russell notes the

                    campaign to attract settlers to the Dakotas. The author emphasizes the work of the territorial
                    immigration office but apparently is not familiar with a fairly complete <pb n="188" id="VAA4025-050-2-100"/> study of the official immigration activities of Dakota Territory
                    published two decades ago.</p>
            <p>A lengthy ethnological study of the Siouan Indians by W. E. Sanders under the title, "Trail
                    of the Ancient Sioux" leaves this reviewer somewhat perplexed. The author undertakes to
                    examine the archaeological and anthropological records for the different areas inhabited by
                    forty-seven divisions of Siouan stock to find common features or similarities in their culture
                    patterns apart from their community of language traits. The disciplines of history and sociology are
                    also heavily drawn upon for illustrative materials. This might just as well be called a study of
                    North American Indians frequenting a distinct geographical region extending from the Great Plains to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName> and from the Gulf coast to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and Upper <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> Valleys. Much of the material presented does not seem relevant to the author's
                    purpose. The ceremonials, the social organizations and mores, as well as the economy pattern, are
                    not necessarily peculiar to the ethnic groups reviewed. The inclusion of so much irrelevant material
                    produces the effect of disunity rather than the unity he seeks to establish. The author, however, is
                    to be commended for his extensive exploration into the field. He has steeped himself in the
                    published literature but has permitted himself to become lost in the process of selecting and
                    organizing his data and consequently fails to make his thesis convincing.</p>

            <p>This source book provides the layman with a substantial introduction to the early thinking of Wesley
                    and other Methodist Church fathers. It is characterized best as a warm and intensely human
                    work—no small task for a source book. Wesley comes alive through these expertly chosen
                    pieces of his writing. The editor's selections give Wesley's family background,
                    his early soul-searching, and conclude with the meeting of the first Conference. All is tied
                    together with an unobtrusive editorial text.</p>
            <pb n="189" id="VAA4025-050-2-101"/>
            <p>Wesley's ancestors were noteworthy for their dissenting views and intellectual independence;
                    however, they remain remote to the reader. His immediate family, on the other hand, is pictured
                    vividly. One shares the family troubles of disastrous fires and annoying
                    ghosts—Wesley's youthful environment becomes quite real.</p>
            <p>Well-selected documents tell the story of Wesley's activities in the Holy Club. This
                    organization's emphasis on the hard and regular life is related clearly to
                    Wesley's spiritual growth, and the anxiety to save his soul which he felt at this time took
                    him to the missionary field of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>. His experiences there are extensively documented and are interesting for the colorful
                    lights they throw on Wesley in a nonreligious context.</p>
            <p>Documents demonstrate the influence of Bohler and Whitefield on the religious thinking of Wesley and
                    also detail the climax of his religious experience in the "strange heartwarming"
                    in the Aldersgate Chapel. By 1739 Wesley was trying eagerly to give all Englishmen his glowing
                    knowledge of personal salvation. This large task created the need for field preaching and lay
                    preachers, which Wesley accepted as undesirable, but necessary, innovations. Whereas in 1739
                    Wesley's work was still revival in form, by 1741 his United Societies were taking shape and
                    gradually separating the Wesleyan movement from others of the period.</p>
            <p>By 1745 this separation was complete, and Methodism's basic form had been set. Wesley had
                    achieved a spiritual revival combined with a reform program in a superb organizational frame. The
                    organizational forms—the band, the class, the conference—assured
                    Wesley's control and influence in the early formative years of Methodism.</p>
            <p>Printing costs, no doubt, are responsible for the grouping of the footnotes at the end of the book.
                    This will not be a serious fault to the layman who will read this work, but it is to be regretted by
                    all that the scope of the book is so limited. Few documents are included which present insights into
                    the social and intellectual ferment of eighteenth-century <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. Methodism and Wesley's personal development can only be understood in terms
                    of these conditions. Nevertheless, the book is of value for its concise reporting by Wesley of his
                    early views.</p>

            <p>With a national board located in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and twelve regional boards distributed throughout the country, charged with
                    responsibility for wage stabilization and the task of preventing work stoppages in essential
                    industries, the War Labor Board was one of the most important of the numerous wartime governmental
                    agencies. From January 12, 1942, to August 18, 1945, the National War Labor Board and its field
                    agencies decided 17,650 dispute cases that other agencies had failed to settle and terminated
                    436,894 voluntary wage adjustment cases. That the national board handled less than .005 per cent of
                    the latter cases is adequate indication of the importance of the regional boards.</p>
            <p>The present volume does not profess to be a history of the Regional War Labor Boards. It is, rather,
                    a study of their administrative policies and problems, and is designed to fill a reported gap in the
                    literature of governmental administration. The "literature on top-level administration
                    outnumbers the literature on field administration by at least twenty to one," and this
                    book, begun as a doctoral dissertation, is an attempt partially to alleviate that discrepancy.</p>
            <p>The author finds much to criticize about the organization and procedure of the War Labor Board. Most
                    serious, perhaps, is the charge that the nature of the national board's orders and
                    directives put the regional boards "in a position of responsibility without
                    authority." Throughout the volume evidence is plentiful that the national board was
                    extremely reluctant to spell out its policies in definite and clear-cut terms. Although refusing to
                    accept the idea that each case should be judged on its own merits, the national board maintained
                    that no formula adequate for all cases could be devised. Regional boards frequently were criticized
                    for taking unauthorized action, but their requests for more definite instructions seldom were
                    heeded. The result was a considerable amount of grumbling, groping, and bungling.</p>
            <p>The mountainous records of the War Labor Board, most of which are housed in the National Archives,
                    would discourage any but the most determined of researchers, but <pb n="191" id="VAA4025-050-2-103"/> the more than 1100 footnotes contained in this 271-page monograph indicate that the author has
                    worked them carefully. In several respects, however, the result of this prodigious amount of work is
                    disappointing. Because the text is broken up into 230 sections, ranging in length from three lines
                    to eight pages, the reader seldom gets the feel of a topic before it is abruptly broken off and
                    another one is begun. The volume abounds in statements that might variously be described as obvious,
                    contradictory, and redundant. For example, the following sentences seem to assert the obvious:
                    "Effective policy effectively administered yields good administration."
                    "The ability of a field office to act within the scope of the agency program depends upon
                    its ability to understand that program." Some examples of contradictory statements are:
                    "Every regional board used part-time members to represent all three
                    groups—labor, industry, public. The sole exception was RWLB VI in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>." "When an analyst opened a case folder, his first concern was that
                    the application was properly filled out." And in the same paragraph: "By the time
                    a case reached an analyst, [it] had been previously checked for accuracy and completeness."
                    Finally, too many short, choppy sentences and a lack of variety in sentence structure greatly reduce
                    the readability of the book.</p>
            <p>Despite the defects which have been noted, <hi rend="i">War Labor Boards in the Field</hi> may
                    properly be described as a useful contribution to the literature on governmental administration. The
                    development of the War Labor Board from inception to termination is minutely traced. The many
                    problems, both procedural and substantive, which it faced and the changes made to meet those
                    problems are discussed in detail. Some of these problems were: (1) what standards would best
                    maintain central control and allow regional discretion at the same time? (2) To what extent should
                    the regional boards be allowed to operate independently? (3) Did the tripartite structure of boards
                    adequately protect the interests of the public? (4) What was the best way to secure sufficient wage
                    data upon which to base wage stabilization decisions? (5) How could contradictory authority and
                    overlapping jurisdiction be eliminated? (6) How specific and unyielding should be the instructions
                    of the national board to regional boards? Few of these problems ever were completely solved.</p>
            <p>The bringing to light of these problems together with the <pb n="192" id="VAA4025-050-2-104"/>
                    various procedures devised to cope with them, although of somewhat limited value to the historian,
                    should be of particular interest to the administrator who may be confronted with similar problems.</p>
