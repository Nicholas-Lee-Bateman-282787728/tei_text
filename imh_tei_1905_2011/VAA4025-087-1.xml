            <p>Millions of citizens throughout the world have taken part in anniversary celebrations, centennials,
                    monument dedications, civic holidays, and other commemorative activities. Despite widespread public
                    participation, however, such events have generated little serious historical analysis. Most
                    participants and observers recognize that commemorative activities can involve traditional symbols
                    and messages from the past, enormous crowds, and extravagant expenditures of funds; but beyond such
                    general observations few are aware of the complex processes that generate and shape such functions.</p>
            <p>Sociologist William Lloyd Warner pioneered the analysis of commemorative activity in the <placeName>

                    present. Entitled <hi rend="i">The Living and the Dead: A Study of the Symbolic Life

                    such as the <placeName>

                    files of the local tercentenary planning group and to provide detailed descriptions of the floats
                    and the tableaus that expressed historical themes in the tercentenary parade.</p>

                    perception of the past but were carefully planned by influential people who wanted to influence the
                    rest of society in specific ways. The "traditional symbols" or historical
                    representations that were prominent in the parade were not objective accounts of the past. Rather,
                    they were symbolic representations that met the needs of powerful people in the community, people
                    who wanted to preserve aspects of a past that reinforced and legitimated their own positions of
                    prominence and fostered notions of loyalty to leaders and existing institutions in the present.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Warner's study revealed the existence in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Yankee City</settlement>
                    </placeName> of a "central committee" that was dominated by the old stock,
                    Protestant elite. It was this committee that selected the major themes expressed in some forty-three
                    floats or, as historians Terence O. Ranger and Eric Hobsbawm put it, that
                    "invented" the traditions and the memories that were meant to be shared by all.
                    Ethnic groups whose origins were more recent than those of the old stock residents in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newburyport</settlement>
                    </placeName> could sponsor floats only if they spoke to the theme of creating the American nation
                    and made a "dignified and trustworthy" presentation of the city's past.
                    Thus, the French Canadian float could depict not the story of the group's migration to <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName> but the ceremonial visit of the Marquis de Lafayette to <placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1824. Ultimately most of the floats in the parade focused on the Puritan origins of
                    the town and the creation of the American nation. Only three floats represented any post-Civil War
                    historical activity, and no floats depicted the migration experience that created most of the
                    town's ethnic communities.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>Just how valid was Warner's argument? How frequently did commemorative activity reflect the
                    celebration of a past that served only the interests of powerful individuals and groups in a
                    community? An examination of commemoration in twentieth-century <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, perhaps provides a partial answer. Not only does the Hoosier capital contain
                    impressive collections of monuments it also preserves long-held traditions of civic holidays.
                    Further, its newspapers offer a glimpse of the process of celebrating and honoring historic ideals
                    and symbols in a region very different from <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Prior to World War I two major themes dominated commemorative activity in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. One appeared to reflect a desire to reinforce citizens' sentiments of
                    national loyalty and patriotism. By fostering loyalty to national institutions, civic leaders
                    apparently hoped to foster loyalty to all institutions and to the men who <list type="footnotes">

                    that ordinary people felt for friends and ancestors who had died in past wars. Ceremonies for the
                    dead not only reinforced historical messages that celebrated the notion of citizen sacrifice but
                    also represented a need to express a sense of loss and sorrow. Citizens of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> also often used commemorative time and civic holidays to enjoy leisure-time activities
                    and did not discuss messages from the past at all. Thus, it appears that commemoration in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was partially what Warner suggested it was in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newburyport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but it was also more complex.</p>
            <p>Celebrations on the Fourth of July provide good examples of the various interests that were
                    manifested during commemorative days. Prior to July, 1918, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> officials seldom organized large solemn ceremonies to honor the origins of the nation
                    itself. Citizens often filled the streets of the city on the Fourth; but rather than marching in an
                    orderly fashion, they were busily going to amusement parks, picnics, or fireworks displays. One
                    observer in the city commented that he thought popular interest in horse racing and betting at the
                    state fairgrounds "overshadowed any celebration of the day." Another remarked that
                    the planning for the programs of the day had apparently been "left to a committee of
                    208,000," the approximate city population of the time.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the initial decades of the twentieth century the most discussed issue concerning Fourth of
                    July celebrations was not the birth of the nation but the use of firecrackers in the streets. Many
                    officials not only decried the potential for injury and fire but also worried that use of these
                    explosives distracted citizens' attention from the patriotic significance of the day. A
                    local editor wrote that it was "barbarous" to celebrate a national birthday by
                    giving the "riotously inclined full liberty to make all the noise they cared to."
                    The writer feared that the "high and holy significance of the day on which a whole people
                    ventured life for liberty is lost in a senseless saturnalia of noise."<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                    City officials and some members of the professional classes such as ministers and businessmen did
                    not object to large displays of fireworks that were properly organized. When they argued for a
                    "safe and sane" celebration, they specifically directed their remarks against the
                    unregulated use of fireworks, an activity that they perceived to be the special preserve of young
                    boys and the foreign-born. In 1910 a local writer expressed his belief that boys were missing the
                    meaning of the day by playing with fireworks and suggested that they take part in neighborhood
                    historical pageants that would tell the story of <geogName>Bunker Hill</geogName>, Paul Revere, and
                    George Rogers Clark at <placeName>

                    restrictions placed on the use of fireworks in the downtown "fire limit" were not
                    young boys but "Americans in the making." They cited the case of one immigrant, an
                    Italian, who could not read English and did not know about the prohibitions. The newcomer, Joseph
                    Coppoleno, did promise that next year, "I will know what the Fourth of July is in this
                        country."<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

            <p>Considerably less debate took place over the proper way to remember local citizens who had died in
                    battle. This component of commemoration, usually expressed on Memorial Day, cut close to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> residents' personal feelings and recollections. Although they certainly had
                    leisure-time activities on their minds, citizens exhibited a seriousness of purpose on May 30 that
                    was often missing on the Fourth of July. By 1910 a Memorial Day automobile race was already
                    attracting large crowds to the Hoosier capital, but, clearly, the commemoration of the dead was no
                    small matter. Normal Memorial Day celebrations consisted of thousands of people walking through the
                    streets carrying flowers to cemeteries, the strewing of flowers around public monuments to the Civil
                    War dead and other figures from the past, and countless sermons and church services. Participants in
                    these activities paid little direct attention to patriotic symbols and messages often associated
                    with commemorative events and a great deal of attention to ordinary people of the community. In 1905
                    a sermon at <geogName>Crown Hill</geogName> Cemetery praised not only those city residents who went
                    off to war but also the "unlisted heroes" who stayed at home. In the same year
                    William Reagan, a Civil War veteran, spoke at another cemetery and called for all to respect the
                    "private" and the "common man" who did his duty. Reports from
                    graveside activities often noted the "tears and sobs" that were evident as roll

            <p>The commemoration of the dead and the sacrifice of ordinary people in the Civil War, at once an
                    expression of patriotism and local and personal sorrow and pride, became the nucleus of the largest
                    commemorative activity in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s history prior to World War I. In 1902 the city erected a towering landmark
                    to the dead in the middle of the downtown. Standing over three hundred feet high, the central shaft
                    of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument looked down on the entire city and created
                    enormous interest and excitement. It certainly stood for the theme of citizen sacrifice for the
                    nation, but contemporary observers were quick to argue that it also honored the "private
                    soldier" who was missed by ordinary citizens in the <placeName>

            <p>The idea for the monument had originated with Oliver P. Morton, Indiana's Civil War
                    governor, and was furthered by a local Union veterans' association that was organized in
                    1876. As was the norm with nineteenth-century monuments, however, patriotism and local pride did not
                    generate sufficient public contributions. Not until the 1880s was the Grand Army of the Republic
                    (GAR) in Indiana able to persuade the state legislature to appropriate $200,000 and get
                    actual construction underway.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In its final form the monument consisted of a tall central shaft with four bronze statues located at
                    each corner. Dedicated to ordinary Hoosier soldiers who had fought for the nation, the shaft
                    included on each side allegorical figures representing war and peace. A local writer thought the
                    monument more beautiful than the "unsightly shaft" of the monuments dedicated to
                    the Battle of <geogName>Bunker Hill</geogName> or George Washington. The bronze corner statues were
                    memorials to four major eras in the history of Indiana and the Midwest as represented by leading
                    figures. Commemorated were George Rogers Clark and the era of the Revolution; James Whitcomb, the
                    governor of the state during the war with <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>

                    P. Morton. Apparently the power structure in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was such that ordinary soldiers could not be commemorated without some attention to
                    prominent leaders.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dedication ceremonies on May 14, 1902, included a parade of veterans from the Mexican, Civil, and
                    Spanish-American wars. Over fifteen thousand visitors crowded into <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> both to see the monument and to watch the parade. Many had visited the memorial several
                    days before the dedication because of rumors that the crowds on dedication day would be prohibitive.
                    During the parade reporters noted "tears and sobs in the eyes" of many spectators
                    as the veterans passed by. Several of the marchers themselves broke into tears in part, as one
                    former soldier described, because of the remembered deaths of the "fellows that bunked,
                    messed, and fought with me for three years."<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

                    and pride they felt for ordinary soldiers than about the "glorious incentives"
                    provided by the soldiers of the Civil War for the youth who had to fight in the World War. Suddenly
                    the past was being commemorated not so much as a means for expressing grief and sorrow for those who
                    had died but as a means of instilling patriotism in the present. Indeed, a study of
                    twentieth-century Memorial Day orations in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> indicates that the memory and example of the Civil War was used extensively during 1918
                    but was dramatically absent afterward, when it was replaced by memories of World War I itself. In
                    1918, however, most citizens could agree with the speaker at Butler College who exclaimed that
                    Americans could truly appreciate as never before exactly what it meant to "preserve the

            <p>The most dramatic change in commemorative activity during World War I occurred in Fourth of July
                    celebrations. In 1918, when the exercise of state power became so dramatic, leisure and frivolity
                    temporarily gave way to more serious commemoration. In that year <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> officials, at the behest of President Woodrow Wilson, organized a commemorative
                    activity that was unique to the city. The event, which discussed issues previously absent from
                    public commemorations, was the Americanization Day parade of July 4, 1918. As a public exhibition of
                    unity and loyalty, the parade included many diverse sectors of the community's social
                    structure but featured immigrant newcomers who had seldom been heard in civic discourse. The one
                    ethnic group that had been publicly audible was unable to assert ethnic identity and loyalty during
                    the war. The Germans, who had celebrated German Day each October, marched in the parade not as an
                    ethnic unit but as the "Friends of German Democracy" and carried only an American
                    flag. Other ethnic aggregations carried flags from both their homelands and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> to tell the rest of the city that ethnic identity and background were not incompatible
                    with loyalty to the American nation.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

                    </placeName>" surrounded by her American sisters. This float was followed by
                    Italian-American school children carrying American flags. Slovenians, numbering over 350 in the line
                    of march, presented a truck carrying Slovene-American children and farmers pledging loyalty to the <placeName>

                    </placeName> and a second truck filled with women in folk costumes. The group carried a banner that
                    read "Slovenians: We Are For America First, Last, and All the Time." Romanians
                    created a float that showed a figure dressed as Uncle Sam triumphing over another figure that
                    represented "autocracy." At the conclusion of the parade each ethnic group carried
                    the flag of its homeland to a stage dominated by a large American flag. Wymond J. Beckett, an
                    attorney active in planning local defense activities, apologized to the foreign-born on behalf of
                    the rest of the city's and nation's prominent classes. He admitted that in the

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> leaders and officials quickly eliminated immigrant voices from public discourse and
                    began once more an energetic quest to link local and personal feeling for the dead with the
                    promotion of patriotism and even the progress of the city itself. Commemorative activities focused
                    on veterans, both living and dead, because they, like all symbols, mediated several powerful but
                    divergent interests in society. Ordinary people felt a strong need to understand what wartime
                    sacrifices were all about and to express sorrow and grief. City leaders and boosters were eager to
                    stimulate civic pride as a basis for continued prosperity and growth and to profit from the powerful
                    patriotic currents engendered by the war and reinforced by the federal government during and after
                    the conflict. Although there was a clear exercise of power on the part of dominant political and
                    civic leaders, there was also a democratic thrust to the commemoration of patriotic veterans since
                    they came from all social classes, ethnic and religious groups, and races.</p>
            <p>This democratic component of the memory system and culture may actually have helped to contain the
                    spread of the more intolerant strain of nationalism that was manifested by the rise of the Ku Klux

                    opposed by all of the local newspapers, which were run by local elites, and by Catholic, Jewish, and
                    Protestant bodies who had all participated actively in the winning' and commemoration of
                    the war. It was not uncommon, for instance, at commemorative events during the height of the
                    Klan's power in the city to have representatives from all three faiths speak at services
                    and ceremonies, a direct rebuttal of the Klan's anti-Catholic and anti-Jewish attitudes.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

            <p>The use of patriotic veterans as a commemorative symbol was not only democratic and linked somewhat
                    to the needs of ordinary people it was intolerant and hegemonic as well. Institutional leaders, who

                    past wars and historical actors therein to stimulate loyalty to existing institutions and,
                    therefore, to themselves. Patriotism was thus fostered in so uncompromising a manner that it
                    nurtured the power of large governmental and economic structures in the city, the state, and the
                    nation. This vested interest in maintaining existing power structures partially explains city
                    leaders' attempts to promote the commemoration of soldiers rather than pioneers, who had
                    been the dominant historical symbol of Indiana's centennial celebration in 1916.</p>

                    </placeName> Speedway remained integral parts of the day's activities. Members of the
                    professional classes, especially ministers, military officers, and lawyers always gave orations; and
                    the past continued to serve as a device to educate citizens in the present. At the
                    Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument in 1929, for example, the Reverend Warren Wiant
                    told his listeners: the "glory of our history is that when the testing day came, our
                    fathers were not afraid to sacrifice." He asserted that the same spirit of sacrifice for
                    the nation must be manifested again in the future if "our priceless heritage is to be
                        preserved."<hi rend="sup">14</hi>

            <p>In the decades after World War I, however, Armistice Day was the major celebration honoring veterans.

                    consisted largely of middle- and lower-middle-class white Protestants, the Armistice Day parade
                    affirmed the equality of all religious groups and consisted of clergy, veterans, and Gold Star
                    mothers of all faiths. Parades of five thousand people were not uncommon, American Legion dances
                    were inaugurated, and speakers used the occasion to "revive cherished memories" as
                    well as to sustain the ideal of continued service to the nation.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

                    because of active efforts on the part of the city's business and professional classes. In

                    narrowly that Middletown's business elite fostered patriotism and civic pride together to
                    promote an orderly society that would assist leaders in their efforts to attract new business. The
                    Lynds failed to realize that honoring soldiers' sacrifices offered ordinary people a place
                    within the construction of public memory. At the same time they were correct in seeing that city
                    boosters' willingness to commit large amounts of resources and energy to the building of
                    patriotic sentiments and landmarks represented a central force in the construction of patriotism.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

                    to build a facility for the national headquarters. Fearing that other cities might still lure the
                    legion away, city leaders pressed for a $10,000,000 memorial building and plaza that
                    would house the legion and honor the war dead at the same time. Some veterans protested that the
                    money would be better spent on bonuses, and residents near the downtown, where the plaza was to

            <p>Local pride and personal memories of the living and the dead were not by any means eliminated from

                    had fought and died in the war went into the cornerstone of the new memorial. Included were the
                    names of over 130,000 Indiana World War I veterans, the state's Gold Star honor roll, a
                    report on the American Red Cross work in the state during the war, a list of the officers and

                    the wartime experience receded and the attention of city leaders switched from boosterism to
                    rectifying economic problems, the organized celebration of patriotism diminished. Leisure and
                    enjoyment rather than patriotism and the commemoration of the dead dominated Armistice Day
                    celebrations. In 1937 the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Star</hi> noted that the downtown parade was larger than in the past but also that
                    "gaiety was peculiarly more predominant." A military band played
                    "Indiana, Our Indiana," instead of a military march, and a high school band gave a
                    rendition of "Jingle Bells." A <hi rend="i">Star</hi> reporter explained that the
                    drum major went through "capers revealing that he had no memory of the first Armistice Day
                    and its surging emotions." A group of marching legionnaires, pausing for a temporary delay,
                    even danced a jig and shouted at onlookers. The Butler University band played a "quick-step
                    version of the Butler war song." Nevertheless, deep emotions and seriousness of purpose
                    still existed in 1937. One observer revealed that a group of war mothers riding in an automobile
                    caravan "brushed away" tears and that "aging veterans stood grim
                    faced" during ceremonies. Both the <hi rend="i">Star</hi> and the local American Legion
                    noted, however, that the "bright edges of what they believed were unforgettable
                    memories" seemed "remote" to a new generation raised since the war. In
                    fact, based on that perception, the legion mounted a display of posters from the era of World War I
                    so that young people could read about how citizens were called to war, bought Liberty bonds, served
                    in the Red Cross, and saved fuel.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>

            <p>As might be expected, the emphasis on patriotism in commemorative activities reemerged during World
                    War II. Once the war had ended, however, the patriotic interest appeared to wane much more quickly
                    than it had in the 1920s. People in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> still paraded on Armistice Day and placed flowers on graves at Memorial Day; but
                    leisure interests predominated as never before, and the effort to place memory in the service of the
                    nation was considerably weaker than after World War I. Parades honoring veterans were smaller, and
                    Memorial Day increasingly became associated with the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> 500 automobile race. On the Fourth of July, 1952, a pageant once again commemorated
                    "Pioneer Days," a theme that had been neglected during the patriotic celebrations
                    of the dead. A local editor observed that after World War II the "Fourth was not as grand
                    and glorious."<hi rend="sup">23</hi>

            <p>An effort to revive the emphasis on patriotism and civic loyalty in commemorative activities
                    manifested itself in the late 1960s and early 1970s when the nation was attacked again, this time by
                    dissidents within the country. In response to urban unrest and antiwar demonstrations in the nation
                    at large and to incidents of "rowdy behavior" by youth during several public
                    events in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the city's leaders attempted to use commemorative days to instill sentiments
                    of patriotism and civic responsibility. On July 4, 1969, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Star featured a plan by which the city could celebrate the upcoming observance of its
                    sesquicentennial and the nation's bicentennial. Conceived by Edward Pierce, a leading
                    architect in the city, the proposal consisted of several projects designed to rejuvenate a sense of
                    civic and patriotic obligation. Pierce called for frequent decorations of Monument Circle to promote
                    a "community spirit," renewed attention to the creation of radial avenues
                    emanating from the downtown and downtown parking areas in order to facilitate the flow of citizens
                    to the center of the city, and the development of an Indiana Lincoln Memorial Center. Pierce argued
                    specifically that historic landmarks could serve as an "inspiration for future
                    generations." Although all of Pierce's ideas were not developed, the promotion of
                    his plan did indicate an awareness on the part of the city's professional classes that
                    public symbols and monuments could contribute to the promotion of community and civic loyalty. In
                    1970 political and civic authorities initiated Unigov, a plan that allowed <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                        <region type="county">Marion County</region>
                    </placeName>. In part, the plan reflected city leaders' desires to reinvigorate what was
                    perceived to be a racially and geographically divided city. Richard Lugar, the city's mayor
                    at the time, claimed that the annexation would "heal" the divisions between the
                    suburbs and the city and make the city more livable.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s professional elite even made some effort to revitalize the patriotic
                    component of Fourth of July celebrations, although the stimulus came from outside the city.
                    Entertainer Bob Hope was prominent in the promotion of an "Honor America Day"
                    celebration to be held in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington, D. C.</settlement>
                    </placeName>, on July 4 of that year. The celebration's purpose was to tell the world,
                    which had watched protests by American citizens against their government and political structure,
                    that "the love of America by Americans is as real and vital as it ever was." This
                    movement stirred some local organizations into action. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Star</hi> offered the local population inexpensive lapel pins in the shape of the
                    American flag and completely sold its initial order of forty thousand in just a few days. The
                    newspaper also cited reports that claimed that the sale of American flags had risen dramatically
                    along with the sudden use of flag decals on automobile windshields. Although Fourth of July parades
                    were seldom significant events in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the twentieth century, four were held on "Honor America Day" in
                    various parts of the city; all ended together in the parking lot of a shopping center instead of
                    near a monument for a patriotic ceremony.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Organized attempts to stimulate patriotism did not last as long during the 1960s and 1970s as similar
                    efforts had after 1918. By the late 1960s even Memorial Day was devoted less to veterans and dead
                    patriots and much more to entertainment and leisure. A parade, held several days before the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> 500, emphasized not serious commemoration and civic duty but fantasy and escape. In
                    fact, civic leaders and officials transferred most of their attention to the organization of the
                    "500 Festival Parade" and left commemoration of the dead largely to individuals
                    and small patriotic or veterans organizations. Unlike the 1920s, when city leaders and ordinary
                    citizens jointly organized commemorative activities honoring the dead, the public in the 1960s was
                    left to express its commemorative sentiments in its own way. Consequently, commemoration became less
                    an expression of national loyalty and more an expression of sorrow and loss. Small ceremonies and
                    personal visits still took place at cemeteries, but no centrally organized parades were held, and no
                    monuments were dedicated. Newspapers carried personal statements from individuals who had lost loved
                    ones both in wartime and peacetime. In a sense the revelation of personal feelings was more
                    widespread than during earlier public commemorative events. At the same time this expression of
                    feeling was in part diminished by the enormous scale of the 500 Festival celebration and parade,
                    which was attended by several hundred thousand people each year just before Memorial Day.</p>

            <p>Although Memorial Day expressions of sorrow undoubtedly drew less public attention, they were
                    nonetheless poignant. Not all involved an articulation of grief for military dead. In fact, any
                    deceased friend or relative was likely to be remembered. Veterans, however, constituted a very large
                    portion of the approximately one thousand messages that were printed in the local press each
                    Memorial Day, and the sorrowful component of private memories was evident. The family of a man

            <p>These expressions of personal grief and memory contrasted sharply with the celebration of the

                    </placeName>. Each year in the late 1960s and early 1970s organizers devoted the parade to
                    entertainment and eschewed the themes of loyalty, Americanization, progress, and the triumph of the
                    pioneers, topics that had been featured in commemorations prior to World War II. Such a focus
                    reduced the level of political discourse that had characterized commemorative activities in the
                    prewar era and suggested that commercialized entertainment threatened to end or replace serious
                    civic ceremony completely. In <list type="footnotes">

                    international fiesta. The grand marshal was a governmental official from <placeName>

                    </placeName> who was in charge of tourism and who was accompanied by riders on horseback in
                    "traditional" Spanish dress. Floats were the central ingredient in the parade and
                    treated the history of aviation, deep sea fishing, a "Good Guy cowboy preparing to lasso a
                    steer," and "Polynesian Surfing." Although most floats were sponsored and
                    produced by local companies and corporations, they in no way reflected local civic themes. Rather,
                    the professional classes sought to promote the city and their own images not through patriotism but
                    through pure forms of entertainment. In the same year, 1969, that several hundred thousand citizens
                    came to see "Polynesian Surfing," a small ceremony was held at the
                    Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument; and the flags in the city were flown at half-mast
                    at the request of President Richard M. Nixon as a "mark of respect" for Americans

                    "You've Come a Long Way Baby." Sponsored by the Indiana National Bank, it
                    featured an infant with an Uncle Sam hat and a birthday cake. Another float called
                    "Marching Along Together" featured a colonial soldier playing a flute and a bear
                    playing a guitar.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

                    </placeName>. Little emphasis was placed on honoring historical symbols such as soldiers and
                    patriots. Public commemorations of the past, in fact, not only were less evident but also seemed
                    more trivial and less tied to the interests and needs of both civic leaders and ordinary people.
                    City leaders continued to promote the need to instill loyalty and celebrate patriots, but these
                    traditional discussions took place on a much quieter level. Ordinary people also continued to
                    remember loved ones who had died, primarily through newspaper messages and visits to cemeteries, but
                    their interests, too, were less visible.</p>

            <p>Before World War II, when prominent leaders and ordinary citizens expressed their commemorative
                    interests more strongly, civic concerns played a preponderant role in commemorative activities.
                    Monuments to soldiers and leaders, who were both symbols of patriotism and lost loved ones,
                    reconciled the diverse interests of the prominent and the average citizen. Warner's belief
                    that commemorative activity primarily served the interests of the elite in a community was only
                    partially true in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> prior to the 1940s. The erection of the Soldiers' and Sailors'
                    Monument and the War Memorial certainly served the need of powerful citizens to stimulate citizen
                    loyalty to existing institutions and to promote the city. But such monuments also provided a means
                    for ordinary people to express sorrow and regret for other ordinary people who had died, not simply
                    because they valued patriotism but also because they bemoaned the loss of lives for any reason
                    whether it be political or otherwise.</p>
            <p>After 1945 ordinary people still indicated that they regretted such sacrifice and loss of life, but
                    the powerful presence of a culture of entertainment muted, in public at least, both the expression
                    of sorrow and of patriotism on the part of citizens and leaders alike. Both groups, in fact, heavily
                    supported this cultural expression of commemoration. For ordinary citizens it was part of the
                    pursuit of leisure and consumption that had come to dominate their lives. For leaders entertainment
                    offered a less politicized way to promote city growth and economic gain, something that was always
                    important in their approach to the planning of commemorative events.</p>
            <p>Did commemorative activity in twentieth-century <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> simply reflect the interests of the city's most powerful political and
                    economic leaders in a manner reminiscent of Warner's <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newburyport</settlement>
                    </placeName>? An examination of such activity suggests that it did not. Instead, commemorative
                    events in the city and probably elsewhere in the state honored a past that was meaningful to various
                    elements of the social structure. The intense focus on the war dead in the entire era prior to World
                    War II satisfied several important concerns. Ordinary citizens were given an opportunity to express
                    their grief, sorrow, and longing for dead relatives and friends; the past they honored was a local
                    and personal one that many had often experienced directly. At the same time influential city leaders
                    periodically altered the focus on a local and personal past by mobilizing patriotic
                    sentiment—the notion of serving and loving the nation—for political and
                    economic ends. Examples include the Americanization effort during World War I and the movement to
                    construct the massive war memorial in the 1920s.</p>
            <p>It is not clear why either honoring the war dead or promoting civic unity and progress through
                    patriotism was not as pronounced in commemorations after World War II. Both the effort to honor a
                    personal and local past by remembering the dead and the promotion <pb n="23" id="VAA4025-087-1-029"/> of patriotism did continue, although in somewhat episodic fashion, but entertainment and leisure
                    interests consumed much of the energy invested in commemorative periods. Civic leaders who certainly
                    saw entertainment as a more effective and possibly more profitable way to promote their traditional
                    objectives of citizen unity and city progress must assume some responsibility for citizens spending
                    more time in leisure activities and less in formal civic rituals. It was these leaders who invented
                    new traditions, such as the festival parade, around which commemorative days could be centered.
                    Citizens themselves, however, demonstrated an obvious interest in leisure and entertainment as well.
                    Traditional commemorations of the past were not entirely eliminated, but they were surely weakened
                    in a city populated by leaders and citizens who feverishly pursued new forms of relaxation,
                    amusement, and economic gain.</p>

            <byline>Edited by Virginia Mayberry and Dawn E. Bakken∗</byline>
            <p>Of the thousands of Civil War diaries and letters that are available to scholars, few are written by
                    children or adolescents. The diary of one young Hoosier, Alice Hawks, provides a glimpse into the
                    maturation of a nineteenth-century girl coming of age in a time of great strife. What is most
                    striking about Alice's diary, however, is that that strife scarcely casts a shadow on its
                    pages. Alice worries about school, clothes, housework, siblings, sleigh rides, and society meetings;
                    the war intrudes only occasionally into the pages of her diary like an unexpected and unwelcome
                    visitor. The story that emerges is of a life crowded with little events. Alice's diary
                    paints a vivid portrait of small-town life in northern Indiana in the 1860s and the life of a
                    middle-class girl.</p>

                    Dwight, took over the family businesses, which included a gristmill, sawmill, woolen mill,
                    cooperage, distillery, and general store. By January of 1862, when Alice's diary begins,
                    Joel, Alice's father, had moved his family approximately three miles north to <placeName>

            <p>Alice's mother, Sarah Jane Brown, was a pioneer who moved to Indiana in 1834 with her
                        family.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> She married Joel Prescott Hawks in 1844. By 1861 her time was taken
                    up with running a large household and caring for six children, of whom Alice was the oldest. Three
                    of the children in the house were still quite young: Minnie was six years old, Mabel (usually called
                    May in the diary) three years old, and Joel (called Jo) only a year old. During the period covered
                    by the diary, Sarah had her last child, Lora. The work of helping to run a large household often
                    dominates the journal. As the oldest girl, Alice was expected to wash and iron clothes, sew, clean
                    house, care for the children, and participate in any other activities that her mother could not
                    manage alone. As a middle-class family the Hawkses did have the benefit of a hired girl, a luxury
                    unavailable to many, but they also had the disadvantages of unpredictable domestic labor. The diary
                    is punctuated with the appearances and disappearances of various girls, in particular Mary Potter,
                    whose absences throw Alice's life into a flurry. It is fitting that the diary ends in June,
                    1863, with Joel Hawks trying to regain, yet again, the services of the unpredictable Mary.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other cornerstones of the story are school, church, and social life. Alice is an excellent
                    example of the emergence of the relatively carefree adolescent into the history of American
                        childhood.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Despite her home responsibilities Alice is free to attend
                    parties and church society meetings, take long walks and rides with friends and family, and
                    generally amuse herself on a level made possible by her family's financial comfort and by a
                    society that no longer defined children in terms of their economic contributions.</p>
            <p>Alice's outlook on life is exemplified by her school record. She clearly places value on her
                    studies, often writing of her worry that she has fallen behind in a particular subject or has not
                    prepared for the next day's class. That Alice entertained dreams of further education is
                    obvious when she cries at the birth of her youngest sister because the family will have no money to
                    send her away to school. When compared with modern society's demand for faithful <list type="footnotes">

                    different time and culture. Peppered throughout the diary are references to missing school in order
                    to visit <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Waterford</settlement>
                    </placeName> with cousins, leaving school to go down to the depot to greet her returning father or
                    bid farewell to a departing relative, leaving homework undone to go to a party, or deserting her
                    books to go sleigh riding. Such behavior was apparently quite normal since no parental disapproval
                    is ever mentioned. Indeed, it is sometimes Alice's mother who urges her to abandon study
                    for a party.</p>
            <p>A second focal point of Alice's life is the church. Alice and her family were faithful
                    members of the local Methodist church, and Alice attended and eventually taught Sunday School. The
                    most frequent religious event in the diary, however, is the society meeting, and here
                    Alice's life provides an interesting look at how much of "religion" was
                    also (or primarily) social entertainment. Alice attends society meetings of Methodists,

                    on the meetings from a purely social standpoint—who attended, what dress she wore, the
                    people she talked to, the unusual excitements that occurred (as when a chimney caught on
                    fire)— and often ends the account with a final judgment: whether or not she had a good
                    time.</p>

                    </placeName> and Indiana, that Alice's life is revealed. The Civil War appears as a faint
                    subtext, in which Alice flirts with a soldier, spends an afternoon filling cartridges, or goes down
                    to the railroad depot to cheer departing troops. There were probably many young people like Alice,
                    who lived far from any battlefront and whose lives were touched but not fundamentally changed by the
                    war. Alice's story may be more typical than is usually recognized, and that very typicality
                    sheds an interesting light on life on the home front during the Civil War.</p>

                              <hi rend="sup">1</hi> Alice Hawks frequently recorded her diary entries late
                                        at night when she was quite tired; at other times she wrote hurriedly or
                                        excitedly. Her errors often reflect the circumstances at the time she wrote, not
                                        her education or knowledge; many are common to such informal writing. In order
                                        to retain this "flavor" of the times and the
                                        diarist's charm the journal has been transcribed as nearly like the
                                        original as possible in regard to grammar and spelling. The editors have used
                                        their discretion in dealing with punctuation, which is sometimes obscured by
                                        faintness in the original script and by Alice's penmanship. In many
                                        instances double spaces have been inserted to break up long run-on sentences
                                        that have no punctuation at all. Unintentional repetitions have been deleted.
                                        Some letters, in particular "n" and "m,"
                                        were occasionally miswritten. In such cases, corrections have been made without
                                        an indication in the text. Any other additions or corrections appear in
                                        brackets. The dates preceding each journal entry have been underlined.</item>

                                        attended a subscription school run by Mrs. E. W. Metcalfe. Since public schools
                                        were still scarce in the state, most schools were organized and financed
                                        privately. Alice's experiences may be unusual, for the Metcalfe school
                                        seems to have met for several months per term. For the state as a whole the
                                        average school term was only sixty-eight days by 1866. James H. Madison, <hi rend="i">The Indiana Way: A State History</hi> (<placeName>

                                        and acquaintances named Frank, Albert, Emma, Ella, Anna, even Calista; thus, it

                                        switching area for trains passing through the station and a place to take on or

                                            at one time her uncle by marriage to Minerva Jennette Brown. According to

                                    went to the school house. I went up to the society but did not have a very good time
                                    The best part of it was the ride home. It was twelve oclock when I got home and

                                        societies and charitable societies, which performed the churches'
                                        outreach programs but obviously also served as important social outlets in small
                                        towns. These societies are usually praised by historians for their official
                                        functions, but Alice's diary provides a strikingly different viewpoint.
                                        Alice records society functions as a modern teenager might record a party. No
                                        doubt it was the officially religious nature of the meetings that enabled Alice
                                        to spend so much of her time thus engaged, but her interests are much more those
                                        of a fun-loving girl than of a sober religious devotee. For some discussions of

                                            typical for her evangelical Protestant background, which shunned the
                                            elaborate liturgy and ritual of Roman Catholicism. What is most interesting
                                            in the incident is her presence in a Catholic church at a time when
                                            anti-Catholicism was still prevalent in Protestant culture throughout

                                 <hi rend="sup">29</hi> Daguerreotypes, dating from the late 1830s, were
                                            the first popular form of photography; but the process had many
                                            difficulties, including long exposure time (necessitating long still poses),
                                            fragility, and expense. Tintypes, employing a faster and cheaper type of
                                            processing, largely replaced daguerreotypes in the 1850s. The images
                                            produced were sturdier and much cheaper, and portrait photography became
                                            widely popular. Alice may refer to an image made by either of these
                                            processes. Unfortunately, no early portraits of Alice are available, perhaps
                                            because they suffered the fate of this likeness. For a history of the two

                                    were ashamed to come in so they came around to our windo and got in but Mrs Metcalfe
                                    caught them and they had to climb out again and go around and climb in at the front
                                    window.</p>
                        <p>I have been to the society this evening at Mrs Baker and had a very nice time the
                                    house was just as full as it could be. <hi rend="u">May 24th</hi> Ella and I were
                                    going calling this afternoon and I got all ready but puting on my dress when she
                                    came up and said she couldent go so we thought that long twordes evening we would go
                                    over to the shop and see them work, when we got there Frank took us all around and
                                    taught me how to make sash.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>

                                    Jim and Mary Latta was there and when they came down they stoped and asked her to
                                    ride down with them and she came never suspecting a thing. Ella Buss and I went to
                                    Mr Defreeses alone but there I got a beau but Ella was not so fortunate Frank took
                                    me down there and brought me home. It was after twelve Oclock when I got home father

                        <p>Grandma is sick and I have been siting withe her nearly all day. This evening Clit
                                    sent down for me to go to the society with her so I got ready and went up there and
                                    when we started we just got out of the gate when we met Mr Shell going up there so
                                    we turned around and went back. Mr Shell came home with me.</p>

                        <p>I have laid down some new rules for my self and I hope I shall be able to keep them</p>
                        <p>I am not going out more than twice a week. I shall go to the ade society once a week
                                    and to our society the next and that will leave me one night each week to go any

                        <p>I have been to the ade society tonight. I went with Ella and we went after Bell while

            <p>"Indiana is changing," begins editor David Hoppe in the introduction to this
                    thoughtful collection of essays, a statement as flat and simple and yet as deceptively complex as
                    the physical and psychological subject matter it represents. In a world where revolutions happen on
                    a weekly basis and attention spans are measured in seconds, the rate of change in Indiana, a state
                    distinguished within its region for stubborn resistance to trends and fads, might appear
                    comparatively insignificant. It might even be invisible, at least to those who do not look closely.</p>
            <p>A number of Indiana writers and scholars are looking closely, however, beyond myths and stereotypes,
                    in an effort to perceive how the homogenizing forces of mass culture have affected the place they
                    call home. Twelve of them are represented in this volume, and their insights deserve attention from
                    all those concerned with Indiana's future.</p>

                    opening essay, "Landscape and Imagination." Returning to Indiana from a
                    year's absence, he experiences a "freshening of awareness" (p. 1) that
                    allows him access to the meaning that lies beyond the surface of appearances, a meaning available to
                    him because the landscape is infused with his past. His sharpened senses lead him to ruminate that
                    this kind of intimate knowledge of a particular place is becoming increasingly rare in a culture
                    that continually bombards its members with "uprooted images." "It is
                    never a simple matter," he says, "actually to see what is before your
                    eyes" (p. 3). Indiana's "unspectacular landscape" presents
                    special obstacles to perception and knowledge, requiring "an uncommon degree of
                    attentiveness and insight" (p. 7), attributes that Indiana's pioneering settlers
                    did not possess in abundance. Their utilitarian attitude toward the land blinded them to the
                    "sacred connection between a people and a landscape" (p. 7) that Native Americans
                    exemplified, and the pioneer legacy manifests itself today in efforts to push the landscape
                    "toward the industrial ideal of profitable uniformity" (p. 5). Responsible living,
                    concludes Sanders, requires that Hoosiers renew their vision of the <pb n="80" id="VAA4025-087-1-086"/> land and reestablish their spiritual connection to place in order to
                    prevent further neglect and destruction.</p>
            <p>The eleven essays that follow, by Michael Wilkerson, George Schricker, Jr., Mari Evans, Teresa
                    Ghilarducci, Michael Martone, Kay Franklin, William O'Rourke, Michael Schelle, Hal Higdon,
                    James Alexander Thorn, and James H. Madison, develop variations on these themes: the problems of
                    perception, the need to reexamine inherited traditions, the role of the creative individual, the
                    subtle and mysterious ties that exist between people and place, and the danger inherent in severing
                    those ties. While all of the essays are memorable and deserve comment, Schricker's urgent
                    call for atonement for the treatment of Native Americans, Evans's description of the
                    destructive ethos that exists for blacks amidst the apparent prosperity and progress of modern <placeName>

            <p>Although, as historian <placeName>

                    </placeName> asserts in the concluding essay, Indiana has managed to avoid abrupt departures and
                    violent upheaval by its reliance on time-honored traditions, too much reliance on unexamined
                    tradition presents its own dangers. One is reminded of the frog mentioned in Schricker's
                    essay, who, put in a pot over a low fire, does not detect the gradual rise in water temperature
                    until it is cooked. This small volume represents an important step on the part of Indiana's
                    intellectual community in the direction of avoiding such slow disasters.</p>

            <p>Can socialism in any of its various forms fulfill its promise of equality? Carol A. Kolmerten argues
                    that the answer will be negative in regard to equality between the sexes until society frees itself
                    from "the ideology of gender," basically the assumption that there are naturally
                    distinct gender roles linked to different levels of power and opportunity unfavorable to women.</p>
            <p>This argument is the animus in Kolmerten's study of one of the earliest forms of modern
                    socialism, Owenism and its varied communal experiments in the <placeName>

                    leanings were patriarchal. As a result, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> and elsewhere, Owen's vague promises of equality gave way to a social reality
                    where women not only were relegated to traditional "woman's work" but
                    wound up doing double duty by serving as wives for their families as well as workers for the
                    community. When they protested, they were treated like women; <hi rend="i">i.e.,</hi> Owen refused
                    to take them seriously, and they soon grew rebellious, becoming an important cause of the speedy
                    dissolution of the Owenite communities. As a counterpoint, Kolmerten assigns one of her five
                    chapters to Frances Wright, a passionate advocate of sexual equality who, after her unsuccessful
                    experiment in an inter-racial community at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashoba</settlement>
                    </placeName>, temporarily persuaded Owen's son, Robert Dale Owen, to join her in a crusade
                    for equality in the late 1820s, only to marry and eventually to fall victim to a male-dominated
                    world.</p>
            <p>This book has several flaws. Among lesser ones is a puzzling neglect of the women in Owen's
                    family; there is not a single reference to either his wife or his daughters, while two of his sons
                    get at least brief mention. Much more significantly, Kolmerten's preoccupation with gender
                    seriously narrows her vision. Undoubtedly Owen was guilty of patriarchism (a trait that offended
                    some men as well as women), but his biases need to be seen in the broader field of his enthusiasms.
                    Although he often identified with equality, the foundation of his New Moral World was the material
                    abundance that he believed humanity could produce under the right circumstances, an abundance so
                    great as to meet all human needs without necessarily destroying class and gender distinctions.
                    Kolmerton gives much too little attention to this and related matters, producing a narrow, static
                    fragment of Owen's system.</p>
            <p>With this important exception, however, Kolmerton is a conscientious scholar whose careful research
                    adds to an understanding both of the Owenite communities and of male-female relations in the early
                    nineteenth century. Also she has some interesting things to say not only about Owen but also about
                    various other figures related to his cause, people like William Thompson and Anna Wheeler, early
                    advocates of equality. If <hi rend="i">Women in Utopia</hi> is far from definitive, it does at least
                    help to sustain interest in humankind's efforts to transform social dreams into realities,
                    a necessary interest in the present all-too-unidealistic age.</p>

            <p>A leader of the abolitionist Liberty party, Salmon P. Chase, once described it as a "forlorn
                    hope of freedom," a movement of lofty goals but of disappointing impact. Vernon L. Volpe
                    borrows this phrase as the title of his informative study of that third party's history.
                    The author's point of departure is the work of Gilbert Barnes and Dwight Dumond, which
                    emphasizes the religious base of the crusade against slavery; but he has deepened the inquiry with
                    extensive use of firsthand sources—manuscripts, newspapers, and other materials. Volpe
                    has also related his own themes to those in the secondary literature of the post-Barnes years. A new
                    aspect is his analysis of electoral data, Liberty party voting in counties of Indiana, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, and especially <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> where abolitionist churches were most active.</p>
            <p>From this investigation Volpe concludes that Barnes was right in emphasizing the religious dimension
                    of antislavery and is able to support that view with a convincing range of additional evidence.
                    Liberty, says Volpe, was not just another political party, for it focused on slavery as a sin to be
                    eradicated from corrupted antebellum institutions. The argument centers on Chase, the rising
                    antislavery Democrat of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Although Chase assumed an important role in the national structure of the new party
                    and although he later helped amalgamate Liberty with the Free Soil party, he did not represent the
                    ideological core of Liberty. He would not disassociate himself from the Episcopal church, a
                    pro-slavery haven; nor did he worry about compromising principles by accepting Martin Van Buren, the
                    Democratic pragmatist, as presidential candidate in 1848. Reluctantly, the ranks of Liberty had to
                    follow. As a result, their religious perspective gave way to the politicians' strategy of
                    nonextension of the peculiar institution in the next decade. Many of them felt that they had failed,
                    rather than helped, to build a more effective party.</p>
            <p>The research for this volume is exhaustive, and the interpretation concerning the party's
                    religious foundation is sound. A regrettable feature is the rigorously condensed text, which leaves
                    an impression of factual overload. But that could reflect the commercial imperative of publishing.</p>

                    supplementing it with a series of short, heavily illustrated volumes focused on particular topics.
                    This book, the first in the series, is perhaps atypical. It does not address a particular topic;
                    rather it is an overview of <placeName>

                    with an almost unrelieved flow of names, dates, organizations, numbers, and percentages hooked
                    together in chronological sequence. This is not narrative history. The anecdotal, illustrative, and
                    interpretative material that would make it so is sparse indeed in this taut little volume. The book
                    is an up-to-date and generally accurate synopsis. The editors claim too much in describing it as
                    "a new synthesis and … interpretation" that will allow the reader to
                    "understand the political, economic, and cultural growth of the city" (p. ix).</p>
            <p>This book will best serve those seeking specific data or those wanting to know how persons and events
                    fit in chronological sequence. One's larger curiosity can then be served by referring to
                    the <hi rend="i">Encyclopedia</hi> for additional commentary. In that sense, this book serves as a

                    of profound change and significance for the Forest City.</p>
            <p>The final chapters, describing events of the last three decades, emphasize economic concerns. The
                    authors treat this troubled period with admirable candor and objectivity. From 1969 to 1979, they
                    write, <placeName>

                    political, demographic, racial, educational, and environmental problems that seemed about to
                    overwhelm it. As this review is written, preliminary census figures place <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s population at about 500,000. This represents a population loss of 414,000
                    persons since 1950. That loss is both cause and effect of the conditions mentioned above. A final
                    chapter entitled "Comeback City?" expresses both caution and hope, a prudent
                    posture to take given <placeName>

                    's first century. Vitz ends his narrative with a question similar to that posed by Martin

                        </placeName>
               </hi> (1966): how did a city once seemingly so rich in cultural promise ultimately
                    produce so little of enduring value? Vitz never answers that question fully but does provide some
                    interesting glimpses into the problem.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> was shaped by the same forces that operated more broadly throughout what was then the
                    "West." Local boosters brayed bravely, and philanthropists occasionally anted up
                    generously, but geographical isolation—in the nineteenth century, especially, from
                    Europe—intellectual myopia, and rampant commercialism made it difficult for artists,
                    writers, performers, and impresarios to create and sustain a viable community as well as individual
                    recognition and reward. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>

                    </placeName> and never attained a sufficient critical mass of tolerance, enthusiasm, and economic
                    support to encourage more than a complacent enjoyment of the traditional, usually with a Germanic
                    flavor.</p>
            <p>Vitz does a good job in chronicling the expressive life that did, if often only temporarily, find a
                    home in the Queen City. He describes the fortunes of the Beecher family, Rookwood Pottery, the
                    painters Frank Duveneck and Henry Farny, and the eccentric journalist Lafcadio Hearn. Vitz is at his
                    best in narrating a good story of conflict and does so in his accounts of the stormy career of

            <p>By the end of World War II over 200,000 young women had enlisted in various <hi rend="i">separately</hi> created military organizations. The placing of nearly a quarter million women in
                    military uniform in a direct chain of military command, albeit in separate units, was no small event
                    in American military and social history. Absent that event, Americans would not now be engaged in a
                    great debate about women in combat. The military has long since abandoned a separate female command
                    structure.</p>
            <p>In June, 1944, Anne Bosanko, a twenty-year-old college sophomore from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>, enlisted in one of the military units that had come to be called the Women's
                    Army Corps (WAC). The bulk of <hi rend="i">One Woman's War</hi> covers slightly more than
                    two years of private personal writings from Anne to the members of her family.</p>
            <p>One has the right to interpret past personal experiences in terms of present predispositions. If one
                    simply reads these fascinating letters without reference to later editorializing by the writer, and
                    without the insightful comments of the foreword, it is somewhat difficult to find any truly
                    deep-seated ideology, aside from an abiding love for family and a strong, straightforward,
                    uncomplicated patriotism. What stands out is a youthful cultural and intellectual curiosity that is
                    all over the field. Bosanko is perfectly willing to read the left-leaning <hi rend="i">P.M.,</hi> as
                    well as the <placeName>

                    the music of Harry James, Glenn Miller, and Artie Shaw; goes to concerts of Jose Iturbi and Arturo
                    Toscanini; and admires Douglas MacArthur. She reads "deeply" into a contemporary
                    novel on the life of the Apostle Paul by Sholem Asch and goes to hear a then very young Charles
                    Laughton reading Walt Whitman. She refers to Jacques Barzun. Also on her literary plate are the
                    mystery writings of British novelist Dorothy Sayer and her Lord Peter Wimsey. In almost the same
                    sentences that Bosanko manifests attitudes that warm the heart of any advocate of the liberal arts
                    and humanities, she speaks of KP duty, hankies, boyfriends, and booze. On her twenty-first birthday
                    she writes home for a copy of her birth certificate so that she can buy booze in a bar.</p>
            <p>Certainly, it is not condescending to suspect that this letter writer was in the highest percentile
                    of intelligence and cultural interests of those women who entered the military service during World
                    War II. It is precisely because of this intelligence and the array of cultural interests that these
                    letters are relevant to an understanding of what was generally being experienced at that time.
                    Jacques LeGoff, contemporary French historian of consciousness, has coined the term
                    "history of mentality." Although this book of letters does not totally fit that
                    concept, and it is doubtful that the author intended to do so, a good deal of it is in that
                    category. Bosanko's consciousness in role playing as a letter writer, as a cheerful/dutiful
                    daughter together with her parents' reciprocal dearness-to-their-child and the
                    proto-domestic contentment, is utterly remarkable, as is the intellectual caliber of the written
                    thought and the popular culture that is reflected.</p>

            <p>Written for a general audience, this volume contains a potpourri of information on the history and
                    culture of Native Americans. Featuring over one hundred maps (original and reproductions), the
                    cartography is buttressed by a text, numerous photographs, line drawings, copies of paintings, and
                    appendixes. The volume covers a broad, if uneven, spectrum of Native American history, including
                    several maps and a limited textual discussion of the classic "civilizations" of <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName> and Central America. The final chapters also devote five maps and several pages to

            <pb n="89" id="VAA4025-087-1-095"/>
            <p>The maps and appendixes are by far the most important contributions of this volume. The maps
                    illustrate a wide variety of subjects, both ethnographic and historical, and cover subjects as
                    diverse as the Creek War of 1813-1814, modern urban Indian centers, dominant types of housing or
                    shelter, and the use of jimson-weed and other psychotropics. Some of the maps, such as the
                    "Vegetation of North America" (p. 25) or "Patterns of Early European
                    Settlement" (p. 167) are presented in such a diminished scale that their lack of clarity
                    limits their effectiveness. Others such as "King Phillip's War, 1675-76"
                    (p. 92) or "The Flight of the Nez Perce" (p. 134) contain sufficient detail to
                    make them useful. Also valuable are the extensive appendixes, which contain lists of federal and
                    state Indian reservations, trust areas, and native villages, or Indian tribes in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The text is less useful. Although the author discusses the history and cultures of North American
                    peoples in general terms, his coverage of these subjects is, at best, uneven. Much of the discussion
                    of Indian-white interaction focuses on warfare, and although relations between Indians and European
                    Americans often were disrupted by conflict, they were also marked by considerable cooperation and
                    acculturation. Moreover, the text occasionally contains minor factual errors that sometimes cast
                    doubt on the author's familiarity with his sources. For example, as recent scholarship has
                    illustrated, Tecumseh was not a brigadier general in the British army, did not visit the South
                    during the fall of 1812, and was not taught academic subjects by Rebecca Galloway.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, this volume provides its readers with some useful maps, lists, and appendixes. It will
                    be of limited value to those historians and anthropologists whose particular research interests
                    focus on Native American subjects; it should prove more useful, however, for the general public and
                    for other scholars who need a quick cartographic reference for American Indian history.</p>

            <p>The best modern standard treatments of the War of 1812 include studies by Irving Brant, Harry L.
                    Coles, Reginald Horsman, James R. Jacobs, John K. Mahon, Pierre Berton, J. C. A. Stagg, and Glenn
                    Tucker. Except for the most recent ones by Berton (1980, 1981) and Stagg (1983), however, they are
                    somewhat dated. Further, they all tend to focus on particular aspects of the war, such as the
                    military or the political.</p>
            <pb n="90" id="VAA4025-087-1-096"/>
            <p>The purpose of the present effort is more ambitious: to encompass politics, diplomacy, economics,
                    finance, and the military; to present a "general overview" of the war; to reassess
                    the sources and to look at some new material. In addition, Donald R. Hickey says his study is
                    designed both as a textbook and as a monograph.</p>
            <p>Such a goal is too much to expect from something less than three hundred pages of text. Hickey,
                    nevertheless, does synthesize much of the work of other historians and utilizes considerable
                    documentary material. In this connection, his meticulous documentation, which itself is over
                    one-third the length of the text, is one of the most valuable parts of the book. As this volume is
                    basically a general history of the War of 1812, one that will introduce many to "our most
                    obscure war," albeit "an important turning point, a great watershed" (pp.
                    1, 3), readers would have welcomed the addition of his working bibliography so that they could
                    pursue the subject in greater depth.</p>
            <p>Hickey is interested in the perspective and role of the Jeffersonian Republicans in the War of 1812
                    in all its ramifications. He argues that their particular aim in going to war was to win concessions
                    on maritime issues in order to vindicate American sovereignty both at home and abroad. The
                    British-Canadian-Indian factor was basically a sectional issue. The war could also preserve
                    Republican power, unify the party, and silence their Federalist critics. Republican expectations
                    were dampened by the decidedly mixed results of the military campaigns and the domestic turmoil of
                    the war years. The war's "most significant victory" was at the peace
                    table where the enemy was consistently outmaneuvered, not because of what the American diplomats won
                    but "because of what they avoided losing" (p. 281).</p>

                    conflict with <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName>, "considers himself in some degree its historian." Regarded as
                    America's first foreign war, fought in a distant and exotic land, and seemingly imbued <pb n="91" id="VAA4025-087-1-097"/> with a laudable patriotic purpose, the Mexican War inspired a
                    torrent of writing among the soldiers who fought it, as they shared their experiences with their
                    friends and families back home. Writing materials were treasured items, and it was not unusual for
                    soldiers to outfit themselves with portable desks containing paper, pencils, pen and ink, and blank
                    notebooks. Hometown newspapers printed their reports, publishers competed for their diaries and
                    journals, and post offices nearest the fighting were choked with their letters.</p>
            <p>Napoleon Dana, twenty-four years old when the war began and newly married, was just such a soldier. A
                    graduate of West Point and a second lieutenant in the Seventh Infantry Regiment, he was assigned to
                    Zachary Taylor's Army of Occupation. Dana began writing to his wife from the encampment on
                    the <geogName>Nueces River</geogName> in August, 1845, and continued to write almost daily until the
                    spring of 1847. The last letter in this selection was written from a hospital in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jalapa</settlement>
                    </placeName> where Dana recovered from a wound suffered in the battle of Cerro Gordo. In the
                    intervening months his regiment had been among the first units to experience combat during the
                    bombardment of Fort Brown on the Rio Grande, had occupied Matamoros, endured the long, tiring, and
                    dusty march into northern <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName>, fought valiantly in the desperate battle for the city of Monterey (as it was then
                    spelled), marched to Tampico to join Winfield Scott's expeditionary force, and participated
                    in the siege of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vera Cruz</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Dana's letters reveal a tender concern for his wife, while exhibiting a remarkable talent
                    for observation, colorful description, and dramatic narrative. Like many soldiers he was impressed
                    by the natural beauty and grandeur of the landscape through which he marched (a sunrise over the
                        <geogName>Sierra Madre mountains</geogName> inspired one of his most lyrical descriptions). At
                    the same time he shared the complaints about the intolerable heat, the swarms of insects that
                    "fly into our noses and mouths" and "get into our eatables" (p.
                    16), and the people he encountered in the villages that lay in the army's path. <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName>, he concluded, was a "mean, miserable, dirty, good-for-nothing place"
                    (p. 108). The conflict, moreover, seemed a "strange kind of war" (p. 114) to Dana;
                    the army paid for everything the people were willing to provide and protected the civilians from the
                    "annoyances of our men" and even from Indian attack. "We ought to put the
                    rigors of war upon them," he suggested, "and spoil as we go" (p. 115).
                    Like most regular army soldiers Dana expressed contempt for the volunteers and disgust for the
                    praise and publicity that the volunteers invariably received.</p>
            <p>Robert H. Ferrell has kept his documentation to a minimum, too much so perhaps. While he has
                    faithfully identified all the fellow soldiers mentioned by Dana, he has left to the
                    reader's imagination episodes and circumstances that might better have been <pb n="92" id="VAA4025-087-1-098"/> explained. Nonetheless, FerrelPs edition of Dana's letters
                    takes its place among the best of the growing body of Mexican War soldiers' accounts.</p>

            <p>This is a very important book about an institution widely known but insufficiently appreciated in
                    American scholarship. It was not Anne M. Boylan's purpose to write a narrative history of
                    the Sunday school movement in America. Instead, she offers in relatively brief scope a highly
                    analytical work on the Sunday school as a religious institution in American society. This is an
                    account gratifyingly full of concrete detail. It draws very sensitively, for example, from the
                    diaries of individual teachers, revealing their perceptions of the ills of society, their fairly
                    predictable concerns for spiritual self-improvement, and their struggle with the restrictions upon
                    their autonomy imposed by the evangelical ideal of womanhood. Boylan argues that the attraction of
                    this work for young women "was part of the larger process whereby Protestantism became
                    ‘feminized’ in the nineteenth century" (p. 132).</p>
            <p>Boylan's analysis follows the first century of the Sunday school movement from its initial
                    efforts to provide instruction in reading for children of the very poor to its emergence in an
                    evangelical age as a means not only of education but of recruitment for the churches. One of the
                    very obvious strengths of this study is the way in which it places the analysis of the Sunday school
                    within the context of the many voluntary societies for Bible and tract distribution, for missions,
                    and for many aspects of American societal reform from asylums to slavery. It might be
                    appropriate—borrowing a term from the study of Utopian communities in this
                    period—to stress the fact that the Sunday school movement was not just voluntary but
                    intentional. People joined it for a purpose. In newly settled societies such as the states of the
                    Old Northwest, missionaries like John Mason Peck believed the Sabbath school might help to instigate
                    a revival of religion (p. 36).</p>
            <p>Based as it is on the study of a great many publications of Sunday schools and churches, of
                    benevolent and reform societies, and of private correspondence, minute books, and statistics, this
                    is a very well documented study, which is also carefully crafted and clear. A particularly important
                    contribution is the way in which Boylan relates the institution of the Sunday school to the history

                    manuals, periodicals, and handbooks and tried to assess the role of new eductional ideas from
                    Europe. The early emphasis on religious conversion seemed to weaken toward midcentury as discussion
                    focused on techniques, professionalism, and nurture. A very interesting chapter at the end focuses
                    on the way in which teaching shifted to the more gradual changes contemplated in Horace
                    Bushnell's ideal of Christian nurture. Childhood in the new romantic understanding
                    challenged orthodox beliefs that, as one clergyman put it, children "are condemned
                    criminals, and they need pardoning mercy" (p. 147). The book closes with a brief return to
                    the comparison of American with British practice. Unlike the British, Americans have made the Sunday
                    school an effective tool in the fulfillment of their intention to Christianize America.</p>

            <p>Elizur Wright, sometime abolitionist, actuary, and atheist, seemed destined for the ministry. Born in
                    1804 to fervently religious parents, educated at that seedbed of evangelicalism, Yale College, and
                    then employed by Oberlin College, where religious commitment reigned, Wright must have felt all but
                    irresistible pressure to consecrate his life to the pulpit. But resist he did. As an Oberlin faculty
                    member in the 1830s, he became embroiled in a tooth-and-nail controversy between immediate
                    abolitionists and proponents of black colonization. His ready pen in the immediatist cause propelled
                    him from his frontier academic post to headquarters of the newly organized American Anti-Slavery
                    Society in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>
                    </placeName>. As the society's secretary, he played a key role in the most aggressive and
                    fateful reform effort of the age. During that campaign his unbelief was honed. Concluding that the
                    conservatism of churches and clerics formed an obstacle to emancipation second only to that of
                    slaveholders themselves, Wright adopted an anticlerical, antireligious stance that led him finally
                    into the advanced freethought position that the author with probable exaggeration calls atheism. It
                    also led him into temporary poverty and joblessness as the antislavery coalition splintered and he
                    himself lost favor with the controlling groups.</p>
            <p>Most of the prominent abolitionists of the 1830s maintained at least minimal ties with the movement
                    as it evolved in later decades. Wright seems not to have done so. After several discouraging <pb n="95" id="VAA4025-087-1-101"/> efforts at publishing reformist newspapers, his career took an
                    unexpected turn. In the 1850s circumstances allowed him to help institute reforms in the infant life
                    insurance industry, whose mysteries were creating fortunes for a few manipulators and losses for
                    myriad small policyholders. Wright put his remarkable mathematical ability to the task of developing
                    actuary tables that removed some of the mystery and much of the chicanery from life insurance. This
                    was a permanent achievement from which millions of Americans have benefited.</p>
            <p>Lawrence B. Goodheart has performed the enviable feat of making the abstruse realm of insurance
                    statistics—of which Wright was master—comprehensible to the layman. For this
                    alone he deserves congratulation. In all, Goodheart has written a well-researched, engaging study of
                    a nineteenth-century figure whose varied accomplishments deserve to be better known.</p>

            <p>Historian Marcus Lee Hansen mostly is remembered for his oft-quoted dictum about generational
                    relations: "what the son wishes to forget the grandson wishes to remember" (p.
                    195). Hansen's "principle of third generation interest" (p. 194)
                    influenced writing on immigration and ethnic history following its exposure in <hi rend="i">Commentary</hi> in 1952, which was fifteen years after Hansen dealt with "The Problem
                    of the Third Generation" before the Augustana Historical Society in <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. In 1987 editors Peter Kivisto and Dag Blanck, Augustana College faculty, invited
                    leading historians and social scientists to the school to assess the significance over the last
                    half-century of Hansen's thesis; they now have edited the proceedings.</p>
            <p>John Higham, Thomas J. Archdeacon, and Moses Rischin begin with essays that place Hansen's
                    work, including <hi rend="i">The Atlantic Migration</hi> (1940) and <hi rend="i">The Immigrant in
                        American History</hi> (1940), in historical context and propose the terms for its enduring
                    value. Particularly interesting is Higham's contrast of Hansen's narrative writing
                    with that of social historian John Bodnar of Indiana University. Five essays are directed toward
                    application of Hansen's thesis to specific ethnicities. Philip Gleason argues that Will
                    Herberg's <hi rend="i">Protestant, Catholic, Jew</hi> (1960) made the first critical use of
                    Hansen's thesis in applying it to American religion and finds the <pb n="96" id="VAA4025-087-1-102"/> fit more favorable to Jews than to Catholics or Protestants. Nathan
                    Glazer links generational interaction with specific historical change and shows how generational
                    standing and contemporary events combine to shape the Jewish quest. Arnold Barton notes, with
                    reservations, ways in which Hansen's thesis aids in comprehending Swedish-American history.
                    Standford M. Lyman questions Hansen's treatment of, and the relevance of the generational
                    thesis to, the black experience. Victor Greene amends Hansen's thesis by arguing that the
                    1920-1950 generation's devotion to native dance and music indicates an affinity with the
                    parent generation. In a final chapter Fred Matthews surveys the shifts in the study of immigrant
                    history.</p>
            <p>Although Hansen's thesis has been used to help explain up-drifts of interest in ethnicity,
                    speculations on the connections of his insight to the dramatic rise in immigrant numbers in the
                    1980s are not apparent in this volume. What does come through is that Hansen gave voice to a
                    demonstrable cultural phenomenon that should be considered in intergenerational research, but one
                    relative to time, place, and group. Moreover, his elevation of the principle as "applicable
                    in all fields of historical study" (p. 194) does not hold up. Readers may find that the
                    critique of Hansen's thesis, finally, is secondary to the welcome positing of current
                    direction in thinking about ethnicity and its historiography.</p>
            <p>The book's appendix provides the text of Hansen's Augustana address, along with his
                    long-forgotten essay "Who Shall Inherit America?" delivered in <placeName>

                    (actually he spoke to the concurrent Conference on Immigration Policy). This was Hansen's
                    last address before his premature death in 1938.</p>

            <p>Spirit Fruit Society, a small Utopian community that was founded in 1901 and that continued until
                    1930, has been the subject of significant scholarship over the past few years. No scholar, however,
                    has engaged in more painstaking research nor unearthed more details about the community than James
                    L. Murphy. For more than twenty-five years Murphy seemingly searched every nook and
                    cranny—as his acknowledgments and endnotes reveal— to furnish a more complete
                    picture of Spirit Fruit.</p>
            <pb n="97" id="VAA4025-087-1-103"/>
            <p>Murphy provides a detailed look at Spirit Fruit from its beginnings in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lisbon</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>. He makes it clear that the person, principles, and philosophy of Jacob L. Beilhart
                    were the driving forces behind the community. The charismatic presence of Beilhart dominated every
                    aspect of community life. Fortunately for his followers, he was a man of principle:
                    "dishonesty and hypocrisy were entirely foreign to his nature" (p. 4). His
                    influence continued even after his death in 1908. Indeed, Beilhart's daily messages to one
                    of his followers, "Ma" Young, were largely responsible for the continuation of the
                    community for an additional twenty-two years.</p>
            <p>Beilhart's philosophy was individualistic and egalitarian. As his creed was put into
                    practice at Spirit Fruit, it produced radical results and challenged prevailing beliefs and
                    institutions. For example, Beilhart advocated women's rights, and Murphy argues
                    convincingly that Spirit Fruit, in contrast to many nineteenth-century communes, lived up to its
                    egalitarian ideals regarding the role of women. On the whole, however, the members of Spirit Fruit
                    were "reluctant radicals," hesitant to broadcast widely their revolutionary views
                    and anxious whenever possible to avoid confrontation with the outside society.</p>
            <p>Although this book contains little analysis, it does furnish a wealth of new information about Spirit
                    Fruit. It includes, for instance, fresh and tantalizing facts about Beilhart's troubled
                    marriage to Louema, who in 1900 took her two children, Harry Harvey and Edith, and left. The
                    evidence suggests that Beilhart never saw them again. The question has always been—why?
                    Why would such a benevolent and principled man not maintain contact with his children? Murphy argues
                    that they were not Beilhart's children. Rather they were the offspring of C. W. Post, the
                    man who built a fortune on Postum and Grape Nuts. The Beilhart-Post relationship is only one of many
                    that Murphy charts in this book. In sum, <hi rend="i">Reluctant Radicals</hi> is rich in detail and
                    is a significant addition to Utopian literature. The story now awaits further analysis.</p>

                    adoption of the Food and Drugs Act of 1906. Along with drawing upon the formidable <pb n="98" id="VAA4025-087-1-104"/> body of published scholarship on the topic, he has done extensive
                    research in such primary sources as the <hi rend="i">Congressional Record;</hi> government documents
                    and reports; National Archives files; and food and drug industry, medical, and pharmaceutical
                    publications.</p>
            <p>Whereas most previous studies of the pure food campaign focus on the years immediately preceding the
                    enactment of the 1906 law, Young begins his story with the adoption of the Drug Importation Act of
                    1848 barring entry of adulterated drugs. He goes on to track in detail the vicissitudes of the drive
                    for a broad national law against adulterated food, drink, and drugs from the first introduction of
                    such a measure in Congress in 1879. In his final chapter Young reviews historians'
                    differing interpretations regarding the forces and motivations responsible for adoption of the 1906
                    law. He himself eschews any monocausal analysis in favor of a "pluralistic
                    explanation" (p. 291). He admits that "most of the larger elements of food
                    processing and drug manufacturing" had come to favor, or at least acquiesce in, federal
                    regulation to curb unscrupulous competitors, avoid the confusion and costs of a multiplicity of
                    state laws, and reassure domestic and foreign customers. He flatly concludes, however, that
                    "no food and drug law would have passed the Congress in 1906 because of business desire
                    alone" (p. 292).</p>
            <p>Young argues that "seven C's underlay the enactment of this pioneering
                    statute": "change" (the scientific and technological revolution of the
                    late nineteenth century); "complexity" <hi rend="i">(e.g.,</hi> the breakdown of
                    local community ethical standards with the emergence of a national market);
                    "competition" among rival interests; "crusading" to arouse the
                    public; "coalescence," or coalition-building; "compromise" to
                    neutralize or reduce opposition; and "catastrophe"—the uproar and
                    anxieties spurred by Upton Sinclair's <hi rend="i">The Jungle</hi>—to supply the
                    final decisive push (pp. 4-6). Young downgrades Theodore Roosevelt as a "latecomer to the
                    food and drug crusade" who played no more than a "minor" role in the
                    bill's passage, although he acknowledges that TR's contribution to the
                    simultaneously adopted Meat Inspection Amendment was "more central" (p. 294).
                    Along with nearly all writers on the subject, he pictures Harvey Wiley as the single most important
                    influence in the battle for pure food, and he extols Wiley as "a sincere crusader,
                    committed absolutely to securing as strong a law as … the complex political situation
                    would permit" (p. 295).</p>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    <pb n="99" id="VAA4025-087-1-105"/> is much broader than biographies of great church leaders and
                    theological speculations. The missing facet to the diamond is solid research on the individual
                    religious congregation. Here intersect the life of the parishioner, trends within the national
                    denomination, and the social, economic, and political changes in secular society. One must start at
                    the congregational level to understand the role of religious experience and values at the national
                    level. Simultaneously, one needs to recognize that broad movements have an effect on congregational
                    development, an effect generally ignored in many congregational histories.</p>
            <p>The author exhorts the would-be historian of a congregation to do more than extend vestry minutes,
                    collect cute tidbits, provide an account of the successes and foibles of clergy, list donors over
                    the decades, and report when the latest lighting was installed. The researcher needs to be aware of
                    the church's neighborhood and the social status of parishioners, discover what the site of
                    the parish plant communicates, and draw deductions from the church's interior. Where
                    furniture is placed and how people sit reveal something about the congregation, ranging from its
                    aesthetic tastes to theological principles. In order to understand the congregation's
                    unique character, the historian must observe the worship service and people's habits,
                    underline important shifts in decisions, describe the congregation's outlook and mission,
                    and even recognize its human failings.</p>
            <p>Despite his directions on how to draw up an outline and helpful hints on how to utilize archival
                    materials, Wind appears to demand the professionalization of congregational history in Indiana and
                    elsewhere. Wind's demand is timely, for today many are interested in
                    "nearby" or local history; professionals analyze the common person's
                    history within a national framework; and both individuals and groups seek to find their true
                    identity.</p>

                    research and criticize an uneven draft text? Lastly, where is the professional to find the financial

            <p>Very few American historians are concerned with the issue of objectivity as Peter Novick defines it.
                    They should be, not only because greater self-awareness will eliminate some of the hubris of the
                    critical seminar but also, and more important, because as Pierre Bourdieu points out,
                    "Epistemological conflicts are always, inseparably, political conflicts: so that a survey
                    on power … could perfectly well consist of apparently epistemological questions
                        alone."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Novick in a sense tests this view by tracing, examining,
                    and analyzing the actions and attitudes of historians from the founding of the American Historical
                    Association to the present. He derives his title from one of Charles A. Beard's more
                    pungent attacks on the objective school, which argued that a "true" history could
                    be written once all the "facts" had been "discovered."</p>
            <p>This is potent stuff. Novick has culled the papers of leading members of the profession and is
                    unsparing in pointing out the hypocrisy of scholars who claim professional objectivity but whose
                    blind ideological, racist, and religious prejudice is evident in their private correspondence. Some
                    Marxist and New Left historians fare little better when the inner contradictions of their work are
                    examined. Carl Becker and Beard loom large as pioneer relativists, while Frederick Jackson Turner is
                    written off ambiguously even if he did suggest that every generation should write its own history.</p>
            <p>Novick draws attention to historical controversies—they range from Sidney Fay vs
                    Bernadotte Schmidt to the Sears Case to the David Abraham episode—to highlight the
                    persistence of the objec-tivist-relativist debate in the profession. There is no doubt that dominant
                    schools of thought on this matter have played a large role in academic preferment. Even departments
                    have been fragmented when differences led to struggles for hegemony. Careers, he implies, have been
                    threatened or reduced to rubble.</p>
            <p>The book makes good reading but requires close attention. Graduate students, especially a new breed
                    of intellectual historians rather tired of social history with or without politics left in, will
                    find it a challenging and rewarding way to look at ideology, race, class, and gender. Surely it is
                    the best recent book on the profession, even if some individuals in it do not come off well. An
                    intelligent layman would find the book disturbing and disillusioning.</p>

            <p>Novick is informed, intelligent, literate, witty, and very self-indulgent. Some subjects are explored
                    so far beyond necessity, especially current trends in literature, anthropology, and philosophy, that
                    the reader may lose the thread of explanation. Novick must feel his audience has not read widely
                    enough to understand his discussion. Some readers may be surprised to find themselves mentioned in
                    the text or notes and wonder why they were not invited to provide a context for their actions or
                    words. Perhaps in Novick's kind of intellectual history, which is of necessity selective in
                    its research design, this is inevitable.</p>
            <p>This is a highly personal and charged book. Adjectives abound as do <hi rend="i">ad hominem</hi>
                    comments, and Novick goes after people he does not like. For example, Novick defends his student
                    David Abraham in a problematic case of evidence. Novick seems to have written a book that he would
                    enjoy reading. Serious historians will find it evocative and rewarding.</p>

                    </placeName>, IN 46526.) In August, 1943, on his thirtieth mission over the South Pacific,
                    Lieutenant Walter Brenneman died when his B-17 was shot down by a Japanese fighter.
                    Brenneman's death at the age of twenty-four was like the deaths of thousands of other young
                    Americans in those years, not unusually heroic and hardly worthy of even a footnote in the grand
                    histories of World War II. Yet this young man from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Wakarusa</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, was special, to his family, his friends, his fiancee—people who
                    for the rest of their lives mourned him.</p>
            <p>Among Lieutenant Brenneman's family was a niece, too young to remember anything but his
                    memorial service. Marcia Brenneman set out to remember as historians remember, interviewing family
                    and friends, tracing newspaper accounts, reading through family correspondence and scrapbooks. Her
                    years of hard work have produced much more than a family memorial. Here is a history of one man that
                    connects to his place and time in such a way as to capture readers with no connection whatsoever to
                    Walter Brenneman. From Marcia Brenneman's descriptions of his childhood, his basketball

                    niece has come to feel. And in the end one concludes that here is a book that deserves far more than
                    family and friends as readers. <hi rend="i">James H. Madison, Indiana University, <placeName>

                    are not published in traditional ways. Indeed, some are not "published" at all.
                    Such is the case with this examination of ethnic settlement patterns in the Hoosier capital, written

                    Historic Preservation and Archaeology in order to "provide reliable data" to the
                    division and to "facilitate its work in evaluating ethnic-related buildings and sites for
                    inclusion <pb n="103" id="VAA4025-087-1-109"/> in the National Register of Historic Places"
                    (p. 1). Thus, the work exists only in an 8½-by-11 inch, spiral-bound format, with copies
                    on deposit in the Indiana State Library, Indiana Historical Society Library, and <placeName>

                    this is a compendium with which students of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> history and Indiana ethnic history should be familiar. Divita has culled a broad range
                    of sources and brought together a vast amount of material concerning the city's population
                    composition over time. The 119 pages of text are supplemented by 20 tables and 58 maps. (Many of the
                    latter, unfortunately, did not reproduce well.) Divita observes that recently "new activity
                    has contributed to a greater consciousness of an ethnic presence in the city" (p. 3).
                    Divita's work, both here and in several other publications, helps to provide the historical
                    context for that raised consciousness. <hi rend="i">Robert G. Barrows, Indiana University-Purdue

                    B. Lane, XIX (1990), paperbound, $4.00. Richard M. Dorson's <hi rend="i">Millrat</hi> legacy continues. Fifteen years after an army of fieldworkers invaded the Calumet,
                    James B. Lane finds significant change in the occupational folklore of steelworkers. Because the
                    typical millrat of the 1990s is no longer a "fat, beer-drinking slob," one
                    narrator says, but a "knowledgeable, college-educated technician" (p. 36), a
                    flexible folklore has emerged to mirror lived experience. In addition, Lane concentrates on drug and
                    scatological stories (the latter influenced in part by increasing numbers of women steelworkers)
                    that Dorson either neglected or overlooked. Although somewhat lacking in analysis and
                    interpretation, this collection is an important update to the dynamic character of (occupational)
