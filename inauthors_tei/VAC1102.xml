pop'lar theory that a feller's usefulness
ends at eighty-five.</p>
<p>"Why, Cato took up Greek an' learned
it at eighty; Goethe wuz eighty when he
put th' finishin' touches on Faust; Sophocles
wrote Oedipus at four-score an'
Theophrastus wuz ninety before he became
pop'lar as a writer," said Prof.
Alex Tansey.</p>
<p>"I don't know nothin' about th' fellers
you're talkin' about, but I do know that
Niles Turner's brother, Rodney, mastered
th' first high wheel bicycle at eighty-one,
an' fer many years thereafter he wuz a
familiar figure in th' sportin' circles o'
this town," said Tell Binkley.</p>
<p>"We find lots o' instances in our medical
researches which show that a great
many famous characters o' th' past did
not reach th' zenith o' ther fame until
after they'd safely tided over th' checker
age," declared Dr. Mopps. "Rev. Wiley

Tanger's case is one that proves my
point. Although he is still alert an'
preachin' regularly, it wuz not until he'd
won th' tri-county checker championship
at seventy-eight that he mastered theology
an' became eminent as a devine.
People are different. Some retire at
twenty. Ther is no rule fer retirin'.
It depends on th' feller. Some people
never begin t' work at all. Tilford Moots
quit plowin' fifteen years ago an' only
recently returned t' th' plow in order
t' release his wife fer war work. Gran'maw
Pash's brother, Bat, wuz a skilled
umbreller mender an' died in th' fairgrounds
at Frankfort in th' winter o'
seventy-eight at th' age o' eighty-one.
He'd been a great pool player up t' his
seventieth year. Another case o' which
I have personal knowledge is that o'
Virgil Plum. He'd never had any real
occupation or callin'. At seventy-four,

<pb id="VAC1102-022" n="[ ]"/>
	
long after his children had married an'
fled, he became interested in croquet
an' astonished th' countryside. He died
o' over exertion on th' floor of a dancin'
academy at th' age o' one hundred

<salute>DEAR MAW:</salute>
	
</opener>
	
<p>Well, here I am. I hope you are well.
We had some trip comin' over. Cigarettes
galore. A piece of shrapnel jest
now broke th' last pane o' glass in my
window as I write. I have enough terbacker
t' last a week. Unless some has
been sent since I left I'll probably be
without some days before some comes.
I'm billeted on th' parlor floor of an ole
historic chateau with a mantel piece that
goes back t' th' renaissance. My shoes
are dryin' on th' mantle. Cigarettes
should be mailed at intervals o' two days
apart t' assure a steady, unbroken flow.

but would rather have cigarettes. It's
wonderful how indifferent you git t'
danger over here. I'm not spendin' any
o' my pay as I want t' loaf a couple o'
years when I git home, so any cigarettes
or t'backer you send me is jest that much
saved. I wouldn' give much fer this
historic chateau after th' shrapnel gits
thro' with it.  .  .  . I'm finishin' this
letter this mornin' as a piece of shrapnel
put my candle out last night an' no
matches wuz t' be had. Th' French
people wuz certainly glad t' see me but
they have scarcely enough cigarettes fer
'emselves, an' are tired out an' poor after
fightin' so long, so I hate t' ask 'em fer
'em when friends kin send 'em t' me so
easily any time. It don't look right
t' take 'em from 'em an' I know you
would not want me t' do so. It's different
with eggs, which are plentiful. I
can't talk any French an' I can't tell what

ther sayin, but I wouldn' ask 'em fer
cigarettes, an' you wouldn' either if you
could see what they've been up against.
Are there any cigarette clubs at home?
Some o' the boys say ther's clubs in ther
towns that gather money with which t'
buy them an' send them t' them. Girls
send them th' same as socks, an' believe
me, th' boys are glad t' git 'em. I hope
you are well an' strong an' able t' work
fer many years t' come. You should be
glad you've got a good, easy cookin' job
when you think o' th' poor ole women
over here plowin'. Ther haint nothin' in
loafin'. I'm goin' t' work some when I
git back. I'm goin' over t' th' mantle
an' git my shoes as soon as th' shellin'
lets up a little. Mark your packages
care A. E. F. You cant carry a pipe
over here very handy. Shrapnel knocks
'em out o' your mouth. You bet I've
got my three cigarette cases distributed


<pb id="VAC1102-132" n="[ ]"/>
		
where they'll stop th' most shrapnel. It
don't look like I'd ever git my shoes as
ther's a constant hail o' shrapnel. Don't
worry about me.</p>
