            <p>The primary and perhaps the most important task of a painstaking biographer is to test the
                    reliability of his source material. The average historian is often tempted to throw the
                    responsibility for the accuracy of his deductions on other authors who have preceded him in the same
                    field of effort. This is accomplished by the use of a generous distribution of footnotes and
                    references, supplemented with an exhaustive bibliography. Supported by this array of evidences he
                    attempts to give his argument the tone of authority. This method of approach by many Lincoln
                    historians is responsible for the continual repetition of folklore and fable, until numerous,
                    untenable stories, so widely circulated, have become accepted generally as factual, and constitute
                    what we may term, "Lincoln Mythology."</p>
            <p>There is no collection of writings, consisting of manuscripts, correspondence, recorded traditions,
                    fragments of folklore, and personal reminiscences, which has contributed more definitely to the
                    current opinion of Abraham Lincoln's private life, than the compilation known as the
                    Herndon collection of Lincoln papers.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> One would lack the ability of
                    discrimination if he did not acknowledge the historical value of much of the information contained

                    appearing in the memoranda, which both common sense and public records make void.</p>
            <p>The mere fact that the Herndon papers were assembled by a law partner of Lincoln was of tremendous
                    importance from the viewpoint of the student searching for reliable data. The supposition that the
                    first book interpreting these manuscripts was written by Ward H. Lamon, one of Lincoln's
                    closest friends, gave additional prestige to the book and its supporting documents, until the famous
                    papers assumed a certain degree of infallibility. So authoritative have they become that even
                    Lincoln's own statements about certain family history and other personal affairs have been
                    pushed aside, when coming in conflict with conclusions drawn from the Herndon sources. With the
                    reliability of both papers and interpreting author apparently established because of such personal
                    and friendly contacts, it is a severe jolt, indeed, to know that the first interpretation of the
                    Herndon papers was not by the friendly Lamon, but a hostile biographer named Chauncey F. Black. He
                    featured the questionable episodes, discovered in the Herndon data, which would place Lincoln in the
                    most unenviable light.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>It has been just a hundred years now since the Lincoln-Herndon partnership was formed. This
                    relationship placed William Herndon in a position to make some positive contribution to a
                    trustworthy recording of facts about his senior partner. It is not strange that in this centennial
                    atmosphere some effort might be made to inquire whether or not Herndon measured up to his great
                    opportunity, or on the other <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The task of this inquiry might properly fall upon Indiana critics, because the famous papers were
                    acquired from Herndon by Jesse W. Weik, of <placeName>

                    Lincoln works which used the Herndon manuscripts as source material were written in Indiana, or
                    written by Indiana men.</p>
            <p>With the trustworthiness of many of the manuscripts in question, and the interpreters who used them
                    making many conflicting deductions from them, it appears that William Henry Herndon, instead of
                    attaining the roll of another Boswell, has become the master Lincoln mythmaker.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>There is no intention to examine the myths he created and elaborate upon them, although some brief
                    references to many of them will appear as the argument proceeds. The objective will be more
                    successfully achieved by directing our attention to various interpretations of the manuscripts.

                    the Herndon papers, on only five different occasions, until their recent deposit in the Library of
                    Congress, have the original documents served as primary sources. The five authors and their
                    respective contributions to be featured are: Herndon's expositions of his own papers in a
                    series of lectures; Lamon's purchase of the documents with Black serving as the
                    interpreter, resulting in a one-volume book; Weik's acquisition of the manuscripts in which
                    he had the collaboration of Herndon and from which came the three-volume edition, also, the
                    one-volume work personally produced by Weik; Beveridge's access to the papers which
                    contributed to the two volumes of his anticipated complete life; and Hertz's publication of
                    many of the originals in a one-volume edition.</p>
            <p>The mammoth scrapbook which Jesse W. Weik made while he was collaborating with William Herndon on the
                    famous Lincoln volumes is now the property of the Lincoln National Life Foundation. It provides
                    important information about the reaction of Lincoln's friends and contemporary literary
                    critics to the first three attempts to give the public a glimpse of the famous Herndon documents.
                    These testimonies are of extreme importance in attempting to pass upon the mythical character of the
                    deductions. It is to be regretted some are not dated.</p>
            <p>A series of addresses on Abraham Lincoln, which Herndon delivered in 1865 and 1866, was the first
                    intimation which the public in general received that he aspired to write a biography of the martyred
                    President. The fact that Herndon had been Lincoln's law partner, no doubt, encouraged the
                    people to believe that his contributions would be based on personal observations. It was not until

                        <p>With no disposition to depreciate Mr. Herndon, or to wound his feelings, respect for
                                    my own state, and for the memory of Mr. Lincoln, compels me to say that
                                    "Mr. Herndon's lectures are regarded here as caricatures upon the
                                    life, habits, and manners of the late President, and there can be no doubt,
                                    whatever, that if Mr. Herndon ever completes his biography, it will be characterized
                                    by the same rambling, conceited qualities that are so conspicious in his lectures.
                                    Whatever other qualities Mr. Herndon possesses, his is not distinguished for taste,
                                    or style in literature; and he is no more a representative of the people of <placeName>

                                    Lincoln's biography, and that he is to immortalize himself by this effort.
                                    Nevertheless, I have never heard one of Mr. Lincoln's friends express other
                                    sentiments than those of regret, that he should have undertaken to write the life of
                                    one, whose memory is so dear to us all as that of a friend, as it is to the country
                                    as that of a statesman and patriot. If you have read the sketches of Mr.
                                    Herndon's lectures, you have seen a fair picture of the man. He is
                                    "Bill Herndon" a man "sui generis", but neither

                    discouraged him in the book project, this fact is certain that he attempted to dispose of his
                    records as early as February 24, 1869, when he asked a correspondent Hart to make some inquiries
                    about their probable value and then concluded, "I may not sell, may finish the life myself,
                    cannot tell."<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Three months earlier Herndon had tried to induce Hart
                    to secure for him a loan of $8,000, stating in the letter, "I am worth
                        $50,000."<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the meantime, Herndon had been corresponding with Ward H. Lamon about the records and had
                    submitted some of the documents for Lamon and his "corps of literary friends" to
                    look over. Finally on September 17, 1869, Herndon sold to Lamon his "Lincoln records in
                    three volumes for the consideration of $4,000 cash in hand paid," empowering him
                    "to sell, publish, use or dispose of said records as he wishes or wills."<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lamon had interested in the biography project a man of some literary ability, Chauncey Black. Whether
                    it was Black's financial or political urge that prompted him to accept the assignment of
                    interpreting the Herndon manuscripts, we may never know, but it was the biased political stand
                    displayed in his copy that brought suddenly to a close the contemplated two-volume work.</p>

                            influences, and Colonel Lamon assured me that nothing politically hostile to Mr. Lincoln

            <p>The contract for the book was signed, however, and the complete life of Lincoln was anticipated.
                    Clark's prophecy about Black's attitude toward Lincoln was confirmed before very
                    much of the copy was presented, and in one instance a whole chapter was eliminated because of the
                    partisan viewpoint of Black. When Clark discovered that Black was sacrificing Lincoln to uphold the
                    Buchanan administration and learned that Black's political bias was "stronger than
                    his desire to have full justice done to Mr. Lincoln's memory"<hi rend="sup">18</hi> both Clark and Lamon broke with Black.</p>
            <p>It was a tragedy, indeed, that the Herndon manuscripts first fell into the hands of a man hostile to
                    Abraham Lincoln and then were released as having been written by a close friend, Lamon. As Clark
                    well said, the results showed "The futility of endeavoring to combine essentially
                    antagonistic elements in the production of an important literary work."<hi rend="sup">19</hi> Black had no admiration for the subject of the biography, and he did not go out of his way
                    to test the validity of the mass of folklore and fable before him, with the result, that much of the
                    most untenable gossip on the personal life of Abraham Lincoln, was first laid before the people by a
                    political and sectional antagonist. No one will ever be able to estimate the great injustice done to
                    Lincoln and the members of his family by the hypocritical Black, who posed as a friend and then
                    defamed the man he really despised. His deductions about Lincoln's private life did more
                    than any other work to influence all subsequent Lincoln biographers writing on the subject.</p>

                    Lincoln features, a few excerpts will show the brilliant review it gave the Lamon book in 1872.</p>
            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>We think every one will find Mr. Lamon's "Life of Lincoln" a book of
                        uncommon interest, whatever may be the opinion of its wisdom, its reliability, and its
                        propriety. On all these points we confess to having doubts, and on one at least something more
                        than a doubt. We cannot see what there was in the career or the character of Lincoln that
                        justifies Mr. Lamon in dragging from the dead man's grave the miserable fact of his
                        unhappy marriage, and thrusting it again and again before the reader. It was a point that needed
                        only to be touched with the lightest hand, to which it would have yielded all that was
                        qualifying and significant in it; but this shameless pressure upon it, this record of
                        preliminary occurrences, these hints of the spiritual squalor and the cruel suffering of his
                        marriage, do nothing to explain Lincoln; and they form a violation of the silence of death, and
                        aggression upon the right of those yet living—the widow and the blameless
                        children—to the oblivion which at least temporarily falls upon such facts. This is
                        the chiefly unpardonable feature of a work which has many features hard to forgive, and which
                        treats all Mr. Lincoln's love affairs with a maudlin insistence and a fumbling
                        melodramatic sentimentality very repugnant to taste and trying to patience. …</p>
                    <p>The history of Mr. Lincoln's childhood and early life is exceedingly full and minute. It
                        appears to us at times quite too full to be quite true. There are few things so untrustworthy as
                        the memory of a great man's boyhood friends and old neighbors concerning his life among
                        them. The passion for distinction at his expense through indiscriminate praise or gross
                        derogation, is one that few of them can resist; and even when their recollections are confronted
                        and compared, it must be wellnigh impossible to sift the truth from them, to gather the grains
                        of wheat from the bushels of chaff. However, this only tells against <list type="footnotes">

                    viewed by a former acquaintance of both Lincoln and his law partner. A. L. Bledsoe, the editor of

                    Lincoln at the time. Bledsoe was no lover of Lincoln, but he did state that Lincoln was one of the
                    most extraordinary human beings that has figured in history. He claimed that it was Lamon's
                    book that revealed to him for the first time Lincoln's ruling passion, something that he
                    had never before been able to discover until he read these lines: "It must by this time be
                    clear to the reader that Mr. Lincoln was never agitated by any passion more intense than his
                    wonderful thirst for distinction."<hi rend="sup">22</hi> This passion, according to Black,

                        <p>It is believed, by the world at large, that the hatred of oppression, coupled with the love
                            of freedom, was Mr. Lincoln's ruling passion. Nothing is farther from the truth.
                            Some of his biographers, indeed, such as Bacon and Holland, would have us to believe that
                            Mr. Lincoln inherited this ruling passion from his father, Tom Lincoln, who, it is said,
                            left <placeName>

                            forever dispelled this illusion. "It has pleased some of Mr. Lincoln's
                            biographers," says he, "to represent this removal of his father (from <placeName>

                            be further from the truth. …"</p>
                        <p>Tom Lincoln, as Colonel Lamon shows, fled from justice and not from slavery. For having, in a
                            low brawl with one Onlow, a mean blackguard like himself, bit off his nose and left his face
                            disfigured for life, he found it convenient to escape from Hardin county and hide himself in
                            the wilds of Indiana. There young Abe, about four years old at the time of the hegira or
                            flight, was raised, in a little cabin fourteen feet square, made of rough, unhewn logs or
                            poles, and daubed with mud.</p>
                        <p>This hole was, literally, "a cage of unclean birds." For Tom <hi rend="i">Linkhorn</hi>, as he was then called, and Nancy Hanks, the father and mother of our
                            hero, were never married, but just lived together, and cohabited, like the lower sort of
                            negroes of the State from which they had fled. When we heard the late Governor Morehead, of <placeName>

                            of Lincoln. There the two "mean whites" lived, like the lowest of negroes,
                            in their hut, without door or window, and with no other floor than the naked earth.
                            … He never had the least respect for father or mother—for Tom <hi rend="i">Linkhorn</hi> or Nancy Hanks. On the contrary, he always abhorred his own
                            father, the brute Tom <hi rend="i">Linkhorn</hi>, and had no tender feeling for his mother,
                            Nancy Hanks. It is no wonder, then, that he should have become, as he did, a determined

                    parents, is quite important in considering the eligibility of Lincoln's law partner to
                    qualify as his biographer.</p>
            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>The little men about him [Lincoln]—the Herndons of <placeName>

                        forthwith, as soon as he was dead, set up as great oracles to let all the world know what manner
                        of man Abraham Lincoln was. … It is an old saying, and true as it is old, that
                        "no man is a hero to his valet"; but, as Hegel has well said, "it is
                        the fault of the valet." It was the fault of Mr. Herndon, that he had no soul, no mind,
                        no eye for the really remarkable qualities of Mr. Lincoln. Hence, valet though he was, he thinks
                        himself a much greater man than his hero. "Lincoln," says he, "was a
                        natural anti-slavery man, <hi rend="i">as I think</hi>, and <hi rend="i">yet he needed
                        watching.</hi>" So, in other places, he represents himself as keeping Mr. Lincoln, as
                        watching and training him, and preparing him for "his great career," when the
                        time should arrive to put him on the race-track of glory, allowing him to enter neither too soon
                        nor too late to win, but just in the nick of time. The world is thus given to understand that it
                        owes Abraham Lincoln to William H. Herndon (no very great obligation, perhaps,) his quondam
                        law-partner. We wonder how Colonel Lamon, whose <hi rend="i">Life of Lincoln</hi> contains many
                        similar statements, reconciled them with a decent regard for the character of his hero.</p>
                    <p>Again, says Mr. Herndon, Lincoln "needed hope, faith, energy, and <hi rend="i">I think I
                            warmed him.</hi> Lincoln and I were just the opposites of one another. He was cautious and
                        practical; I spontaneous, ideal, and speculative. He arrived at truths by reflection, I by

                        Thus, according to Mr. Herndon, Lincoln was the cold, creeping, calculating reasoner; while he
                        was the warm, spontaneous, glowing, and gifted seer. …<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

            <p>It is quite apparent that those who knew William Herndon, personally, placed little confidence in his
                    ability to speak with any degree of authority on the more intimate characteristics of Abraham
                    Lincoln. This would largely discredit the personal estimates which he made available to Lamon and
                    which were so exaggerated by Black.</p>
            <p>Anyone who has read the rambling letters of William Herndon and the equally disorganized arrangement
                    of the subject matter in his early lectures will immediately come to the conclusion that the critics
                    who doubted Herndon's ability to write a biography of Lincoln were correct. Since he first
                    announced his biographical intentions to the public in 1865, a dozen years had passed when he
                    received a letter from an eighteen-year-old boy named Jesse Weik, who was a student in John Clark
                    Ridpath's history class at DePauw University in Indiana. Although interested in Lincoln, it
                    cannot be said Weik was familiar with Lincoln's writings and public speeches, as there was
                    not available to him at such an early date any extensive compilation of Lincoln's works.
                    The fact that he began collaborating with Herndon on the contemplated book when he was little more
                    than a youth without any former literary experience is another factor that must be considered when
                    placing a valuation on the Herndon volumes,<hi rend="sup">28</hi> as it is a well-established fact
                    that Weik, and not Herndon, was the writer of the text. Much of the book was written by Weik in a
                    room above a grocery store in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greencastle</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and the larger part of his source material came in long letters from Herndon,
                    who stated twenty-three years after Abraham Lincoln was dead, "I have in my memory a
                    thousand unwritten facts about our good man, Abe, that were told me by good and truthful

                        <p>Mr. Herndon has one trait that is ever obnoxious in the writers of books—personal
                            vanity, and he lacks another that always challenges the admiration and respect of those who
                            read books, common sense. … The "holier-than-thou" air of the
                            writer is repulsive to the last degree, and a shudder creeps over the reader to realize that
                            a "friend" is thus harshly revealing glimpses of a life that came to his
                            knowledge, as the friend and law partner of twenty years, and cooly makes merchandise of the

                                    "Herndon's Life of Lincoln" came duly to hand and but for
                                    a spell of the grip would have answered sooner.</p>
                        <p>Herndon was a peculiar kind of "crank" and his work is regarded
                                    here as deserving of but little credit by those who were acquainted with both
                                    Lincoln and Herndon. Although professing to have been gotten up with friendly
                                    intentions towards Lincoln, such professed good intentions are not credited. Herndon
                                    had a sort of loose connection with Lincoln as a partner in local business of this
                                    county, and after Lincoln's election, as the understanding is here, he went
                                    to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName> as an applicant for some place and was disappointed—He
                                    returned home soured and sore headed and thereafter active with the Democrats.</p>
                        <p>Immediately upon Lincoln's death, he proclaimed himself as the only living
                                    man who knew all about Lincoln, and assumed that he had been Lincoln's
                                    conscience keeper, and that he was the man who had made him what he was, and
                                    particularly that Lincoln had confided to him, secrets known to nobody else.</p>
                        <p>It is not believed that any such confidence had existed—Much of the
                                    narrative contained in the Book is known to be erroneous here, and he states the
                                    matter as though he was personally acquainted with the facts, it has impaired
                                    credence in whatever he has stated as being only within his own knowledge.</p>
                        <p>The story of Lincoln having told Herndon that his Mother was a bastard is wholly
                                    discredited by everybody who knew Lincoln, as well as much of other matter in the
                                    Book alleged to have been derived from conversations with Lincoln.</p>
                        <p>I think I have fairly given the criticism made here by those best acquainted with
                                    both Lincoln and Herndon.</p>

                    happened to become associated with Herndon as a law partner one hundred years ago. Harvey L. Ross,

                        <p>There are but few persons now living who knew Mr. Herndon as well as I did in the days of his
                            youth. He was a son of Archer G. Herndon, one of the early settlers of <placeName>

                            city—the Herndon House. Archer G. Herndon was a prominent politician and had been
                            elected state senator besides holding several other offices at different times. He was a
                            Whig and a warm personal friend of Mr. Lincoln. … While I was carrying the mail I
                            stopped two nights each week at the Herndon House and there is where I became acquainted
                            with William Herndon. We were about the same age he being fourteen years old while I was

                            thought a little strange at that time that Mr. Lincoln would take into partnership so young
                            and inexperienced a lawyer as Bill Herndon. But he had his reasons and I think I can come
                            very near guessing some of them. Bill's father had been a friend to Lincoln for a
                            great many years and was a very influential man in Sangamon County. He had always helped
                            Lincoln in every way and it was in payment for this kindness that Lincoln took his son in
                            his office.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>

                    mainly of reminiscences and extended accounts of the debatable episodes in the three-volume work.

                    to make an epochal study of Lincoln, the Herndon papers received attention for the first time from a
                    nationally known biographer. In the preface of his book Beveridge makes the statement that from Weik
                    came "The largest and most important aid."<hi rend="sup">39</hi> Possibly
                    Beveridge might have had access to the Lincoln papers now impounded in the Library of Congress if
                    Robert Lincoln had not learned that he was placing much stress on the Herndon manuscripts, which
                    Robert had a just reason to deplore. There can be no question that the Herndon traditions greatly
                    influenced the Beveridge volumes, and some of the myths which had fallen into disrepute were given a
                    new lease of life by the conclusions of the distinguished author.</p>
            <p>It is surprising how the Herndon papers took on a new importance under the professional handling of a
                    noted historian. The plan Beveridge had in mind, which he very clearly and definitely explained to
                    the present writer then living in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, called for an evolutionary process of bringing his Lincoln to a great climax. His plan
                    was not so different from Herndon's idea of starting Lincoln in a "stagnant putrid
                    pool," and it was in this same pool where Beveridge, as he worked over the Herndon papers,
                    found the future emancipator. It is to be regretted that Beveridge did not live long enough to get
                    Lincoln entirely out of the <list type="footnotes">

                        <p>that Lincoln's love affair with Ann Rutledge was carried on while she was really
                            engaged to another man; that he did not acquit a client by the use of the wrong almanac;
                            that he was not greatly excited over slavery till well on in life; that he appeared as
                            attorney for a slave holder trying to drag a chattel back across the border; that he was a
                            machine politician who was more ambitious than conscientious; that he used anonymous letters
                            lavishly in his campaigns and when challenged to a duel by a man he defamed, thus, not only
                            broke the law by accepting the challenge, but violated all codes by insisting on a weapon
                            that left his brave and honorable opponent at a fatal disadvantage.</p>
                        <p>Beveridge shows that none of Lincoln's family voted for or sided with him, and that
                            he did not like his own father. He is pictured as slipshod and slovenly and shiftless, yet
                            shifty in principles to such an appalling degree that some of his debts are still unpaid.
                            There was so much dirt in one corner of his office that weeds grew up in it. He presents

                    Lincoln, and it also allows us to observe something of the development of his Lincoln mythology.
                    Herndon had been gathering information about Lincoln but three years, as he stated when he wrote to
                    Ward H. Lamon on February 26, 1869, that his records about Lincoln were "the most perfect
                    on record."<hi rend="sup">46</hi> He did make one probable exception to this

                    seemed to Herndon an easy taskmaster if in three years the collecting of a few manuscripts, while
                    still attending to his law practice, had allowed him to stand by the side of the immortal Boswell.
                    Herndon told Lamon that only by the use of his records could the true life of Lincoln be written,
                    and then concluded that there was fame and fortune in the records when put in the form of a

            <p>Ten years elapsed between the sale of the manuscripts to Lamon and Herndon's second attempt
                    to accumulate information about Lincoln. During this interval only one letter written by Herndon
                    appears in the Hertz volume. When this second installment of information began to accumulate Herndon
                    was seventy years of age and Lincoln had been dead twenty years. On December 1, 1888, Herndon
                    advised Weik that he had in his memory a thousand unwritten facts about Lincoln,<hi rend="sup">48</hi> and he drew upon this inexhaustible mass of reminiscences and jotted down what he called
                    factual evidences.</p>
            <p>It was a changed Lincoln, as might be expected after so long an interval, that emerged from his
                    memory. In his early discussions, he said that Lincoln was "true to friends,
                    never-deserting them till they deserted virtue, veracity, and integrity,"<hi rend="sup">49</hi> but in his later deductions, Lincoln becomes "a remorseless trimmer with men. They
                    were his tools and when they were used up, he threw them aside as old iron and took up new
                        tools."<hi rend="sup">50</hi> In the old installment of notes, Herndon said he
                    "never knew him [Lincoln] to do a mean thing,"<hi rend="sup">51</hi> but he wrote
                    to Weik in 1886 that "when he [Lincoln] used a man and sucked all the uses [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] out of him, he would throw away the <hi rend="i">thing</hi> as an old orange
                        peeling."<hi rend="sup">52</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why continue with these contrasts, which are innumerable, between Herndon's Lincoln of
                    1869, and his Lincoln of 1889. Such a procedure would cause one to challenge, without good
                    authority, almost all of the accepted, noble characteristics of our best-loved American.</p>
            <p>It will be worthwhile, however, to observe briefly, just how much of the source material in the
                    Herndon manuscripts now published in <hi rend="i">The Hidden Lincoln</hi> would be accepted today as
                    authentic by any well-trained, discerning historian. <hi rend="i">The Hidden Lincoln</hi> is in two

            <p>Only fifty-five of the 233 pages of "Letters to Herndon" were written before 1874,
                    the bulk of the remainder between 1885 and 1891, twenty years and more after Lincoln was dead. Only
                    twenty-eight of the above-mentioned fifty-five pages of letters were written within three years
                    after Lincoln's death, and even in these few pages many of the incidents discussed occurred
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> sixty years before they were recorded.</p>
            <p>Most of the correspondence in "Letters to Herndon," written shortly after
                    Lincoln's death, covering seventy-three pages, was from people who were reciting incidents
                    which happened in Indiana, at least thirty-five years before, or in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName>, twenty-eight years before Lincoln was assassinated. The forty-eight pages of
                    "Statements Collected," on his trip to Indiana, and a few others in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> were also in most instances memories of people who were trying to recall events which
                    happened a quarter of a century before. "Herndon's Notes and Monographs,"
                    which cover forty-nine pages, were apparently written as late as 1887, twenty-two years after
                    Lincoln was dead.</p>
            <p>No summary of the contents of the volume is needed to reveal the general character of the evidence
                    therein displayed. It is not strange that the trend of Lincoln biography emerging from such an
                    unreliable original source is still presenting a confused mass of contradictions. When one observes
                    such hostile interpreters as Black and Bledsoe, utilizing directly or indirectly these sources on
                    the very threshold of the Lincoln literary structure, now enlarged to such enormous proportions, he
                    is not surprised at the mythical content of our current Lincolniana.</p>
            <p>The good and noble acts of Abraham Lincoln may be authenticated by a voluminous mass of his own
                    personal writings and addresses—greater in bulk than the complete works of Shakespeare.
                    Supplementing this dependable information there is available the reports of hundreds of interviews
                    and observations relating to Abraham Lincoln which were written down while he lived. It is almost
                    unbelievable that a mass of folklore and tradition of such unreliable content as the Herndon papers
                    should become our primary source bearing on the private life of America's outstanding
                    historical character.</p>

                    </placeName>, the McDonald family of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, received the urge to move on, and for their new abode chose a tract of land
                    approximately two miles south of the present town of Portersville. Since the Indians were a
                    disturbing factor, a fort was built where the family might go for protection at the slightest
                    indication of danger. That they feared the Indians was also demonstrated by the fact that one member
                    of the family would walk around the land with a long rifle while the other members cleared the land.
                    It was not unusual to see a man plowing in the field accompanied by a son or daughter carrying a
                    rifle which might be put to use in case the opportunity presented itself.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>Only a few foreigners can be mentioned among the first settlers. Of all the pioneers, however, the

                    it: "The very fact of the wilderness appealed to men as a fair, blank page on which to
                    write a new chapter in the story of man's struggle for a higher type of
                        society."<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A large number of early settlers who migrated north of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> did so because of slavery. Some were too proud to work among the slaves and too poor to
                    own a plantation. The inflow of the "poor white" was made up in part of restless
                    hunters and thriftless settlers who moved along without any definite ambitions, and in part of other
                    classes who migrated to a new region with the hope that they might improve their conditions.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

            <p>That emigration made its imprint on the South can be seen by newspaper accounts. A traveler was

                    </placeName> were pouring forth their population in swarms. At night the campfires of the emigrants
                    made the woods blaze in all directions. The lands were exhausted and the planters sought more
                    fertile land. A reduction in wages of twenty-five per cent also worked a hardship on many and
                    deprived them of what little comforts they had.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> As early as 1821 the
                    free-laboring classes refused to settle in places where labor was considered degrading. In areas

            <p>Although there was only a slight variation in some sections of the native-born population, only the

                    German-speaking settlers and since he spoke German his sympathies went out to this group. While
                    traveling around in this district he conceived the idea of establishing two resting stations in the

                            of the town there are about forty farmers and more than 120 sections of Congress land.
                            … The region is healthful, the soil fertile. A German Catholic priest is
                            appointed for it, as soon as the congregation increases. The lots, which are 100 feet long
                            and wide, will be sold in the town itself on April 22, at $10 each, on condition
                            that $5 must be paid by July 1, and the other $5 by September 1, 1840.

            <p>Father Kundek visited Europe in 1852 in the hope that he might arouse interest in his missions. He

                        <p>In General the Germans come flying like the snowflakes and buy up the land, and in
                                    two years our congregation may amount to two hundred families. Last spring [1841]
                                    our pastor counted forty families, and now there certainly are fifty. Last spring a
                                    house was built in town. The owner sold it to a man named Schneider, who lives in <placeName>

            <p>For a clearer presentation of the vital part which the Indiana coal industry played in World War II,
                    the changing aspects of production and the various phases of the industry's picture will be
                    presented as to their status at the outbreak of the 1939 invasions conducted by <placeName>

                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, and the progression from that point to August of the year 1945 which, in all
                    probability, saw the peak of coal production and initiative required to meet demands for coal, as
                    well as the end of the war.</p>
            <p>During World War I, Indiana production had been geared to a high of over thirty million tons in the
                    year 1918, which production figure remained the all-time high, even during the highly prosperous
                    period before 1929. In fact, since 1918, with the exception of one or two years, there was a steady
                    decline in that production to a low of 12,500,000 tons in 1932. The production figure continued to
                    hover around the fourteen to sixteen million mark through 1937, following which there was a decline
                    of three million tons to a little more than thirteen million tons in 1938. This decline is explained
                    by the fact that the latter part of 1937 saw the Bituminous Coal Commission, established by the
                    Bituminous Coal Act of 1937,<hi rend="sup">1</hi> prepare to issue minimum prices for the sale of
                    coal, resulting in purchasers stock-piling more than customarily to avoid increased costs due to the
                    new minimum prices, which would be effective on 1938 purchases. This stock piling resulted in a
                    lesser demand during the year 1938. In the year 1939, however, the production figure rose to over
                    fifteen million tons and, for the year 1941, reached almost twenty-one million tons.</p>
            <p>Unprecedented demands for coal following the declaration of war on <placeName>

                    the production of 1942 increased 2,700,000 tons; the production of 1943 exceeded that of 1942 by
                    160,000 tons; and the production of Indiana mines for 1944 exceeded 26,000,000 tons. All of these

                    million tons per year.</p>
            <p>The increases in production indicate that Indiana producers were able, because of having followed for
                    years a policy of initiating and maintaining the highest mechanization of their mines, to produce
                    the added requirements for coal which resulted from increased demands within their customary
                    markets.</p>
            <p>Markets for Indiana coal extend more or less in a northerly and westerly direction from the producing
                    fields. In these markets were situated consumers who required practically every and any type of
                    prepared coal made available by the Indiana producers. Large tonnages move to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> region and northwest into <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="mnu">Minnesota</country>
                    </placeName>. Indiana markets also consume considerable tonnage. Other consumers located west of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, in the states of Jowa and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> and in others farther west, complete the general markets. At the time our nation was
                    plunged into war, these markets continued to draw their coal requirements from the Indiana mines but
                    in larger quantities, as previously indicated by the increased production from a little more than
                    fifteen million tons in 1939 to almost twenty-one million tons at the end of 1941, and over
                    twenty-six million tons in 1944.</p>
            <p>The increased production of 1944 moved to normal markets, with the exception of shipments made
                    because of several directives that were issued by the Solid Fuels Administration for War<hi rend="sup">2</hi> to supplement declining production or priority shipment of certain high-grade
                    Eastern coals to other than normal markets.</p>
            <p>In 1939, there were approximately 56 rail mine producers and 622 truck mine producers, which figures,
                    at the time of the entry of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> into the war, were changed to 63 rail mine producers and 601 truck mine operators; and
                    77 rail mine producers and 212 truck mine operators comprised the Indiana picture in June, 1944. In
                    February, 1945, there were 84 rail producers and 193 truck mine operators.</p>

               </table> It was expected that, with the initiation of the drafting of young men for military
                    training, under the Selective Service Act beginning in October, 1940, a considerable decrease in
                    mine wage-earners would have been effected. The table indicates that, between the period of October,
                    1940, and December, 1941, there was an actual increase of approximately eighteen hundred mine
                    wage-earners. The trend downward, however, between the entry of this country in World War II and the
                    employment figures for the subsequent six months (June, 1942), indicated a decrease from the
                    December, 1941, high figure of 11,987 to 8,186. The figures for June, 1943, and June, 1944, and also
                    for February, 1945, indicate that considerable recovery in number of men employed in the mines was
                    made by producers following the June, 1942, low. This was due to the fact that many of the younger
                    men, who were the mainstays for productive efficiency, were replaced with older men, and in greater
                    numbers to offset the lack in production which would result with the employment of the same number
                    of older men to replace younger men. Then too, continuing increases in demands for Indiana coal
                    required the hiring of many additional older men to maintain production at demand level.</p>
            <p>Questionnaires conducted by the Bituminous Coal Producers Advisory Board for Indiana indicated some
                    interesting trends in the personnel situation, as a major percentage of the mines responded to these
                    questionnaires. The results of these questionnaires are quoted herewith:</p>

                    major increase in production that was realized from the Indiana field.</p>
            <p>The same provisional set-up for handling of organized Indiana mines remained in effect during the war
                    period. Labor relations covering strip mine operations were carried on with the United Mine Workers

            <p>While the April, 1941, disagreement as to a wage contract between operators and the United Mine
                    Workers resulted in strikes that curtailed some production, demand was in no way so urgent that
                    after the settlement of differences production was insufficient to meet the 1941 requirements. When,
                    however, the renewal of the contract on April 1, 1943, became imminent, dissatisfaction because of
                    failure to include a portal-to-portal payment as time worked resulted in major strikes, which were
                    concluded by government seizure of the mines through a newly established bureau known as the Coal

            <p>By June, 1944, the difficulties that existed between mine operators and the United Mine Workers of
                    America had been concluded with respect to portal-to-portal back payment and the inclusion of a

                    various operator groups represented by their liaison agencies concluded the agreements by formal

            <p>Later, the portal-to-portal issue was declared a required payment and, subsequently, during the 1945
                    wage contract negotiations, was accepted as a basis for discussions. Failure to arrive at a new
                    contract before April 1, 1945, resulted in sporadic strikes, even in the face of a mutual agreement
                    to continue the old contract for thirty days. Some seizures resulted but not in the numbers reached
                    in 1943. The 1945 contract was finally signed and submitted to the National War Labor Board for

            <p>While this reduction in truck mine operation continued there was not a too-noticeable slump in the
                    total production because many of the truck mines became mechanized and engaged in large-scale
                    production. This, together with the lengthened work-week of the rail mine producers and the
                    increased efficiency resulting from the market demands, speeded up Indiana to the unusual high
                    production figures indicated before.</p>
            <p>The tremendous transportation load placed upon the railroad and trucking facilities of the nation was
                    met ably by companies engaged in those businesses. The Office of Defense Transportation, established
                    by Executive Order of the President,<hi rend="sup">12</hi> had as its responsibilities the continued
                    flow of vital military and civilian goods through the conservation and maintenance of the available
                    rail and. truck facilities. So far as Indiana coal producers were concerned, local defense
                    transportation offices worked in conjunction with the Coal Trade Association of Indiana and
                    representatives of the Bituminous Coal Producers Advisory Board for Indiana to the Office of Solid
                    Fuels Administration for War, to conserve equipment, to procure in the case of truck coal-hauding
                    equipment necessary tires and gasoline requirements for essential haulage, and, in the case of
                    railroad equipment, to secure the co-operation of railroads to have available necessary cars for
                    shipping the output of Indiana mines. Details of this phase of the industry's war problem

            <p>The greatly increased supplies of coal demanded by industrial consumers, particularly those that had
                    transferred to war activities, meant a large demand in the industrial-sized coals, ranging from a
                    maximum 2" top size to a minimum bottom size of 0. Fortunately, the crushing of large sizes
                    of double-screened coal was not required to any great extent <list type="footnotes">

                    because the general over-all increase in the larger sizes of coal demanded by the railroads resulted
                    in sufficient production of the industrial-sized coal through regular screening processes. Domestic
                    consumption of Indiana coal, while slightly increased, would not have been sufficient in the
                    double-screened sizes to have produced the necessary industrial-sized coals resulting from the
                    screening processes.</p>
            <p>Demands for supplies of Indiana coal made upon producers by industrial, railroad, and domestic
                    consumers were met with comparative ease from the period 1939 to the end of 1941. Programs of
                    maintaining stock piles carried on by various industries were enlarged to some extent in view of the
                    expected greater demand of coal. When that demand asserted itself, beginning with 1942, it became
                    necessary to urge domestic consumers to buy during the summer months rather than delaying purchase
                    of winter supplies to the actual burning season. Programs urging such domestic purchases were
                    carried on through radio, newspaper and trade publications, sponsored by retail dealers in the main
                    who were made aware of the necessity for domestic consumers engaging in such a program. Later,
                    following the establishment of the Solid Fuels Administration for War, a definite program of stock
                    piling for both domestic and industrial consumers was fostered, rules and regulations governing such
                    programs being issued by that office. Details of this program and other activities of the Solid
                    Fuels Administration for War will be dealt with separately later.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Other
                    agencies interested in fostering programs of the aforementioned type included the Bituminous Coal
                    Institute, an organization established by co-operative contributions of larger coal producers to
                    better the public's understanding of the coal industry, and the National Coal Association,
                    an organization active for more than a quarter of a century in the interest of coal-producing
                    companies in the <placeName>

                    by hints on proper firing, installation and maintenance of burning equipment.</p>

                    not be sold, expired in August, 1943, but provision had been made to carry on its intents and
                    purposes. With the establishment of the Solid Fuels Administration for War and the Coal Mines
                        Administration,<hi rend="sup">15</hi> the former continued more or less the activities carried
                    on during the existence of the Bituminous Coal Division under the Bituminous Coal Act of 1937, and
                    the latter was created for the purpose of serving as the administrative agency to operate the coal
                    mines if government seizure became necessary during the wage deadlock which started in April, 1943.
                    The Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, approved on January 30, 1942,<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
                    resulted in the establishment of the Office of Price Administration in which a Solid Fuels Price
                    Branch was created. This Solid Fuels Price Branch concerned itself with establishing the maximum
                    prices at which coals could be sold. Other government groups, such as the Office of Defense
                    Transportation and War Production Board<hi rend="sup">17</hi> also affected the industry. Each of

            <p>The policing of minimum prices was a major responsibility of the Bituminous Coal Division,

                    coal during the years 1941 and 1942. Then minimum prices no longer were the governing factor in the
                    market, but rather the supply of coal available. This transition may be described as "from
                    minimum prices to what the market would bear." This "what the market would
                    bear" phase became the concern of the Office of Price Administration, mentioned earlier.</p>
            <p>The Solid Fuels Administration for War was established on April 19, 1943, pursuant to the provisions
                    of Executive Order No. 9332. This agency was considered by the producers to be more or less a
                    provisional move to continue government control to almost the same degree as under the Bituminous
                    Coal Act. This act was scheduled to expire, April 26, 1943, but it was renewed for a period of
                    thirty days at one time and ninety days at another time. It eventually expired on August 23, 1943,
                    and the Solid Fuels Administration for War was announced, effective August 24, 1943, as continuing
                    certain activities and taking over personnel that had constituted the extinct Bituminous Coal
                        Division.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Solid Fuels Administration for War proceeded with the issuance of various orders and regulations
                    to assure continued flow of the produced coal to vital industries, as well as to the usual markets.
                    These orders were directed not only to the producers but to the retail dealers as well.
                    Concurrently, with such orders, committees to advise the Solid Fuels Administration for War were
                    established, among which was the Bituminous Coal Producers Advisory Board for each bituminous coal
                    producing district authorized on August 3, <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The District Advisory Board, as the Bituminous Coal Producers Advisory Board for Indiana was known,
                    also conducted surveys under the direction of the Solid Fuels Administration for War of the manpower
                    situation at Indiana mines. The purpose was to determine the effect of the Selective Service Act
                    upon the personnel at the mines. Earlier reference has been made to the results of these surveys.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Circulars indicating the results were issued to producers following the
                    completion of the surveys.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> These surveys resulted in some concerted action
                    being taken to secure special deferments for men in the twenty-two to twenty-five age bracket. The
                    executive committee of the District Advisory Board aided the Area Distribution Manager in reaching
                    decisions as to which of the special deferment applications filed by the producer should be
                    certified to the Solid Fuels Administration for War. The Solid Fuels Administration for War, in
                    turn, made its recommendations to the State Selective Service Director and he, in turn, to the local
                    Selective Service Board as to the individual mine employee whose deferment was being sought.</p>
            <p>When, early in 1945, withdrawals from mining personnel in the age group of eighteen to thirty were
                    impending up to seventy per cent of such personnel, representations to Selective Service resulted in
                    unequivocal deferments for such personnel because of essentiality to continued production of
                    vitally-needed coal.</p>
            <p>Shortages in domestic supplies of coal for Indiana homes became acute in January, 1945, due mainly to
                    curtailment in supplies of eastern-produced coal for such purposes, and the further fact that
                    Indiana domestic users of coal had failed to heed suggestions that they purchase Indiana-mined coal
                    to supplement their usual supplies.</p>

                    shipments by appeals to individual Indiana producers, some more workable plan needed creation. The

                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, upon suggestion by Indiana producers, had approved a proposed plan which had been

            <p>In order to create a domestically usable coal, it was agreed that railroad coal, usually prepared in
                    sizes ranging from a 6" top and a 1¼″ bottom should, in effect, be
                    shorted to the extent of fifteen per cent by screening out 4" top size and
                    1¼″ bottom size coal. The fifteen per cent thus "robbed"
                    from the railroad size would create the domestic emergency pool from which shipments to the needy
                    communities would be directed. In turn, the fifteen per cent thus taken from the railroad fuel was
                    to be replaced by mixing in a like amount of 1¼″ 0 coal into the regular
                    railroad coal shipments. The supply of screenings for this fifteen per cent mixture was to be
                    secured by limiting industrial consumers using this size of coal to shipments ten per cent less than
                    their January and February allowed tonnages, provided their storage piles had in excess of twenty
                    days' supply of coal. This plan was agreeable to all concerned, including the railroads
                    that would be involved in the shipment of the mixture of railroad coal consisting of the eighty-five
                    per cent of the size normally shipped and the fifteen per cent of screenings mixed therewith.</p>

                    Indiana communities, began to function on January 15. At the direction of the Board, it operated on
                    the principle that an emergency existed in any retail dealer's yard only if that yard was
                    without coal or had no coal en route to the yard. Requests from dealers were received <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Naturally, there was some animosity created by the rejection of certain emergency applications. The
                    committee, however, carried out the precepts established by the District Advisory Board as a basis
                    for its operation and refused any dealer the right to any emergency shipment who had a sufficient
                    stock of coal on ground or coal moving to his yard. It was not the intention of the committee under
                    any circumstances to "subsidize" increased business over that usually handled by
                    any one dealer through the allocation of emergency coal in a quantity which would suffice for such
                    purposes. All in all, the results achieved through the operations of the emergency coal pool created
                    by Indiana producers far overshadow the minor criticisms which have been leveled at the policies
                    adopted. The prevention of suffering in Indiana communities through a proper coal supply was
                    definitely accomplished.</p>
            <p>Indiana coal producers were affected also by the regulations of the Office of Price Administration.
                    Office of Price Administrator Leon Henderson on April 28, 1942, issued Maximum Price Regulation No.

            <p>The six-day work-week was instituted in Indiana early in 1943 in place of the five-day,
                    thirty-five-hour week which was previously in effect. This resulted in a representation to the
                    Office of Price Administration by a committee of Indiana producers of the need for increasing
                    maximum prices to allow for the additional labor and other costs that would be incurred. This
                    representation resulted in the issuance of Amendment No. 48 allowing certain increases in the prices
                    for coal produced in the State of Indiana.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the latter part of 1943, the Office of Price Administration appointed Bituminous Coal Producers

                    Price Administration, made representations for the need for further increasing maximum prices, based
                    upon the unusual producing costs incurred by hand-loading mines and those mines having to haul from
                    their preparation facilities to a railroad siding for rail shipment. This resulted in Amendment No.
                    73, effective November 29, 1943, and Amendment No. 76, effective December 16, 1943.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> These amendments permitted a twenty-cent increase over effective maximum prices for all
                    hand-loading mines or truck mines having to haul to a rail siding, and a five-cent per ton increase
                    for all other rail and truck mines. Another important feature of Amendment No. 76 was the fact that
                    the railroad fuel price level became the maximum at which lump and double-screened coal (classified
                    in <placeName>

                    below those established for locomotive fuel use.</p>
            <p>In an effort to reduce the number of price groups and to simplify the maximum price schedule, the
                    Industry Advisory Committee for Indiana collaborated upon such a simplified maximum price schedule,
                    resulting in Amendment No. 94, which became effective March 27, 1944.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> This

            <p>Special studies were conducted by the offices of the Industry Advisory Committee for Indiana to
                    warrant the continuance of the twenty-cent premium for hand-loading mines beyond the specified
                    expiration date of June 1, 1944. A temporary extension was made to August 1, 1944, to permit the
                    completion of a study which was being conducted to substantiate the claim that the twenty-cent
                    increase involved was entirely necessary to continue these hand-loading mines in the business of
                    producing coal. Later, when a consolidated maximum truck price schedule was issued, the
                    aforementioned differential was permanently established, effective August 5, 1944.<hi rend="sup">40</hi> Upon the conclusion of the 1945 wage negotiations in April of 1945, the committee again
                    cooperated with the Office of Price Administration offices to determine a proper increase in maximum
                    prices to offset increased costs resulting from the new contract. Effective May 1, 1945, the Office
                    of Price Administration issued Amendment No. 137 to Maximum Price Regulation No. 120 increasing the
                    prices in effect April 30 for coal from District No. 11 (Indiana) twenty cents per ton for
                    hand-loading mines and nine cents per ton for all other mechanized truck or rail mines. An
                    additional increase of four cents per ton on all maximum prices for Indiana coal was made effective
                    August 3, 1945, by Amendment No. 146. This came about through further conferences with the Office of
                    Price Administration and threatened action by congressional committees who were impressed with the
                    Office of Price Administration's failure to have allowed sufficient increases on May 1 to
                    offset actual increased costs of production.<hi rend="sup">41</hi>

            <p>The Industry Advisory Committee, with respect to new mines coming into operation, was required to
                    make recommendations to the Office of Price Administration as to the proper maximum prices that
                    should apply. This was done through the appointment of a Classification Committee of three
                    individuals whose findings were reported to the Industry Advisory Committee. If the findings were
                    approved, they were submitted to the Solid Fuels Price Branch of the Office of Price Administration

                    agreement resulted in the seizure of the mining properties by the newly-established Coal Mines
                    Administration under Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes. Actual seizure took place on May 1,
                    1943. On May 19, 1943, Secretary of the Interior Ickes, using Executive Order No. 9340 as authority,
                    issued rules and regulations for the operation of coal mines under government control. These were
                    amended and reissued and on July 29, 1943, the Coal Mines Administration was established.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> The order liquidating the Coal Mines Administration was issued by Secretary

                    during which interim some mines were returned to their owners from government possession. Following
                    October 12, when the remaining mines were returned, strikes again began breaking out in various
                    sections of the country, resulting in a reseizure of the mines by Secretary of the Interior Ickes on
                    November 1. Following November 7, strikes were in the majority discontinued during the working out
                    of details between operators and the United Mine Workers based upon the Ickes-Lewis agreement which
                    was approved by the National War Labor Board, and which included the portal-to-portal compensation
                    issue. As mentioned earlier, all mines were eventually returned to private ownership following the

                    following the precept of the Office of Civilian Defense for Indiana, also employed William J. Tipton
                    as Co-ordinator of Mines on a half-time basis, thus occupying the balance of his available time with
                    carrying out for rail mines the same liaison activities for which he had been engaged between truck
                    mine producers and the War Production Board offices at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>

                    </placeName>, by the Office of Civilian Defense of the State of Indiana. The Co-ordinator of Mines
                    succeeded in co-ordinating mine purchasing with manufacturing schedules and War Production Board
                    priorities to the benefit of the Indiana operators and their continued high rate of production.</p>
            <p>Knowledge of the critical competitive situation, which will be extant at the close of the war, has
                    forced Indiana producers, along with those in other producing areas in the country, to give serious
                    consideration to the requirements of the post-war era. Stepped-up production facilities which will
                    not be required, refinements in the consumer requirements because of a purchaser's rather
                    than a seller's market, and research and public relations programs carried on by
                    competitive fuels, are major factors bearing upon the period to come. As of the present writing four
                    steps have been taken by Indiana producers to anticipate the new competitive era: (1) contributions
                    to Bituminous Coal Research, Incorporated, (2) contributions to the Bituminous Coal Institute, (3)
                    the formation of the Indiana Coal Preparation and Utilization Society, and (4) the establishment of
                    Coal Laboratories, Inc., at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana.</p>
            <p>In the order of their listing, these organizations are concerned with research in the better
                    utilization of coal, the public relations aspect of the coal industry, co-ordination between the
                    consumers' requirements and the combustion engineering and preparation facilities made
                    available by Indiana coal producers to such consumers, and improvement in preparation of Indiana
                    coal, as well as the analytical services and chemical analyses necessary to the maintenance of coal
                    standards. As in the many years past, Indiana producers have continued to maintain and advance their
                    preparation facilities for the better utilization of their production by consumers. In keeping
                    abreast of developments through such channels in competitive fields, and in the possible application
                        <pb n="286" id="VAA4025-041-3-070"/> of refinement to their own product, Indiana producers will
                    continue to serve the thousands of their customers to the end that they secure the most energy
                    possible from Indiana-mined and prepared coal.</p>

            <p>The old Swiss inn of Vevay was seriously damaged by fire August 11, 1943. Five brick thick in parts,
                    the walls are still intact and the firemen assert as solid as ever. The roof was destroyed and some
                    of the interior badly gutted but not beyond repair. This left this historic old town, a mecca for
                    tourists, without a hotel—a serious condition.</p>
            <p>For a century the inn has been the social center of the community. It was established in 1833 by
                    Robert Le Clerc whose father, Pierre Louis Le Clerc, and mother came from <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>. Robert Le Clerc was assisted in this founding by his French-Swiss bride, daughter of
                    Monsieur and Madame Jean Morerod. The latter was a sister of the Dufour brothers who founded <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1802; Morerod was a soldier of Napoleon and fought at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Marengo</settlement>
                    </placeName>. After the death of her husband in 1856, Mrs. Julie Elise Le Clerc conducted the inn
                    until 1894, a year before her death. The original building was added to until it grew, like
                    "The Chambered Nautilus," into the present three-story brick building of forty or
                    more rooms.</p>
            <p>A clarion-voiced bell in the cupola regularly summoned boarders to meals and so regular was it that
                    the people set their timepieces by it. It was often borrowed, either with or without permission, to
                    assist at charivaris and Halloween pranks, but woe to the luckless wight who failed to return it in
                    time for its matutinal duties. The old bell rang out the old year and rang in the new; it tolled
                    defiance when Fort Sumter fell, sounded taps for Lincoln, and welcomed home the heroes of the Civil
                    War.</p>
            <p>The old register lists some nationally known names. Among them are Henry S. Lane, who helped to make
                    Lincoln President; Benjamin Harrison, then campaigning for governor; Daniel Voorhees, "tall
                    sycamore of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>"; "Blue Jeans" Williams, once governor of the state; William
                    H. Venable, historian and humorist; James Whitcomb Riley; and Thomas Marshall.</p>
            <p>For years the hospitality of the old inn was renowned. The place was known up and down the river as
                    "The House of Candles" for there was no night clerk, and the drummers arriving on
                    the night boats were accustomed to light themselves <pb n="288" id="VAA4025-041-3-072"/> to bed with
                    tapers left for that purpose on the desk in the "gentlemen's sitting
                    room." This custom offered a chance for free lodging to those inclined to abuse a trust by
                    an early, unostentatious flitting. No doubt many an errant lodger arose betimes and
                    "silently stole away."</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> newspapers often published reminiscences of the old-time traveling men appreciative of
                    the old Le Clerc House, its hospitality, candles, French cookery, and its presiding genius,
                    "Aunt Julie," as she was generally called. The spacious double parlors were a
                    social center over which Mrs. Le Clerc and her daughters dispensed a lavish hospitality. Every
                    evening the black hair chairs and sofas were filled with the elite of the town.</p>
            <p>The traditions of the inn have been carried on for the past fifteen years by the present owner, Mrs.
                    E. P. Downey, but she has now decided to retire. Thus this place, so long a friend to the public,
                    seems abandoned to the luckless fate of a filling station or some such deterioration unless a
                    champion arises to put it on its feet again as a hotel. "It takes a heap of livin'
                    to make a home" and surely this old house deserves that name and a chance to continue its
                    well-proven usefulness to <placeName>

                    most notable of these interesting homes is that of Dr. and Mrs. R. M. Copeland. Having been
                    collectors for years, they have added many antiques to those they inherited.</p>
            <p>Recently, they sold the large brick house on Main Street and purchased from Mrs. Adelaide Fairbanks
                    Causey an intriguing six-room bungalow on Market Street on the overhanging bank of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. This cottage was built almost one hundred years ago by Thomas Armstrong, one of the
                    most substantial pioneers prominent in social, civic, and political movements. He was one of the
                    first tavernkeepers of the place, and the house where he conducted the inn is still in good repair
                    which proves he excelled as a builder. He served <pb n="289" id="VAA4025-041-3-073"/> seven years as
                    the first county recorder, was one of the backers of the first bank in the county, and was a member
                    of the state legislature in 1850.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> It was at his house the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Committee met and nominated Henry Clay for President and Andrew Jackson for
                    Vice-President, and the county courts were also occasionally held here. Evidently, it was at the
                    tavern these meetings were held as the brick cottage was erected later.</p>
            <p>This house is four rooms and a hall wide and two rooms deep on the west side. The hall and the room
                    on each side have hardwood floors covered with Oriental, Indian, and braided rugs. Another room has
                    the original broad planks. The ceilings are twelve feet high and the woodwork, painted white, is the
                    lovely kind found only in fine old houses. Some of the walls are papered in exquisite old-fashioned
                    patterns, while others have the delicate, harmonious tints supplied by casein. A
                    grandfather's clock stands in the hall and also two priceless cherry tables—one
                    a Pembroke with rope legs and an end drawer, and the other a Jenny Lind, beaded pattern, which
                    belonged to Mrs. Copeland's grandmother. The latter table was sold out of the family but
                    after forty-five years was found and bought back. An old wooden <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> rocker extends hospitable arms; "Old Glory" is unfurled in a corner;
                    and the portrait of Mrs. Copeland's father, Dr. Lewis, a Union surgeon in the Civil War,
                    occupies a prominent place.</p>
            <p>The sitting-room is at the right of the hall. The tall wooden mantel first catches the eye with the
                    eight-day clock (a Birge-Gilbert &amp; Co., <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>

                    cherry table in the hall, was sold at a sale but returned to her father after thirty years'
                    exile. A Hamlet and Ophelia of Staffordshire ware share the honor of the mantel with other quaint
                    and priceless pieces of bric-a-brac.</p>

                    scattered about. There is also a little wooden rocker, inherited from the Doctor's family,
                    which has sturdily withstood many decades. All forms a picture worthy of a background for Godey
                    models. Curtains of Irish points are held back at the windows with quaint old metal pullbacks.</p>
            <p>A bedroom back of the sitting-room has a lovely four-poster cherry and maple corded bedstead and
                    large bureau with a small cherry dressing table and mirror. On the wall are family portraits and an
                    oval framed photograph of a graduating class from an <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Baptist seminary. Opening from this room is a small den which contains a tulip
                    patterned daybed, bed clothes chest, sewing basket, and easy chairs. A window overlooks the river
                    view and makes the room a most cozy and restful place. A narrow hall connects the modern bathroom
                    with the den and dining-room. Wooden peg hangers are along the wall, as well as in the front hall,
                    like those in the old Shaker houses in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

                    over" in pioneer days.</p>
            <p>The dining-room, largest apartment in the house, has a Dutch cherry china cupboard on matching chest
                    and is full of lovely glass, china, and silver. A dropleaf cherry table, a card table, and twin
                    cherry tables of unusual patterns are also here. An old silver castor, ladled soup tureen, brass
                    kettles, and innumerable other attractive articles are here and there. The surgical instrument case
                    of rosewood with brass inlay, which belonged to Mrs. Copeland's father, occupies a
                    prominent place. Off the dining-room is the kitchen, also modern, very dainty and colorful with
                    white enameled equipment and bright red trimmings and curtains.</p>
            <p>The guest room is at the left of the front entrance with its high mantel, fireplace, Seth Thomas
                    clock, and bric-a-brac— each with an interest all its own. A cherry corded bedstead of
                    unusual design is the center of attraction with low head and footboard and a brightly colored oak
                    leaf quilt. Two or three chests, a dressing table with a mirror, and a <pb n="291" id="VAA4025-041-3-075"/> pedestal table—all of cherry—occupy this room. An
                    old Paisley shawl of the most fascinating harmonious colors is draped over a cedar chest, and a
                    ladder-back rocker and other chairs are grouped about. There is even a conch shell doorstep. Antique
                    mirrors, Currier and Ives sketches, Godey and English prints, wall brackets galore, and articles
                    "too numerous to mention," as the schoolboy essay says, complete the picture of
                    this lovely home where most of the furniture are museum pieces.</p>
            <p>The back porch has a cement floor of richly colored blocks with a quaint old settee, "Mammy
                    rocker," and attractive seats that tempt one to sit down and feast on the lovely view. The
                    lawn at the rear leads in terraces to the river bottom, and a stately sycamore lifts its lofty top
                    at the corner of the house like a plume at the back of a hat. The front lawn Is enclosed by an iron
                    fence and there is an old-time foot-scraper at the gate. A short paved walk leads to the broad stone

                    each side of the door, the conventional pioneer architectural design. If the rear door happens to be

            <p>In the papers of Henry P. Thornton, an Indiana lawyer, which came to the Society last year as the
                    gift of his grandson, J. F. Thornton, are several printed and manuscript items concerning the
                    efforts of the veterans of the War of 1812 to obtain pensions for themselves and their families in
                    the decade from 1850 to 1860. Meetings, local, state, and national, were held agitating the subject;
                    resolutions were adopted and pressure was brought on Congress and other officials.</p>
            <p>At a meeting of citizens of central Indiana counties, held February 9, 1850, as described in a
                    newspaper clipping, Governor Wright spoke on the deeds of the frontier militia of 1812 and on the
                    right and need of the survivors and their families for aid. They, as well as the soldiers of the
                    Mexican War, should be remembered by a grateful country. The veterans passed resolutions stating
                    that the soldiers would require pledges of candidates for Congress and the legislature to use their
                    best efforts to secure a "grant from the National bounty."</p>
            <p>A national convention in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> in January, 1855, is reported in two other clippings. Here General Leslie Combs
                    delivered a stirring address on the deeds and sufferings of the soldiers of 1812 concluding,
                    "let us go before Congress now and ask for justice, not for charity, and if they refuse, we
                    will ‘meet them again at Phillippi.’ They shall hear our voices at the polls,
                    as loud as drums and trumpets, next election day, and in the Presidential campaign of
                    1856."</p>
            <p>April 6, 1857, the veterans of Lawrence County, Indiana, met in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bedford</settlement>
                    </placeName> and approved a memorial to Congress and appointed delegates to a state convention
                    called for June 18. Major Thornton was one of these delegates.</p>
            <p>Included in the material is a manuscript draft for a joint resolution of the Indiana legislature
                    urging passage by Congress of a bill on pensions.</p>

                    bickering, here too resolutions were adopted, for, said one of the speakers, to many the
                    government's tardy <pb n="293" id="VAA4025-041-3-077"/> grant of land had come too late, in

            <p>[Editor's Note—Our average reader may question the propriety of printing these
                    two little gems in a historical magazine, though surely no one would question the desirability of
                    having them in print. It seems, however, that history has come to be a very inclusive study, and
                    that there are those who believe that intellectual history is the very heart of all history. If this
                    is even approximately true, one need not explain the appearance of these items here.</p>
            <p>The experience of many an American in the British Isles during the present war may build a foundation
                    of friendship which will make impossible in the future the prejudice with which so many Americans
                    have regarded our English brethren in the past. A young man like Larry McFaddin cannot be influenced
                    by the cheap political practice of twisting the British Lion's tail as preceding
                    generations of Americans have been influenced. These delightful week-ends will long be remembered.
                    The kindness with which our boys have been treated can never be forgotten. May we not hope that a
                    tradition is being developed like that between the <placeName>

                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> which will make war between the <placeName>

                        attempt to title the past week. Regardless, it shall always be a memorable seven
                        days—a week of wonderful enjoyment and disassociation from the countless things that
                        make life seem complicated, in spite of their relative unimportance.</p>
                    <p>Monday, John Meloney and I were in <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                        </placeName>, completely equipped for our trip to the North. We were to meet Fraser Stokes and
                        Don Dunbar later in the day. The day beginning our furloughs had arrived <pb n="295" id="VAA4025-041-3-079"/> suddenly, for it had been a furlough unexpected (but none the less
                        appreciated!) We had been warned numerous times by rugged Scotchmen of treacherous bogs in the
                        moors, blinding mists in the mountains, and dangerous ledges, and especially of the cold there
                        in <placeName>
                            <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                        </placeName>—all of the warnings only made the anticipation greater, and we sincerely
                        hoped we might scare up a ghost or two in an old castle!</p>
                    <p>I spent a short time with Hugh that morning and learned that he was planning a trip to Edinburg
                        later in the week. John and I then went to St. Jame's Palace to meet "Sir
                        Norman," (a title which he used only when formality necessitated it—he
                        preferred "Speedy"). We had a wonderful dinner at the
                        "Trocadero," just off Piccadilly Circus. He's a good
                        fellow—a nice sense of humor and a person who has had a great number of interesting
                        experiences all over the world. We spent several amusing minutes standing on the Circus (an
                        appropos name!) and watching the people, who never stopped passing by.</p>
                    <p>A couple of hours later we met Fraser and Don at the station and fortunately, got seats on the
                        train. The only part of the night I remember is, at each awakening, finding myself in a
                        different position, each more impossible than the previous. I had visions of never standing up
                        again! By morning we were well into <placeName>
                            <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                        </placeName>, for we had passed through Perth quite early. The Scots swear that the air is purer
                        right over the border, and somehow it did seem different. It was a beautiful
                        day—perhaps that alone accounted for the difference.</p>
                    <p>The country was already becoming pretty rugged, altho the real highlands were much farther north.
                        Already I could feel the barrenness of them, for from a distance they appear quite bald. We were
                        too late for the real autumn season—the heather had turned brown by frost and rain,
                        but there was a sober loveliness in the hills that somehow almost equaled the vivid colors of
                        early fall. The birch trees, which were sparce, however, were bright yellow, and the spruce, of
                        course, retained their year-round dark green. The hues here on th hills were very much
                        alive—the large ferns had turned a dark rust. We still were traveling on the Dee side
                        of the mountains.</p>
                    <p>We changed trains at <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Aviemore</settlement>
                        </placeName>, and in a few minutes were in Boat of Garten, the village of our destination.
                        It's a funny little town of two or three streets and very plain, but secure, looking
                        houses. Years ago, so the good folk said, there was a boat which made the crossing of the Spey
                        on which the town is located. Progress, however, caught up, and a bridge was built. The name
                        remained the same. Incidentally, we never discovered the bridge, and the river is much too
                        narrow to warrant much more than a canoe. We stopped at Mac-Donald's grocery to find
                        the way to Lynchurn, the home of Mrs. Grant, where we were to stay. The farm is half an
                        hour's walk from town past a little mill pond and a bakery. We had learned of Lynchurn
                        through Lady Ross and her daughter in <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                        </placeName>, for they often spent their vacations there.</p>
                    <p>The four of us stopped at a farm on the way, and apparently frightened the good farmer's
                        wife, for she disappeared and returned with husband, offspring, and Granny. In wonderful Scotch
                        brogue, Granny told us how to reach Mrs. Grant's. Our reception along the <pb n="296" id="VAA4025-041-3-080"/> road was mostly that of barking dogs, disinterested cows, and
                        friendly, but suspicious, glances from the people.</p>
                    <p>The farm house is way up on a hill—a beautiful spot. The river Spey runs through the
                        valley just below it, and for miles around you can see the ranges of the Cam Gorm [Cairngorm]
                        mountains. Mrs. Grant was at the door to meet us—such a wonderful little
                        person— friendly and amusing, a delightful small caricature: gracious with the gift
                        of real sincerity. She showed us first our sitting room—a nice comfortable room with
                        a wonderful fire in the hearth. Already I had fallen in love with the place. Our rooms upstairs
                        were lovely—two tremendously large rooms and one small one at the front of the house.
                        It seemed the windows only framed the view to the front. The tile washstands were classic, and
                        very lovely. However, I'll take my water hot! Which, by the way, I did; for we had our
                        own bath.</p>
                    <p>And speaking of this very essential room, I think the bathtub deserves special mention. It was
                        the biggest one I've ever seen—terrifically deep (speaking in relative
                        terms, of course!) and long enough to lie completely flat. Really a wonderful idea! Too bad most
                        of us are space-savers. And speaking again of essentials, the "W C" was
                        without doubt the coldest object upon which I have ever rested. There was no central heating,
                        and my teeth played a beautiful stacatto.</p>
                    <p>When we went down there were milk and gingerbread waiting for us—real
                        milk—that wonderful cow! It was the first glass I had drunk since leaving the States.
                        Soon afterward we had dinner—scotch broth, fried chicken, brussel sprouts, carrots,
                        two pitchers of milk—and hot gingerbread with cream so thick you had to help it along
                        with a spoon. That alone looked like paradise to us, and it was only the beginning. Fresh eggs
                        (I hadn't seen one for weeks!), lamb chops, steak, roast duck, more chicken, hot
                        deserts—all in our own dining room. Perhaps you can better understand our deep
                        affection for Lynchurn!</p>
                    <p>The first afternoon there, we dozed around the fire, had a delicious tea at 4:00 and dinner at
                        8:00 (by kerosene lantern!) Then we sat around the fire and talked for several hours. It was a
                        wonderful feeling of being completely away and yet closer to the things I consider priceless
                        than I had felt for weeks. We talked of home, of course, and for a few too short days Lynchurn
                        almost became home.</p>
                    <p>Wednesday morning we got up early, had a wonderful breakfast, and started out for Mt. Cam Gorm,
                        several miles away. In Aviemore we met a Mr. Mackay, who possessed the village taxi, and he
                        drove us to the hunting lodge at the foot of the mountain. The lodge itself is on Loch Morlich,
                        a lovely lake right up the mountains. From there we took the path along the stream which
                        followed a narrow ravine up the rise. The heather was thick there, and in some patches was still
                        bright purple. The climb itself after reaching a certain level becomes uninteresting unless you
                        look—stop every short while to look back. The view is beautiful—much too
                        lovely for my description. Far up on the peak we could see the snow and clouds which made the
                        top invisible. During the entire climb, as we looked back we could see a rainbow, which seemed
                        to begin in the loch and end at the foot of the mountain facing Cam Gorm. And yet, as we
                        watched, we could see it move slowly—it seemed to follow us up the mountain side. Far
                            <pb n="297" id="VAA4025-041-3-081"/> below were the lodge and the loch—the black
                        aberdeen-angus cows appeared as small dots. Intermittently we got a little of the rain from the
                        storm we could see on a distant range. There the peaks were far more rugged and looked ugly and
                        dark.</p>
                    <p>A short distance from the top we stopped and looked at a curious formation of weathered stones.
                        The air was cold and the wind almost strong enough to knock one over. Apparently I had overrated
                        myself as a mountain climber—our pace had been swift, and I was completely winded.
                        The other three went ahead, and I liked the sensation of being alone there. It was that
                        wonderful sense of freedom and. complete, yet perhaps momentary, independence and at the same
                        time the feeing of utter insignificance. I ran several hundred yards down the slope to the pile
                        of stones. The wind was blowing so strongly that I could scarcely hear myself shout. I tried to
                        eat my lunch there, but my hands became numb. The sun on the levels below looked much better.</p>
                    <p>I went down a different way, disregarding the path and the stone trail markers. On one level were
                        dozens of clear springs on the mountain. The beds were of small quartz stones, and the water
                        clearer than I've ever seen. Strange how natural a thing water becomes; yet the water
                        [in] those springs actually tasted better than I've ever known. Farther down the slope,
                        I stopped at the loveliest spot there. The entire slope is covered with thick heather and ferns.
                        Directly below me, several hundred feet, was the stream we had followed. It was a wonderful
                        spot—the peak, no longer visible and no longer inviting, behind; the valley below;
                        and the mountains all around. I fell asleep on the heather a short time and was awakened by a
                        "pack" of congenial dogs followed by an elderly man. Farther down the trail
                        were another fellow and a horse. They were going up to bring down the two deer they had shot the
                        previous night.</p>
                    <p>It was an unforgettable day, and the beds at <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Lynchurn</settlement>
                        </placeName> seemed even softer.</p>
                    <p>Thursday Don left for Dufftown in search of some relatives. That morning we hiked along the Spey
                        and in the evening went up into the hills behind the farm to watch the sunset. The hills were
                        lighted up beautifully, and in an instant, when the sun disappeared behind the mountains in the
                        back, became dark and indiscernible. The clouds for several moments were lovely—and
                        suddenly dark and chilling.</p>
                    <p>The next day was rainy, in standard Scottish fashion, and we spent a lazy day inside, sleeping
                        and eating—in general doing a beautiful job of doing nothing.</p>
                    <p>Saturday we traveled up to Inverness, primarily to see a Mrs. Gooch, the grandmother of a Mary
                        Grant, whom we have known for some time. What a wonderful person she is—young to be a
                        grandmother. She's head of the Women's Volunteer Service in northern <placeName>
                            <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                        </placeName> and has recently flown back from the Shetlands on a governmental survey. Such an
                        active little person, drives with great enthusiasm, and doesn't miss a trick. She took
                        us to lunch and drove us out to her present home, Castle Hill House. First we drove up Moray
                        Firth towards the sea. We stopped at <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Culloden Moor</settlement>
                        </placeName>, the famous battle ground of Prince Charlie and some dozen Scottish clans.

                        this spot, high above Inverness. Apparently the Grant clan played a smart game and watched the
                        battle closely before choosing sides. And from the grave markers were quite successful.
                        Apparently the Macintoshes were extremely vulnerable! Incidentally, Prince Charlie slept in
                        Castle Hill House the night before the battle. That was in the 1770's.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
               </p>
                    <p>At Castle Hill we met Mary's great-grandmother, who is 96 years old. She is truly a
                        remarkable person. I sometimes feel my mind is less alert than hers is now. She was determined
                        to learn our names and homes, for she expects us to pay a visit again. She told me how clearly
                        she remembered seeing the troops leave Edinburg Castle for the Crimean war, in 1850's.
                        We also met Mrs. Gooch's sister and a charming Miss Ellis. I've never seen
                        such vitality in a woman her age—she had just been stag hunting the day before. We
                        had tea with them in their lovely old home and then Mrs. Gooch drove us to our train. Her
                        son-in-law is the Grant who owns such great tracts of land and several homes in Inverness Shire.</p>
                    <p>One doesn't have the opportunity to meet people like these often. My contacts here have
                        been so wonderful, [I] shall never forget them. One can't easily forget the cordiality
                        and friendliness we've received here in <placeName>
                            <country reg="enk">England</country>
                        </placeName> and <placeName>
                            <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                        </placeName>. I particularly like the Scotch people—the way they laugh, their
                        frankness and complete friendliness.</p>
                    <p>Sunday morning we hiked through the pine forests behind the farm. We walked through them just as
                        the sun started slanting in. It was so lovely, it seemed almost a sacrilege to make any kind of
                        noise. The ground was covered with thick moss growing through the years' carpet of pine
                        needles. That afternoon we left—for all good things must end, and spent the night in
                        Perth.</p>
                    <p>We arrived in <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Edinburg</settlement>
                        </placeName> Monday morning and had made arrangements to leave on the night train to <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                        </placeName>. John left in search of a friend, and Fraser and I first walked up to Edinburg
                        Castle. It was a good climb, for the massive castle is located on a steep hill, approachable
                        from one direction, with three sheer bluffs on the other sides. The history of the castle is
                        quite interesting, and, of course, I know but a sketch. The first parts are over nine centuries
                        old; yet the castle, through the strife of <placeName>
                            <country reg="enk">England</country>
                        </placeName> and <placeName>
                            <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                        </placeName>, has been sieged and sacked, and each time rebuilt. The entrance is through the
                        courtyard in front—on which square public executions took place and witches were
                        burned at the stake hundreds of years ago. Then across the old moat and up the winding stairs to
                        the top. From here one can get a truly beautiful view of Edinburg, a city of spires and shrines.
                        At the highest part of the castle stands the tiny chapel built by St. Margaret, Queen, in the
                        11th century. Under the altar lie her remains—she died upon hearing of the death of
                        her husband and son. By far the most interesting to me was a small plot of ground jutting out
                        rather precariously from the castle side. Here is the "Soldier's <list type="footnotes">

                        Memorial within the castle is a beautiful shrine. The coats of arms are so vivid and bright, the
                        atmosphere so light and reverent.</p>
                    <p>From the castle we walked along the famous "High" to Calton Hill, on which
                        stand Nelson's Tower, the Observatory, and the Scots-mans' Disgrace."
                        (A building begun modelled after Athen's Parthenon and discontinued through lack of
                        funds.) On the way we stopped at an old cemetery where are buried many of <placeName>
                            <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                        </placeName>'s illustrious. At the foot of a rather ostentatious tomb, I saw a small
                        white stone, carved in the shape of a heart. On it were inscribed the words: "Here lies
                        sweet <placeName>
                            <region type="county">Marion</region>
                        </placeName>, asleep." I remember it above all the others; yet who <placeName>
                            <region type="county">Marion</region>
                        </placeName> was, to whom death came so soon, I shall never know.</p>
                    <p>From there we walked to the Royal Palace of Holyroodhouse, the palace in <placeName>
                            <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                        </placeName> for the royal family, who, by the way, had been there a fortnight previously.
                        According to legend, it was built in recognition of luck while hunting during the days of
                        Arthur. We walked through Mary Queen of Scots audience chambers, bedroom, and dressing rooms.
                        Mary's bed, one of the few remaining pieces of furniture, looked terribly
                        uncomfortable! As did her husband's, Lord Darnley. (Modern psychologists say this
                        two-bedroom business definitely leads to marital dischord!)</p>
                    <p>The remains of the royal chapel are quite impressive and very lovely. They are of <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Norman</settlement>
                        </placeName> architecture of the 12th century. The roof is no longer there, for it disappeared
                        when Cromwell burned the palace. However, ancient stone lattice work is still standing. The
                        floor is nothing but tomb markers. On the floor also were several stone caskets, and for the
                        first time, I knew what tomb, stone-cold, meant.</p>
                    <p>After leaving the castle we walked up some funny little side streets and stopped in a Scotch
                        Tartan shop to look at some plaids. Apparently the McFaddin clan set up permanent residence in <placeName>
                            <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                        </placeName>, for none seem to exist in northern <placeName>

                        In any case, "our" plaid is very colorful. I still can't visualize
                        myself in a kilt, although I saw dozens of them. Fraser and I met John for tea. Could it be that
                        I'm becoming a synthetic Britisher, demanding my tea at 4:00, pouring the milk first
                        and feeling indignant if the milk isn't hot?</p>
                    <p>Later, we met Don and boarded the train for rainy <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                        </placeName>. Yes, a good week. A nice week to remember. …</p>
                    <p rend="center">ST. IVES</p>
                    <p>"As I was going to S. Ives …," I met no polygomist, but rather a
                        number of people who must have known the charms of Cornwall which I was to discover. The night
                        train was slow, but time was not important then, for I had eight days ahead—eight
                        days which were completely mine. My first glimpse of the sea came when we entered <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                        </placeName>, the city which, a year prevíously, had seen hundreds of ships leaving
                        for the invasion of the continent. It was early and grey and cold, and the water of the channel
                        wasn't any color. A few hours later we reached St. Erth, a small Cornish inland
                        village, just west of the pirate's playground of Penzance. There I caught a wonderful
                        little <pb n="300" id="VAA4025-041-3-084"/> two car train, bound for the coast … a
                        little two car train with a holiday whistle.</p>
                    <p>In ten minutes, St. Ives was in view, a toy village on a peninsula stretching out into the sea.
                        The Gulf Stream is blue, but St. Ive's Bay was bluer that day. Blue, and sunny, and
                        beautiful. Pedn Olva, our hotel, was just a short walk from the small station. I had hoped that
                        it would be near the water; that perhaps we could get a glimpse of the sea from there. I never
                        expected a lovely place, built right in the rocks—the foundation of which was washed
                        by the tides. Yet, there it was, facing the sea, on the sea. I had a late breakfast in the
                        lounge; yet as hungry as I was, I sat and looked out the bay window at the water, and the beach
                        below. The sun was out, and the boats were sailing—and <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                        </placeName> seemed a million miles away.</p>
                    <p>Bill had arrived earlier that morning and was already somewhere below, on the rocks, sunning
                        himself. Our room overlooked the harbor. Beyond 'St. Ives we could see the Atlantic,
                        and straight down were rocks and the sea. Three miles out in the bay was the lighthouse on a
                        small island. I stood by the window and looked, knowing there could be no other place the same.
                        Then I climbed down to the beach to look for Willy … it was difficult to walk, when I
                        wanted to run. The sand was soft and fine, and the tide was beginning to come in, each wave
                        reaching a little farther up the beach.</p>
                    <p>Our table in the dining room was in a small bay window, overlooking the garden in the back of the
                        hotel. Beyond the garden and below were the beach and the water. Flowers on the table, a pitcher
                        of ice-water (Londoners never drink water!) and excellent meals, usually topped with fresh
                        strawberries and cream. The view alone was worth the sitting there, but the food made it even
                        more attractive. After coffee in the lounge that first day, we embarked upon a week of contented
                        laziness, which, unfortunately, didn't end with the expiration date of my furlough
                        papers. The entire afternoon we sat on the beach, wondering if our good luck in finding this
                        spot were true. Unknowingly (undoubtedly stimulated by the sea air) I went dashing down the hot
                        sand into the water. I emerged, dripping, and a ghastly shade of blue. Never have I been in such
                        freezing water. The effect was even more colorful the next day when I blossomed forth a
                        brilliant lobster red.</p>
                    <p>Tea was each afternoon at 4:00—how delightful it was to sit on the terrace and think
                        of nothing except how delightful it was! I longed for some color film to capture the scenes
                        which can never be written on paper. The small garden is enclosed by immense lilac bushes and
                        flowers grow up and down the rocks and walls of the terrace. The boats in the harbor were blue,
                        and red, green and orange—wonderfully happy looking.</p>
                    <p>Early each morning after breakfast we would wander down the hill to the wharf. Narrow, little
                        streets with gay little houses—white ones, blue, yellow, and green. From a distance,
                        St. Ives looked strangely colorless in contrast with the sea. Yet in the streets was the
                        color—yards full of roses, brightly colored doors with polished knockers. And in the
                        grey, drab streets were colorful children. There were no plain children there, for they all
                        seemed to have curly hair, and blue eyes—and inquisitive faces. How strange it is
                        that these children will mature <pb n="301" id="VAA4025-041-3-085"/> into the plain old women
                        who sit on the waterfront and knit vests, and men who fish at night and sleep through the days.</p>
                    <p>Each morning we would stop on the wharf to watch the fishermen bring in the night's
                        catch. The tide was out at that time of day, and a little one-horse cart brought the fish to the
                        dock from the boats, lying absurdly awkward in the sand. St. Ives was more alive in early
                        morning than any other time. The fish, skates, crabs, and lobsters, after being weighted were
                        sold there on the wharf to the highest bidder. Housewives seemed to be in the majority, but the
                        lobsters were carried away by the owners of the littled cafes that lined the waterfront. After
                        the auction, only the cats seemed to remain feasting on fish heads—the fishermen went
                        off to bed, and the wives took the day's food home.</p>
                    <p>"… each wife had seven bags; each bag had seven cats; each cat had seven
                        kittens." I'm sure that those cats have been reproducing prodifiously ever
                        since that Cornish verse was first composed. Hundreds of cats—in the windows in the
                        doors, in the shops, in the boats—everywhere cats. They all seemed quite well pleased
                        with themselves and their stations in life. Even the dogs in St. Ives appeared to enjoy
                        themselves more than dogs anywhere else. Centuries ago they must have tired of chasing cats. A
                        nondescript pack of them played each morning on the beach, charging the waves and kicking up the
                        sand.</p>
                    <p>In addition to being a fishing village, St. Ives is an artists' colony. In almost every
                        street were artists, sitting and painting scenes which were offered no where else in <placeName>
                            <country reg="enk">England</country>
                        </placeName>. The second day we came across an elderly painter, quite at home sitting in a
                        rowboat painting a harbor scene. The shops were full of watercolors, and oils, lovely and
                        expensive. During our week in the village, we visited, I think, every gallery there.</p>
                    <p>At ten o'clock each morning, we could be found at the Shore Cafe, drinking hot chocolate
                        and eating ice-cream. After two or three days it became a ritual, and at the stroke of ten,
                        we'd head for the little room upstairs, over looking the bay. After lunch each day we
                        sprawled- in the sun, a glorious English sun which, for the first, time, warmed me completely.
                        The days, which went so quickly, were difficult to distinguish one from [the] other. However,
                        though their patterns were almost identical, their designs were quite different. Each part of
                        each day there was something new to see, and, if not different, to be enjoyed again.</p>
                    <p>On the wharf in St. Ives is a magnificent pub. Countless are the "King's
                        Arms," "Dog and Badgers," "Running Horses,"
                        "Duke's Head," "Little White Harts," and
                        "Red Lions"—but there is only one "The Sloop,"
                        and it is in St. Ives. The ceilings slant, as in a ship's cabin—closing time
                        is the ringing of a ships bell. Great oceans of mild and bitters flowed each night there, where
                        gathered the town's illustrious. Adorning the walls of the largest room in the pub, are
                        caricatures of the best known people in the village. What fun it was to sit there, with a glass
                        of ale, and spot the people whose pictures were on the walls; the whiskered old fisherman, the
                        bartender, the village fish dealer, the funny old woman who sat and screamed"
                        'ello mi love," at each newcomer.</p>
                    <p>Centuries ago, an Irish saint by the name of Ives, sailed from the Emerald Isle on a shamrock. He
                        landed on this tip of Cornwall and <pb n="302" id="VAA4025-041-3-086"/> built a chapel on the
                        highest hill there. This building, reconstructed some years ago, still stands, viewing the town
                        and the ocean. The hill on which it stands is called "The Island." A long time
                        ago the sea washed over a part of the peninsula and isolated the hill—perhaps
                        believing that in some future time the sea again will do the same, the people have never stopped
                        referring to this piece of land as "The island." From the top can be seen the
                        Atlantic Ocean, St. Ives Bay, and the Irish Sea. Miles of ocean—blue sea, and rocks,
                        and white foam … hilly St. Ives and Carbis Bay, leading to rhodedendron covered hills
                        behind.</p>
                    <p>After lying contentedly in the sun for several hours after lunch, we would climb back up to the
                        hotel for tea at four o'clock. This tea was usually augmented by another one at
                        "The Copper Kettle" at four thirty—toasted scones, and bisquits,
                        and jam. By early evening, the tide was well in, and the boats began to prepare for the
                        night's fishing. All this we watched from the small tea room, which also faced the
                        harbor. Then back up the narrow hilly street we'd go to Pedn Olva, dinner, and watching
                        the sunset from the terrace.</p>
                    <p>We didn't do much—there wasn't time to take the side trips to
                        Land's End and Penzance as we had originally planned. A week was much too short a time
                        to be in paradise. Seven days were much too brief to hear enough of the waves at night, or see
                        the boats sailing out with high tide and moonlight. Early in the morning, even before the gulls
                        started screaming for day, I would sit up in bed and see the fishing boats returning. There
                        weren't enough hours to feed the gulls, and watch them swoop down to catch bits of
                        bread tossed in the air. Now, as I look out of the window and see the Rhine, Cornwall and St.
                        Ives seem even farther away, more as if I remember them from an early imagination and not from
                        having been there. Perhaps it was a continental fascination, a likeness to the Riviera which
                        people claim exists, that made it so attractive. That I can't say. I only know it was
                        different from the rest of <placeName>

                        </placeName> I knew. I feel as if it will retain an individuality which can belong to no other
                        place. Sometime I'll go back just to know it's still there and the same, as it
                        has always been. …</p>

            <p>"This scholarly and elaborate bibliography appears at a time when it may be said that the
                    Lincoln subject as an intellectual interest has come of age." These words from the foreword
                    written by J. G. Randall, Lincoln scholar and professor at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, rightly evaluate these volumes. The development of the great Lincoln collections of
                    books and pamphlets and the rules which the collectors have adopted are discussed by the compiler in
                    the introduction.</p>
            <p>The bibliography includes books and pamphlets, but not magazines or newspapers. If the magazine as a
                    whole or a special issue is devoted to Lincoln, it is included. Magazine articles are not listed,
                    unless reprinted as separate pamphlets. Titles have been arranged chronologically, and
                    alphabetically under each year. There is one exception and this is somewhat difficult to appreciate.
                    Later editions follow the original entry and thus do not appear under the year of their publication.
                    More than one-fourth of the entries under 1863 were not published in that year but in later years as
                    recent as 1936.</p>
            <p>Much interesting information may be acquired from these volumes. Some six hundred publications about
                    or by Lincoln appeared before 1865, and in the year of his death 563 are listed, quite a number
                    being sermons preached following his death. Interest in Lincoln must have declined very quickly and
                    sharply for only three items are given in 1869 and only one in 1871. In the 1890's and
                    early 1900's interest revived and in the centennial year of his birth 258 separate
                    publications are noticed. Approximately a half hundred entries are included in each succeeding year.
                    The peak was reached in the years 1927-1930 when over eighty are found each year. In a separate list
                    over two hundred foreign publications are given.</p>
            <p>A very noticeable point is the very small number of contributions by scientifically trained
                    historians. Very few of the professors of history in our colleges and universities have contributed
                    this type of Lincoln literature. The authors who occupy the most space in the index, which is only a
                    rough measure of output, are Emanuel Hertz, William E. Barton, Louis A. Warren, and Paul M. Angle.
                    The earlier Lincoln authorities have many fewer titles. Perhaps the inclusion of articles in learned
                    society periodicals would bring in more of the work of university men, but the fact remains that
                    there is no other field in American history which they have so consistently avoided. Perhaps the
                    appearance of this work may serve to enlist their labor.</p>
            <p>The chief significance of this work, however, is as a guide to Lincoln literature, a guide for all
                    types of persons interested in Lincoln. The <placeName>

            <p>This little volume is pre-eminently a fine book. Its design and typography are due to Norman W.
                    Forgue, the hand decorated paper employed for binding was made by R. Hunter Middleton, the typefaces
                    used are Linotype Baskerville and Monotype Ultra Bodoni, and the edition was printed at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Norman</settlement>
                    </placeName> Press on Cortlea ivory paper. The number of copies was limited to 500, apparently,
                    designed particularly for Lincoln collectors. It is a beautiful production, and each copy is
                    enclosed in a protective slip-case.</p>
            <p>Carl Sandburg in his brief foreword declares the book "has history and mystery."
                    Bullard in his prefatory notes does not attempt to identify the "Public Man," but
                    does tell us quite a little about the <hi rend="i">North American Review</hi>, in which the
                    "Diary" first appeared, and about its editor, Allen Thorndike Rice, who refused to
                    reveal the author. Facts about the period covered by the diary and about prominent men are given.
                    Nine letters of Edwin M. Stanton to James Buchanan written between March 14, and July 26, 1861, are
                    included. They contain very pessimistic predictions about the Lincoln administration and items that
                    would "cheer or gratify" the former President. Like the "Diary,"
                    they had been published in the <hi rend="i">North American Review.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole procedure leaves one feeling as though he were all dressed up with no place to go. We do
                    not learn the identity of the author or to what extent the contents are trustworthy. In fact,
                    historians need to be warned that a fairly good case can be presented for forgery. One will not,
                    however, be harsh with anyone for not producing the name of the diarist, indeed, Mr. Bullard
                    suggests "if this ‘Diary’ is in fact a fake, it has full right to be
                    pronounced an—almost—perfect crime." Perhaps the volume was intended
                    to stimulate the search for the missing author, or to induce Professor Frank Maloy Anderson to
                    publish the result of his study. It was unfortunate his findings could not have been included.</p>
            <p>The "Diary" is "a series of extracts" supposedly written between
                    December 28, 1860, and March 15, 1861. It contains very interesting and provocative stories, gossip,
                    and incidents, which presumably passed through <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> political circles just before the outbreak of the Civil War. There is just enough to
                    whet the appetite, and to give one a vivid idea of the perplexing problems which confronted Lincoln
                    as he came into the presidency.</p>
            <p>The solution of the mystery, the identity of the author, can become a lifetime passion or a side
                    issue for Lincoln collectors, college professors, or anyone intrigued by the search for truth.</p>

                    93. $3.50)</head>
            <p>Nellie Waldenmaier is first and foremost a genealogist, and as <pb n="305" id="VAA4025-041-3-089"/>such her approach to a discussion of oaths of allegiance to the infant revolutionary state colors
                    the materials with which she has dealt. She has not distorted anything she has used, nor has she
                    misrepresented anything. Her introduction and text, however, are too summary and too disjointed to
                    be very useful to the historian. Her work is little more than a brief survey of the various oaths
                    (not only to the United States, but to various offices as well of which certain men were then the
                    incumbents) taken in the three years prior to 1779.</p>
            <p>Fifteen pages are devoted to explanation; the remainder of the book is a list of signers of oaths.
                    The lists are compiled from the originals in the National Archives and the Library of Congress. The
                    compiler's chief interest seems to be in providing a list of men hereby proved to have participated
                    in the American Revolution. She has included some interesting facsimiles of various types of oaths.
                    As a handbook of signers it is very useful; as a historical study of the oaths and their background
                    it falls short of the ideal.</p>
            <p>It is the genealogist primarily, not the historian, who presided over the compiling and writing of
                    this book. Her enthusiasms sometimes overreach themselves: "The usefulness of the material
                    in these oaths in genealogical research far exceeds the bare fact that a given individual
                    ‘took and subscribed’ the oath on a certain day. The existence of a man's name
                    in this roster of patriots in indisputable evidence that he was a person trusted by the Continental
                    Congress."</p>
            <p>The author, too, has a tendency to see nothing but high resolve and noble purpose in the actions of
                    the men of the American Revolution. In her mind they <hi rend="i">all</hi> took oaths because of
                    idealism and not to ensure holding a post. To her "They are unequivocal endorsement of the
                    action of the fifty-six men who signed the Declaration of Independence and for that, if for no other
                    reason, they are deserving of our most respectful attention." Sidney George Fisher, to
                    mention but one of many, would undoubtedly take exception to this viewpoint. The inclusion of the
                    name of Benedict Arnold, as an early signer of the oaths now reposing in the National Archives,
                    seems to shatter Nellie Waldenmaier's thesis at the outset.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Coimate of Indiana.</hi> By Stephen Sargent Visher. (Indiana University, Bloomington,
                    Indiana, c. 1944, pp. 511. $4.00)</head>
            <p>Encyclopedia of Indiana Climate might have been the title given to this volume, for it is very
                    inclusive. It treats not only the major topics, but it analyzes them into their more minute parts
                    and describes these small subjects. For instance under precipitation the following divisions receive
                    attention: seasonal, monthly average, weekly average, daily, and hourly precipitation. Under climate
                    there is a chapter describing the "Climate of Seven Legal Holidays." Large amounts
                    of statistical data are included. Scattered through the five hundred pages are 486 maps and charts
                    and 81 tables. Consequently, it is quite likely that it will be used as a reference book rather than
                    as general reading. In many parts it is very interesting, in others somewhat heavy and dull.</p>
            <p>The work begins with a summary, followed by four chapters on <pb n="306" id="VAA4025-041-3-090"/>
                    temperature; five on precipitation; one each on floods, humidity, and sunshine and clouds; three on
                    storms; one each on seasons, weather types, holiday climates, and climatic changes; four on
                    relations of climate and physiography, crop yields, and health; and finally, three chapters which
                    treat the climate of the subregions and cities of the state.</p>
            <p>Quite a little of the book uses the threefold division of the state into northern, central, and
                    southern thirds, but these thirds are not described or mapped. The author is probaably exact in his
                    use of these and similar terms, but it would be helpful to have them defined. The author shows a
                    tendency to be satisfied with approximations, as in describing figures 361, 362, 169, and 221. For
                    mote readers the climographs in chapter twenty-three should be explained for they are very
                    complicated and unintelligible to the readers without specialized training. These are minor items
                    and are easily offset by generalizations like the following:<quote rend="blockquote">The regional
                        contrasts in rainfall intensity clearly help to explain the sharp southward increase in soil
                        erosion, and therefore in ruggedness. The greater runoff induced by the greater intensity and
                        slope at the south results not only in poorer soil but also in drier soil, as little rapidly
                        running water soaks in. The greater rainfall intensity helps to cause the smaller crop yields,
                        the smaller fraction of the land used for crops, and the average greater property of the people
                        in southern Indiana.</quote>
            </p>
            <p>The historian will be interested in knowing what progress has been made in correlating climate and
                    history. This work lays the foundation in that it describes in detail the climate of Indiana, but it
                    does not go very far beyond that. The chapters on health and crops offer some suggestions, but
                    fundamentally the correlation remains to be done, in fact, it seems to be outside the scope which
                    the author set for himself.</p>
            <p>The book should have a wide appeal for every one knows something about and is interested in various
                    phases of the weather. Copies of it will be very useful in newspaper offices, school libraries, and
                    public and private libraries generally.</p>

            <p>The Genealogy Section of the Indiana State Library is the recipient of "Simon Hadley and His
                    Descendants," a compilation of hundreds of typewritten pages assembled in four volumes
                    bound in "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName>" gray. In addition to the genealogical records there are photographs of people
                    and places, newspaper clippings, copies of census, court, Bible and church records, early wills, and
                    marriage agreements signed by witnesses. Interesting anecdotes and bits of family history and
                    biography, as well as personal letters are found among the pages, leading descendants to anticipate
                    something greener for their family tree.</p>
            <p>Supplemented by material listed above, the family records are based primarily on questionnaires sent
                    out by the compiler, Kingston Goddard Hadley, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Media</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>. It is evident that he devoted many years of his life to this work, following every
                    clew received to enable him to make the family records complete to 1937. Many years ago Mordecai
                    Hadley, of Indiana, wrote a partial genealogy of the family which the compiler had the privilege of
                    copying. He states that he used a chart made by Walter Brooks Hadley as well as data sent by others
                    who had attempted to trace their own lines back to the immigrant ancestor. To these he gives credit
                    in his preliminary notes.</p>
            <p>An examination of the volumes reveals the fact that the original plan was to assign to each
                    descendant a number keyed to generations down from Simon Hadley. As more information reached the
                    compiler he was unable to carry out the plan; however, these numbers are helpful in keeping family
                    groups together. Families of daughters are carried through several generations, a feature not
                    customary in the usual family history. Birth, death, and marriage dates always are included when the
                    facts are available. Much collateral data appear making buried treasure for the genealogist. It is
                    amazing to realize that the compiler was able to assemble the information, once it was collected. In
                    its present form the genealogy is difficult to use; it is hoped that some descendant will supplement
                    this labor of love with an adequate index.</p>
            <p>Simon Hadley, the father of Simon Hadley, the immigrant, <pb n="318" id="VAA4025-041-3-102"/> owned
                    an iron smithy in King's County, <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName>, and was also interested in some fishery property in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Dublin</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He was born about 1640 and his first wife was Catherine Talbot (?), of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Dublin</settlement>
                    </placeName>. She seems to have been the first of the name to join the Society of Friends; her death
                    is recorded in the Minutes of the Moate Granoge Register. After her death Simon Hadley married a
                    second time; this marriage was "out of unity" and caused his disownment from the
                    society. He died on June 6, 1711, leaving four children —John Hadley, Elizabeth Hadley
                    Miller, Jane Hadley Kiernan, and Simon, the immigrant.</p>

                    covered with yellow stucco. A pen and ink sketch shows the gabled roof, the quaint-pointed windows,
                    and the white stone slab sunk in the front wall on which are carved the initials, S (and) R. H,
                    1717, the year that Simon and Ruth built this home. The interior of the house includes a lovely old
                    mantle and a colonial stairway. The stone foundations of the carriage shed remain; the old barn with

                    about twelve miles south of Graham, the county seat of Alamance County. On the top of an old mill
                    stone is a large stone from the chimney of Joshua Hadley's first house; on top of it is a
                    rock from the family hearth.</p>

                    </placeName> in 1684-1685.</p>
            <p>The name Hadley is a place name, derived from two Anglo-Saxon words meaning "a wild heath
                    where cattle graze." In America we have a Hadley village in seven states, a Hadley Station,
                    a Hadley Chapel, and Hadley townships in both the North and the South. The spot called Hadley, in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Chatham County</region>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <country reg="ncu">North Carolina</country>
                    </placeName>, is presumed to have been the location of Joshua Hadley's mill, possession of
                    which probably aided members of the family to render material aid to our continental troops.</p>
            <p>In every line from Simon and Ruth, one finds given names repeated. There are Simons by the dozen.
                    Jonathan, too, was a popular name; one who lived near Guilford Courthouse, because of his loud
                    voice, was called "Whispering Jonathan" to distinguish him from
                    "Jonathan-up-the-creek" and "Jonathan-down-the-creek." Jeremiah,
                    James, Joshua, John, and Joseph were other favorites. Hence we have "Gentleman
                    John," "Hill Jerry," "Lame Joseph," "Joshua
                    the Miller," and "Little Newt," the latter for James Newton Hadley. There
                    were the "T. Hadleys," too; eight sons of Simon and Elizabeth Thompson, buried at
                    Mill Creek, Hend-ricks County, Indiana, had the middle initial "T" for Thompson to
                    carry on the mother's name.</p>
            <p>Hadley families are in every state from <placeName>

                    </placeName> south, southwest, and west to the coasts. The four volumes record the trek of a family
                    of indomitable pioneers pushing farther and farther into newer territory. Many of the descendants of
                    Joshua and his first wife, Mary Rowland, espoused the cause of the Revolution, later moving into
                    every Southern state, whereas the majority of Simon's descendants came north and west via
                    the Carolina gateway. By far the greatest concentration before 1850 was found in south central
                    Indiana, with Morgan and Hendricks counties as the nucleus. <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> was another gathering place whence they pushed farther westward.</p>

            <p>Descendants are legion. To be convinced one has only to examine the obituary columns of the <hi rend="i">American Friend</hi> where as many as three of the names in as many different parts of
                    the country have been listed at the same time. There is a Hadley Genealogical Society in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>

                    </placeName>. Among the family there have been governors, ministers, judges, physicians, lawyers,
                    army officers, ministers, and even Hollywood is represented by "Buddy" Rogers. In
                    Hendricks County, Indiana, there was an unbroken record of seventy-five years in which Hadleys
                    served in public office.</p>
            <p>The donor of these volumes is Chalmers Hadley, author of the <hi rend="i">Quaker Family of
                    Hadley</hi>, published in 1916, which Mr. Kingston Hadley drew upon in compiling the earliest
                    records of the Hadleys in <placeName>
                  <country reg="enk">England</country>, <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
               </placeName>, and in America. He is descended from William Hadley, son of
                    Thomas and Mary Newlin Hadley, who married Ann Harvey, the daughter of Eli and Mary Stanfield
                    Harvey. Their youngest son was Evan Hadley, born in 1845, who married Ella Quinn. He attended
                    Earlham College and Long Island Medical College, was a Professor of Medicine at the Medical College
                    of Indiana, and a one-time superintendent of the City Hospital. For thirty years he was a practicing
