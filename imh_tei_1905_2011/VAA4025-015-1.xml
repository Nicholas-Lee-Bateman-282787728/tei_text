            <p>Notwithstanding this intimate knowedge, however, the wilderness of the early days
                    was marked by many Indian trails, caused by different parties of Indians
                    traveling frequently over the same route, to hunt or trade. These trails usually
                    followed the path of least resistance, avoiding swamps, bogs and stony places,
                    and choosing the high and dry ground.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Sometimes they

                    certain that a route would always be adopted, at least in times of peace, where
                    water and fire would be available, and where the hunting parties would be
                    afforded an opportunity, if possible, to camp and rest in the groves and
                    woodlands. Mrs. J. H. Kinzie mentions a great trail made across the prairies of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, by the Sauk Indians, in going to Fort Maiden and <placeName>

                    it as "a narrow path, deeply indented by the hoofs of the horses on
                    which the Indians traveled in single file. So deeply was it sunk in the sod
                    which covers the prairie, that it is difficult, sometimes, to distinguish it at
                    a distance of a few rods."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> This great Sauk trail

                    </placeName>, in Indiana, running by Cedar Lake, where fish and game were
                    abundant.</p>
            <p>It must not be understood that these trails were always plainly marked. In places
                    they were lost in the expanse of the plain, or disappeared in marshes and
                    lowlands. However, the general outlines of the larger trails were fairly well
                    fixed. There might be two or three paths in some places, but these would later
                    converge and run together. In places the track might be entirely obliterated,
                    but would later appear again.</p>
            <p>There is now no doubt that an eaerly Potawatomi trail, of great importance,
                    extended from Kick-a-poo Falls, on the <geogName>Wabash river</geogName>, near
                    the present site of Attica, to the old Indian trading post of <placeName>

                    across the prairie to Parish's Grove, and from thence northwest to
                    Sugar Grove; it then ran to the State line, northwest, between Indiana and <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                        <geogName>Beaver lake</geogName> on a big hunt. They started at Kick-a-poo
                    and followed a well-defined Indian path. When they got out into the big prairies

                        <region type="county">Benton county</region>

                    the Potawatomi well, always spoke of a "trail" instead of a

                    of the great fur companies, and it is not likely that any of those who bartered
                    whiskey and beads for furs and peltries would be found anywhere else than on the
                    lines of Indian communication. Hubbard in his autobiography speaks of Sugar
                    Grove and tells of camping with some Kick-a-poos on Big Pine creek. He says that
                    he accused the Kick-a-poos of deceiving General Harrison, at the Battle of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>, by pointing out an unfavorable location for a camping ground. He
                    says that the Kick-a-poos laughed at this and told him that the old general had
                    selected the best site in the locality for a ground of defense, and Hubbard to
                    verify this statement made a trip to the battleground and said he was convinced
                    that the Kick-a-poo statement was true. He mentions Burnett's creek on
                    the west side of the battleground.</p>

            <p>The early accounts of the Iroquois, the Kankakee and Beaver lake, all agree that
                    at one time they constituted the great hunting and trapping grounds of the
                    Potawatomi in northern Indiana. <geogName>Beaver lake</geogName> and its
                    contiguous swamps abounded at one time with fur-bearing animals, such as the
                    muskrat, the mink and the beaver. "It was located almost wholly within

                    the government survey, and as the lake existed before being materially reduced
                    by drainage, it was the largest body of water in the State of Indiana. Its
                    greatest width from north to south was about four and one-half miles, and its
                    greatest length from east to west was about seven and one-fourth miles. It
                    covered an area of about twenty-five square miles, or about sixteen thousand
                    acres of land. In earlier times the water of the main body of the lake was
                    perhaps six to ten feet deep, and abounded in fish of all varieties usually
                    found in streams and lakes in this locality, and was especially remarkable for
                    the number of buffalo fish that abounded in its waters."<hi rend="sup">11</hi> The party of land hunters, heretofore mentioned, who accompanied
                    the Potawatomi to this lake in 1824, described it as "a beautiful body
                    of water, very clear and rather shallow, a delightful place for the Indians to
                    hunt, fish and bathe. It was one of the principal camping grounds of the

            <p>Is it any wonder, then, that we find a main line of travel, extending from the
                    groves of the prairies, and from the trading posts, to and from these rivers and
                    lakes where the savage went to supply his wants, and to secure those valuable
                    furs which he found so useful in exchange. It is plain to be seen that Le
                    Vasseur and Hubbard exercised some degree of intelligence in establishing the

                    route, where fewer obstacles would be encountered in the journey and taking
                    advantage of the frequent groves and Indian villages along the way. Fort
                    Ouiatenon was one of the earlist French trading posts in the West. It was
                    established, as Logan Esarey says, for the protection of the fur trade.

                    several years an unscrupulous band of half-breed French traders with whiskey,
                    beads and trinkets, who took every advantage possible of the ignorant savages.
                    But the Potawatomi Were always favorable to these French traders, who seemed to
                    understand them better, were less brusque with them, and frequently intermarried
                    with members of the tribe. This great Indian pathway is not without its
                    historical interest. It played a conspicuous part in the shaping of the history
                    of the Northwest. Over it probably passed the renowned Shaubena, chief of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName> Potawatomi, to form a league with Tecumseh and the Prophet. This
                    was in the spring of 1807, and was Shaubena's first meeting with that
                    famous chieftain. The friendship thus formed was afterwards cemented by frequent
                    intercourse. Shaubena was with Tecumseh at the great council with General
                    Harrison, in 1810, In the fall of that same year, Tecumseh started out on his
                    great mission of uniting the Indian tribes against the further progress of the
                    white man. He rode hundreds of miles across the forest and prairie, accompanied
                    by three principal chiefs, and all were mounted on spirited black ponies. Their
                    nearest route to Shaubena's village would be by the side trail leading
                    from the site of the present city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, west across the prairies to Parish's Grove. There was a
                    persistent tradition among the early settlers of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton county</region>
                    </placeName> that Tecumseh had at one time camped there. This was probably the
                    occasion. Shaubena afterwards related that Tecumseh arrived at his village on
                    the <geogName>Illinois river</geogName> on a warm day in the early part of
                    Indian summer. The trip across the vast expanse of prairie at this delightful
                    season must have been entrancing. The arrival of so distinguished a person as
                    Tecumseh was no common event. "On the following day a favorite dog was

                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, there came a demand for the opening up of highways north of the
                        <geogName>Wabash river</geogName>. General Harrison's soldiers, on
                    their historic march to the battlefield of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>, had discovered bluegrass in the prairies of Vermilion and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> counties, and they had been wonderfully impressed with the vast
                    areas of open plain containing rich and productive soil. General Tipton had
                    recorded in his rather rough and illiterate diary, that the troops of Harrison,
                    on the morning after the battle of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>, had discovered a "grait Deal of corn" at
                    Prophet's Town; that, after loading six wagons with corn, the troops
                    had destroyed the balance, estimated at two thousand bushels. These facts became
                    generally known with the return of the troops to southern Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. Great reports had been made of a virgin land, filled with pleasant
                    groves. Deer were known to abound, and all kinds of wild game. Discerning men,
                    even at that day, saw great possibilities ahead for the grazing of herds. Some
                    of the prairie groves contained springs; others were located on the banks of
                    running streams. Here was water and fuel, and refuge from the storms of the
                    prairie. With the development of markets, their greater accessibility, all
                    things were possible. Long before the "40's" had
                    arrived, men were predicting the coming greatness of the Old Post of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. There was the old line of the Potawatomi trail from Kick-a-poo to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Post Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and another ill-defined trail leading into this from the vicinity

            <p>Accordingly, we find the General Assembly of 1829 appropriating the sum of seven

                    the later days had scarcely heard of such a thing as a trail. Not so with John
                    Pugh and some of the earlier pioneers.</p>
            <p>If you will examine the Colton map of 1838, printed with this article, you will
                    plainly see the line of three roads, all entering Parish's Grove. The
                    one farthest to the left is the old State Road from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Williamsport</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName>; the one in the center, passing through Rainsville, is the old
                    Potawatomi Trail, extending from Kick-a-poo to Parish's Grove, over
                    which Berry Whicker and his companions traveled in 1824; the one to the right is
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> Road; running from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Parish's Grove, and crossing Big Pine creek. This <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> road followed the line of the old trail extending south and east
                    from Parish's Grove to Ouiatenon and the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>. By consulting the map, the markings of the trail as it runs
                    northwest from Parish's Grove, may be plainly seen, and also the point
                    of intersection with Hubbard's Trail, which is the first trail west of
                    the State line. The point of intersection, however, should be at the
                        <geogName>Iroquois river</geogName>, instead of farther south, for
                    Hubbard's Trail was first established from Bunkum, on the Iroquois,
                    north to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

                    "prairie schooner" might be seen traveling across the plains
                    from Parish's Grove to the northwest. The old trail suddenly assumed a
                    national importance. From <placeName>

                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, a tide rolled on that ultimately filled all the groves and

                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, and overflowed into other and newer territories to the north and
                    west.</p>
            <p>The amount of travel along this old trail in the 40's, and later, was
                    greatly augmented by the constantly increasing number of wagons coming from

            <p>It might be added that this Indian whom Mr. Ade speaks of as being named Yellow
                    Head, was a drunken and quarrelsome savage who once caused Mr. Gurdon S. Hubbard

            <p>John Pugh, a late respected citizen of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren county</region>
                    </placeName>, when a boy fourteen years of age, made a trip over this road,
                    which he persisted in calling "The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Trail," in the year 1841. The party consisted of several
                    men, horses and wagons. Peter Schoonover, grandfather of Judge Schoonover,
                    present judge of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fountain</region>
                    </placeName> circuit court, accompanied the party and drove two yoke of oxen. It
                    was the custom of those days to make the trip to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> in companies, in order to guard against the hazards of the journey,
                    and to provide means of "pulling out" the other fellow in case
                    he "got stuck" in the mud. To the eager boy of fourteen, this
                    pilgrimage of ten or twelve days through the wilderness, crossing plains and
                    rivers, sleeping at frontier taverns, and at last reaching the great lake and
                    the post of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was an experience that he remembered as long as he lived.</p>
            <p>The way was long and the journey difficult, as the ground was extremely soft and
                    wet, and this made hard pulling for the teams. The elder Pugh had a load of
                    about twenty-five bushels of grain, consisting of wheat and flax, the latter
                    grain being much grown in the early days to subdue and rot the sod of the
                    prairies. The market price of wheat in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> at that time was thirty-seven and one-half cents per bushel, and
                    flax was seventy-five cents per bushel.</p>

            <p>Coming out of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren county</region>
                    </placeName>, the wagon struck the main trail in the vicinity of where the town
                    of Boswell now stands, and the boy remembered of seeing a man come across the
                    prairies in a wagon. The hoofs of a deer were sticking up above the top of the
                    box. Deer were then very abundant. The first camping ground was on the northwest
                    slope of Parish's Grove, near the renowned tavern of Robert Alexander.
                    The horses and oxen were watered at the fine spring of pure water, at the foot
                    of the slope, which had made this a favorite camping ground of the Indians.</p>
            <p>Morning on the prairie was glorious. An early start was made, and the party
                    arrived at Bunkum on the second evening and at <geogName>Beaver Lake</geogName>
                    creek on the third. At <geogName>Beaver Lake</geogName> creek the wagons mired
                    in the bog and were pulled out by Schoonover's oxen. On the arrival of
                    the company at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which was then a small place, Pugh remembered of watering the
                    horses at the lake front. The waves were very high, and at one moment the horses
                    were splashing knee deep, and at the next they would be standing on the naked
                    sands.</p>
            <p>After disposal of their loads and doing some trading, the party returned over the
                    same route. Pugh recalled the bartering of seventy-five coon skins, the product
                    of many a good night's hunt, and of his father buying a stove, which
                    was then a curiosity, and some articles of wearing apparel. The whole party of
                    travelers, however, were clad in homespun, the product of the pioneer looms of
                    those days.</p>
            <p>The whole country from <placeName>

                    </placeName> to the lake was then in a state of nature. Bogs and marshes were
                    frequent, but in places the level prairie extended in unbroken grandeur for many
                    a league. Wild game was extremely abundant in the fall of the year. In the night
                    time, when the wagons rolled along, the great flocks of geese and brants,
                    aroused by the approaching teams, and arising from the ponds and low places,
                    made a great noise and clamor.</p>

            <p>Of latter-day art in Indiana, which has added honor to the name of Hoosier, much
                    has been said in a passing way, but the forerunners of that artâ€”the
                    first esthetic expressions of our people, have escaped notice or comment. The
                    first aspirants whose souls soared above mere utility, were so isolated and
                    obscure that the little part they played is all but lost to the memory of man. A
                    counterpane or quilt, treasured in a family here and there, with the simple
                    tradition that "grandma made it," is about all that remains by
                    way of record, unless we except obscure and indirect records that are more than
                    apt to be missed by the chronicler. One, for example, might hardly think to turn
                    to the dry old official reports of the State Board of Agriculture as a source of
                    information about art beginnings, yet those reports, as foreign as they would
                    seem from things of this sort, have preserved from utter oblivion not a few
                    names that should be remembered very kindly by those of today who stand for the
                    upward trend and the struggle away from the sordid.</p>
            <p>The records referred to are, in brief, the premium lists of the yearly fairs. The
                    first State fair was held in 1852, and it is interesting to find that in this
                    agricultural exhibit of a State that was predominantly agricultural some
                    attention was paid to the beauty side of life. Among the home-made articles
                    receiving premiums and mention we find lace caps, Ottoman covers, ornamental
                    shell work, fancy baskets, lamp mats, chenille work and artificial flowers.
                    There is also a natural flower display.</p>
            <p>The following year the list of articles of this sort is enlarged, and still
                    further enlarged in successive years, the range including fancy chair covers and
                    tidies, fancy worsted work, fancy penmanship, etc. Pictorial art was represented
                    the first year only by "monochromatic" drawings, by Lucy D.
                    Carlisle, aged nine, but in 1853 the committee on special articles reported
                    "several beautiful specimens of landscape painting," <pb n="16" id="VAA4025-015-1-024"/> the artists being Miss S. Benbridge, James
                    Crawford, Jacob Strilling, G. W. Morrison and Jacob Cox. The highest award,
                    fifteen dollars, was given to Morrison, and Cox got ten dollars.</p>
            <p>By 1857 the list of exhibiting artists had increased to a quite considerable
                    number, and the localities they hailed from are given as follows: Jacob Cox,
                    Mrs. M. A. Talbott, Mrs. A. G. Porter, Miss Mary E. Hill and R. D. Musgrave, <placeName>

                        <region type="county">Lake county</region>
                    </placeName>. This exhibit, about twenty pieces in all, was somewhat
                    heterogeneous, consisting of landscapes portraits, still lifes, pen and crayon
                    drawings, fancy penmanship and "fancy paintings," whatever
                    that may mean. Of the persons named Jacob Cox, James F. Gookins and George W.
                    Morrison attained to some prominence and are still remembered. Of the three
                    least is known about Morrison, but Mrs. Kate Milner Rabb, of <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where specimens of his art may now be found.</p>
            <p>An artist of the pioneer period whose pictures are still found up and down the
                        <geogName>Wabash valley</geogName>, and who for his services to both art and
                    history deserved more fame than he has fallen heir to, was George Winter. Winter
                    was an Englishman, who had studied painting at the Royal Academy, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In 1837 he came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and for the better part of forty years he resided there and at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, wringing a livelihood out of art as a profession, and managing to
                    do so by periodical raffles of the products of his brush. What drew him to the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> region was the Indian life, still lingering there, with its
                    picturesque features. In the portrayal of this life he produced many pieces of
                    decided historical value, including council scenes, portraits of notable chiefs
                    and the Indian dress and customs. Subsequently he painted many local landscapes,
                    among which were at least half a dozen views of the Tippe-canoe battleground.

                    several artists, but these, exotic, borrowing nothing from the life to which
                    they had been transplanted and adding little to it, can hardly be reckoned as
                    among the "forerunners" of our indigenous art. In this
                    connection may be mentioned Christopher Harrison, Indiana's first
                    Lieutenant-Governor, who prior to his public life spent several years as a
                    hermit on the bluffs of the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName> now stands. Harrison, so tradition says, brought with him his
                    paints and brushes, and with them whiled away the lonely hours, but how serious
                    were his efforts is not known.</p>
            <p>The discouragements of the artists are proverbial, but in our pioneer days they
                    were more desperate than now, and he who surmounted them had persistence indeed.
                    About the first sympathetic notice that Jacob Cox ever received came from Peter
                    Fishe Reed, a fellow-idealist who, in 1852, lauded his work and congratulated
                    him on his determination to give up the tinner's trade and devote
                    himself entirely to artâ€”which change, Reed facetiously remarked,
                    would afford his friend "more comfort but less tin." By that
                    time Cox had been painting pictures for some years, but Reed states that he had
                    never seen in the public prints any notice or appreciation of him, and he
                    wondered that he (Cox) did not go to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where he would have a chance.</p>
            <p>An unpolished diamond with a determination to shine not to be thwarted was Joseph
                    O. Eaton, who came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the latter forties as a runaway from his home in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, wearing one of his father's old coats, which was much too
                    large for him. His father wanted him to be a farmer, but Joseph elected to be an
                    artist, and as proof of his talent in that line brought with him two portraits,
                    one of George Washington and the other of an itinerant Methodist preacher. The
                    father of his country looked as if intended for a tavern sign, and both pictures
                    are described as "frightful daubs." Nevertheless, on the
                    strength of them he succeeded in drumming up custom and, it is said,
                    "painted whole families at five dollars ahead." Among these
                    subjects was no less a person than Governor Whitcomb. This Whitcomb portrait was
                    once owned by Judge Biddle, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and is probably still in existence. From <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Eaton went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and subsequently to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York City</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He became a portrait painter of note, and <pb n="18" id="VAA4025-015-1-026"/> it is said that in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> he cleared up a respectable fortune.</p>
            <p>Other names that should be mentioned in this connection are Jacob Cox, John H.
                    Niemeyer, John G. Dunn, Peter Fishe Reed and James B. Dunlap. Cox, the best
                    known of these, devoted himself to art in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> for fifty years, though obliged, for the sake of a livelihood, to
                    retain a connection with the tinning business, which he learned as a young man.
                    His art career seems to have begun in 1840, when he was called upon to paint a
                    banner for the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> campaign. After that he studied for a while in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, then painted and taught in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where he came to be regarded as the Nestor of the profession. He
                    may, perhaps, be spoken of as the true forerunner of the art that has since
                    sprung up. Niemeyer, an <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> sign painter, took his first art lessons of Cox, then studied in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, then in Europe, and after that became a professor of drawing and
                    painting at Yale College, and a lecturer on art. Dunn, a son of George H. Dunn,
                    an eminent lawyer of the State, was an erratic character with the temperament of
                    an artist, who might have made his mark had he possessed tenacity of purpose.
                    Cox describes him as "a genius with much ill-jointed, badly-directed
                    talent," and adds that "his coloring was exquisite and his
                    invention wonderful." He got nowhere, however, was given to
                    dissipation, and died young, leaving as a tragic token of both his talent and
                    his moral trials and struggles a temperance painting representing a man with pen
                    in hand and the pledge before him, on one side a woman urging him to sign it,
                    while on the other Satan, just visible in the shadows, tempts him with a glass.
                    The piece, in its appeal to the imagination, bears out Cox's comment as
                    to the artist's invention. Peter Fishe Reed was a versatile genius of
                    the middle-century period, who stood loyally for the fine arts and produced both
                    paintings and literature, besides being a devotee of music. His work in the two
                    lines still exists but is rare. Dunlap was an <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> man, who left as a proof of his talents many clever sketches, and
                    at least one piece of sculptureâ€”a bust of Captain Sutter, which is
                    now in the State Library.</p>
            <p>In the State Library hangs what is probably the oldest existing Indiana painting.
                    It is of Hyacinth Lasselle, and a memorandum in the handwriting of Charles B.
                    Lasselle, his son, states that it was painted by Louis Peckham at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <pb n="19" id="VAA4025-015-1-027"/> in 1812. Another portrait in
                    the Library is of John B. Dillon, the historian, when a young man, and this is
                    attributed to a now-forgotten artist by the name of Stephens, who painted this
                    piece at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1835.</p>
            <p>It should be added to this cursory sketch that, as early as 1853, the question of
                    an "Academy of Arts" for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was proposed, and that in 1856 the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Art Society, for the encouragement of local artists, came into
                    existence. All of which goes to show that before our present crop of trained
                    artists there was a pronounced impulse toward an indigenous art expression.</p>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> is made, it is necessary first to understand the meaning of the
                    term as it is to be used in this discussion. There are at least three ways in
                    which the term is popularly used, and each of these is quite distinct from the
                    others. The broadest meaning includes all those citizens who could be called out
                    in an emergency to defend the country. A second and more limited meaning
                    includes those between the ages of eighteen and forty-five who are enrolled in
                    regularly organized companies. The third and most limited use of the term
                    applies to men who are not only organized into companies, but who meet regularly
                    and drill for the purpose of becoming proficient in the manual of arms. It is
                    this third type of militia which has done really effective work, and it is the
                    purpose of this paper to discuss what it actually accomplished during the years
                    under discussion, with the hope that some light may be thrown on a
                    little-explored field of our military history. The sources for a study of this
                    type include the documents of all the States, as well as those of the <placeName>

                    even a great number of them. The task would obviously be an endless one for a

                    has been touched and the selection of material has been based on the importance
                    and representative character of the respective states. <placeName>

               </hi>, remarks that "up to (the time of the Mexican
                    War) the militia <pb n="21" id="VAA4025-015-1-029"/> system âˆ—
                    âˆ— âˆ— had been regarded as the bulwark of national
                        defense."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Evidence seems to prove that the
                    bulwark had begun to weaken before the Mexican war, but, at any rate, there had
                    been a conscious attempt on the part of congress and the various state
                    legislatures to remake their schemes to meet the new conditions arising. The
                    basic law for all military organizations was passed by congress on May 2, 1792,
                    and was entitled, "An Act to provide for the Militia to execute the
                    laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions."<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Although probably suited to the time when it was made, it
                    left many loopholes which had to be filled in later. In 1803 the
                    adjutant-generals of the various states were required to make annual returns to
                    the President of men, arms and ammunition; in 1808 the President was given
                    authority to require executives of the States to organize effectually and equip
                    their portion of the militia, and the government agreed to provide the equipment
                    for all militiamen, the allotments to be based on the annual returns. In 1820
                    the States were required to use the discipline and yield exercise of the regular
                    army. This completes the government program to the beginning of the Mexican war.
                    There is evidence of progress.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>At the same time that the general government was taking measures to keep the
                    militia at its best, the State legislatures were making repeated attempts to
                    hold popular interest in measures of defense. In 1855, the author of a pamphlet

                    was on the decline and every effort failed to maintain the old standards.</p>
            <p>It is impossible to set an exact date for the beginning of the decline in
                    interest in the militia, but certain it is that the declne began many years
                    before the Mexican war. The causes for it were manyâ€”lack of military
                    necessity; rareness of drill days; expense, and commutation and fines. As the
                    memory of the War of 1812 faded gradually from the public mind, the military
                    spirit also declined. Then it was that the hardships worked by the system became
                    noticeable. The drills in most cases were held on only one day in the year, and
                    that usually in April or October. It took all morning to get the roll called,
                    and it was not until two o'clock that the actual drilling occurreds and
                    then the officers in command many times appeared late in the day. In many cases
                    that in itself would have made little difference, for often the officers knew
                    little more than the men, but the loss of time was a real burden. One case at
                    least is on record where the officer in charge was in the habit of reading the
                    orders from printed cards.</p>
            <p>Next to the loss of time occasioned on drill days, the things felt to be most
                    burdensome were the fines imposed for absence, and commutations allowing those
                    with money the opportunity of buying their exemption from duty. The miserable
                    condition of feeling toward the system is indicated by the fact that in many
                    States the commutation required for one's absenting himself entirely
                    from military activity amounted to something between seventy-five cents and
                    three dollars. To those who stood the strain this seemed unfair and they
                    rebelled. In the beginning the fines were exceedingly heavy, and many times
                    imprisonment was included. This latter burden became so odious that it had
                    finally to be removed in all parts of the country. All manner of claims were set
                    up for exemption; lieutenant-governor; legislators; judges; State officials;
                    college instructors; academy teachers; county officers; government clerks, and
                    all conscientious objectors, all claimed exemption. By 1840 the whole system had
                    fallen into general disrepute.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>The lack of interest is nowhere more evident than in the incompleteness of the
                    annual returns from the States. During the entire period under consideration

                    the government records was due to the fact that the State officials failed,
                    either in returning complete records or in turning them in at all. The complaint
                    was also made by the State officials that the smaller units failed to turn in
                    the records to them. Indeed, the greatest lament came from the State
                    adjutant-generals, for it was their duty to see that the State which they
                    represented got its full quota of arms. As the means provided by the government
                    was the basing of State quotas on the annual returns, the State was the loser
                    and the adjutant-general got the blame. The first year the adjutant-general was
                    in office he was likely to send a statement to the legislature to the effect
                    that he was helpless, and request legislative aid. The following years, having
                    been discouraged by the lack of attention to his first appeal, he usually merely
                    remarked that he had no effective way of getting records. Thus the records of
                    the federal adjutant-general were usually very defective. The following table
                    indicates the number of times reports were sent to the general government during
                    the period from 1846 to 1860, the dates indicating the years of the first
                    reports from the respective States. Note that in many cases the number of arms
                    furnished a State had to be based on a return which came in long before 1846.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>

            <p>The duties of the adjutant-general in most of the States were so slight that the
                    office was not generally attractive to men of energy. In many cases the
                    incumbent knew nothing military. An example of this is found in David Reynolds,
                    adjutant-general for Indiana in 1846. General Lew Wallace, in his <hi rend="i">Autobiography</hi>, gives an interesting account of a visit to
                    Reynolds' office. He remarks among other things that the office and
                    salary of the adjutant-general were alike unattractive, up till the time of the
                    beginning of the war. He refers to "the office" of the general
                    for lack of a better word to express what he meant. Until 1846 the
                    "office" was the front room of the incumbent's house
                    in southern Indiana. Beginning with 1846, he was required to have an office in
                    the State Capitol, and the salary, including all expenses, was one hundred
                    dollars a year.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

            <p>By 1840 the condition of the militia began to alarm some interested people and,
                    as a result, congress appointed a committee to report on the condition of the
                    militia and to make suggestions for its betterment. The report got no decent
                    hearing, but, as many of the States followed the advice of the committee, it is
                    worthy of some attention. The report began with the recognition of the fact that
                    the enlistment plan for obtaining men was a failure, and the committee recalled
                    the fact that privileges and exemptions allowed those who joined and became
                    uniformed had been of no avail. Next, they called attention to the fact that
                    while the regular soldier was comfortably clothed, the militiaman was thrown on
                    his own resources. They demanded that something be done immediately to avoid the
                    impending crash of the whole framework of national defense.</p>
            <p>The committee suggested the following changes: Repeal the part of the law of 1792
                    which required <hi rend="i">all</hi> able-bodied men between the ages of
                    eighteen and forty-five to serve in the active militia, in such States as would
                    provide for the drafting or voluntary enlistment of one hundred and sixty
                    thousand men and place them at the disposal of the President, and train them for
                    thirty days a year; second, it was suggested that <list type="footnotes">

                    fourth, eight years. This second provision planned to make the system a burden
                    on no one. In addition, there was a third suggestion, that each
                    county's quota be divided into two groups; the younger men were to be
                    organized as the "Active Militia," and the older as the
                    "Peace Establishment." The younger companies would in all
                    cases be called first. The general government, had this plan been adopted, would
                    have furnished regular army pay and uniforms; the individual State would have
                    furnished the arms and other equipment. The Secretary of War disapproved of the
                    plan because it did not furnish enough drill days, although it was much better
                    than anything in the past.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

            <p>Soon after the report of the committee several States remodeled their systems,
                    many of them using suggestions embodied in the report. Volunteer companies had
                    been doing regular work in many States, and these were now given more
                    recognition. The outstanding example of this is <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, this State disorganizing its existing militia system and
                    substituting a call for volunteers to the amount of ten thousand. These were to
                    be the "Active Militia," and were the only ones of military
                    age to be trained. Five years was the length of service for each man. However,
                    the volunteer system does not seem to have been successful in any case, and this
                    was no exception. In 1847 the adjutant-general of the State reported that the
                    whole thing was a failure.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indiana made a desperate attempt during this period to revive interest in the
                    system. In 1840 an act was passed dividing the militia into
                    "Active" and "Sedentary." The former
                    division was composed of men from eighteen to thirty, and the latter of those
                    from thirty to forty-five. The younger group, as was the plan in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, was to be called upon first. Evidently this was not entirely
                    satisfactory, for the provisions were changed in 1842 and 1843, and by 1844, the
                    legislature was willing to accept companies containing as few as thirty-two
                        men.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> The same thing with slight variation <list type="footnotes">

                    ebb and that the chance of saving the system was small. Examples could be

            <p rend="center">UNITS AND OFFICERS OF MILITIA</p>
            <p>Since the Militia Act of the general government, passed in 1792, formed the basis
                    for service throughout the whole period under consideration, it will be worth
                    some examination. It was called an "Act more effectually to provide for
                    the National Defense by establishing an Uniform Militia throughout the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>," and it provided that "the militia of the
                    respective States be arranged into divisions, brigades, regiments, battalions
                    and companies as the legislature of each State direct; and each division,
                    brigade and regiment be numbered at the formation thereof; and a record made of
                    such members in the adjutant-general's office in the State; and when in
                    the field, or in the service of the State, each division, brigade and regiment
                    respectively take rank according to their numbers, reckoning the, first or
                    lowest number highest in rank." In addition, it was suggested
                    "That if the same be convenient, each brigade consist of four
                    regiments; each regiment of two battalions; each battalion of five companies;
                    each company of sixty-five privates."<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This same law also provided that each State should officer its militia as
                    follows: "To each division, one major-general and two aides-de-camp,
                    with the rank of major; to each brigade, one brigadier-general, with one brigade
                    inspector, to serve also as brigade-major, with the rank of a major; to each
                    regiment, one lieutenant-colonel commandant; and to <list type="footnotes">

                    one lieutenant, one ensign, four sergeants, four corporals, one drummer and one
                    fifer or bugler." Each regimental staff was to consist of an adjutant,
                    and a quarter-master, each to rank as a lieutenant; one paymaster, one surgeon
                    and a surgeon's mate, one sergeant-major, one drum-major and one
                    fife-major.</p>
            <p>In regard to detail, the act provided that each battalion was to have at least
                    one company of grenadiers, light infantry or riflemen, and that each division
                    was to consist of one company of artillery and one of horse. Artillery companies
                    had one captain, two lieutenants, four sergeants, four corporals, six gunners,
                    six bombardiers, one drummer and one fifer. Each troop of horse was to be
                    equipped with one captain, two lieutenants, one cornet, four sergeants, four
                    corporals, one saddler, one farrier and one trumpeter. Each State was required
                    to furnish each company with a drummer, and a fifer or bugler; each State was
                    required to elect an adjutantgeneral. As to the rank of officers in the States,
                    the date of the commission was to be the deciding factor and, when this was
                    impossible because of two coinciding dates, the matter was to be settled by
                        lot.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The law deserves such examination in detail because it covers the field of
                    possibilities in organization so thoroughly that there was little left for the
                    individual States to decide. It will be observed that there were a few places
                    where modifications were possible. The units could not have less than the
                    required number of officers but they might have more. <placeName>

                    suggested five of the law; <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> allowed a company to organize with only forty-eight members instead
                    of the sixty-five; some States had four lieutenants instead of the two required.
                    With these minor exceptions the States were organized according to the one type.

            <p>The method of the selection of officers was not worked out during this period,
                    but during the fifties there were nunferous suggestions made to the effect that
                    it would be wise to introduce the merit system into the selection of officers.
                    However, none of these suggestions, for some reason or other, seem to have been
                    acted upon. In most of the States the privates elected. Especially was this true
                    of the company officers. In <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> the major-generals and brigadier-generals were elected by the vote
                    of the General Assembly, and the adjutant-general was appointed by the governor.
                    With such exceptions as the foregoing, most of the officers got their positions
                    through the votes of the men directly under them; the men of the company
                    electing the company officers; the company officers electing the regimental
                    officers, and so on. Indiana offers a good illustration of this selection plan.
                    In 1843 Indiana passed an act allowing the second or second and third
                    lieutenants to be elected by the companies. In 1844 the regimental officers were
                    to elect two men for colonel and lieutenant-colonel, their respective rank to be
                    determined by lot. Notification of the vacancy of an office was to be sent to
                    the governor, who would thereupon order an election to fill the vacancy. In
                    1852, a new act gave the Governor the authority to appoint a resident
                    brigadier-general in each county, each county to be a regimental district. Each
                    general was to recommend to the Governor suitable men in his county for colonel,
                    lieutenant-colonel and major. The colonel was given the right to appoint one
                    captain and two lieutenants in each township for every one hundred militiamen
                    inhabitants. The captain of each company was made responsible for the
                    appointment of four sergeants and four corporals. All removals were to be made
                    by court-martial. It can scarcely excite comment, after reading the foregoing,
                    that there were officers who had to read their orders from cards.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, it must not be inferred from the foregoing that all the officers were
                    entirely without training. To be sure, most of it was meager, and often it did
                    not exceed that of the privates, but there were some exceptions. Whereas, some
                    of the States required the officers to buy their own tactics, <list type="footnotes">

                    times offices were given to men merely as honorary, and the incumbent needed to
                    know nothing about military usages. A military title was a desirable handle in
                    the community, for time was when a military officer was an exceedingly important
                    personage. Brant and Fuller, in their <hi rend="i">History of <placeName>

                    so fortunate as to secure a commission of general, colonel, or even
                    lieutenant-colonel or major, was pretty sure to get a civil office if his
                    aspirations led him that way."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> The honor for a
                    uniform did not disappear with interest in what the uniform represented. It was
                    claimed that the Indiana law of 1855 was passed with nothing else in view but
                    the issuing of commissions in order to confer military titles only. <placeName>

                    years to be given the honorary rank of colonel. The evidence of the prevalence
                    of this plan is the custom in some communities of calling any elderly man
                    "colonel."</p>
            <p>From colonial times the annual muster day had been the chief social time for the
                    entire neighborhood, the dancing and barbecue always attracting quite as much as
                    the serious business of the day. This festive side of the occasion became more
                    and more prominent as the memory of past wars gradually faded, and the officers
                    took their duties less and less seriously. The appearance of a body of militia
                    on training day has been likened to a burlesque on all things military. There
                    was considerable variation among the States in the number and time of drill
                    days. Most of the States had only one, and that either in the late spring or
                    early autumn; but it gradually became the custom to have the drill on both days.
                    Indiana, in 1844, provided that drill should take place at a time set by the
                    regimental by-laws, or at a time when two-thirds of the members should agree. <placeName>

            <p>The early encampments were by small units, but the tendency was always toward
                    larger ones. There was the constant suggestion throughout the forties, by
                    adjutant-generals, that much might be gained by training larger units together.
                    During the fifties the improvement on this point came. Indiana had muster by
                    battalions in April and by regiments in October. In 1853 <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> had an encampment by divisions for the first time; and, finally, in
                    1859, the entire military force of that State assembled for the first time
                        together.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Inside the regimental organizations, many States permitted volunteer companies to
                    become a part of the system. Voluntary enlistment of this nature was permitted
                    by Indiana in 1844, and these organizations, since they were free-will in plan,
                    furnished the real backbone of the organization of the volunteers for the
                    Mexican War. Numerous references are made throughout the county histories to
                    crack companies and their relation to the regular required organizations. In
                    1846, just at the outbreak of hostilities, the adjutant-general of Indiana
                    called attention in his report to the useful volunteers. The internal
                    organization of these units was the same as that of the regular units.</p>
            <p>The condition of the militia system after the war is to be considered in another
                    part of this paper, but it is necessary to stop here long enough to call
                    attention to the changes in units and officers, brought about by conditions
                    existing at the close of the Mexican War. Diminished interest produced what
                    might be called a period of "skeleton regiments." As early as

                    because so many of the companies of both infantry and artillery had been reduced
                    to small numbers. The reorganization was immediately effected. There was a
                    continued change to larger units and less detail. This is illustrated well by <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, which State for many years previous to the War claimed that she
                    had the best militia system in the whole Union. In 1855 it proposed to drop the
                    names of "artillery" and "light infantry"
                    and call it all "infantry." The next year the adjutant-general
                    proposed dropping the third and fourth lieutenants, and his 1858 report shows
                    that one-third of the companies of the State had been affected by an order of
                    March 27, which provided for the disbanding of all companies having less than
                    thirty-two privates.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

                    1856, for the adjutant-general reported that it was harder than ever to get the
                    returns, to say nothing of better organization. His remark, near the end of his
                    report, summed up the case as it existed in many States: "Literally,
                    there is no report to make."<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

            <p>In the case of equipment, as in the case of the organization of the militia, the
                    general government furnished the pattern and a large amount of the actual
                    material to the States. In 1803 congress authorized the constant provision of

                    carrying into effect the previous provision. By this act, the secretary of war,
                    through the department of the quartermaster-general, was authorized to provide
                    each State with sufficient arms, each year, to equip the militiamen reported
                    from each State. The basis for the apportionment was one musket, or its
                    equivalent, to each man. A musket was reckoned at thirteen dollars, and it was
                    left to each State to determine what kind of equipment <list type="footnotes">

                    were a thousand men reported from a State, that State's quota would be
                    a thousand muskets, or any other arms stipulated by the State to the value of
                    thirteen thousand dollars.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is probable that no State, during this period, got its full quota of arms at
                    any time, for the rolls were never complete. Attention has already been called
                    to the fact that the number of men reported from a State determined the amount
                    of arms allowable to that State. There was considerable variation among the
                    States as to the number of men sent in as compared to the actual strength of the
                    militia, but they all fell short of anything like perfection. As a result of the
                    repeated annual statements of the chief of ordnance to the general government to
                    the effect that the total strength of the militia was by no means being turned
                    in, congress, finally, in 1846, passed an act which provided in a better way for
                    the enrollment. A study of the figures representing the number of muskets or
                    their equivalent, furnished the States and Territories by the general government
                    year by year from 1846 to 1860, shows some very interesting facts. In the first
                    place, more than half of the States had their quotas based on numbers sent in
                    before 1845; secondly, there was an evident, continued drop-off in interest from
                    1846 on; thirdly, the low mark for returns is from 1855 to 1858. This is evident
                    at a glance from the fact that in so many States the number of arms remained the
                    same from one year to another.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                    due the States by the general government, for there is evidence that many of the
                    States were continually attempting to collect back debts. Finally, in 1853, a
                    special agent was appointed to settle up the accounts with the States. As early
                    as 1848, Indiana's adjutant-general complained that he had received
                    nothing from the general government for two years.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As far as the records show, the State aid for the militia was small indeed;
                    evidently, it was thought that the government would provide enough under the act
                    of 1808. In Indiana the legislature provided, in 1844, that the governor should
                    furnish militia companies with arms, but, from all evidences, the supplying was
                    done from the equipment supplied to the State by the general government.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> An isolated case appears in <placeName>

            <p>The arms furnished the States varied much in quality as well as in kind. During
                    the fifties percussion muskets were replacing the old flint-locks, and every
                    State wanted the new implement. The government, not being able to supply the
                    entire demand for new arms, gave altered flint-locks to all who could be made to
                    take them, and the good ones were reserved for the strongest objectors.
                    Complaints come from all sides concerning the bad treatment.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The care taken by the State, of the arms allowed it, differed nearly as much as
                    the quality of the arms furnished. Most of the States provided arsenals for the
                    care of the arms, but these were often poorly constructed and ill-equipped
                    buildings. In 1857, <placeName>

            <p>Reports from the States show a great amount of necessary repairing being done, or
                    needing to be done, to the arms in the hands of the State. In many cases the
                    arms were scattered over the State, and these were poorly cared for. Practically
                    all the holsters were capped with bearskin, and these were in constant need of

                    evidently going on, but there was not sufficient money to hire enough men to do

                    and lack of proper provision for care, arms given out by the State to individual
                    companies were left, not only in a state of disorder, but without proper
                    equipment for their protection from the elements. <placeName>

                    illustrated by the special case of one State. In 1831 Indiana passed a law,
                    requiring the quartermaster to take receipts for all arms drawn from the public
                    armory. How much interest was taken in such affairs may be gathered from the
                    fact that, not until 1844 was there a receipt to be found in the office of this
                    man. From 1832 till 1837, 1,857 muskets had been given out without record of who
                    received any of them, and, by 1844, there were 2,401 muskets unaccounted for.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> In 1842 the General Assembly enacted that the commanding
                    officer of each company should be required to give bond to the quartermaster,
                    and that it should be the duty of that officer to get bonds as quickly as
                    possible for those already out.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> The quartermaster started
                    on the job with a determination to collect for everything outstanding and, by
                    1844, he was ready to report that he had required bonds on all small arms and
                    had collected $96,098 in this way; and that he was trying to reclaim
                    all the lost arms with the aid of five agents in different parts of the
                        State.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>. By the next annual report he had collected
                    seven hundred pieces, for which bond had never been given and, in 1846, he had
                    succeeded in collecting seven hundred and ninety-three additional. Moreover, he
                    had succeeded in getting most of the companies to pay the transportation charges
                    on the arms to and from the arsenal, a thing which the State had not
                        required.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> In 1853, when the new militia act went into
                    effect, public sentiment had been developed to the point where a provision could
                    be incorporated, requiring the board of commissioners of each county to be
                    responsible and furnish the bond.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

                    belt, two spare flints and a knapsack, a pouch with a box therein to contain not
                    less than twenty-four cartridges, suited to the bore of his musket or firelock,
                    each cartridge to contain a proper quantity of powder and ball; or with a good
                    rifle, knapsack, shot pouch and powder horn, twenty balls suited to the bore of
                    his rifle, and a quarter of a pound of powder." He was to âˆ—

                    company days to exercise only, he [might] appear without a
                        knapsack."<hi rend="sup">21</hi>. The act of 1808 took care of the
                    gun the man had previously to furnish, but, with this exception, the individual
                    completely equipped himself. All commissioned officers were to provide
                    themselves with a sword or hanger and spontoon, and the rest of the officers
                    were each to have a sword or hanger, a fusee, bayonet and belt, with a cartridge
                    box to contain twelve cartridges.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> The cavalry officer was
                    to have a horse at least fourteen-and-a-half hands high, a sword, a pair of

            <p>No problem was more difficult to solve, nor is there one more interesting to read
                    about than that of the uniform. There was no government regulation on this
                    point, and the States did'not take the matter in hand until after 1840,
                    and then they usually left it to the individual unit to select. The government
                    committee on militia did suggest, in 1840, "that no more becoming dress
                    need be sought than the white rifle frock worn by many corps of the
                    revolutionary army."<hi rend="sup">25</hi> It was hinted that this
                    would have an elegant effect. In fact, in most cases, the decision seemed to
                    turn almost entirely upon the imposing appearance of the uniform. In Indiana,
                    during this period, all companies selected their own uniforms, the only check
                    being an order from the adjutant-general, in 1846, to the effect that when a

                    instead of two."<hi rend="sup">26</hi> Similar situations in other
                    States might be mentioned to indicate the same confusion. The fact that crack
                    companies were designated by the color of their uniforms is significant at this
                    point.</p>
            <p>In conclusion there is another item of money to be mentioned; fines and
                    commutations. It is evident that, from the first, one of the popular ways of
                    enforcing attendance at drill was by means of fines. Another way of getting
                    money was to let the man plan beforehand for an absence and pay a sum for the
                    privilege of so absenting himself. The early fines were large and burdensome. In
                    1799, the basic law of Indiana provided that the fines for non-attendance at
                    muster might be from six to one hundred dollars, at the discretion of the
                    officer in command.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> This is typical of the system until
                    the early forties. A probable high spot in the history of militia fines is found
                    in October, 1840, when the congressional committee on militia reported that
                    imprisonment (an alternative for fines allowed in many States) was a thing which
                    public opinion would no longer tolerate.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> From this time on
                    there is little or no evidence of imprisonment and the fines become less and
                    less burdensome. In Indiana, in 1840, a law was passed stipulating that fines
                    for non-attendance should not exceed three dollars.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Placing fines and commutation fees and collecting them proved to be two very
                    different matters. It seems that at no time within the period under
                    consideration did the States succeed materially in collecting either. Of the
                    two, commutation money came in the easier; <placeName>

                    through their plan of charging the commutation delinquencies remaining unpaid at
                    the end of the year, to the town from which the commuters came. Indiana required

                    adjutant-general of that State made the remark that, "public opinion
                    may not yet be prepared to sanction a direct tax for the support in part of the
                    militia. The subject has not been sufficiently discussed, nor has the measure
                    been seriously pressed." Evidently, however, no time was lost in
                    pressing it for, in 1858, the people of <placeName>

            <p>Some money was realized from the sale of old and unserviceable military stores.

                    </placeName> authorized the sale of old materials. In this State two antiquated
                    arsenals were sold, one bringing nineteen thousand dollars, and the other more
                    than six thousand. The next year the interest in several old gun-houses was
                        sold.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> At the suggestion of the adjutant-general, <placeName>

                    </placeName> sold her old arms, gaining ten thousand dollars, which amount was
                    used for the purchase of tents and camp equippage.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>. At no
                    time was the expense of the States exceedingly great, usually not being more
                    than the pay of the men while in camp; that is, from five to nine dollars a year
                    apiece. Nevertheless, there was considerable complaint at the expense of the
                    system. In <placeName>

                    the system was not costing much seems to be evident, but that it was costing
                    much more than it was worth may be true, in light of the constant decline of the

            <p rend="center">THE MILITIA AFTER THE MEXICAN WAR</p>
            <p>A well-known writer on military history has said that "the Mexican War
                    marked a great change if not a revolution, in our military policy."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> On examination, this is found to be true, and it is the
                    object of this chapter to show what the change was and how it came about.
                    Incidentally, it will not be beside the question to call attention to the fact
                    that the Mexican War was fought by volunteersâ€”not by the militia.
                    That more died from ignorance of how to take care of themselves than from actual
                    battle experience, was unobserved by the average citizen, and a great many
                    people throughout the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> came to the conclusion that we could fight a successful war without
                    the aid of trained citizens.</p>
            <p>Whatever the inter-working causes, the militia continued to decline, as it had
                    been declining for many years before the war. The fact is not obvious
                    immediately on the close of hostilities. On the other hand, in many sections of
                    the country, the opposite seemed to be the case for the first few years.
                    Roughly, the period from 1848 to 1860 can be divided into three parts, with no
                    absolutely distinct lines between them. For convenience, the first period may be
                    called the early fifties, with the approximate dates, 1848 to 1853; the second
                    period, the middle fifties, 1853 to 1858; the third period, the eve of the Civil
                    War, 1858 to 1860. The first is characterized by a generally renewed interest in
                    the militia, undermined in many places by superficiality; the second period is
                    that of real decline, with a few isolated exceptions that seem to prove the
                    rule; the third is the time of excitement before the storm, ending in the
                    revelation of the fact that there was, in reality, no military force among the
                    civilians from which to make an army.</p>
            <p>The most noticeable change immediately upon the close of the Mexican War was the
                    improvement in the returns from the States. There was a tightening up of the
                    strings everywhere, and the results show nearer the truth concerning the number
                    in the enlistment age than at any other time during the period under
                    consideration. A study of a table, indicating the returns from the various
                    States from 1846 to 1860, shows some important facts. It is evident, in the
                    first place, that <list type="footnotes">

                    there was a decided increase during the next few years after the Mexican War;
                    secondly, that, although the majority of States sent in better reports from now
                    on till the Civil War than had been the custom before the end of the Mexican
                    War, yet, from 1852 on, the majority shows a gradual decrease. Finally, it is
                    evident that there is a slight renewed interest just on the eve of the Civil
                    War. If a graph could be constructed to indicate the facts, it would begin with
                    the lowest point in 1846 and rise gradually and slowly through the Mexican War;
                    rise rapidly after the war till 1852 or 1853; then gradually drop, but never
                    reaching a level as low as that of 1846, until 1858; finally it would rise from
                    1858 to 1860.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                    sentiment in favor of militia that he doubted much whether any law, passed by
                    State or nation could remedy the condition. The law of 1840 had practically
                    disbanded the organized militia and had left the entire system on a volunteer
                    basis. Partly as a result of this statement of the case, the legislature of <placeName>

                    of the law, as he summed them up, were: the benefits of competition; the
                    provision for a testing of skill offered by the large gatherings, and the
                    opportunity there offered for discussion and correction; finally, the battalion
                    drill provided an opportunity for experience by larger units than had formerly
                    been possible. The facts are that, in 1852, twenty-one companies were formed and
                    only twelve disbanded; the next year twelve were organized and four disbanded.
                    The average number of men in a company was increased; in 1851 it was 46.6, in
                    1852, 55.0, and in 1853, 63.0. There is no doubt but that the adjutant-general
                    was correct when, in 1853, he said that "the militia never enjoyed a
                    higher reputation, was never better organized, and never more free from
                    objections." In 1855, he told the State that the <placeName>

                    that year one company reported, and, in 1857, no company made returns, although

                    ordered the disbanding of all companies containing less than thirty-two
                    privates. This year also showed an actual decrease in the number of enrolled
                    militiamen; only ninety-five companies were in existence. Likewise, 1859 showed
                    a decrease and the number dropped to eighty-seven. In the light of these facts,
                    the statement of the adjutant-general may be taken with a grain of salt. He
                    said, "In my judgment the Volunteer militia of the State has never been
                    more thoroughly organized, nor in better condition than at the present
                        time."<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

            <p>The later fifties was a time when the "Corn-stalk militia" was
                    abundant. Corn-stalks replaced the guns at drill and an extravagantly fancy
                    uniform for the commandant in charge was sufficient for the whole body of men.
                    Before the Civil War broke out the militia may be said to have disappeared as an
                    effective body.</p>

            <p>Many of the early settlers in northern and central Indiana were of this stock and
                    their descendants are now numbered by thousands, many of whom are entirely
                    ignorant of their true origin. In the families herein recorded there is only one
                    record in the direct line of a marriage outside this racial strain. In the
                    collateral lines it may be said that such marriages are more frequent but there
                    has been a strong tendency to keep the strain pure.</p>
            <p>The Crone, Switzer, Weaver, Stuckey, Stout and Steel families came from the

                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> and then northwest to the vicinity of Mansfield, Rich-land county, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. The Stuckeys and Switzers came straight west from

               </placeName>, while the Weavers
                    first went into the <geogName>Shenandoah Valley</geogName> and then northwest to
                    the vicinity of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lancaster</settlement>,
                            <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                    county, Indiana, where the writer's parents were married and he was
                    born.</p>
            <p>To describe these migrations in another way it may be said that certain families
                    followed the trail along which the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> railroad was afterwards laid. Others went directly west to
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lancaster</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, while others came up
                    from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and followed the line of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                    </placeName> to <placeName>

                            <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, and later to
                    the vicinity of Mansfield. Not only these families but hundreds of others
                    followed these routes of travel. They came in covered wagons bearing with them
                    not only necessary tools and utensils but in many cases some prized article of
                    furniture or table wear.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The first American ancestor of this family was Johannes Cron who came from the
                    Palatinate and landed in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> September 19, 1738. He settled in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">York county</region>
                    </placeName> where he died in 1769, leaving two sons, Simon and John. Simon
                    apparently died without heirs but John of the second generation died in 1785,
                    leaving twelve children, Jacob, John, Lawrence, Christina, Conrad, Michael,
                    Henry, Anna, Mary, Catherine, Barbara and Elizabeth. The five last mentioned
                    were minors. John Crone of the second generation and his sons Jacob, John and
                    Lawrence were soldiers of the Revolution.</p>
            <p>Jacob Crone of the third generation was born about 1756 or 1757. He served in the
                    Sixth <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> regiment from 1777 to 1781. He was evidently a man of some
                    independence of character for he declined to receive his pay in the depreciated
                    currency offered him. After his father's death he must have suffered
                    some financial reverse which compelled him to dispose of the double share in his
                    father's estate to which he was entitled by reason of being the eldest
                    son. Later he sold his personal property and went to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Hagerstown</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
               </placeName>. In the meantime he had married Margaret
                    Dritt, daughter of Peter Dritt (Tritt) and a sister of Jacob Dritt, a captain in
                    the Revolution and later brigadier-general of State militia, and of Peter Dritt,
                    also a Revolutionary soldier. They were married January 3, 1786 and had two
                    sons, Jacob and John, When these two sons were very young the family removed to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hagerstown</settlement>
                    </placeName> and later returned to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">York county</region>
                    </placeName>. None of <pb n="50" id="VAA4025-015-1-058"/> the sons of Jacob
                    Crone or Krone left any issue, but his daughter's descendants live in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                    </placeName>. Jacob Crone was a soldier of the War of 1812.</p>
            <p>John Crone of the fourth generation married Elizabeth Pence (Bentz or Pentz)
                    November 4, 1813. Elizabeth Pence was the daughter of Bernhard and
                    grand-daughter of George Pence (probably the soldier of the Revolution) and
                    doubtless the great-granddaughter of John Bentz who settled in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">York county</region>
                    </placeName> in 1732. The fall of 1814 John Crone joined one of the companies
                    which went to the relief of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName> but which arrived too late to take any active part in the
                    hostilities. Later he removed with his family to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName>, thence to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hagerstown</settlement>
                    </placeName> and later to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greencastle</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Chambersburg, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>. He was a blacksmith and these frequent changes of residence were
                    doubtless due to his search for employment. The Crone family returned to York
                    some time previous to their departure for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> in 1832. They settled in the vicinity of Lucas, <placeName>

            <p>John and Elizabeth Pence Crone were blessed with seven children who reached
                    maturity, John, Jacob, Elizabeth, Joseph, George, Emily and Catherine. John
                    moved to Indiana, Jacob to <placeName>

                    great-grandfather, John Weaver, born in 1762. This John Weaver married Susannah

            <p>By the year 1895 radicalism in the south and west was well under way. Among other
                    factors, the panic of 1893, the shrinking of the gold reserve from 1893 to 1895,
                    the demonetization of silver by <placeName>

                    </placeName> in June, 1893, and the failure of the corn crop of 1894, had sown
                    dissension in the ranks of the Democrats and strengthened the forces of
                    discontent. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> was repudiated by the bulk of his party, his attitude toward free
                    silver, made plain as far back as February, 1891 by his let er on free coinage,
                    particularly alienating the free silver wirag. A new democracy was arising,
                    based on new ideas and looking for new leaders. The repeal of the Sherman Silver
                    Purchase law in October, 1893, was bitterly denounced as was also the
                    Morgan-Belmont agreement in February, 1895, by which $62,000,000 in
                    gold was obtained from the bankers in payment for thirty-year four per cent
                    bonds. As the campaign year of 1896 drew near, it was clearly foreseen that the
                    free coinage of silver would be the one big issue. It was the subject on every
                    one's lips; the newspapers were full of it. Again and again petitions
                    were sent to congress praying for the passage of silver legislation, and free
                    coinage bills were introduced into congress galore. In the face of the popular
                    clamor, the Republicans and the conservative element among the Democrats were
                    making strenuous but futile efforts to keep party issues confined to tae Tariff.
                    How blind and mistaken was their policy is shown by the reception given at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> in June, 1896, to Bryan's populistic speech which
                    stampeded the convention.</p>
            <p>An important factor in the shaping of public opinion in favor of free coinage was
                    the publication in 1894 of a pamphlet entitled <hi rend="i">Coin's
                        Financial School.</hi> It purported to be <pb n="54" id="VAA4025-015-1-062"/> an account of a series of platform lectures delivered in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> by a young and brilliant financier, Coin, to a class of prominent
                    local and national business men. By apt illustrations and well-turned remarks
                    Coin answers their objections, parries their thrusts and overwhelms them with
                    arguments in favor of free silver. There was much superficial reasoning and
                    charlatanism, as well as much that was sound in the book, but it was read by
                    farmers, laborers, business men, college professors, and it converted thousands.</p>
            <p>In 1895 an extraordinary session of the State central committee was called for
                    September 2. A. E. Taubeneck, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, the chairman of the national executive committee was present and
                    made the principal address. The chief significance of the meeting lay in the
                    platform which was formulated. This document in the main contained none but
                    already well-worn populistic doctrines. The free and unlimited coinage of silver
                    at the ration of 16 to 1 was demanded, as well as the issuance of legal tender
                    treasury notes to the amount of $50 per capita, a guaranteed income
                    tax and the initiative and referendum. The issuance of interest bearing bonds
                    and bank currency, the recent deal of the administration with the bankers and
                    the decision against the income tax were bitterly denounced.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were rumors afloat at this meeting of fusion with the Prohibitionists, but
                    even if the rumors were not exaggerated in the newspaper reports through
                    political bias,<hi rend="sup">5</hi> there is nothing to indicate that they were
                    anything more than the merest gossip.</p>
            <p>For the campaign of 1896 the Populists in Indiana had a good State organization.
                    Besides the State central committee, at the head of which was N. T. Butts<hi rend="sup">1</hi> of Winchester with F. J. S. Robinson of Cloverland as
                    secretary, there were local organizations in practically all of the counties.
                    Never were prospects brighter for a Populist victory than in 1896. Among the

            <p>While the question of fusion with the Prohibitionists was insignificant, one of
                    the great issues confronting the Populists In the late summer and fall of 1896
                    was the problem of amalgamation with the Democrats. In order to understand this
                    development it will be necessary first, to say a word in regard to the
                    respective national conventions of the Democrats and Populists, and second, to
                    review briefly the events of the Popalist State convention.</p>
            <p>As has been pointed out the date of the national convention had been set for July
                    22, 1896. The time of meeting was purposely set for a date subsequent to the
                    holding of the two other conventions in order for it to be ascertained what
                    action the two old parties, particularly the Democrats, would take. It would be
                    beyond the scope of this paper to give any detaned account of the proceedings at
                    the Democratic convention at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The reader is familiar with the exciting events of that convention
                    culminating in Bryan's dramatic speech which won for him the
                    nomination. When the Populist convention that two weeks later it was found that
                    there was no more desirable nor acceptable candidate among the Populists
                    themselves than Bryan, the Democratic nominee. It was the nomination by the
                    Democrats, however, of Arthur Sewall, a rich shipoader and ex-banker, for
                    Vice-President which constituted the Gordian knot. Sewall was as much an object
                    of hatred if the eyes of the Populists as Bryan was a Messiah.</p>
            <p>Sewall being unacceptable the convention was obliged to look about for other
                    vice-presidential timber. Mort C. Rankin, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was the first to suggest to the convention the plan of nominating
                    a southern man with Bryan,<hi rend="sup">6</hi> and S. W. Williams, of <placeName>

            <p>It was under these circumstances that the Populist, State convention met July 28
                    at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. From the start it was seen that a struggle was to ensue between
                    the fusionists and the anti-fusionists, or
                    "middle-of-the-roaders" as they had come to be called. Upon
                    the convention rested, to a great extent, the responsibility of deciding whether
                    the party was to be absorbed by the Democrats or preserve its identity. The
                    majority of the Populists, while flattered by the fact that the Democrats were
                    now in a position where they must come to them on bended knees, and although
                    naturally drawn to the Deomcrats because of common hostility toward the
                    Republicans were afraid nevertheless that amalgamation with a third party would
                    mean the death-blow of Populism.</p>
            <p>Much was made by the enemies of the party of an agreement alleged to have been
                    made at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> between the Populists and Democrats. A speech made by D. H.
                    Femnandes, of Anderson, State member of the national executive committee,
                    setting forth a plan whereby the electors in the various States were to be
                    Democratic or Populistic according to the strength of their respective parties,
                    was magnified and construed by the Republicans to mean that the Populists were
                    to be repaid for their nomination of Bryan by the withdrawal of Sewall.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While there doubtless was an agreement made between the national committee of the
                    two parties at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in regard to presidential electors, we may reject this second
                    conclusion as an effort on the part of the Republicans to discredit both
                    parties. What was particularly gilling, the Republicans insinuated further that
                    Sewall was not as distasteful to the Populists as they would have it believed.</p>
            <p>All during the time of the convention the Democrats were hanging on the outskirts
                    ready and willing to bargain. At one point in the deliberations Franklin

                    for the endorsement by the Populists of the Democratic State ticket in return

            </p>
            <p>The Populists were disposed to turn a cold shoulder to the advances of the
                    Democrats. They realized, it was true, that both the Democrats and the Populists
                    agreed on the vital issues. As a matter of fact, the only points on which they
                    differed were those of government ownership, fiat paper money, and the
                    sub-treasury plan. Then again fusion would mean no separate campaign fund since
                    the Democrats would pay the expenses of speakers, etc.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> On
                    the other hand they saw that fusion would make it impossible for Populists to
                    fight for local tickets, it would destroy the Populist press and in case of the
                    election of Bryan would make it out of place for them to demand appointments.</p>
            <p>It was evident that the Populists had the best of the bargain. The way affairs
                    had shaped themselves, they had everything to gain and little to lose. It was
                    the Democrats now whose turn it was to look well to their fences. This accounts
                    for the serene attitude of the Populists in the convention and the speedy rout
                    of the fusionists. It was small wonder that the efforts of the Democrats to
                    prevent the setting up of a Populist State ticket and to get their own endorsed
                    came to nothing. The case with reference to the presidential electors was no
                    different, even though we leave out of account the Vice-Presidential imbroglio.
                    By putting independent electoral tickets in the field it was possible for the
                    Populists to deprive Bryan of a majority of the electors even though he had a
                    majority of the aggregate vote.</p>
            <p>With the exception of an anti-fusion plank declaring that "the
                    People's party of Indiana is emphatically in favor of maintaining its
                    organisation national State and local," there was little in the
                    platform that was new.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

            <p>The sub-treasury plan, advocated in 1892 was not mentioned.</p>
            <p>Although a plank which might be construed as anti-fusionist was adopted, the
                    convention took one very important step toward amalgamation with the Democrats.
                    The middle-of-the-roaders, who dominated the convention, had won out not only in
                    getting a State ticket put up but also by defeating the plan of endorsing the
                    Democratic platform. Partial success attended the efforts of their adversaries,
                    however, when, near the close of the convention came the appointment of a
                    conference committee to decide upon the selection of presidential electors.</p>
            <p>On July 28, late in the day a resolution had been moved "that the
                    convention appoint a conference committee, â€¦ to confer with the
                    Democratic State central committee â€¦ to the end that we secure
                    â€¦ the overthrow of the Republican party and the present gold
                    standard." After a fight which lasted until one o'clock in the
                    morning the resolution was lost and the following adopted: "Resolved,
                    that this convention appoint a committee consisting of one in each congressional
                    district to have power to act for this convention in the <list type="footnotes">

                                never be equal except for a short time to the debt. The debt
                                increases through the accumulation of interest and the medium
                                decreased by wear and tear.</p>
                            <p>As an alternative to the above financial policy the unrestricted
                                coinage of gold and silver was demanded at the ratio of 16 to 1.</p>
                            <p>Other demands were, the ownership and operation of all natural
                                monopolies, railroads, telegraph, telephone, etc., by the
                                government, the initiative and referendum, industrial arbitration
                                and the increase of the volume of money to correspond to the needs
                                of business.</p>
                            <p>The old demand for exemption of bona-fide indebtedness from taxation
                                was reiterated together with equal representation of all parties on
                                election boards. The party also declared in favor of the reduction
                                of officials salaries to correspond to the fall in prices, the
                                enforcement of the laws prohibiting child labor, and the granting of

                    Thomas E. Watson the candidate for Vice-President; that Bryan was the Democratic
                    candidate for President and Arthur Sewall the candidate for Vice-President. (2)
                    That there were to be the same and identical names of electors on both tickets.
                    (3) That each party was to select one-half of the electoral candidates: the
                    Populists those in districts with even numbers and the Democrats those in
                    districts with odd numbers. (4) That after the election and prior to the State
                    meeting of electors a committee of four count the electors voted for under the
                    Bryan and Sewall column and then those under the Bryan and Watson column. As
                    between Sewall and Watson the largest Bryan electoral vote was to elect.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To meet this proposition the Democrats had no better offer than the yielding of
                    four electors provided the Populists would withdraw their State ticket. The
                    Populists met this by contending that the State convention had delegated to the
                    committee of thirteen, power only in regard to electors. Therefore they had no
                    authority to withdraw the State ticket.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> In the same way
                    the Democrats met the demand for the withdrawal of Sewall by arguing that the
                    Democratic State committee had no authority over Sewall. In spite of what the
                    Populists had said in regard to their State ticket they offered to withdraw it
                    provided they might have all fifteen electors. This proposal the Democrats
                    rejected. After an evening's haggling the two parties were no nearer an
                    agreement than before.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>

            <p>The above was the work of a committee of three appointed by the committee of

                    committee of thirteen, were being bribed by the Republicans to use their
                    influence in preventing fusion. Silas M. Shepherd, it was said, was approached
                    by a man who offered him a generous salary for such services. L. W. Hubbell, of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Pulaski county</region>
                    </placeName>, and Julius Rosenheiner, it was alleged, were also approached.
                    Naturally, most of the charges appeared in the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> while
                    the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> was silent on the subject. However, the <hi rend="i">News</hi>, the independent organ, came out on September 20 with a
                    bitter editorial denouncing the attempted corruption.</p>
            <p>Thus the whole affair hung fire until the last of September. The Populists seemed
                    to know their mind well in regard to one thing at least and that was that they
                    would not support Sewall. To a man the party supported the <hi rend="i">Nonconformist</hi> in its stand that Sewall get off the ticket.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> One reason for this attitude was that fusion meant
                    repudiation of Watson. The attitude of Watson toward the whole fusion movement,
                    more or less prevalent over the whole country, can well be imagined.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> In a telegram sent to Governor Claude X. Matthews, Watson
                    had said, "On principle I am dead against fusion with Sewall electors.
                    Where I submit to fusion I do so under protest."<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The explanation of the Democratic overtures is, that they felt themselves in
                    pretty much of a dilemma. Watson was as obnoxious to them as Sewall was to the
                    Populists. Then, too, they were loath to repudiate Sewall since he was the only
                    real Democrat on the ticket, even barring his protectionist proclivities. On the
                    other hand, alienation of the third party men in the close States would be very
                    apt to mean a Democratic defeat.</p>
            <p>Nor were the Populists insensible of the gravity of the situation from their
                    point of view. They realized that fusion would make strong the chances of
                    Bryan's election, resulting in the partial triumph of their principles.
                    But they realized, too, that partial success meant total oblivion so far as
                    their independent party existence was concerned. Fusion meant that all would be
                    staked on the election of Bryan.</p>

            <p>These arrangements, it must be understood, were not as yet ratified by the
                    Democratic State committee. In one sense they may be considered final inasmuch
                    as they were not subsequently changed yet the Democrats were not satisfied.
                    Though urged by Chairman Jones, of the Democratic national committee, to accept
                    the terms of fusion offered, the committee still declined because the Populist
                    State ticket remained up.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> It is not surprising, therefore,
                    that the next ten days saw strenuous efforts put forth by the Democrats towards
                    inducing the Populists to withdraw their State ticket. Numerous conferences in
                    committee were held and the air was thick with political intrigue. The Populists
                    were given to understand that they could hope for no further concessions as long
                    as their State ticket was up. On this point the Democratic reasoning was as
                    follows: In 1894 the Democrats cast 238,000 votes in Indiana, the Populists cast
                    30,000, about one-eighth as many; yet the Populists wanted one-third of the
                    electors when they already had more than one-third of the congressional
                    nominees, and in the legislature fusions in every case had the best of the

            <p>The fusionists left no stone unturned in trying to prevail upon the candidates on
                    the State ticket to withdraw. On October 8, Julius Rosenheiner, the new chairman
                    of the State committee called the State executive committee and the candidates
                    together at the English Hotel. Here M. C. Rankin endeavored to persuade the
                    candidates to withdraw. He pointed out that if the State ticket came down five
                    of the Bryan electors would give way to five straight Populists. Threats and
                    pressure of various sorts proving unavailing it was arranged to have the
                    candidates call on W. J. Bryan who, on his presidential campaign tour through
                    the State, happened to be in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> at the time. Although Bryan at his hotel had retired for the night
                    at ten o'clock, the candidates were taken into his presence and briefly
                    addressed by him.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> Bryan's remarks were
                    characteristic. He said the work of fusion, begun at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, had been completed in every State except Indiana. Nothing should
                    stand in the way, he said, of unity and harmony of the forces fighting the
                    battles of the people against the gold standard.</p>
            <p>After this talk with Bryan the candidates were requested to confer among
                    themselves and then say definitely what action they would take.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> The whole proceeding failed to impress them.</p>
            <p>All efforts to put the State ticket out of the way was cut short when, on October
                    8, Silas M. Holcomb, the Populist candidate for secretary of state, filed in the
                    governor's office the certificates of nomination. A few days later the
                    electoral ticket of ten Democrats and five Populists was filed. Thus the only
                    possible way in which the State ticket could be disposed of was by the
                    resignation of the candidates. Naturally this could hardly be expected, since
                    the candidates were practically all middle-of-the-road men.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The filing of the certificates of nomination threw the Democrats into a new
                    dilemma. The acceptance of the combination Populist ticket would be greatly to
                    their advantage, inasmuch as many voters, wishing to vote for the five Populist
                    electors would at the same time vote a straight ticket under the rooster,
                    thereby giving the Democratic State ticket the <list type="footnotes">

                    electoral ticket were rejected, each party putting up straight tickets, many
                    Populists having no incentive now for marking the ballot under the rooster would
                    vote a straight ticket under the plow and hammer thereby giving the Populist
                    State ticket the benefit.</p>
            <p>But there was still another consideration. The acceptance of fusion would
                    alienate votes from Bryan and Sewall since many persons would not vote a ticket
                    with Populist names on it.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Meanwhile the question of fusion continued the one big issue throughout the
                    State. At <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> fusion was accomplished by the nomination of two Democratic
                    senators, three Democratic representatives and two Populist representatives,<hi rend="sup">37</hi> By October 10, fusion had been accomplished in every one
                    of the close legislative districts.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> However, the faithful
                    in a few localities held out. In spite of the efforts of Julius Rosenheiner and
                    Mort C. Rankin the Populists at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> declined to fuse.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> But such cases were few and
                    isolated. Fusion was the order of the day.</p>
            <p>Now that fusion had been accomplished, various were the characterizations of it
                    by its enemies and bitter were the denunciations heaped upon the leaders who had
                    brought it about. The partial fusion in the matter of the presidential electors
                    and the outright amalgamation in many local districts were said to be the
                    shameless work of mercenary leaders and not of the masses.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>
                    The middle-of-the-road men led by Claude X. Matthews, the editor of the <hi rend="i">Nonconformist</hi>, the national organ of the party, declared that
                    fusion was a mercantile betrayal of Watson at the behest of the national
                        committee.<hi rend="sup">41</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another charge was that the fusion which had taken place was illegal. On the
                    Populist ticket it was pointed out were ten names never nominated by a Populist
                    convention and on the Democratic ticket were five names never nominated by a
                    Democratic convention. There were three ways only, it was contended, in which a
                    ticket could be nominated: by a nominating convention, with the ticket certified
                    by the chairman <list type="footnotes">

                    primary election ticket certified by the chairman and the secretary of the
                    county committee; or by a petition containing at least five hundred names.</p>
            <p>Then again, the fact that there were names appearing twice on the
                    ballotâ€”once in the Populist column and once in the Democratic
                    columnâ€”was urged as a violation of Section â€˜19 of the
                    election law which provided that the name of no candidate appear on two tickets
                    or on the ballot in two places.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole matter was a knotty problem without exact precedent and one which
                    presented many difficulties. No legal action was ever taken to determine the
                    illegality of the fusionist arrangements and so the situation was allowed to
                    drift until election day.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The results of the election held November 3 were awaited with the keenest
                    interest. Party feeling ran high and there was much excitement. It was the fad
                    among the farmers in various parts of the State to put up signs in front of
                    their homes bearing the motto, "16-to-1."<hi rend="sup">44</hi> The widespread interest in the issues involved, and the publicity given
                    to political affairs by the dickering and haggling over fusion, brought out an
                    unusually full vote. The returns on the Populist State ticket, however, were
                    disappointing. Scarcely one-fourth of the Populists voted the middle-of-the-road
                    State ticket, although all voted for Bryan and for the fusionist county
                        ticket.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> Thomas Wadsworth, the candidate for governor,
                    received only 8,626 votes, about 1.3 per cent, of the total. The vote cast for
                    the other candidates did not vary much from that figure. In the legislative
                    districts, as the result of fusion, the Populists achieved some successes. They
                    managed to elect one State senator, W. B. Gill, and sent eight representatives
                    to the lower house.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> In the secretary of state's
                    abstract of vote all these men were listed as Democrats.</p>

                    fusion with the Democrats in 1896 sounded the death knell of the party. Never

            <p>However, after the election the workers in the movement, undaunted, proceeded to
                    reorganize and take stock of their forces. The fight for free silver, they felt,

                    delegates gathered in conference on December 29 at the Hotel English, <placeName>

                    skirmishing between the fusionists headed by Julius Rosenheiner and the
                    middle-of-the-roaders led by Newell H. Motsinger. Rosenheiner had taken care
                    that the call was cleverly worded so as to apply "to all silver
                    advocates," consequently many "half-breeds" were
                    present. Motsinger, always spoiling for a fight, led the attack on Rosenheiner
                    with a view to procuring his resignation from the office of chairman of the
                    State committee. Rosenheiner only sat tight, however, reminding his foes that he
                    was on the job to stay until 1898. Consequently the Motsinger forces were
                    defeated. A set of harmless resolutions mainly educational in their nature were
                    adopted to the effect that "all organizations of whatever name or
                    party, having the same patriotic purposes ought to be encouraged" and
                    that clubs be formed throughout the State without reference to party
                    affiliations for the purpose of studying economic questions.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> Motsinger insisted on having these called the
                    "People's party clubs" but was outvoted. The trend of
                    the meeting is apparent. From now on until the day of its gradual decay and
                    death, the People's party was to be torn by two factions, the
                    middle-of-the-roaders and the fusionists.</p>

            <p>After 1896 the decline of the People's party was rapid. The party, torn
                    by internal dissensions, saw its following melt away, the individuals, for the
                    most part, returning whence they came. However, after the wreck of 1896, the
                    more optimistic element in the party looked forward with high hopes to the
                    election of 1900. Bryan, they thought, coming so near the presidency in 1896
                    would acquire a strength by 1900 sufficient for his triumph. In the years from
                    1896 to 1900, however, conditions arose which conspired to disappoint them.
                    Beginning with 1896 a tide of prosperity set in which cut the ground from under
                    the Populists' feet. The pendulum was now on the return swing. Prices
                    rose and trade assumed normal proportions. The discovery of gold in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="aku">Alaska</region>
                    </placeName> assured an abundant supply of money and robbed of its point the
                    strongest plank in the Populist platform. Consequently the emphasis in the later
                    history of the party ceased to be on economic matters but instead the main
                    issues come to be political. The initiative and referendum especially came in
                    for a large share of attention as did also woman's suffrage and the
                    direct election of public officials. Within the party itself the great
                    disrupting influence was the question of fusion.</p>
            <p>In the State convention of 1898,<hi rend="sup">1</hi> held on February 22, a
                    fight early developed between the middle-of-the-roaders and the fusionists. The
                    former faction was led by Newell H. Mot-singer, editor of the Shoals <hi rend="i">Referendum</hi>, while the fusionists were ably headed by Julius
                    Rosenheiner, chairman of the State central committee.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                    Motsinger came to the convention with a solid delegation of one hundred and
                    seventeen men at his back.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> In securing this following he
                    had shrewdly taken advantage of a loophole in the call. The call, instead of
                    basing the representation in the convention upon the Populist vote in previous
                    years, permitted the attendance of one delegate from each township and ward.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Motsinger by more strictly and efficiently complying with
                    the terms of the call than the leaders in the other districts, was able to

                    convention. The middle-of-the-roaders were intent upon the accomplishment of two
                    things. In the first place they wanted to get rid of the then sitting national
                    committeemen, D. H. Fernandes, Joshua Strange and W. S. Austin, who had been
                    connected with the disastrous deal with the Democrats in 1896. These men were
                    wanted off the national committee in order to make way for others who would help
                    reorganize the committee against <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Bryan. The right to do this was based on a resolution of the
                    national convention allowing State conventions to elect committees.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> The ideal of the middle-of-the-roaders was a straight
                    national ticket in 1900. Then, secondly, they wanted a resolution against fusion
                    on State, county, and township tickets.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Fusion, they
                    claimed would lead to the further ruin of the party; at any rate, if it was to
                    be taken up at all it was a question to be decided by the counties and local
                    districts. These units knew what was best for them, and the State convention had
                    no right to interfere with their affairs.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The matter of the national committeemen was finally settled by the re-election of
                    Joshua Strange and W. S. Austin and the election of A. G. Burkhardt to take the
                    place of D. H. Fernandes. Two fusionists were thus left on the committee, yet is
                    was practically a victory for Motsinger. The whole affair simply amounted to the
                    ditching of Fernandes.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Co-workers with Rosenheiner in opposition to the anti-fusionists were Editor

                    fusionists believed in keeping up the party organization, but in using it mainly
                    as a club to enforce Democratic compliance. This was the stand taken by Marion
                    Butler, the national chairman.</p>

                    called for.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> The convention also demanded a maximum legal
                    rate of interest of six per cent. Further, it expressed itself as opposed to
                    "government by injunction" and in favor of the election of
                    federal judges by direct vote of the people. Other demands were, that county
                    school superintendents be elected by popular vote, that the soldiers be paid the
                    difference between the money they were paid in and coin and that public printing
                    be let to the lowest bidder. One plank in the platform denounced the Republican

                        <country reg="cu">Cuba</country>
                    </placeName>, whose independence was demanded. In regard to the old demand for
                    free coinage of silver, a plank bordering upon evasiveness was adopted. The
                    Populist party was declared "the only party in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> which was a unit for the free coinage of silver at the ratio of 16
                    to 1." Harmless as this declaration was, the Motsinger faction tried

            <p>Motsinger and his followers were successful, however, in pushing through a

                    be put out carrying simon pure candidates under the party's name and

            <p>It would be tedious and unprofitable to give a detailed account of the further
                    activities of the party in the period from 1900 until its lingering death, a few
                    years later. State conventions were regularly held up to 1908, candidates
                    nominated and platforms constructed. The party's demands continued in
                    the same strain as beforeâ€”governmental reform, greater power for the
                    people, denunciation of monopoly in all its forms, and justice to labor. The
                    following of the party gradually dwindled away until only a few faithfuls
                    remained. In 1902 the vote cast for the head of the ticket, William B. Gill,<hi rend="sup">7</hi> was only 1,350. In 1904 Leroy Templeton, for Governor,
                    rallied 2,065 voters to his standard, but in 1906 the following of John W.
                    Clark, the candidate for secretary of state, sank to 972. The number of votes
                    polled by Benjamin F. Wheeler in 1908 was but 1,193.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A noteworthy plank in the platform of 1902 demanded that the legislature, under
                    Article V of the Federal Constitution, force the calling of a national
                    constitutional amendment to provide for the election of <placeName>

            <p>The Populist party may be considered a phase of that radicalism in American
                    politics which began in the Granger movement of the seventies and eighties, and

                    "reform" and railroad legislation; of the Greenbackers,
                    "reform" and fiat money. Combining these principles into a
                    single movement, the Populists added others which, in time, constituted the
                    chief demands of the Progressives. The direct election of <placeName>

                    </placeName> senators, the initiative and referendum, woman's suffrage
                    and the inheritance and income taxâ€”the most important planks in the
                    Progressive platformâ€”were all old Populist demands.</p>
            <p>Indirectly the Populist party was the successor to the earlier Greenback and the
                    Union Labor parties, but directly it was the outgrowth of the Farmers'
                    Alliance. The Alliance, after having tried in vain to graft itself into one of
                    the old parties entered independently into the political field. The Populist
                    party was the result. The other agrarian organizations were so far eclipsed by
                    the alliance that their influence was almost negligible, yet an important
                    relation existed. H. E. Taubeneck, speaking, in 1891, said: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            industrial masses the principles of economic government that we call
                            for. All of these organizations are working for a common end and the
                            People's party reaches out and takes them all in. The
                            People's party most certainly expects to get out a national
                            ticket and it will receive hearty support from Alliance men and members
                            of the F.M.B.A. This can be done and still these organizations will
                            retain their individuality and separate organizations.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

            <p>As a matter of fact, as later events proved, these organizations did not retain
                    their individuality, the Alliance, particularly, being wrecked on the rocks of
                    party politics.</p>
            <p>The Populist party was pre-eminently a farmers' party. Because of the
                    superficial resemblance between the demands of the farmers and those of the
                    laborers, efforts were made to include in the movement the labor element. But
                    such an alliance was necessarily doomed to early dissolution. The fundamental
                    differences between the two classes were too great and the common interests too
                    few to admit of complete amalgamation. In fact, labor leaders openly objected to
                    participating in the Alliance on the ground that it was too agricultural. What
                    the Populist party lacked in the view of the <list type="footnotes">

                    Hence, in the middle nineties one sees the beginnings of a new party, the party
                    of the wage-earner, which within a few years grew to a strength rivalling that
                    of the Populist party in its palmiest days. Significant, and more than a mere
                    coincidence, is the fact that simultaneously with the decline of Populism
                    occurred the rise of Socialism.</p>
            <p>While there was doubtless much that was unsound in Populism, the importance of
                    the movement is best shown by the fact that the wildest dreams of the Populists
                    of yesterday have become the commonplaces of today. Many of their demands, if
                    not actually matters of legal enactment, at least hold a favorable place in
                    public opinion. Debtors' exemption from taxation, the income tax,
                    postal savings banks, the initiative and referendum, direct election of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senators, the inheritance tax, industrial arbitration, municipal
                    ownership, six per cent legal interest, woman's suffrageâ€”all
                    important and persistent planks in the Populists' platformsâ€”
                    are now incorporated into either State or national law. Even the sub-treasury
                    plan, considered at the time the most radical and absurd of the
                    farmers' ideas, finds a present-day counterpart in the farm loan and
                    credit act of 1916. Though differing in method, the two plans aim to accomplish
                    much the same thing, and strike at the same weakness in our agricultural system.</p>
            <p>Whatever our political convictions by nature or nurture, we cannot doubt the
                    sincerity of the Populist movement. The men in 1890 who launched the new party
                    were convinced that a real danger threatened the republic. Though their action
                    was inspired by the interests of a class, that class, to their mind, constituted
                    the backbone and hope of the nation. It was the battle of the masses against the
                    selfish interests of the few.</p>

            <p>This is a most difficult piece of work to characterize. If it were all sketched
                    on a large map of Indiana it would give us an invaluable pioneer map of the
                    State. Mr. Wilson has gone over the surveyors' notes for the State,
                    locating roads, trails, posts of all kinds, with distances and dates. In
                    addition he has searched our pioneer literature and thereby identified many of
                    the references of the surveyors. The monograph represents an enormous amount of
                    tedious detail work; such, moreover, as only a practical surveyor could do. The
                    footnotes not only give full source references but much additional information.
                    Among the many traces located are the Buffalo trace, Vallonia trace,
                        <geogName>Blue River</geogName> trace, Yellowbanks trail, Redbanks trail,
                    Salt trace, Whetzel's trace. Part II of the work is devoted to the
                    actual surveying, commencing with Clark's Grant surveyed by William
                    Clark soon after the Greenville treaty down to the last surveys in the Kankakee
                    swamps by Jeremiah Smith about 1835. It is a work of genuine scholarship, and it
                    might be added there is very little of such work being done at present.</p>

            <p>There are included in the volume twenty-three speeches by Mr. Griffiths. Most
                    interesting for Indiana readers are the addresses: Abraham Lincoln, Benjamin
                    Harrison, A Great Teacher (Catharine Merrill), Indiana, The American Spirit, The
                    American in Fiction, and Nathan Morris. Most Indianians will remember Mr.
                    Griffiths as an extremely pleasing <pb n="76" id="VAA4025-015-1-084"/> political
                    orator. There was no trace of bitterness in his political oratory. In this
                    respect he much resembled William McKinley, R. W. Thompson or Henry S. Lane. He
                    rarely if ever dealt in political partisanship and never descended to
                    personalities. His reputation rests on his work as consul at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> where he helped as much as any other individual except John Hay to
                    clear away the national prejudices that had existed for a century between the
                    English and Americans. His broad scholarship, especially in literary lines,
                    fitted him especially for this position. It is to his credit that he secured and
                    held the high esteem of the English without losing that of the Americans. From
                    time to time he added new friends to his list but never at the sacrifice of the
                    old. He was a loyal Hoosier, a loyal American, a loyal Anglo-American and a
                    loyal Republican and never lost his loyalty to his home city of <placeName>

            <p>Senator Kern was born near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kokomo</settlement>
                    </placeName> December 20, 1849 and died at a sanatorium in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Asheville</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the fall of 1917. His life was one long, unbroken political
                    struggle. In that respect he has had few equals, beginning before he was old
                    enough to vote, and ending with the day of his death. The rise and decline of
                    the Greenback, Granger, Populist and Progressive parties fell within the active
                    period of his career and though he sympathized with each he never broke
                    connections with the Democratic party. He belonged to the army of the Regulars,
                    though always, I think, a radical. He ran on the same ticket with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, with Bryan, with Parker and with Wilson. On this account he has
                    been charged with a lack of integrity, or in other words with subordinating his
                    principles to his desire for office. Such a charge is both unjust and
                    unnecessary. He was a party man, a regular who fought under discipline. During
                    the long period of his service he held office as Reporter of the Supreme Court,
                    1885â€“1889, State Senator, 1892â€“1896; <placeName>

                    </placeName> senator 1911â€“1917, rewards entirely incommensurate with
                    his long, loyal service to his party. Not only as a stump campaigner was Senator
                    Kern available at all times, <pb n="77" id="VAA4025-015-1-085"/> but several
                    times he was drafted by his party to lead a forlorn hope, the most thankless
                    task in political life. The reviewer recalls an incident of the campaign of
                    1900. He was connected with the county Republican organization of one of the
                    southern counties. A business meeting was in session and about fifty of the
                    leading Republican politicians present when about 7:30 it was learned for the
                    first time that Mr. Kern was to speak that night at the local opera house. The
                    Republicans rushed their business through and attended the speaking in a body,
                    in the meantime 25 or 30 local Republicans uniting with the crowd. After a very
                    pleasant speech in which the Republican plutocrats were handled in the usual
                    style a reception was held and I remember the amused expression of the face of
                    Mr. Kern as he shook hands with Republican after Republican, the Democratic
                    secretary being very careful in every case to tell the politics of each. After
                    the reception a social good time of two hours was had with Mr. Kern chief
                    entertainer. It was an intentional freeze-out by the Democratic organization but
                    Mr. Kern, whatever he felt, showed no signs of displeasure or soreness.</p>
            <p>The Democratic party has had since the Civil War, an unequal contest in Indiana.
                    Throughout, Senator Kern has conducted himself in such a way as to retain the
                    faith of his party friends and hold the personal friendship and good will of his
                    opponents. He was a good fighter but uniformly fair, his influence and example
                    always on the side of political morality. In the disgraceful senatorial election
                    of 1909, although the victim of underhand politics, he preserved his good faith
                    and honor, though one might wish he had shown as much zeal in hunting down the
                    criminals as he did in the case of the election of Lorimer of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. In extenuation it may be said that if there were any similarity
                    between the two cases Mr. Kern was in a position to do his duty in the latter
                    case and did it while in the former he was not. His service in the U. S. Senate
                    was brief, 1911â€“1917, but long enough to earn a place with the best
                    of Indiana senators. Whatever honor may attach to the work of the Wilson
                    administration will be shared in large degree by Senator Kern. Any one
                    acquainted with the political history of Congress knows what a difficult and
                    thankless task it is to manage a party with a small majority. The reviewer spent

                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>

                    some matters of historical interest in which he very much desired the assistance
                    of Senator Kern and although he met the Senator several times and saw him often
                    he never presented his letters of introduction or mentioned his business.
                    Senator Kern seemed the busiest man in <placeName>

                    </placeName> and rarely slept over six hours, if so much, out of the
                    twenty-four.</p>
            <p>Mr. Bowers, the author of the book under review, is a well-known newspaper man of
                    Indiana. For a quarter of a century he has been in close touch with Indiana
                    politics. He was secretary to Senator Kern and in sympathy with the
                    senator's views. While the whole volume is thus sympathetic there is no
                    offensive partiality, no long arguments so often indulged in by apologists to
                    prove his hero always in the right. The reviewer, as has been intimated, was not
                    a follower of Senator Kern but he has not found a single expression in the
                    volume at which offense could be taken. Mr. Bowers is a graceful writer, his
                    style is clear and simple. The volume should rank with Mr. Foulke's <hi rend="i">Life of Morton</hi> as one of the two best contributions to Indiana
                    biographical and political literature.</p>

                    averaging 40 pages each. The whole series is tinged with a political cast which
                    indirectly reflects the deep and consistent interest of the people in things
                    political. In dealing with so large a unit the author necessarily uses wide
                    generalizations each of which is open to grave exceptions. Time and again he
                    insists on the conservatism of the people as a whole. How he arrives at his
                    conclusions is not always shown. He points out that Grangers, Greenbackers,
                    Populists and Progressives are all native to the place but continues that the
                    West was merely flirting with these. As a matter of fact the dreams of the
                    fathers are nearly always realized by the children and the visions of the
                    agitators referred to above are practically all now on our state and national

                    the western historians. One is left with the suspicion that somewhere in the
                    background are the busy millions of whose busy life and thought these clubs,
                    societies and activities are merely surface indications, merely driftwood on the

                    years ago, on the breezy terrace of one of the handsomest villas in the lake
                    region, I talked with the head of a great industry whose products are known
                    round the world." It is hardly necessary to point out that conclusions
                    drawn from such sources are liable to be over colored. The picture of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> is open to the same general objection. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> does not live on the boulevards nor sit in the music halls nor
                    picture galleries. It lives in the smoke, grime and sweat of the factories and
                    counting houses. The life of the west and of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> is not play but work, a hard continuous struggle. I have enjoyed
                    the "big-brother" hospitality of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> but the west knows that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> takes a heavy toll of its manhood and womanhood as well as of its
                    wealth. But these things can not all be told in a magazine article. Mr. Draper
                    who, and not Dr. Thwaites, was the founder of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> Historical library, spent a lifetime collecting materials for a
                    history of the life of the west and the work is only begun. A careful study of
                    this material would have so far improved Mr. Nicholson's perspective
                    that all doubts of the continual improvement of the west would have disappeared.
                    Its pulse is as strong and steady as ever and its home life, politics and
                    general culture better as the years pass. It has its problems, many of which are
                    national, and in the solution of these it has little regard for any other
                    section. However, one may disagree with many of the statements Mr. Nicholson is
                    a vigorous writer. His birds-eye review will arouse healthy thought. It is
                    better perhaps to write of the more pleasant things even at the expense of fact,
                    of the social settlement rather than of the slum, of George Ade's golf
                    course and swimming pool than of the distressing tenements that still disfigure
                    too many of our western farms.</p>

            <p>This is a high school text following the general lines of the best teaching
                    practice in civics. The authors have included what is best in the late tendency
                    toward emphasizing local institutions without at the same time neglecting
                    national institutions. The writers have resisted two well-defined departures in
                    civic teaching which seem to have carried so many teachers beyond the point of
                    good practice. One of these was to neglect the national field almost entirely in
                    their zeal to be practical. The other was that government could be corrected and
                    purified by devices. This resort to devices vitiated much of our teaching during
                    the last decade. The authors emphasize the fact that the chiefest concern
                    politically of all good citizens is in the national government and the other
                    equally important fact that good government can not be had without social
                    honesty and intelligence. The text begins with the citizen himself and gradually
                    widens to the local, state and national governments. The volume is well-written,
                    clear and full. Marginal texts, topical heads, suggestive questions and
                    supplementary readings help to make it an attractive text for teacher and pupil.
                    Sixty-four illustrations, many of them full page and twelve maps and charts
                    assist greatly in giving definiteness to the topics. It should find wide use
                    among up-to-date high schools.</p>
