                        <head>AN ANSWER TO RILEY&apos;S &quot;DEER CRICK.&quot;</head>
                        <p>It is coming to be pretty generally conceded that Indiana people are
                            capable of excellent work in all kinds of literature, and particularly
                            in poetry. It is not to be denied that there is very much poetry written
                            by Indiana writers that is not good; indeed, some of it is very bad. But
                            that is true of the literary people of all parts of the world. Out of
                            the mass that is constantly tumbling into the hopper of the daily and
                            weekly press there is much that is worthy of preservation. Writing verse
                            seems to come as natural to many Indianians as to write anything, and to
                            do it well. It is so easy, some think. It is too easy for some. But,
                            altogether, the people of the Hoosier State have no reason to be ashamed
                            of the productions of their favorites. An incident happened, recently,
                            illustrative of the facility with which the aver-age native of Indiana
                            turns to poetry. Mr. James Whit-comb Riley had been to lecture at some
                            town in the Kankakee region, probably at Kentland, and after his
                            departure his auditors got to discussing the merits of his productions,
                            excerpts from which he had read to make up his entertainment. There were
                            those who regarded him as a genius, while others were as firmly
                            persuaded that his work was &quot;just as easy,&quot; and any
                            one could make the same kind of verse ad lib. His dialect, while it
                            stirred up a good deal of admiration, was regarded as something that any
                            properly-constituted man could duplicate on order. To put it to the
                            test, one of his auditors set himself about doing a little,
                            &quot;just for a joke,&quot; going home and finishing up the
                            poem before he retired for the night. That he did not make a failure of
                            it altogether may be seen from the following, which is the poem he
                            produced:</p>

                        <p>There are crudities in it, as might have been expected; but on the whole
                            it is a production of which the author has no reason to be ashamed. He
                            is evidently laboring under a delusion, if he thinks any one can write
                            such articles &quot;off-hand.&quot; If he does, let him try it
                            himself again, or, better, get some of his neighbors to try it. He will
                            discover that the machine won&apos;t work in that easy and graceful
                            manner every time. He may learn that he himself can&apos;t duplicate
                            it. If he can, he should be at it, for there is a grace, and rhythm, and
                            flow about it that reveals the true poetic instinct. The gentleman to
                            whom credit should be given for this poem is Mr. William W. Pfrimmer, of
                            Kentland, who is represented to be a great lover of nature, well
                            acquainted with all her ways. &quot;Ho, for the swales of the

                        <head>THE GILDED ROLL.</head>
                        <p>N<hi rend="sc">OSING</hi> around in an old boxpacked away and lost to
                            memory for yearsan hour ago, I found a musty package of gilt paper, or,
                            rather, a roll it was, with the tarnished gold of the old sheet for the
                            outer wrapper. I picked it up mechanically to toss it into some obscure
                            corner, when, carelessly lifting it by one end, a child&apos;s tin
                            whistle fell tinkling on the cellar floor. It lies before me on my
                            writing table nowand so, too, does the roll entire, though now a roll no
                            longer, for my eager fingers have rent the gilded covering, and all its
                            precious contents are spread out beneath my hungry eyes.</p>
                        <p>Here is a scroll of ink-written music. I don&apos;t read music, but I
                            know the dash and swing of the pen that raised it on the page. Here is a
                            letter, with the self-same impulse and abandon in every syllable, and
                            its melodyhowever sweet the otheris far more sweet to me. And here are
                            other letters like itthreefiveand seven, at least. Bob wrote them from
                            the front, and Billy kept them for me when I went to join him. Dear boy!
                            Dear boy!</p>
                        <pb id="VAA2439-197" n="190"/>
                        <p>Here are some cards of bristol-board. Ah! when Bob came to these there
                            were no blotches then. What faceswhat expressions! The droll,
                            ridiculous, good-for-nothing genius, with his &quot;sad
                            mouth,&quot; as he called it, &quot;upside down,&quot;
                            laughing alwaysat everything, at big rallies, and mass meetings and
                            conventions, county fairs and floral balls, booths, watermelon wagons,
                            dancing tents, the swing, daguerreian car, the &quot;lung
                            barometer,&quot; and the air-gun man. Oh! what a gifted,
                            good-for-nothing boy Bob was in those old days. And here&apos;s a
                            picture of a girlish facea very faded photographeven fresh from
                            &quot;the gallery,&quot; four-and-twenty years ago, it was a
                            faded thing. But the facehow bright and clear that was; for
                            &quot;Doc,&quot; Bob&apos;s awful name for her, was a pretty
                            girl, and brilliant, clever, lovable every way. No wonder Bob fancied
                            her! And you could see some hint of her jaunty loveliness in every fairy
                            face he drew, and you could find her happy ways and dainty tastes
                            unconsciously assumed in all he didthe books he read the poems he
                            admired, and those he wrote; and, ringing clear and pure and jubilant,
                            the vibrant beauty of her voice could clearly be defined and traced
                            through all his music. Now, there&apos;s the happy pair of themBob
                            and &quot;Doc.&quot; Make of them just whatever your good fancy
                            may <pb id="VAA2439-198" n="191"/> dictate, but keep in mind the stern,
                            relentless ways of destiny.</p>
                        <p>You are not at the beginning of a novel, only at the threshold of one of
                            a hundred experiences that lie buried in the past, and this particular
                            one most happily resurrected by these odds and ends found in the gilded
                            roll.</p>
                        <p>You see, the contents of this package, mainly, were hastily gathered
                            together after a week&apos;s visit out to the old Mills farm. The
                            gilt paper, and the whistle, and the pictures, they were
                            Billy&apos;s; the music pages, Bob&apos;s, or
                            &quot;Doc&apos;s;&quot; the letters and some other MSS. were
                            mine.</p>
                        <p>The Mills girls were great friends of &quot;Doc&apos;s,&quot;
                            and often came to visit her in town; and so &quot;Doc&quot;
                            often visited the Mills&apos;s. This is the way that Bob first got
                            out there, and won them all, and &quot;shaped the thing&quot;
                            for me, as he would put it; and lastly, we had lugged in Billy,such a
                            handy boy, you know, to hold the horses on picnic excursions, and to
                            watch the carriage and the luncheon, and all that. &quot;Yes,
                            and,&quot; Bob would say, &quot;such a serviceable boy in
                            getting all the fishing tackle in proper order, and digging bait, and
                            promenading in our wake up and down the creek all day, with the
                            minnow-bucket hanging on his arm, don&apos;t you know?&quot;</p>
                        <p>But jolly as the days were, I think jollier were <pb id="VAA2439-199"
                                n="192"/> the long evenings at the farm. After the supper in the
                            grove, where, when the weather permitted, always stood the table,
                            ankle-deep in the cool, green plush of the sward; and after the lounge
                            upon the grass, and the cigars, and the new fish stories, and the
                            general invoice of the old ones, it was delectable to get back to the
                            girls again, and in the old &quot;best room&quot; hear once more
                            the lilt of the old songs and the stacattoed laughter of the piano
                            mingling with the alto and falsetto voices of the Mills girls, and the
                            gallant soprano of the dear girl &quot;Doc.&quot;</p>
                        <p>This is the scene I want you to look in upon, as, in fancy, I do nowand
                            here are the materials for it all, husked from the gilded roll.</p>
                        <p>Bob, the master, leans at the piano now, and &quot;Doc&quot; is
                            at the keys, her glad face often thrown up sidewise toward his own. His
                            face is boyishfor there is yet but the ghost of a mustache upon his lip.
                            His eyes are dark and clear, of over-size when looking at you; but now
                            their lids are drooped over his violin whose melody has, for the time,
                            almost smoothed away the upward kinkings of the corners of his mouth.
                            And wonderfully quiet now is every one, and the chords of the piano,
                            too, are low and faltering; and so, at last, the tune itself swoons into
                            the universal hush, andBob is rasping in its stead the ridiculous <pb
                                id="VAA2439-200" n="193"/> but marvelously perfect imitation of the
                            &quot;priming&quot; of a pump, while Billy&apos;s hands
                            forget the &quot;chiggers&quot; on the bare backs of his feet,
                            as, with clapping palms, he dances round the room in ungovernable spasms
                            of delight. And then we all laugh; and Billy, taking advantage of the
                            general tumult, pulls Bob&apos;s head down and whispers,
                            &quot;Git &apos;em to stay up &apos;way late
                            to-night!&quot; And Bob, perhaps remembering that we go back home
                            to-morrow, winks at the little fellow and whispers, &quot;You let me
                            manage &apos;em! Stay up till broad daylight if we take a
                            notioneh?&quot; And Billy dances off again in newer glee, while the
                            inspired musician is plunking a banjo imitiation on his enchanted
                            instrument, which is unceremoniously drowned out by a circus tune from
                            &quot;Doc&quot; that is absolutely inspiring to every one but
                            the barefoot brother, who drops back listlessly to his old position on
                            the floor and sullenly renews operations on his
                            &quot;chigger&quot; claims.</p>
                        <p>&quot;Thought you was goin&apos; to have pop-corn tonight all so
                            fast!&quot; he says doggedly, in the midst of a momentary lull that
                            has fallen on a game of whist. And then the oldest Mills girl, who
                            thinks cards stupid anyhow, says, &quot;That&apos;s so, Billy,
                            and we&apos;re going to have it, too; and right away, for this
                            game&apos;s just ending, and I shan&apos;t <pb id="VAA2439-201"
                                n="194"/> submit to being bored with another. I say
                            &apos;popcorn&apos; with Billy! And after that,&quot; she
                            continues, rising and addressing the party in general, &quot;we must
                            have another literary and artistic tournament, and that&apos;s been
                            in contemplation and preparation long enough; so you gentlemen can be
                            pulling your wits together for the exercises, while us girls see to the
                            refreshments.&quot;</p>
                        <p>&quot;Have you done anything toward it?&quot; queries Bob, when
                            the girls are gone, with the alert Billy in their wake.</p>
                        <p>&quot;Just an outline,&quot; I reply. &quot;How with
                            you?&quot;</p>
                        <p>&quot;Clean forgot itthat is, the preparation; but I&apos;ve got
                            a little old second-handed idea, if you&apos;ll all help me out with
                            it, that&apos;ll amuse us some, and tickle Billy, I&apos;m
                            certain.&quot;</p>
                        <p>So that&apos;s agreed upon; and while Bob produces his portfolio,
                            drawing paper, pencils and so on, I turn to my note-book in a dazed way
                            and begin counting my fingers in a depth of profound abstraction from

                            Billy.</p>
                        <p>Goody, goody, goody! Bob&apos;s goin&apos; to make

                        <p>&quot;Now, you girls,&quot; says Bob, gently detaching the
                            affectionate Billy from one leg and moving <pb id="VAA2439-202" n="195"
                            /> a chair to the table, with a backward glance of intelligence toward

                            work, but, as I&apos;ll have all the illustrations to do, I want you
                            to do as many of the verses as you canthat&apos;ll be easy, you
                            know,because the work entire is just to consist of a series of
                            fool-epigrams, such as, for instance,</p>
                        <lg>
                            <l n="1">Here lies a young man</l>
                            <l n="2">Who in childhood began</l>

                        <p>And the rest of his instructions are delivered in lower tones, that the
                            boy may not hear; and then, all matters seemingly arranged, he turns to
                            the boy with,&quot;And now, Billy, no lookin&apos; over
                            shoulders, you know, or swinging on my chair-back while I&apos;m at
                            work. When the pictures are all finished, then you can take a squint at
                            &apos;em, and not before. Is that all hunky, now?&quot;</p>
                        <p>&quot;Oh! who&apos;s a-goin&apos; to look over your

                            offending brother, he scrambles under the piano and laughs
                            derisively.</p>
                        <p>And then a silence falls upon the groupa <pb id="VAA2439-203" n="196"/>
                            gracious quiet, only intruded upon by the very juicy and exuberant
                            munching of an apple from a remote fastness of the room, and the
                            occasional thumping of a bare heel against the floor.</p>
                        <p>At last I close my note book with a half slam.</p>
                        <p>&quot;That means,&quot; says Bob, laying down his pencil, and
                            addressing the girls,&quot;That means he&apos;s concluded his
                            poem, and that he&apos;s not pleased with it in any manner, and that
                            he intends declining to read it, for that self-acknowledged reason, and
                            that he expects us to believe every affected word of his entire
                            speech&quot;</p>
                        <p>&quot;Oh, don&apos;t!&quot; I exclaim.</p>
                        <p>&quot;Then give us the wretched production, in all its hideous
                            deformity!&quot;</p>
                        <p>And the girls all laugh so sympathetically, and Bob joins them so gently,
                            and yet with a tone, I know, that can be changed so quickly to my future
                            discomfiture, that I arise at once and read, without apology or excuse,

                        <p>The crude production is received, I am glad to note, with some
                            expressions of favor from the girls; but Bob, of course, must
                            heartlessly dissipate my weak delight by saying, &quot;Well,
                            it&apos;s certainly bad enough; though,&quot; he goes on with an
                                <pb id="VAA2439-206" n="199"/> air of deepest critical sagacity and
                            fairness, &quot;considered, as it should be justly, as the
                            production of a jour poet, why, it might be worse that is, a little
                            worse.&quot; But, by this time, the girls, in a body, are
                            suppressing him, to which he laughingly submits and calls for quarter,
                            declaring that he would have been inclined to have ventured no comment
                            whatever, but for the very personal allusion of the poem to his boyish
                            derelictions and youthful eccentricities. &quot;And now,&quot;
                            he says, when order is restored, &quot;our other production needs
                            attention, and, with our new reinforcement, we can, with diligence, soon
                            have it ready for both printer and engraver, and then we&apos;ll
                            wake up the boy (who I notice has been fortunately slumbering for the
                            last quarter of an hour), and present to him, as designed and intended,
                            this matchless creation of our united intellects.&quot; At the
                            conclusion of this speech we all go good-humoredly to work, and at the
                            close of half an hour the tedious, but most ridiculous, task is

                        <p>W<hi rend="sc">E</hi> who read that Mrs. Burdette is dead are very
                            thoughtless. We listen to the birds this morning; and the gilding of the
                            sunshine on the blossoms and the leaves is simply just the alchemy our
                            selfishness demands, and we are pleased to say &quot;this is a very
                            pleasant world to us!&quot; Some of us say this because we want to
                            forget the mother that went away a year ago, and tried to speak but
                            could not; for that the lips were dry and framed no thing, although they
                            writhed and writhed with the great yearning of their love. Some say it
                            is because the sister, when she went, was very poor, and had no legacy
                            at all to leave, only her virtue and old maidenhood, and the
                            strangely-vague daguerreotype of the one whose lie made all her life an
                            empty album in which no line was writ by any friend. Some say it is
                            because they blindly think this agony will never come to thembut, all
                            the same, some day the hammer on the anvil will ring drearthe twitter of
                            the blithest bird will hurt the hearing, and the lightest laughter of
                            the sweetest child will be an awful discord that will jar and clang and
                            ache on every sense.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA2439-214" n="207"/>
                        <p>The woman that is dead is past all this. That is her rapture and her joy.
                            God is blessing her just as He has been blessing her for years and
                            years. As it happens, I knew her here; also her husband, He is not a
                            &quot;funny-man&quot; to-day, nor was he very funny when, but a
                            few weeks ago, at his own home, he asked the writer, one Sunday morning,
                            if he would join the family in morning service. The scene is here and it
                            is all very plain: The invalid bolstered in her chair, her sister at her
                            side, and the boy he has laughingly called &quot;the
                            Prince&quot; for her sake, leaning on her knee. Words grow very
                            tired trying to say how sweet and perfect it all was. But the very funny
                            man, I remember, held the Bible on his knees and read from it in a way
                            that sometimes he was not a funny man at all, but thought serious things
                            and even was capable of having tears in his eyes and blessings on his
                            head, showered, both, from the palms of God. Come from this with me, and
                            read from the pen of the woman, who will never, with her poor, crippled
                            hands, write one other line:</p>
                        <p>&quot;Out of the cloud-folds of her garments shaken, nature trails
                            the soft, soft blossoms of the snow, from grey sky to brown earth.
                            Softly, softly, the snow comes down, and in my heart the sun still
                            shines. Sweet peace is there. The <pb id="VAA2439-215" n="208"/> strong
                            right hand of His righteousness is about me; underneath me are the
                            Everlasting arms. Always I hear in my heart His words, &apos;Abide
                            with me.&apos; I am waiting for the post to come across the river
                            with the message&quot;</p>
                        <p>This is the woman who is dead to-day, the wife of the funny-man.</p>

                                >HITCOMB</hi> R<hi rend="sc">ILEY</hi> at Kalamazoo.</p>
                        <p>While the Nye-Riley combination was on the road last winter, a little
                            incident happened at Kalamazoo, Mich., which has never been given to the
                            public. Their entertainment was over for the night, and a large and
                            pleased audience had dispersed. Nye had been taken in hand by the town
                            lecture committee and towed off up to Uncle Asa Butterfield&apos;s
                            house to hear Uncle Asa tell his famous story about his red cow and Dunk
                            Brown&apos;s hired man, the occurrence having actually taken place
                            in 1839. Uncle Asa was a local humorist of great renown; he had been
                            unable to attend the lecture on account of rheumatism, but had promised
                            to sit up till the committee brought Nye around. The Red Cow story was
                            his master-piece, and he was very anxious that Nye should hear it, as he
                            thought that very likely he might want to introduce it into his lecture.
                            Riley had escaped by feigning sickness as soon as the visit was
                            proposed, and before Nye could employ the same excuse, and <pb
                                id="VAA2439-217" n="210"/> was sitting in the hotel office at about
                            11 o&apos;clock, congratulating himself and chuckling quietly. He
                            was thinking of various facetious remarks which he would make to Nye
                            should he survive the operation he was undergoing, about Uncle Asa, the
                            red cow, the hired man, and so forth, when a man hurriedly entered who
                            attracted his attention at once. The man was tall and angular, with
                            long, grey hair, hollow eyes; and he had a trick of thrusting his head
                            forward and pointing with a long, bony finger. He glanced around at the
                            group of hotel guests sitting about and walked directly to Riley.</p>
                        <p>&quot;You are Riley, James Whitcomb Riley,&quot; he said as he
                            pointed a long finger at him.</p>
                        <p>The poet blushed slightly, and modestly admitted the fact. &quot;Yes,
                            yes,&quot; went on the man, &quot;I knew you though I never saw
                            you before. We never met, but we&apos;ve had a good deal of business
                            with each other.&quot;</p>
                        <p>&quot;Well, perhaps,&quot; replied Riley, &quot;but I
                            don&apos;t exactly understand what you refer to.&quot;</p>
                        <p>&quot;Hah? I&apos;ll tell you. My name is Thomas H.
                            Stockwell,&quot; and he looked at Riley triumphantly.</p>
                        <p>&quot;Erwell, I can&apos;t just place you, I&apos;m
                            afraid,&quot; answered Riley.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA2439-218" n="211"/>
                        <p>&quot;You can&apos;t? Why, I&apos;m the man that has written
                            all your poetry for you!&quot;</p>
                        <p>The poet looked at the hollow-eyed visitor speechless.</p>
                        <p>&quot;Yes, sir, gentlemen,&quot; went on the intruder, swinging
                            his long bony hands so as to include the little group, &quot;I am
                            the man who has written all of James Whitcomb Riley&apos;s poems for
                            him. When he has wanted a new one he has always written to me and I have
                            sent it to him and got my pay for it, and that has been all there is
                            about it. You know it, Mr. Riley, as well as I do. But I&apos;m sick
                            and tired of it. Hereafter, sir, the world shall know Thomas H.
                            Stockwell as he is; the fame of James Whitcomb Riley will hereafter rest
                            on the brow of Thomas Hostetter Stockwell. The time is come for me to
                            declare myself and claim my own!&quot;</p>
                        <p>The unknown poet who had blushed unseen all these years drew himself up
                            proudly and laid his hand on his heart. Riley had been gradually getting
                            over his astonishment, and now found his voice.</p>
                        <p>&quot;Perhaps, Mr. Stockwell,&quot; he said, &quot;you may
                            have some of your poems with you such as you have been furnishing me and
                            can favor us with a short reading.&quot;</p>
                        <pb id="VAA2439-219" n="212"/>
                        <p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; replied the long-haired individual, as he
                            pulled a handful of crumpled manuscript out of his breast pocket;
                            &quot;certainlynothing would give me more pleasure. I have here

                        <p>&quot;That is all I will give you to-night, gentlemen, but it is
                            enough to show you who has been writing Mr. Riley&apos;s poems. My
                            reading tomorrow evening will be most entertaining, and as I wrote all
                            of Mr. Longfellow&apos;s poems, and am constantly shipping poems to
                            Mr. Lowell, you can see that it will be varied as well. Lately I have
                            been encroaching on the English market, sending a number of consignments
                            to Mr. Browning, and yesterday filling a trial order for Baron Tennyson.
                                <pb id="VAA2439-221" n="214"/> This is all done away with, however,
                            and Thomas H. Stockwell reveals his true self to the world. Do not
                            forget my entertainment to-morrow&quot;</p>
                        <p>&quot;Tom,&quot; said a man, as he entered and touched the poet
                            on the shoulder, &quot;come onit is long past time that you were in,
                            and I have been looking everywhere for you. I hope he hasn&apos;t
                            disturbed you, gentlemen,&quot; he continued, as he started toward
                            the door, followed by the other; &quot;he is perfectly harmless, so
                            we allow him about the asylum grounds, but we didn&apos;t think
                            he&apos;d wander away. It is the same man who used to think the
                            world would cease to revolve around the sun if he didn&apos;t wear a
                            green ribbon on his hat, but he has given up that and taken to
                            poetry.&quot; Nye came in, a moment later, very much exhaused by
                            Uncle Asa&apos;s cow-and-hired-man story, but he had to help Riley
                            up to bed.</p>
