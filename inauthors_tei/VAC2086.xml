						<l><hi rend="b">T</hi><hi rend="sc">HO'</hi> yer lamp o' life is burnin' with a clear
							an' steady light,</l>
						<l>An' it never seems ter flicker, but it's allers shinin' bright;</l>
						<l>Tho' it sheds its rays unbroken for a thousan' happy days--</l>
						<l>Father Time is ever turnin' down the wick thet feeds the blaze.</l>
						<l>So it clearly is yer duty ef you've got a thing ter do,</l>
						<l>Ter put yer shoulder to the wheel an' try to push her through;</l>
						<l>Ef yer upon a wayward track yer better turn about--</l>
						<l>You've lost other chance ter do it when the</l>
						<l rend="ti-4">Light</l>
						<l rend="ti-5">Goes</l>
						<l rend="ti-6">Out.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Speak kindly to the woman who is workin' for yer praise,</l>
						<l>The same way ez you used ter in those happy courtin' days;</l>
						<l>She likes appreciation jest the same ez me an' you,</l>
						<l>An' it's only right an' proper thet yer give her what is due.</l>

						<pb id="VAC2086-012" n="2"/>

						<l>Don't wait until her lamp o' life is burnin' dim an' low,</l>
						<l>Afore you tell her what you orter told her long ago--</l>
						<l>Now's the time ter cheer her up an' put her blues to rout--</l>
						<l>You've lost other chance to do it when the</l>
						<l rend="ti-4">Light</l>
						<l rend="ti-5">Goes</l>
						<l rend="ti-6">Out.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Don't keep a puttin' matters off an' settin dates ahead--</l>
						<l>Tomorrow's sun 'll find a hundred thousand of us dead;</l>
						<l>Don't think because yer feelin' well you won't be sick no more--</l>
						<l>Sometimes the reddest pippin hez a worm-hole to the core.</l>
						<l>Don't let a killin' habit grow upon you soft an' still</l>
						<l>Because you think thet you ken throw it from you et your will--</l>
						<l>Now's the time ter quit it when yer feelin'> brave an' stout--</l>
						<l>You've lost the chance ter do it when the</l>
						<l rend="ti-4">Light</l>
						<l rend="ti-5">Goes</l>
						<l rend="ti-6">Out.</l>

						<l>Thet I hed got my money in a robbin', graspin' way;</l>
						<l>No words above my restin' place from any tongue or pen</l>
						<l>Would hev a deeper meanin' then "He helped his fellow men."</l>
						<l>So ef you hev a fortune an' you want to help the poor</l>
						<l>Don't keep a stavin' off until you get a little more;</l>
						<l>Ef yer upon a miser's track you better turn about--</l>

					<lg>
						<l><hi rend="b">G</hi><hi rend="sc">OOD-BY</hi>, Old Year, 'tis not without a sigh</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">I realize this hour is thy last,</l>
						<l>For in thy wake a thousand memories lie</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Like changeless specters of the buried past.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>I had a friend, Old Year, a generous boy--</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Good resolutions marked his start with thee;</l>
						<l>But sorrow drowned his fondest hopes of joy,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">And happiness gave way to misery.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Aye, for a while no storm-cloud marred the sky;</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Proudly he rode life's great uncertain ship,</l>
						<l>Until the rock temptation dimmed his eye</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">And resolutions froze upon his lip.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>He knows the mighty secret (if to know</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Befalls the lot of every human soul)</l>
						<l>Of death's true meaning-- of the awful flow</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Of human hearts to life's old-fashioned goal.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>I had a dearer friend, Old Year, and she</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">With all a woman's grander virtues shone,</l>
						<l>Most nobly pure in her simplicity--</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">But she is dead, and I am all alone.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>With poignant grief and sorrow thou art through,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Departed one! Sleep in thy hallowed place;</l>
						<l>For like the shamrock drinks the morning dew</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">One heart absorbs the image of thy face.</l>
					</lg>

					<pb id="VAC2086-015" n="5"/>

					<lg>
						<l>Though time may change the noblest form to clay,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">And rack the living with a ceaseless strife,</l>
						<l>Naught can diminish memory's soothing ray,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">That sheds its beauty down the path of life.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Old dying year, I would not have thee stay;</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Fly on, and meet the countless thousands who</l>
						<l>Within thy varied chapter passed away--</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Good-by, Old Year-- I enter on the new.</l>

						<l>With somethin' in the wagon thet is covered with a sheet;</l>
						<l>'T won't be long afore the crowd begins to gather 'round</l>
						<l>To see the undertaker fit thet somethin' for the ground.</l>
						<l>Some poor mortal's seen the last o' misery an' woe;</l>
						<l>Some poor brother knows the secret everyone must know;</l>
						<l>Somehow 't blurs a feller's eyes to think of how he died--</l>

					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>His clothin' an' his general style don't bear refinement's stamp--</l>
						<l>The chances are thet he was some despondent, starvin' tramp</l>
						<l>Who thought thet he hed taken mor'n his share o' sorrow's cup</l>
						<l>An' jumped into the river jest to wind the business up.</l>
						<l>The world ain't goin' to weepin'-- jest a few'll gather 'round</l>
						<l>An' help to lift the plain pine box an' drop it in the ground;</l>
						<l>The ordinary mortal ain't a-goin' to turn aside</l>

						<l>For footsteps that'll fall upon the threshold nevermore;</l>
						<l>Ther' may be one thet's prayin' for the clouds to roll apart</l>
						<l>An' let a ray o' sunshine creep into her bleedin' heart--</l>

						<l>He might ha' had a happy home till fortune turned away</l>
						<l>An' misery an' trouble drove him where he is today.</l>

					<lg rend="center">
						<l><hi rend="b">I</hi> SAW the dear old place, Eugene,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">The home we used to know</l>
						<l>When life was new and cares were few</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">So many years ago;</l>
						<l>The old familiar house, ah me--</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">The same old tree near by</l>
						<l>In whose cool shade we romped and played</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">My brother-- you and I.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg rend="center">
						<l>The little laughing, babbling brook,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Where dwelt the speckled trout,</l>
						<l>Is running still adown the hill</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">And winding in and out</l>
						<l>Across the verdant pasture field,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">And through the shady glen--</l>
						<l>With music sweet it seemed to greet</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">The boy returned again.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg rend="center">
						<l>The fruit trees growing near the well</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">With pears and apples hung,</l>
						<l>Gave me a treat, oh, full as sweet</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">As when we both were young;</l>
						<l>The time worn weather beaten post</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Where you once carved your name,</l>
						<l>Like some old guard before the yard</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Is standing just the same.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg rend="center">
						<l>The grape vine arbor lane, Eugene,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Where you and I once played</l>
						<l>With joy serene-- is just as green</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">And deep in leafy shade.</l>

						<pb id="VAC2086-020" n="10"/>

						<l>The honeysuckle bushes too</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Wear just as bright a dress</l>
						<l>As ever shown from any throne</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Or robed a fair princess.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg rend="center">
						<l>The happy birds were singing, oh</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Just as they used to sing</l>
						<l>When all the earth was full of mirth,</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">And all the year was spring;</l>
						<l>When sweet content and happiness</l>
						<l rend="ti-1">Claimed childhood as their own,</l>
						<l>And grief and care and deep despair</l>

						<l>Some are sick an' poor in youth an' poorer when they're gray;</l>
						<l>Others allers have their health an' never strike a bog</l>

						<l>Not a single one was even nipped, tho' how they escaped God knows,</l>

						<l>To tell about-- she wasn't there--</l>
						<l>And the baby was gone-- on a kitchen chair</l>
						<l>I found this paper, and God! if you</l>
