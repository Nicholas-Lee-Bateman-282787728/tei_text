            In the dominant historical image of African-American migration, great cities such as 
                        Chicago
                     and 
                        New York
                     appear as powerful magnets. Acknowledging the attractive power of big cities need not
                    prevent one, however, from recognizing the place of smaller urban communities in the migration
                    process. Such communities tend to be ignored when historians focus their investigations on the
                    largest cities. Yet during the quarter century after Emancipation, many black migrants to the North
                    found their way to small towns and cities.1 Moreover, some African Americans
                    continued to migrate to small cities even when thousands of others traveled to 
                  New York, Chicago,
                            Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Indianapolis
               , and
                    other major cities in the mass exodus from the South after 1915 known as the first Great Migration.
                    A few nonconformists even forsook big cities for smaller ones. Thinking of migration as synonymous
                    with big-city urbanization not only effaces the choices made by migrants who settled in small cities
                    and the results of their decisions; it also unduly homogenizes a black folk movement and tends to
                    shift the interpretive focus from the folk who made the movement to the forces that acted upon them.
            Indiana furnishes useful examples of African-American migration to places other than large cities. In
                    a state with only one metropolis, both black and white migrants to the country towns and small
                    cities that dotted the Hoosier landscape could find jobs and

                     urban amenities without completely abandoning their rural
                    roots. This study focuses on one such community, 
                        Muncie
                    . For the purpose of understanding African-American migration, 
                        Muncie
                     represents not a typical northern or midwestern community but a specific blend of
                    historical circumstances. Examining those circumstances can cast light on the choices made by
                    African-American migrants during the period from the Civil War to the Great Depression. The 
                        Magic City
                     was unique only in the same way that every place is. The characteristics that define it
                    can be found to varying degrees in other communities.
            
               
                        Muncie
                     is best known as the "
                        Middletown
                    " of Robert and Helen Merrell Lynd's sociological classic of the
                    1920s. The Lynds may have contributed to the scholarly neglect of small-city black communities. They
                    explicitly chose 
                        Muncie
                     as a subject for study because in their view it had a small black population. The Lynds
                    wanted a community that was both representative and ethnically homogeneous.2
                    Homogeneity, in the Lynds' eyes, required "a small Negro and foreign-born
                        population."3 In addition to its apparent ethnic homogeneity,
                    Muncie was attractive to the Lynds because it was an industrial city. 
                        
                            Middletown
                        
                     portrayed industrialization as the driving force of many twentieth-century cultural changes.
            The Lynds were correct in portraying 
                        Muncie
                     as an industrial city peopled by few immigrants. A close reader of 
                            Middletown
                        , however, would have noted that in the third of a century before the Lynds
                    began their study 
                        Muncie
                    's black community grew substantially. During this time, the overall population
                    mushroomed from about 11,000 to more than 35,000. The African-American segment of that population,
                    meanwhile, increased from less than 4 percent to nearly 6 percent.4 Thus, during
                    a period of rapid population growth the city's black population grew at a faster rate than
                    its white population. This study probes that phenomenon. First, the expansion of 
                        Muncie
                    's black population will be traced from the Civil War to the onset of the Great
                    Depression and placed in the contexts 
                  
                     2 In the aftermath of massive European immigration and in the age of
                            African Americans' Great Migration to the North, it was, of course, impossible to
                            find a northern city that was both ethnically homogenous and representative. Richard Jensen,

                             had "a slightly higher proportion of blacks than was usual in the

                    Finally, although the principal purpose of this essay is descriptive, possible reasons for 
                        Muncie
                    's appeal to African-American migrants will be examined.
            The pace of African-American migration to Indiana varied considerably during the period from 1860 to
                    1930 (see Table l).5 In the 1860s about 11,000 blacks, mostly former slaves,
                    entered the state despite white violence directed against them and the presence until 1867 of a
                    black exclusion law. Most probably came during the war and in the year or two immediately after its
                    end, before Radical Reconstruction began to give southern blacks hope of making new lives in the
                    South free from white domination.6 While the struggles over Reconstruction raged
                    in the 1870s and 1880s, black migration occurred at a slower pace. It then quickened again during
                    the 1890s.7 The flow diminished once more in the first decade of the twentieth
                    century, but a new and much larger wave began about 1915. During World War I and continuing through
                    the 1920s, the Indiana stream of the first Great Migration brought more than 50,000 African
                    Americans to the state. Thus, black migration to Indiana fluctuated greatly. In nearly all census
                    decades, however, Indiana's black population grew more rapidly than its white population,
                    since white out-migration consistently exceeded black in-migration.8
            
            
               
                  5 The figures given in Tables 1 through 4 should be viewed as no more than
                        rough approximations, given the inaccuracies of the federal census and the estimation methods
                        used. The federal census clearly underenumerated African Americans, although the frequency with
                        which it did so probably declined somewhat during the period under consideration. Net migration
                        for Indiana in Table 1 is estimated using a forward census-survival method, in which
                        age-specific survival ratios from one census year to the next are calculated for the 
                            United States
                         and then applied to age cohorts within the states to estimate net migration. See

                        , 1988). The principal source of black migrants to Indiana, however, was 
                            Kentucky
                        , which did not experience Reconstruction. See Lee et al.,

            African-American migrants, whether moving into or within the state, distributed themselves throughout
                    Indiana's landscape in quite different ways before and after 1890. Before 1890, more blacks
                    lived in small towns and cities (43 percent of the total black population) than in rural areas (36
                    percent) or in 
                        Indianapolis
                     (20 percent). Black Hoosiers were more urbanized than their white counterparts (see
                    Table 2). Blacks' greater degree of urbanization was caused not only by a higher
                    concentration of the African-American population in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , but also by higher concentrations at every level of community size. Blacks'
                    lower concentration in rural areas was probably the result of most blacks' being newcomers
                    to the state at a time when rising land values and new machinery costs during the late nineteenth
                    century made entry into Indiana's mature agricultural economy increasingly difficult.9

            After 1890, African Americans in Indiana began a decisive shift up the urban ladder. The rural black
                    population declined by one-quarter between 1890 and 1910, while the black population of the smallest
                    towns (less than 10,000 population) grew more slowly than did the state's black population
                    as a whole. Black urbanization was most evident in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , where the African-American population more than doubled over the twenty-year period.
                    Most striking, it was only in the largest size category (
                        Indianapolis
                    ) that the black population grew faster than the white. In country towns and small
                    cities after 1890, white populations continued to grow, while black populations lagged. For small
                    towns and small cities considered as a whole, Table 1 and Table 2 together imply relative growth in
                    black population before 1890 followed by a relative decline that set in over the following twenty
                    years. New 
                        Albany
                     exemplifies the trend. There, blacks increased from 5 percent of total population in
                    1860 to 9 percent by 1890, but then both black numbers and their proportion of the community total
                    fell over the next twenty years. Farther north, the number of African Americans in 
                        Lafayette
                     more than doubled between 1860 and 1890 (from 133 to 304), but twenty years later only
                    34 more blacks were living in the community, which suggests that out-migration had surpassed both
                    in-migration and natural increase. In 
                        New Castle
                    , the percentage of black population  grew from 3.3
                    in 1860 to 6.7 thirty years later. It then declined to 2.2 percent by 1910. The pattern of
                    African-American movement to large cities, a pattern that first appeared during the 1890s, was to
                    reappear during the first Great Migration of 1915-1930 and again in the second Great Migration of
                    1940-1970, both of which were characterized by black migration directly from the rural or urban
                    South to the big-city North.10
            
            
               
                        Muncie
                    's black population, tiny in 1860, grew steadily over the next thirty years in
                    common with the black populations of many other Indiana small towns (see Table 3). During the 1890s
                    blacks' share of total population fell from 3.7 percent to 3.5 percent. This percentage
                    decline was not caused by a declining, stable, or even slowly growing black population. Instead, the
                    number of black Munsonians increased substantially during the 1890s (77 percent), a fact that
                    strongly suggests that in-migration to the community far outpaced out-migration.11 African Americans' relative decline was the result of rapidly expanding white
                    population, which grew by 85 percent during the decade.

                    natural gas boom that began in northeastern Indiana during the mid-1880s. Lured by the prospect of
                    cheap or even free gas to power their plants, many manufacturers moved to the region, and the
                    ensuing factory growth contributed substantially to the state's industrialization. The gas
                    boom accelerated a northward shift of the state's industrial center of gravity from the

                     11 Population growth is necessarily used as an indicator of migration,
                            since I cannot distinguish the contributions to population growth of natural increase and
                            migration. This cannot be done because the necessary data are not available. One method for
                            determining rates of interstate migration, a procedure that involves counting those living
                            in a state during a given census year who were born in other states, is not suitable for use
                            with smaller units than states, since such a measure will omit intrastate migrants. Other
                            methods, which depend upon use of survival ratios drawn from either census data or life
                            tables, require breakdowns of community population by age, sex, and
                            "color" to measure migration by blacks and whites. Such data are available
                            for communities only from intensive analysis of the manuscript census for every census year
                            covered by the study. Such an analysis is impossible for any period including the census
                            year 1890, for which manuscript census data for most states (including Indiana) were

                            adult African Americans living in the community in that year. Only 27 of 384 were both
                            natives of Indiana and had been living in

                     and its sister cities of the Gas Belt on the leading edge of Indiana's
                    industrial expansion, the gas boom also shielded them from the worst effects of the catastrophic
                    depression of the 1890s.

                        Muncie
                     during the gas boom were five brothers named Ball who had been making glass jars in

                        New York

                    property, and $5,000 in cash. They moved in 1887 and began manufacturing their patented
                    glass jars the next year. By 1900, aided by extensive mechanization of the production process, the
                    Ball Company had become the nation's largest manufacturer of fruit jars. Another glass
                    manufacturer, the Hemingray Glass Company, moved to 
                        Muncie

                    leading manufacturer of insulators for the nation's rapidly spreading network of telephone
                        poles.13 Natural gas, which allowed the production of good quality glass
                    from impure materials, was crucial to the relocation and expansion of glass manufacturers. Natural
                    gas also facilitated expansion of already existing foundries and steel wire factories in

                    during the 1890s, but its rate of growth did not slow as much as that of whites. The result was that
                    the black share of 
                        Muncie
                    's population rose from 3.5 to 4.2 percent. With 
                        Muncie
                    's growth accelerating during the 1910s, blacks again moved to 
                        Muncie
                     at a faster rate than whites, a performance they repeated—unnoticed by the
                    Lynds—during the 1920s.
            This brief review of 
                        Muncie
                    's population history reveals that the community's African-American
                    migration was unusual. It did not follow the pattern of many other Indiana small towns and small
                    cities over the long period from the Civil War to the onset of the Great Depression, a pattern of a
                    rising followed by a falling percentage of black population. 
                        Muncie
                    's special character was particularly apparent during the crucial period for
                    black urbanization, 1890-1910. While the black population of towns in its size category
                    (10,000-24,999) grew by 51 percent, 
                        Muncie
                    's African-American population rose by 140 percent. The 
                        Magic City
                    's appeal was evident both during a decade of massive white population
                    growth— the 1890s—and during the succeeding decade of slower growth in both 
                        Muncie
                    's white population and the state's black population. 
                        Muncie
                    's nearly constant ability to attract black migrants at a faster rate than
                    white migrants over the entire seventy-year period produced a pattern of relative black population
                    growth that resembled the trend found in the state's largest city (see Figure 1). Black
                    migration to 
                        Muncie
                     created by 1920 an African-American community that was larger as a proportion of
                    overall population than black communities in such major northern cities as 
                  Cleveland, Detroit,
                            Chicago
               , and

            The description of black migration to 
                        Muncie
                     thus far has been based upon federal census records. Those records display the external
                    aspects of the migration process, but they cannot reveal the perceptions or motivations of those who
                    migrated. Moreover, they cannot provide more than a snapshot every ten years of the distribution of
                    population, a picture from which migration patterns must be inferred. Oral-history evidence can
                    offer more, and such evidence has played a prominent part in recent studies of black migration
                        north.16

                    Around 1980, the Black 
                        Middletown
                     Project, under the direction of Rutledge Dennis and Vivian Gordon, interviewed
                    thirty-three elderly African-American residents of 
                        Muncie
                    . Another project, the 
                        Muncie
                     Black History Project, interviewed three more. This study draws on twenty-six of these
                    interviews (seven from the Federal Writers' Project series and nineteen from the Black 
                        Middletown

                        Muncie

                    came to 
                        Muncie
                     before and during the first Great Migration. These interviews should not be regarded as
                    constituting a statistically representative sample of all migrants, since the numbers involved are
                    small and it is not known how informants were selected. Nevertheless, the interviews provide

                             interviews were conducted by William Webb Tuttle. See George P. Rawick, ed.,

                        Muncie
                     from the perspectives of the migrants themselves.
            The earliest migrant interviewed came to 
                        Muncie
                     in 1886, the latest during the 1930s. Of twenty-seven migrants or families represented
                    by an interviewee, fifteen arrived before 1915, when the first Great Migration began. The remainder
                    came after that date, with the bulk of the second group arriving during the 1920s. Of the pre-1915
                    cohort, all those who came from outside Indiana were from states of the Upper South:
                            
                  Kentucky, Tennessee
               , and 
                        North Carolina
                    . In the Great Migration group, a majority also originated in the Upper South (
                        Kentucky
                     and 
                        Tennessee
                    ), but the Deep South was represented by two migrant families from 
                        Alabama
                     and one from 
                        Arkansas
                    . This profile is broadly consistent with general patterns of migration to the Midwest.
                    The states of the Upper South provided most of the migrants to the region from the Civil War to
                    World War I, while the first Great Migration consisted largely of former residents of the Lower
                        South.18
                    
                        Muncie
                     in 1920, as a sample from the manuscript census shows, represented a variant on the
                    statewide pattern of black origins. In both 
                        Muncie
                     and the state, Kentuckians represented the largest single out-of-state group. 
                        Muncie
                    , however, attracted more migrants from 
                  Ohio, North Carolina
               , and 
                        Virginia
                     and fewer from 
                        Alabama
                     and 
                        Georgia
                     than the statewide norm (see Figures 2 and 3)."The significant northern
                    component in 
                        Muncie
                    's immigrant stream strongly suggests that the 
                        Magic City
                     appealed to migrants from small midwestern towns and cities as well as to newcomers to
                    the North.20
            
            For those interviewed, the journey to 
                        Muncie
                     was typically a family migration. Whether the migrant traveled as a child or as an
                    adult, the trip was usually taken either in the company of family members or with the intention of
                    joining at least one family member already in

                     of relocating as well as the shock of arrival in new
                    surroundings. Sometimes the aid given by extended family members was directly instrumental, such as
                    the offering of lodging for new arrivals. In other cases it was indirect, in the form of information
                    about the journey or about conditions at the destination. Both forms of aid could be provided by
                    friends as well as family. Few migrants arrived completely alone in their new surroundings. Most
                    migrated within chains of family and friends.22
            
            The predominance of chain migration suggests that many migrants accumulated a stock of knowledge
                    prior to uprooting themselves from their homes. Those who had family or friends at a potential
                    destination were likely to know the prospects for jobs, housing, and education and to be aware of
                    the state of race relations before setting off. Their decision to migrate, that is, was likely to be
                    an informed one.23 Even without access to a chain of family and friends,
                    however, migrants could still acquire knowledge of their potential new homes. The case of 
                        Muncie
                     migrant Elam F. illustrates this point. He came directly to 
                        Muncie
                     from rural 
                        Tennessee
                     in 1913. Traveling alone and having no friends or family in 
                        Muncie
                    , he came because he had heard he could get work in "the glass
                    factory," probably either the Ball Brothers glass jar factory or the Hemingray Glass
                    Company plant.24 In their degree of foreknowledge, African-American migrants
                    during the early twentieth century were typical of migrants and immigrants in general. As a recent
                    historian notes, "Rarely [did they] leave home without a clear idea of where they were
                    going and how they would get there."25
            
            The railroad provided the means of travel for most of the interviewed migrants who indicated how they
                    came to 
                        Muncie
                    . This fact reflected the centrality of the railroads to America's
                    transportation system during the period between the Civil War and World War II and their presence
                    throughout the nation. When asked how she and her family left their home in the country, one 
                  
                     22 This is consistent with the findings of modern migration research.
                            As a summary reports, "virtually all studies of migration find that the destination
                            is chosen on the basis of friends and relatives." Price and Sikes, Rural-Urban Migration Research, 14-15. See also Grossman, Land of
                                Hope, 99. This finding should not be read as meaning that choice of destination was
                            governed solely by the presence of family or friends at that destination. A migrant may have
                            had such connections in more than one possible destination.

                     (the "Nickel Plate Road"), which also linked 
                        Muncie
                     with major northern and southern transfer points.28
            
            Many of the migrant families discussed in the oral-history projects farmed before leaving the South.
                    Some migrants, however, had been skilled workers, such as a shoe repairman and a brickma-son. Peter
                    Gottlieb has argued that many migrants had previous exposure in the South to industrialization.
                    Gottlieb emphasizes the importance of labor in southern industries in "providing [for
                    migrants] a transition from farming to industrial labor."29 The 
                        Muncie
                     interviews lend support to this view, as a significant minority revealed earlier
                    experience with factory work. James D. had worked in a factory in 
                        Indianapolis
                     before moving to 
                        Muncie
                     in 1926 to work at Indiana Foundry. The father of James L., who came to 
                        Muncie
                     during the 1930s from 
                  Knoxville,
                            Tennessee
               , had worked in a steel mill.
                    James himself found work in a foundry in 
                        Muncie
                    . The father of Joseph W., a minister who traveled to 
                        Muncie
                     in 1928 from 
                        Alabama
                    , had combined his ministerial vocation with working in a sawmill and "around
                    the mines."30 Another migrant's father had been employed in a
                    factory in 
                  Chattanooga, Tennessee
               , before migrating in 1923 to work at the Broderick
                    boiler factory. His daughter related in her interview that she had worked in 
                        Muncie

                     30Historian Joe William Trotter, Jr., argues that extractive
                            industries such as mining and lumbering "operated at the interface between the
                            black agricultural experience … and the black transition to an urban-industrial
                            foundation." Joe William Trotter, Jr., Black Milwaukee: The Making of

                     the factory of the Butterfield Canning Company.31 Another father, who had begun his travels from a 
                        Kentucky
                     farm, arrived in 
                        Muncie
                     in 1904 after working in a factory in Peru, Indiana. He was able to put his industrial
                    experience to use in a 
                        Muncie
                     factory.32
            
            These examples suggest that although the overall direction of African-American movement has been from
                    rural to urban places, it would be a mistake to think of 
                        Muncie
                    's black migrants as encountering urban life for the first time on the streets
                    of the 
                        Magic City
                    . Even those whose backgrounds included no previous industrial experience might have
                    stopped in other towns or cities, in the South or the North, before traveling on to 
                        Muncie
                    . The fact that a large proportion of 
                        Muncie
                    's 1920 black population was either northern-born or from the more urbanized
                    southern states supports this possibility. Articulating a widely held view of black urbanization as
                    a disruptive, disorienting, and alienating experience, Richard Wright wrote in 1941:
                    "Perhaps never in history has a more utterly unprepared folk wanted to go to the
                        city."33 The 
                        Muncie
                     evidence, together with evidence presented by recent historians, throws a long shadow
                    of doubt over that view.
            The oral-history material also indicates that some migrants chose 
                        Muncie
                     not as a step on their way to a bigger place but as a more desirable destination than a
                    large city. 
                        Chicago
                    's South Side in 1929 contained the Midwest's largest and culturally
                    most vibrant black community, but after a few months there the mother of Ester-ine M. chose to
                    depart for 
                        Muncie
                    . She wanted to join her parents, who had preceded her from 
                        Arkansas
                    , but she may also have perceived 
                        Muncie
                     as a satisfactory alternative to the midwestern metropolis.34
                    Versia A. lived in 
                        Indianapolis
                     for eight years during her twenties before moving to two smaller 
                        Michigan
                     cities. She then traveled to 
                        Muncie
                     in 1934.35 A decade earlier, James D. made the same decision to
                    migrate to 
                        Muncie
                     after living for at least nine years in 
                        Indianapolis
                     during his teens and early twenties.36 The beginnings of the gas
                    boom drew thirty-one-year-old Alexander Kelley, a chef in 
                        Indianapolis
                    's Grant Hotel, and his new wife, twenty-nine-year-old Bell, to 
                        Muncie
                     in 1886. Alexander Kelley had lived in 
                        Indianapolis
                     for thirteen years and Bell for even longer.37 At the time of their
                    decision, the black community in 
                        Indianapolis
                     numbered more than 6,500, proportionally the largest of any midwestern

                     big city, while less than four hundred blacks lived in 
                        Muncie
                    .38 Spurning the attractions of big-city life as well as the
                    advantages offered by a large black community, these migrants joined those coming from smaller
                    places to form 
                        Muncie
                    's migrant stream.
            Researchers typically measure migration using cross-sectional measures that identify the places that
                    lost population and those that gained. They then infer migration from the first sort of place to the
                    second. Interviews make possible a view over time that produces a quite different image of the
                    migration process, a much more complicated and less linear portrait. While most migrants who
                    described their path came directly from the South to 
                        Muncie
                    , some followed circuitous routes. Lelia D., born in 1890 in 
                  Germantown, North
                    Carolina
               , took a parabolic course, first to 
                        Maryland
                    , then to Heightstown, 
                        New Jersey
                    , then to Reading, 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , and finally in 1910 to 
                        Muncie
                    .39 James D., born in 
                        Tennessee
                     in 1903, traveled to 
                        Texas
                     and then back to 
                        Tennessee
                    . He moved to 
                        Indianapolis
                     in 1915, then to New 
                        Albany
                    , Indiana, for two years, and then back to 
                        Indianapolis
                     before settling in 
                        Muncie
                     in 1926.40 Finally, Versia A. moved from rural 
                        Kentucky
                     to Bowling Green, 
                        Kentucky
                    , at the age of sixteen and then to 
                        Indianapolis
                     four years later. After eight years living in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , she moved to Pontiac, 
                        Michigan
                    , but after one year moved to Flint, 
                        Michigan
                    . A little more than a year later, she went back to Pontiac and then finally moved to 
                        Muncie
                     in 1934.41 These zigzag routes should lead one to think of
                    migration not as a linear phenomenon in which each migrant moved directly from the rural South to
                    the urban North but as a constant flux. At any given time some people were moving south, east, and
                    west, while others were going north. Some were migrating from larger places to smaller places, while
                    many others were shifting from rural to urban environments. While the general tendency for African
                    Americans was to move from the rural South and the rural and small-town North to urban centers, this
                    path did not describe the course taken by every migrant.42
            
            Researchers studying the "push" factors behind African-American migration from the
                    South have not reached a consensus. While some emphasize economic motivations—the
                    difficulty of supporting a family in a society where blacks controlled few
                    resources—others add to this model the force of social and political oppression.43

                     Unfortunately, the 
                        Muncie
                     migrants spoke little of their reasons for leaving their former homes. While some
                    implicitly suggested economic motivations in noting the appeal of potential jobs in 
                        Muncie
                    ,44 others explicitly identified social or political causes for
                    migration. Two families came to 
                        Muncie
                     as a result of their church ties, while a third family emigrated from 
                        Kentucky
                     in 1907 "on account of the Ku Klux Klan."45
            
            When African-American migrants explained why they moved to 
                        Muncie
                    , they most often said that they came for jobs. They came because a sister had said that
                    good wages were to be had in 
                        Muncie
                    
               46 or so a father could find work in a marble factory.47 In many cases, the jobs they sought materialized. Men told of how they found work in 
                        Muncie
                    's factories: in the Broderick boiler factory, in foundries such as the Whitely
                    Malleable Castings Company, at the Indiana Steel and Wire plant, at the glass factories of Ball
                    Brothers and Hemingray, and at the Chevrolet plant.
            The migrants' stories of finding work in factories reflected the experience of 
                        Muncie
                    's black work force as a whole. The 1889 city directory reveals that at this
                    early date blacks were gaining access to industrial employment. Nearly one-quarter of
                    "colored" males listed with occupations held jobs in factories. Other men worked
                    as artisans, and some owned businesses. Four of 
                        Muncie
                    's ten barber shops, for example, were owned by black proprietors, evidence
                    which implies that these shops depended upon a white or mixed black and white clientele. Only three
                    women were listed with occupations. One of these three advertised herself as 
                        Muncie
                    's only carpet weaver, while another worked in a commercial laundry.48
            
            In the 1920 census sample, the most common occupational designation for African-American men was
                    "laborer." The census, however, recorded place of work as well, and this

                             in 1900. In 1880, five occupations (porters, waiters, servants, cooks, and
                            common laborers) made up 69.7 percent of black jobs in Milwaukee; in 
                                Muncie
                            , these five occupations represented only 30.3 percent (37 of 122) of jobs held
                            by blacks listed in the city directory. In Milwaukee in 1900, an African-American population
                            twice the size of

                            "few Afro-Americans entered the industrial work force." Trotter, Black Milwaukee, 10-13. The proportion of African Americans in Milwaukee
                            was 0.2 percent in 1880 and 0.3 percent in 1900. In 
                                Chicago
                            , only 8.3 percent of the black male work force in 1900 held jobs in

                makes clear that most laborers were industrial workers employed in 
                        Muncie
                    's factories.49 And while most black men in 1920 held
                    unskilled industrial jobs, a few were able to find semiskilled or skilled work in the factories. The
                    census noted an electrical engineer, a crane operator, gas makers in glass plants, boilermakers, and
                    machinists. Although most women found themselves in domestic service, some also worked in the
                    factories of such companies as Ball Brothers, Hemingray, and the Butterfield Canning Company at a
                    time when few industrial jobs were open to African-American women. Black cooks could find work in
                    factories as well as in private homes. James D. recalled, "You could always get a job in 
                        Muncie
                     when you couldn't get a job any place else. Used to be plenty of work here in
                    the factories and the foundaries [sic]."50
            
            In addition to jobs, African-American migrants found integrated neighborhoods, schools, buses, and
                    streetcars. On the other hand, no white-run restaurants would allow them to eat on the premises, and
                    theaters seated blacks only in the balconies. These two forms of discrimination continued at least
                    into the 1930s. Some parks and swimming pools were closed to blacks. Interviewees reported that
                    African Americans were not hired for the police or 
                  
                     49 Of the 114 African Americans whose occupation was listed as
                            "labor" or "laborer," 94 (82 percent) gave a place of
                            work that was clearly an industrial site.

                     sheriffs department or in the courthouse, nor as clerks in
                    stores or waiters in restaurants.51 Glass workers had organized a union, but it
                    excluded blacks. Clearly 
                        Muncie
                     had a long way to go to achieve racial equality, but segregation and discrimination
                    were not as pervasive as in the South at this time.
            The evidence from the interviews suggests several hypotheses to explain why black migrants continued
                    to select 
                        Muncie
                     while African Americans were leaving similar Indiana cities and why they came even
                    during periods when the 
                        Muncie
                     economy slowed. Even in times of slow growth, 
                        Muncie
                     continued to enjoy the fruits of the frantic industrialization spurred by the gas boom,
                    as firms such as Ball Brothers and Hemingray remained. Ball Brothers, for example, reduced its need
                    for labor as a result of extensive mechanization beginning in the 1890s, but the company still
                    employed 2,500 workers in 1936.52
            
            With this industrial base, 
                        Muncie
                     contributed, along with larger centers in both the North and the South, to the process
                    of prole-tarianizing the African-American work force, molding a population of mostly agricultural
                    laborers into industrial workers.53 For some migrants who experienced this
                    process, industrial work meant an intensification of work patterns learned in seasonal engagement
                    with the southern industrial economy. From the migrants' perspective, at least equally
                    important was the higher and more regular pay their labor in northern industries could command.
            For employers, hiring black workers may have meant hindering unionization by fostering division among
                    their workers—an action employers may have seen as especially necessary in a community
                    that attracted relatively few immigrant workers. Since the jobs black factory workers found were
                    generally the most menial and poorest paid, white employers and co-workers may have been able to
                    maintain racial stereotypes even in the face of black achievement. The ability of northern
                    industrialists to attract blacks to their least desirable factory jobs depended upon the
                    continuation of even worse prospects for African Americans in the South and in the rural and
                    small-town North.
            Jobs, however, were not the whole story. In deciding whether and when to leave the South and where to
                    settle in the North, black

                            or three years the appointment of the city's first black fire fighter. Furthermore,
                            in 1897 an African American was hired to a clerkship in the city post office. Goodall and

                             appears to depart from William Cohen's generalization that few blacks
                            migrated to the North before World War I because of "an absence of jobs open to
                            blacks." Cohen, Freedom's Edge, 96.
               
                     migrants probably considered more than merely the availability
                    of jobs.54 As they searched for better employment, they looked for improvement
                    in other areas of life: better housing, better schools, equal treatment, and freedom from
                        violence.55 This last factor may have been a key to the migration of
                    midwestern rural and smalltown black populations to cities beginning in the 1890s. Most of the
                    collective violence directed against blacks in the lower Midwest around the turn of the century
                    occurred in rural areas and small towns.56 Blacks generally did not stay in or
                    migrate to such places. In Indiana, towns where lynchings or race riots occurred experienced an
                    average rate of black population growth lower than the average for their size category.57
                    
                        Muncie
                    , however, seems to have been free from antiblack collective violence during this
                        period.58 Its relatively tranquil racial atmosphere may have bolstered 
                        Muncie
                    's appeal to blacks during its industrial slowdown in the first decade of the
                    century, a time when violence flared in other communities.
            
               
                        Muncie
                    's proportion of black population grew even during the 1920s, when it was a
                    stronghold of the Ku Klux Klan.59 Some of the 
                        Muncie
                     interviewees recalled witnessing Klan meetings or having personal acquaintance with
                    Klansmen, but none recalled any incidents of Klan-inspired violence against blacks.60 "The Klan was active in 1920," reported one. "They used to
                    assemble right down here on

                     54 The inadequacy of a purely economic explanation of migration is
                            noted in Lansing and Mueller, Geographic Mobility of Labor, 5-6. Peter
                            Gottlieb points out that the period of mass migration to the North during World War I was
                            also a period of economic expansion in both rural and urban areas in the South. Gottlieb,

            Other Indiana cities whose black populations grew rapidly after 1890 seem to have shared varying
                    combinations of 
                        Muncie
                    's characteristics (see Table 4). Industry was a key variable, as shown by the
                    development of sizeable African-American populations in industrial towns located either in the Gas
                    Belt (Anderson and Marion) or in the rapidly industrializing region near 
                        Chicago
                     (
                        Gary
                     and 
                        Michigan City
                    ).62 Although Indiana's black population shifted north
                    within the state after 1890, not all northern Indiana cities gained black citizens, nor did all
                    southern Indiana cities lose them. Some northern communities, such as 
                  Kokomo, Richmond
               ,
                    and Logans-port, showed rates of black population growth that suggested that in-migration was at
                    best balanced by out-migration. Other places in the North lost black population. In southern
                    Indiana, only 
                        Terre Haute
                     seems to have grown through migration. 
                        Evansville
                    , meanwhile, demonstrated that the local context within which industrialization occurred
                    was crucial. That city's growing industries offered few jobs for blacks, while heightened
                    racial discrimination and a vicious race riot in 1903 drove blacks from the city.63 Blacks generally moved from smaller places to larger ones, but the size of a
                    town's black community was not a reliable predictor of subsequent black population
                        growth.64 The presence of immigrants by itself did not seem to discourage
                    black population growth, as the examples of immigrant-rich Gary and South Bend indicate.65 With the exception of 
                        Terre Haute

                            cities during the 1920s but argues that this development, while motivated by the same racist
                            attitudes that bolstered the Klan, was not produced by Klan activity. Thornbrough,

                     64 Among sixteen Indiana cities with a 1910 population of 10,000 or
                            more and an 1890 black population greater than 10, there was not a statistically significant
                            correlation between the size of the black population in 1890 and the percentage increase of
                            the black population over the subsequent twenty years (r =
                            -.21, p > .05). The same test produced the same result for the thirty-six towns and
                            cities having a 1910 population of 5,000 or more and an 1890 black population greater than
                            10 (r = -.12, p > .05). This contrasts with findings on patterns of black
                            migration to metropolitan areas during the 1950s. Price and Sikes, Rural-Urban

                            than 2,500 population in 1910 shows that the black percentage in 1910 was only weakly
                            correlated (negatively) with the percentage of foreign-born whites in the same year: r = -.20, p > .05. Unfortunately, it is impossible to
                            conduct a statistical test of the effect of large immigrant populations in industrial communities, since census data to measure industrialization are not
                            available at the local level.

                     rapidly growing black populations lacked recorded incidents of
                    antiblack public violence.66
            
            To understand the ebb and flow of black migration to 
                        Muncie
                    , it may be helpful to think of migrants' perceptions of 
                        Muncie
                     as colored both by characteristics of the 
                        Magic City
                     and by the southern and northern backgrounds against which migrants weighed 
                        Muncie
                    's qualities. Both 
                        Muncie
                     and these backgrounds changed over time. These changes, together with the developments
                    already discussed in this paper, suggest that the growth of 
                        Muncie
                    's black population occurred in three distinct stages. During the Civil War and
                    the quarter-century following emancipation, African Americans migrated from the Upper South to 
                        Muncie
                     as they did to other small towns and small cities in the Midwest. They found settings
                    similar to the rural worlds they had left behind. During this period, 
                        Muncie
                    's appeal to black migrants depended on its similarity to other Indiana small
                    towns.
            After 1890, as the tide of migration in the Midwest began to turn toward the region's
                    largest cities, 
                        Muncie
                     continued to attract black migrants. Factors contributing to its continuing appeal
                    probably included the countercyclical timing of its industrialization, the paucity of immigrants who
                    could compete for factory jobs, and its relative freedom from antiblack public violence.67
            
            Finally, after 1915 African Americans from the Deep South joined a continuing stream of migrants from
                    the Upper South to fill the jobs created by a booming industrial economy. By this time, a black
                    community had formed in 
                        Muncie
                     of sufficient size to support migration chains that allowed the 
                        Magic City
                     to share in the fruits of the first Great Migration.68 Having set
                    itself apart from the pattern of black out-migration that characterized other midwestern small towns
                    at the turn of the century, 
                        Muncie
                     was able to remain an attractive destination for African-American migrants.
            The view from 
                        Muncie
                     provides a useful perspective on some important issues surrounding black migration.
                    Migration to 
                        Muncie
                     between the Civil War and the Great Depression was not a headlong flight from
                    heightened segregation and violence in the South, but rather a long-term process resting upon a
                    succession of

                     67 Kenneth Kusmer argues that a decline in black opportunity
                            throughout the North during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was retarded
                            in medium-sized midwestern cities, "chiefly because they contained fewer immigrants
                            to compete for … jobs [in the skilled trades]." Kenneth Kusmer, A Ghetto Takes Shape: Black

                        Muncie
                    , the places where migrants originated, and the other destinations to which they might
                    have traveled. Nor was it a blind rush to any place where a railroad might deposit southerners
                    heading north. Northern-born migrants relied upon prior experience of northern conditions, and
                    migrants from both North and South depended upon information gathered from family and friends about
                    potential destinations. Foreknowledge was necessary because northern towns and cities presented to
                    the migrant not a uniform field of opportunity but a patchwork of jobs varying in quantity and
                    quality, black communities differing in size and readiness to welcome newcomers, and race relations
                    of varying temperatures.69 And, like a turned kaleidoscope, the pattern changed
                    with time. That blacks continued to migrate to

            During the Civil War Hoosier Republicans claimed that a very large proportion of their Democratic
                    neighbors were avoiding military service. In the wake of their party's disastrous 1862
                    defeat, 
                        Greene County
                    's Republican newspaper asserted that the loss "proves conclusively
                    that a large majority of the soldiers from Indiana are Republicans." To back their
                    contentions Republican newspapers throughout much of the war printed straw polls of Hoosier military
                    units that registered huge majorities for state and national Republican candidates.1
            
            Most modern historians have discounted the wartime accusations of Hoosier Republicans as little more
                    than overheated political hyperbole. Young men volunteered in such great numbers at the beginning of
                    the war that it is hard not to believe that members of both parties volunteered in large numbers.
                    "Certainly," Kenneth M. Stampp has written, "Republicans could not
                    surpass the Democratic masses in devotion to the war effort" at the beginning of the
                    conflict. Democratic opposition to the war and the policies of the administrations of President
                    Abraham Lincoln and Indiana Republican Governor Oliver P. Morton did not develop, it is generally
                    held, until later with the advent of the Militia Draft and the preliminary Emancipation
                        Proclamation.2

                        , wrote in a private letter to a fellow Vigo Republican who was serving in Abraham
                        Lincoln's administration of his concern that, locally, their party was going to lose
                        the 1862 elections because so many area Republicans were in the army and would thus be unable to
                        vote. Harvey D. Scott to John Palmer Usher, October 2, 1862, John Palmer Usher Papers (

            The commonsense views expressed by Stampp and others have been reinforced by statistical evidence.
                    Gilbert R. Tredway found that predominantly Democratic congressional districts in Indiana actually
                    outperformed many Republican districts in raising recruits during the war. Analysis of county-level
                    data for the period before the draft similarly reveals no meaningful correlations between
                    volunteering and either Democratic or Republican dominance in 
                        Indiana counties
                    .3
            
            With common sense and statistics arrayed against the Republican charges, no one has bothered to
                    undertake a detailed investigation of which Hoosiers volunteered for service during the Civil War.
                    The more closely one examines the political situation in Indiana and the letters of ordinary
                    residents, however, the more evidence one finds supporting the Republican charges. The public
                    statements of Democratic politicians, for example, suggest that Democratic opposition to Republican
                    policies was, in fact, quite strong from the beginning of the war. In an April, 1861, speech, John
                    G. Davis, the Democratic congressman from the Seventh District during most of the 1850s, proclaimed
                    that the South had not seceded, which was illegal, but was in revolution, which was legal. This
                    being the case, Davis concluded, it was wrong for the Lincoln

                            Civil War of reduced party strife and of broad public support for the war that cut across

                            were serving at the time of the first draft enrollment was divided by the total county
                            population to obtain a comparable figure for recruits from each county. This figure was
                            compared to the average Republican vote of each county for the period of 1856-1864. The
                            figures for the most heavily 
                                Republican

                             reveal no particular pattern. Regression analysis of ninety of the
                            state's ninety-two counties (
                                Jasper
                             and Newton were excluded for lack of voting data) failed to find any meaningful
                            relationship between Republican voting and high volunteer rates. Whether using numbers per
                            hundred population or grouping these numbers into categories, the values for R squared were
                            neglible. These findings, however, may be somewhat dubious because there are so many
                            complicating factors, such as the fact that many of the most heavily 
                                Republican counties
                             contained large numbers of pacifist Quakers and the fact that some heavily 
                                Democratic counties
                             had large immigrant populations. In addition, the maturity of the rural
                            populations varied widely across the state, from a few mature southern counties that were
                            losing population during the 1860s to a few northern counties that were still in a frontier
                            condition. County figures for volunteers serving at the time of the first draft are in

                     administration to coerce the Confederate states back into the
                    Union. Although less strident in his opposition, Davis's successor, Democratic Congressman
                    Daniel W. Voorhees, declared in May, 1861, that he was in favor of a compromise solution to the
                    sectional crisis rather than a military one. Democratic leaders may not have publicly urged their
                    constituents to avoid service, but their pronounced opposition to a military solution discouraged
                    Democrats from volunteering.4
            
            The private correspondence of rank-and-file Republicans from west-central Indiana contains charges
                    that Democrats were not volunteering. These charges were not simply a parroting of the accusations
                    Republican leaders so often made in public. Rather, rank-and-file Republicans based their claims on
                    their own observations in their own communities. Upset that so few local Democrats were serving,
                    Sarah Dooley of 
                        Parke County
                     wrote to her soldier son that she approved of the draft because "I do feel
                    like some of the Butternuts ought to go." One 
                        Vigo County
                     volunteer wrote home, "They may tell you that there are as many Dem[.] in the

                            remarks probably represent an extreme position. However, most Democrats appear to have had a
                            kind of sympathy for the South because, while they felt secession was wrong, they believed
                            the primary cause of the war was an aggressive Republican party that was trying to change
                            the nation in a way detrimental not only to the South but also to Hoosier Democrats. See

                     describing the behavior of people they knew have been so
                    mistaken? In order to reconcile the conflicting evidence about who volunteered, this article
                    presents a case study of volunteers from Indiana's Seventh Congressional District. It
                    examines selected infantry companies organized during the first year of the war, the predraft
                    volunteers from four townships, and volunteers whose biographies appear in county histories. Most of
                    the evidence in this study is drawn from the period before the advent of drafts in mid-1862 and thus
                    from a time when men were free to join or not join without the threat of being conscripted.
            The Seventh Congressional District encompassed an eight-county area surrounding the city of 
                        Terre Haute
                    , the county seat of 
                        Vigo County
                    . With a population of 8,594, 
                        Terre Haute
                     was the largest city in west-central Indiana. It was a regional economic center with
                    excellent transportation facilities and large-scale milling and slaughterhouse operations that
                    processed the agricultural commodities of west-central Indiana and east-central 
                        Illinois
                    . While the district did contain some substantial towns besides 
                        Terre Haute
                    , a significant amount of manufacturing, and a small immigrant population, it was a
                    largely rural area with an agricultural economy and a predominantly native-born population that
                    contained substantial numbers of people of both southern and northern birth or ancestry. There were
                    both Republican- and Democratic-dominated counties in the district and two counties that were evenly
                    divided between the parties.6
            
            The records of three companies organized in the district early in the war provide the first evidence
                    about who volunteered. The men of Companies C and D of the 11th Indiana Regiment of Volunteers
                    enlisted for three years. Almost all of the recruits listed 
                        Vigo County
                     as their place of residence. The manuscript enrollment lists for the companies provide
                    the ages of each recruit. With a name and an age all but a few recruits with very common names can
                    potentially be identified in the 1860 manuscript census. Most of the recruits who were listed in the
                    census were young, single, and poor. This is what one would expect given the findings of the
                    existing studies of Civil War volunteers.7

                        contained in the district during the Civil War were 
                     Clay, Greene
                  , Owen, Parke, 
                            Putnam

                            Vermillion
                        , and Vigo.
               
                  7 For the social characteristics of the enlisted men and noncommissioned
                        officers of the 11th and the 43rd, see Thomas E. Rodgers, "A Collective Profile of
                        Union Army Volunteers in West-Central Indiana" (Paper presented at the annual
                        convention of the Social Science History Association; 
                            Baltimore
                        , November, 1994). While little intense analysis of Hoosier recruits and recruiting
                        has been done, there have been a number of case studies of volunteers in other areas of the
                        country and several more general works on recruiting, the draft, the motivations and experiences
                        of recruits, and the demographics of enlistees. James W. Geary, We Need Men:
                        The
               
            
            
            What is surprising about these recruits is that so few of them can be found in the manuscript census
                    taken about a year before the enrollment. Using a county index of the 
                        Vigo County
                     1860 manuscript census, a state index of the 1860 manuscript census assembled by the
                    Indiana Historical Society, and other sources, the following conclusions can be made. Of the 143
                    enlisted men who gave 
                        Vigo County
                     as their place of residence, 39.2 percent do not appear in the census for the entire
                    state. For some 17.5 percent of the recruits a person of the correct age and name was listed as a
                    resident of Indiana but in a county outside the Seventh Congressional District. Thus some 56.7
                    percent of the volunteers listed as residents of 
                        Vigo County
                     had probably come from somewhere outside of the district during the previous year. Only
                    29.3 percent of the recruits were living in 
                        Vigo County
                     at the time the census was taken. The remaining 14.0 percent of the soldiers appear to
                    have been living in nearby counties of the Seventh Congressional District or in a neighboring county
                    in 
                        Illinois
                     at the time of the census.8

                  8 The two companies were mustered on August 31, 1861. The published
                        rosters of Indiana volunteer companies usually give the enlistee's place of residence,
                        date of muster, and date of death or of release from the army. The place of residence provided
                        is usually a county, but in some cases a town is given instead. Town names can be tricky because
                        recruits apparently sometimes gave the name of the nearest town with a post office, even if that
                        town was in a different township or even a different county. The manuscript muster roles for the
                        11th provide the ages of the recruits but no other significant information. For the published
                        rosters, see Terrell, Report of the Adjutant General of the State of Indiana.

                            Indianapolis
                        ). The Indiana Historical Society's state index for the 1860 manuscript
                        census lists all residents of the state alphabetically. The list gives the name, age, place of
                        birth, county of residence, and census location of each person. 
                            Vigo County
                         was bordered on the west by two 
                            Illinois
                         counties. No census index was available for 
                            Edgar County
                        , but one was for 
                            Clark County
                        . Men not found in the Indiana state index were searched for in the 
                            Clark County
                         index. There is no way to know if the young men from nearby counties had moved to
                        Vigo or if they

            Given 
                        Terre Haute
                    's size, its economy, and its transportation facilities, one might expect its
                    units to have included more transient young men than units from rural counties. This appears to have
                    been the case. The rural county unit chosen for study was Company E of the 43rd Indiana Regiment of
                    Volunteers, a unit raised in predominantly rural 
                        Sullivan County
                     in the period before conscription existed. The percentage (57.5 percent) of the
                    seventy-three Sullivan enlisted men recruits who appeared in the manuscript census was twice that of
                    the Vigo recruits. While many of the men listed in the census fit a nonpersister profile, there were
                    more sons of landowning families and a few more men with wealth of their own than was the case with
                    the Vigo recruits. Despite these differences a substantial percentage of privates (42.5 percent) did
                    not appear in the Sullivan census, and a number of the men who did appear seem to have been marginal
                    to the economy and society of the county.9
            
            The noncommissioned officers of Companies C and D of the 11th and Company E of the 43rd were more
                    likely to be present in the 1860 census and less likely to exhibit characteristics associated with
                    marginal, nonpersister individuals. While the sergeants and corporals of Companies C and D were more
                    likely than the men they commanded to be present in 1860, still only a minority of them were in the
                    census. Some 42.9 percent of the twenty-four noncommissioned officers of Companies C and D were
                    present. Although they possessed little wealth, these men were much more likely to be skilled
                    workers. Of the thirteen noncommissioned officers in Company E some 76.9 percent, including all of
                    the sergeants, were in the 1860 Sullivan census. These men were more likely to be landowners than
                    were the men they commanded or their peers in the two companies of the 11th.10
            
            Based on these three companies, it appears that a substantial number of the volunteers from
                    west-central Indiana were drawn from the large pool of single, low-skilled, poor young men who did
                    not persist for long in any one place that social historians have discovered and described.11 This was especially true of the 
                        Vigo County
                    
                    
                  simply went there to enlist. For a number of reasons, however, it is probable that many
                            had recently moved to Vigo. It was not unusual for people from the region to move to 
                                Terre Haute
                            , some recruits gave non-Vigo addresses, and there was no apparent advantage in
                            lying about one's residence during the early months of recruitment.
                  
                     9 Company E was mustered on October 9, 1861. The search for men in the
                            census was aided by very good county- and state-level indices. On the 43rd Indiana Regiment
                            of Volunteers, see Box 102, Civil War Muster Rolls (Indiana State Archives); Terrell, Report of the Adjutant General of the State of Indiana.

                            officers are in the same sources as those of the enlisted men (see notes 8 and 9). For
                            economic information on these men, see Rodgers, "Collective Profile of Union Army
                            Volunteers."
                  
                     11 For background on geographical mobility in the nineteenth-century
                            Midwest, see Don Harrison Doyle, The Social Order of a Frontier
                        Community:
                  
               
                     volunteers. Not only did fewer of them appear in the census,
                    but more of those who did appear fit the nonpersister profile than was the case for the 43rd. Thus
                    it appears that a significant number of the men who volunteered for service had not been socialized
                    in the cultures or political ideologies of the Seventh District.
            What can be discovered about the political affiliations of the volunteers who were in the 1860 census
                    or who settled in 
                        Vigo
                     or 
                        Sullivan counties
                     after their military service? Very little information about the volunteers of Companies
                    C and D is extant. What evidence there is suggests tentative identifications for six enlisted men
                    and one noncommissioned officer who were listed in the 1860 Vigo census. All seven appear to have
                    been Republicans. The characteristics of the volunteers and of the historical materials available
                    make it nearly impossible to identify more members of the two companies by party. With the exception
                    of Riley Township, which is discussed below, what is known about party affiliations is based on
                    lists of party activists and biographies in county histories written years after the war. These
                    sources generally contain information only on individuals who persisted and thrived in the county.
                    Most of the volunteers, however, appear to have been young, single, transient men, only a few of
                    whom established families and put down roots in 
                        Vigo County

            More information on party affiliation is available for the men of the 43rd than for those of the
                    11th. The 43rd included a larger number of persisters, and a larger number of sources of party

                            have had an influence on who volunteered. The three-year 11th was preceeded by an 11th
                            Regiment with a three-month enlistment. While many of the characteristics of the men of the
                            two regiments were similar, the three-month men were more likely to be in the census, and
                            some of these men came from prominent families, including the important Republican
                            Fairbanks, Ross, and Paddock families and a son of Richard W. Thompson, one of the most
                            important Republican activists in the county. Most of the men from the three-month 11th who
                            reenlisted in the three-year 11th were nonpersisters. An exception was John E. Wilkins, the
                            only volunteer from Companies C and D of the 11th who is known to have left a written
                            record. His diary indicates that he was very devoted to the Union cause.
               
                     records for two townships together provide party
                    identifications for hundreds of the county's families. Among the officers, noncommissioned
                    officers, and enlisted men of the 43rd, some twenty-two can be identified by party. Four of the
                    enlisted men were War Democrats from the same family. James W. Lloyd, the head of this family, felt
                    so strongly about the war that he joined the 43rd in spite of family obligations, a substantial farm
                    to run, and other restraints. Lloyd was reported in a county history to have been the first man in
                    the county to volunteer for service and to have made a strong speech in favor of the war policy of
                    the Lincoln administration. Three of Lloyd's sons, including one who lived outside of the
                    county, joined the company with their father. Of eleven other enlisted men identified by party, ten
                    were Republicans, while only one was a regular Democrat. The party affiliations of five of the
                    noncommissioned officers can also be established: all five were Republicans. Two of the three
                    officers of the company were identified by party: both were Republicans. The proportion of
                    Republicans (77.3 percent) among the twenty-two men identified by party is quite extraordinary
                    considering that the average Republican share of the vote in 
                        Sullivan County
                     was 26.8 percent.13
            
            Was the hugely disproportionate number of Republicans among the volunteers of the 43rd who can be
                    identified by party an anomaly, or did Republicans among the more stable part of the population of
                    the Seventh District volunteer in disproportionately high numbers? An answer to this question can be
                    found by analyzing the predraft volunteers from four townships in Sullivan, 
                        Putnam
                    , and 
                        Vigo counties
                    , places for which a good deal is known about party affiliations (see Table 1). Of the
                    four townships, 
                        Hamilton
                     Township in 
                        Sullivan County
                     has the most information available. 
                        Hamilton
                     Township contained the town of Sullivan, which was the county seat, the largest town in
                    the county, and the focal point for the county's political activity. Some 253 men listed in
                    the Militia Enrollment of 1862 as having volunteered for service before the 
                  
                     13 The prevalence of Republicans among the identified enlisted men
                            resulted in part from the fact that a number were from 
                                Hamilton
                             Township, for which a Republican voter list is available. Still, the presence
                            of only one regular Democrat among those identified by party seems remarkable considering
                            the large number of Democrats in the county and the fact that more than 138 Democratic
                            families can be identified from convention lists in the Sullivan Democrat.

                            footnote 14). The county voting average is based on the elections held in 1856, 1858, 1860,
                            1862, and 1864. A War Democrat is defined here as a pre-war Democrat who supported the
                            Republican party and/or its policies during the war but who returned to the Democratic party
                            within a few years of the end of the war. Prewar Democrats who supported the Republicans
                            during the war and continued doing so for a long period after the war are counted as
                            Republicans.

                    census, and 16 (6.3 percent) were in the county but not in 
                        Hamilton
                     Township during the time the census was taken. Of the 135 (53.4 percent of the total)
                    men who were present in 
                        Hamilton
                     Township in 1860, 49 (36.3 percent) could not be identified by party, 2 (1.5 percent)
                    were Democrats, and 84 (62.2 percent) were Republicans. Circumstantial, but inconclusive, evidence
                    suggests that some of the 49 men who could not be identified by party were probably Republicans.
                    Thus the number 84 for Republicans should be seen as a minimum figure. If only recruits who joined
                    units organized in 1861 are counted, the Republican percentage is even higher. Some 108 of the
                    township's recruits were in the 1860 census and joined during 1861. Of these men, 2 (1.9
                    percent) were identified as Democrats, while at least 76 (70.4 percent) were Republicans. As was the
                    case with the party affiliation figures from the 43rd, the percentage of Republican volunteers among
                    the stable population in 
                        Hamilton
                     was much larger than the Republican proportion of the voting population (about 31.2
                    percent) whether one uses the number at the time of the draft or the 1861 figures.15
            
            Many of the men present in the 1860 census fit the typical nonpersister profile. They were landless,
                    low-skilled, single, and young. A number, however, exhibited other characteristics. A surprising
                    number of volunteers were middle-aged, married, and propertied. Some thirty-eight of the recruits
                    were listed in the Militia Enrollment as being over thirty-five years old when they joined. Of the
                    thirty-eight, some twenty-seven appear in the census. Among these twenty-seven, one (3.7 percent)
                    was identified as a Democrat, and at least seventeen (63.0 percent) were Republicans. Some of these
                    men had grown sons who also volunteered. The most extreme example of this trend for older men to
                    join was the Republican

                            contains a list of men eligible for the draft and a separate list of men who had served or
                            were serving at the time of the enrollment. This second list provides a name, an age, and
                            usually the unit and civilian occupation of each soldier from the township. On Lloyd, see

                activist James Case, Sr. Case, aged sixty-one, joined the army along with five of his
                    sons. While Case's advanced age was unusual, multiple enlistments from one nuclear family
                    were not uncommon among 
                        Hamilton
                     Republicans. Hannah Crowder, for example, sent four Republican sons off to war, while
                    forty-five-year-old Hardin Boles and two of his sons enlisted.
            Since it contained the county seat, 
                        Hamilton
                     Township also included an unusually large number of political activists. The same
                    pattern of enlistment existed among these highly visible political leaders as among the general
                    population. Republican activists and their sons were much more likely to enlist than were their
                    Democratic counterparts. There were thirty-four nuclear families of Democratic activists. Among the
                    activists and their military-aged sons in these families, only John S. Milam, aged thirty-eight,
                    joined the army. He served nearly one year as an officer before resigning. One Democratic
                    activist's son might have served, but this cannot be verified. Meanwhile, twenty nuclear
                    families containing Republican  activists provided at least
                    sixteen volunteers before the first draft was held. One recruit cannot be assigned to either group
                    because he was both the son of a Democratic activist and the brother of a Republican activist.16
            
            Jefferson Township was a rural township in the southeastern part of 
                        Sullivan County
                    . It contained no towns of significant size. By the time the draft began, some
                    thirty-five men had volunteered for service. Twenty-seven (77.1 percent) of these men were in the
                    township at the time the 1860 census was taken. Fifteen of the twenty-seven (55.6 percent) can be
                    identified as Republicans. One was a farm laborer who worked for a Republican family, and the
                    remaining eleven men cannot be identified by party. Circumstantial evidence suggests that one of the
                    eleven unidentified men might have been a Democrat, while at least a few of the remaining men might
                    have been Republicans. Some twenty of the twenty-seven local men appear to have joined during 1861.
                    Of this group fifteen (75.0 percent) were Republicans. Jefferson's Democratic leaders and
                    their sons do not appear to have volunteered before the draft, but families of Republican activists
                    provided recruits. Whether one looks at enlistments in 1861 or at the time of the first draft,
                    Republican volunteering was out of all proportion to the township's average Republican vote
                    of about 18.7 percent.17
            
            Were low participation by Democrats and extraordinarily high participation by Republicans unique to 
                        Sullivan County
                    ? Unfortunately, no other townships or counties in the district offer the quantity and
                    range of materials available for 
                        Hamilton
                     and Jefferson townships. However, evidence from two other predominately Democratic
                    townships and one heavily 
                        Republican county
                     suggests that this pattern of volunteering was not confined to 
                        Sullivan County
                    .
            Cloverdale Township in 
                        Putnam
                     County was largely rural, but it did have a small town. It had better transportation
                    facilities and a larger population than Jefferson. It also underwent a voting fraud investigation
                    that left a list of Republican voters. By the time the 
                  
                     16 Republicans also appear to have predominated among
                            Sullivan's military officers, its citizens involved in war-related charity
                            activity, and its draft administrators. See Rodgers, "Northern Political
                            Ideologies," 107-108, 132-33, 147, 374-75, 578.
                  
                     17 The Jefferson average vote is based on elections held in 1856,
                            1860, 1862, and 1864. Immediately after the enrollment was taken twenty-seven more men
                            enlisted. These men were listed separately in the enrollment and their names were crossed
                            out on the list of those subject to being drafted. No other township examined for this study
                            listed men who joined after the enrollment. The number of volunteers (35) before the draft
                            was similar to the number of recruits (42) from Cass Township, 
                                Sullivan County
                            , the only township in the district with a larger Democratic vote (88.3 percent)
                            than Jefferson. The banner Republican township in the district provided more volunteers than
                            Jefferson and Cass combined. Penn Township, 
                                Parke County
                            , voted about 93.3 percent Republican during the war. Despite a smaller
                            population than Jefferson and a large number of 
                                Quaker
                             inhabitants, Penn provided 119 volunteers before the first draft
                        enrollment.
               
                     draft was held, Cloverdale had provided some 104 volunteers. Of
                    these men, 45 (43.3 percent) cannot be located in the township at the time of the 1860 census. Among
                    the 59 men who do appear in the census, 21 (35.6 percent) can be identified as Republicans, while
                    the party affiliation of the remaining men cannot be positively determined. Circumstantial evidence
                    suggests that 1 of the unidentified men was a Democrat, while a substantial number of the rest were
                    probably Republicans. If one looks at only the 53 recruits who joined in 1861, one finds that 21
                    (39.6 percent) were not in the census. Of the 32 men in the census, at least 16 (50.0 percent) were
                    Republicans, while the rest cannot be identified by party. The average Republican vote in Cloverdale
                    Township was only 30.1 percent. As was the case in 
                        Hamilton
                     and Jefferson townships, it is clear that in the predraft period Republican party
                    members were doing their share and more of the war effort.18
            
            While the sources of information about Cloverdale Township are not as good as those for the two 
                        Sullivan County
                     townships, a number of Cloverdale families can be identified as Democratic from lists
                    of activists in newspapers and from biographical entries in county histories. Whether they were
                    activists or the kind of long-term persisters who appear in county histories, the members of these
                    families were people whose Democratic affiliations were well known in the township. These well-known
                    Democrats and their sons did not volunteer, while volunteers can be found among members of the
                    township's Republican activist families.
            Riley Township was a rural township in southeastern 
                        Vigo County
                    . Like 
                        Hamilton
                    , Jefferson, and Cloverdale it was a majority Democratic township that underwent a
                    voting fraud investigation. The sources of information are not as abundant as those for 
                        Hamilton
                     and Jefferson, but a number of Republican voters and activists and Democratic activists
                    and long-term persisters are known. By the time of the Militia Draft, Riley had provided some 108
                    recruits. Of these, 63 (58.3 percent) cannot be located in the 1860 census for the township. Among
                    the 45 recruits who do appear in the census, 20 (44.4 percent) cannot be identified by party, 25
                    (55.6 percent) were Republicans, and none can be positively identified as a Democrat. Among the 44
                    men who joined in 1861, some 26 (59.1 percent) were not in the census. Of the 18 men who were in the
                    census, 12 (67.7 percent) can be identified as Republicans. The 6 remaining men cannot be identified
                    by party, but circumstantial evidence suggests that some of them were Republicans. As was the case
                    in Jeffferson 
                  
                     18 The sources of information on voting affiliation in addition to the
                            Republican voter list from 1864 include newspapers and county histories:

                                Evansville

                     and Cloverdale, some of the recruits came from Republican
                    activist families, while Democratic activist families provided none.19
            
            Data drawn from 
                        Parke County
                     in the northern part of the Seventh District further supports the conclusion that among
                    the persisting population Republicans were more likely to enlist than were Democrats. Parke was a
                    largely rural county with some small towns. Unlike the four townships just examined, Parke featured
                    a heavily Republican polity. In 1880, J. H. Beadle wrote a history of 
                        Parke County
                    . Beadle was a long-time resident of the county and a Civil War veteran. The history he
                    produced is unusually thorough in noting in its biographical sketches such things as a
                    subject's military service, fathers who had sons who served, and party affiliation. Beadle
                    even records some instances of men who wanted to join but were prevented from doing so by various
                    factors. The people he wrote about do not represent a random sample of the county's
                    population but instead constitute a list of some of Parke's long-term persisters. Most
                    political studies of nineteenth-century communities suggest that such individuals predominated in
                    positions of authority and shaped the values and positions of their political parties. Indeed, many
                    of the men in Beadle's biographies were politicians, justices of the peace, and men
                    described as prominent in their communities. The men from Parke examined here, then, were
                    individuals who shaped political ideology and who were highly visible, well-known members of their
                        parties.20
            
            The vast majority of Civil War volunteers were under thirty years old. An analysis of the men in
                    Beadle's work who were eighteen to twenty-nine years old at some point during the Civil War
                        (i.e., born between 1832 and 1846) and residing in 
                        Parke County
                     when the war began reveals the following information. Of the seventy-one Republicans in
                    this age group, some forty-seven (66.2 percent) served in the military. If the six 
                        Quaker
                     Republicans are excluded from the list, the percentage volunteering rises to 69.2.
                    Among the fourteen Democrats in this age group only one (7.1 percent) volunteered. Among Parke men
                    born between 1826 and 1831, eight (36.4 percent) of twenty-two Republicans enlisted, while none of
                    the eight Democrats in this age group joined the military. Two Republicans born before 1826 and two
                    born after 1846 enlisted, while no Democrats in these categories volunteered. Note that, 
                  
                     19 Riley Township's voting patterns were much more volatile
                            than those of the other three townships. The average Republican vote in Riley during the war
                            years (based on the 1860 gubernatorial and 1864 presidential races) was 44.6 percent. For
                            sources on voter affiliation besides the 1864 Republican list, see footnote 12.

                                    Parke County
                                , Indiana (reprint ed., 
                                Knightstown
                            , Ind., 1977). For two good studies of the importance of persisters in a
                            locality's politics see the works by Alcorn and Doyle cited in footnote 11.
                            Alcorn's study deals with 
                        Paris,
                                    Illinois
                     , the county seat of 
                                Edgar County
                            , which bordered

                     unlike the predraft volunteer figures above, these numbers are
                    for men who joined at any time during the war.21
            
            The figures presented in Table 2 suggest that the figures for 
                        Parke County
                     were not unusual for Indiana.

                    , and 
                        Sullivan counties
                     were in the Seventh District. Porter and 
                        Warren
                     counties in northern Indiana and Jackson, Perry, 
                        Spencer
                    , and 
                        Warrick
                     counties in southern Indiana all had unusually high rates of enlistment in the predraft
                    period. 
                  Clark County, Illinois
               , was located on the western borders of 
                        Vigo
                     and 
                        Sullivan counties
                    . While there is some variation from county to county, the percentage of Republicans
                    volunteering in each county is consistently higher than that of Democrats. These figures include
                    recruits from the draft period as well as that of the predraft time.
            In his biographies of the older men in the county, Beadle was careful to note when his
                    subjects' sons served in the military during the Civil War. Because the ages of children
                    are not recorded in the biographies, no accurate percentage of Democratic and Republican families
                    contributing sons can be given. What can be said is that among the numerous older Democratic fathers
                    whose biographies appear in Beadle's work, only two of them (both described as War
                    Democrats) had sons enlist. Each had two sons volunteer. In contrast, a substantial number of the
                    Republican fathers had one to five sons enlist. Excluding those soldier sons included in the figures
                    above, the thirty-one Republican fathers with volunteer sons contributed forty-eight recruits.
            In fact, Republicans in all of the counties listed in Table 2 contributed much more to the war effort
                    than their Democratic neighbors. While examples can be found of Democrats over thirty-five or under
                    draft age volunteering and prominent Democrats organizing volunteer companies, such examples are
                    uncommon. In contrast, dozens of examples of Republicans over and under draft age volunteering, of
                    Republicans organizing volunteer companies, of Republican non-volunteers described as helping
                    soldiers, their families, and the war effort, can be found in these twelve counties. To give just
                    two examples, of the sixty-seven men over thirty-five who volunteered from these twelve counties
                    fifty-four were Republicans, while of the eleven boys born after 1846 who enlisted, ten were
                    Republicans.
            The fact that a significant number of the Parke Republican fathers and 
                        Hamilton
                     Township Republican nuclear families had more than one son in the army coincides with a
                    great deal of anecdotal evidence contained in county histories and other sources from around the
                    Seventh District. Very few examples of Democratic families providing multiple volunteers for the
                    army can be found in the district, and almost all of these families were War Democrats. Conversly,

                     dozens of examples of Republican nuclear families having more
                    than one member for the army can be cited. Many of these families were headed by prominent political
                    leaders. Samuel Myers, for example, was the most prominent Republican activist in Fairbanks
                    Township, 
                        Sullivan County
                    . Five of his six adult sons joined the army. William Harrison, a Republican activist in
                    Russell Township, 
                        Putnam
                     County, had all four of his sons and a younger brother enlist in the Union army before
                    conscription was started. In 
                        Parke County
                    , the Dooley family had two single sons who enlisted in the army a total of five times,
                    a married son (living just across the border in 
                        Montgomery County
                    ) who volunteered once after the stimulus of the draft was in place, and a son too young
                    for the army who served in the Home Guards. Samuel R. Cavins, the most important Republican
                    politician in 
                        Greene County
                    , had all four of his sons join the army. Lewis P. Letsinger, another 
                        Greene County
                     Republican, had six sons and three sons-in-law serve in the army.22
            
            Could it be that while political affiliation appears to have been a major motivational factor for
                    volunteering among the more stable part of the population some other factor reflected in or masked
                    by political affiliation was the real causal factor? The answer is no. The most likely alternative
                    factor was regional origin. Since the Seventh District and the entire southern half of Indiana
                    contained many people who were from the South or whose ancestors had migrated from there, it has
                    been suggested that this segment of the population might have been less enthusiastic for the Union
                    cause. As noted earlier, there is no statistical evidence demonstrating that southern Indiana
                    provided fewer recruits than northern Indiana. With regard to the hundreds of Seventh District
                    volunteers examined in this study, there are no strong indications that being of northern or
                    southern birth or ancestry was a significant factor in determining whether or not one volunteered.
                    For instance, some 44.4 percent of the noncommissioned officers of Companies C and D of the 11th who
                    can be located in the census were born in a northern state other than Indiana or were sons of people
                    from other northern states. This is a much larger figure than the percentage (27.2 percent) of all
                    adult males in 
                        Vigo County
                     who had northern origins. However, the enlisted men and noncommissioned officers of
                    Company E of the 43rd displayed a disproportionate percentage of men of southern birth or ancestry.
                    Some 43.9 percent of the adult males of 
                        Sullivan County
                     were of southern origins, but bout 47.6 percent of the enlisted men and 90.0 percent of
                    the noncommissioned officers of Company E who can be found in the census were born in the South or
                    were of southern ancestry. In addition, regional origin had little if any impact on patterns of
                    volunteering among

                     the Republicans in Beadle's history of 
                        Parke County
                    . Among the Republicans born between 1832 and 1846, twenty-nine were non-Quakers of
                    southern birth or heritage, while twenty had a northern background. Of the twenty-nine southern
                    Republicans who volunteered, 69.0 percent enlisted, while 75 percent of the northern Republicans
                    enlisted. Some nineteen of the thirty-one Parke Republican fathers who had sons enlist were born in
                    southern states, while twelve were born in northern ones.23
            
            If Republicans predominated among the volunteers from the more stable population, what was the
                    political orientation of the nonpersisters? Probably no definitive answer to this question can be
                    given. A few of the nonpersisters remained long enough in the polity from which they volunteered and
                    were sufficiently successful to be included in county histories. A few nonpersisters appear to have
                    been young men who had left home to work elsewhere but who returned home to enlist. However, these
                    two categories combined include only a very small part of the nonpersisters. For the vast majority
                    little can be known. What can be inferred from straw polls of troops and from general political
                    studies is contradictory. On the one hand, straw polls of soldiers often resulted in such
                    overwhelming Republican majorities that large numbers of nonpersisters must have voted Republican.
                    On the other hand, no study of mid-nineteenth century voting behavior suggests that unskilled,
                    single, rootless, young men and older unskilled laborers without property were overwhelmingly
                    Republican. If anything, existing studies suggest just the opposite.24
            
            The most plausible hypothesis for explaining the political views of most nonpersisters is that the
                    majority of them did not have a strong political orientation when they joined and that many of these
                    weakly oriented volunteers were converted to the Republican view by the zealous party members who
                    joined in such large numbers. Over 40 percent of the privates in the three companies of the 11th and
                    43rd who could not be located in the census were too young to have voted in 1860. Given their
                    frequent movement, it is possible that many of those in their early and middle twenties had never
                    lived in a place long enough to meet residency requirements

                            volunteered and four did not. For background on the Quakers and military service in Indiana,

                            west-central Indiana seems to have been greater than for non-Republicans. See Rodgers,

                     for the franchise. Displaced from the influence of their
                    families and neighbors and unlikely to have established any personal pattern of voting, most of
                    these young men probably had no strong political orientation.25
            
            This hypothesis is supported by the fact that in the Seventh District the young Democrats who did
                    live at home, where strongly Democratic kin and neighbors could exert influence over them, did not
                    join the army in numbers proportional to their presence in the population. It is also supported by
                    one of the few literary sources left by a nonpersister. E. B. Reese was a young, single farm laborer
                    from 
                        Pennsylvania
                     who happened to be living near Gosport, 
                        Owen County
                    , when the war began. In his short memoir he says that he told his pro-Union employer, a
                    Reverend Milligan, that he was thinking about joining. The minister then took over, pushing his
                    ambivalent farmhand toward a decision to join and even bringing a recruiter to the house to sign him
                    up. Reese never really explains why he joined or for what he thought he was fighting. He makes some
                    vague comments about preserving the Union at one point toward the end of his memoir, but he makes no
                    clear pronouncement of his motivation for fighting or his views on slavery. Except for passing
                    references to Lincoln being a "great president," Reese has nothing to say about
                    politics. Aside from his recruitment story, he also has very little to say about 
                        Owen County
                     or Indiana. He appears not to have been integrated into the community to any meaningful
                    degree at the time of his enlistment. In fact, what seems to have impressed Reese most was not some
                    great national cause or duty to his adopted state or local neighborhood, but the camaraderie he
                    experienced with the men of his unit and the thrill and glory of battle.26
            
            While Reese was ambivalent about why he fought, the letters of Republican volunteers from the Seventh
                    District often reveal an intense, almost missionary, zeal for the Union cause and an equally intense
                    disdain for Democrats and their leaders.

                        Putnam
                     County signed his letters to his father "your Son in the Union
                    Cause." His letters regularly condemned Democrats in 
                        Putnam
                     County and the Seventh District as traitors and their position on the war as
                        "toryism."27
            
            Fervently Republican soldiers did not fail to try to convert others to the views they held so
                    strongly. Their letters refer to their circulating pro-Union materials among their fellow soldiers,
                    to the availability of Republican newspapers among the troops, and to the muzzling of those who
                    might espouse Democratic views. The efforts of Republican soldiers to mold the views of their
                    comrades appear to have been as effective as the efforts of Reverend Milligan to push Reese toward
                    enlistment. For example, two young 
                        Greene County
                     officers of the 97th Indiana boasted to another officer, who was back in the Seventh
                    District, that the attitude of the men of their regiment toward Lincoln's preliminary
                    Emancipation Proclamation had changed. At first many of the soldiers were very upset by the
                    proclamation. Then, apparently, Republicans in the unit went to work. The discontent of the soldiers
                    was quieted. The men then were persuaded to reverse their opinion and support the proclamation. Soon
                    the men of the 97th were giving unanimous approval to resolutions in favor of Lincoln's
                    policy, resolutions that were sent off to Hoosier Republican newspapers for publication.28 The presence of fervent Republicans, the relative absence of strongly
                    Democratic soldiers (especially early in the war), and the weak and malleable political views of
                    nonpersisters combined to produce overwhelming support for Republican candidates and policy
                    positions in straw polls of soldiers.29

                        97th found that two were probably Democrats, thirteen were Republicans, and another four were
                        possibly Republicans. The rest could not be identified by party.
               
                  29 An interesting comparison can be made between this process and the
                        religious revivals that occurred in the Confederate army. A recent study has shown that these
                        revivals were not caused primarily by a fear of death among the soldiers but were mainly the
                        result of purposeful evangilizing by religious organizations. The evangelizing was most
                        successful where officers supported it. See Drew Gilpin Faust, "Christian Soldiers: The
                        Meaning of Revivalism in the Confederate Army," Journal of Southern
                            History, LIII (February, 1987), 63-90.
            
            
            Two major facts stand out about the men who volunteered for the army from the Seventh District during
                    the period before a draft existed. First, a substantial proportion of the volunteers were young,
                    single nonpersisters who were not socialized or politically rooted in the county or township from
                    which they volunteered and who probably did not have strong political orientations. The percentage
                    of volunteers who were nonpersisters appears to have been greater in Vigo, a relatively urban
                    county, but the figure for rural 
                        Sullivan County
                     was also substantial. Second, among the more stable parts of the population,
                    Republicans were much more likely to join the army than were Democrats, especially during the huge
                    initial surge of volunteers in 1861. The great difference between Republican and Democratic levels
                    of participation suggests that political ideology was an important motivational factor for
                    volunteers and nonvolunteers among those rooted and socialized in the party politics of west-central
                    Indiana.
            The west-central Indiana Republicans who complained about Democrats not joining, then, were at least
                    partially correct. The Democrats they knew—long-time neighbors and political activists
                    and their sons—did not in fact join in significant numbers. However, these same
                    Republicans failed to note the large numbers of nonpersisters who volunteered. These young, rootless
                    men were nameless faces who passed into the army without being noticed. The number of nonpersister
                    volunteers appears to have been large enough to eliminate significant statistical differences
                    between county-level data on party dominance and data on level of enlistment. In essence, the large
                    numbers of nonpersisters masked statistical differences that might otherwise appear between heavily
                    Democratic and heavily 
                        Republican counties
                    .
            While almost all the data presented here comes from only one congressional district, there is no
                    reason to believe similar patterns of volunteering did not take place in areas of Indiana, 
                        Illinois
                    , and other midwestern states with political and socioeconomic characteristics similar
                    to those of the Seventh District. Indeed, the statistics in Table 2 suggest that the pattern of
                    enlistment in west-central Indiana probably existed, with some variations, in other regions. If the
                    findings here are in fact applicable to large areas of the Midwest, then they raise some interesting
                    questions about the existing literature on volunteers and their motivations. Can one, for instance,
                    make claims about the "patriotism" of all of the people of a county based on a
                    simple examination of volunteer and census numbers when so many recruits were not socialized in the
                    county and when large segments of the stable population may not have volunteered in significant
                    numbers?
            The facts presented here also have implications for the fine studies of Union soldiers and their
                    communities written by Reid 
                        Mitchell
                    , Gerald E. Linderman, and others. Among other things,  these studies describe how communities encouraged enlistment, courage
                    on the battlefield, and relatively good behavior in camp.30 While the figures
                    here in no way refute the theses of these works, they do suggest some caveats. Many of the soldiers
                    who went to war had no ties to the communities in which they enlisted. Republicans seem to have been
                    under many of the community influences various authors have described, but, obviously, the Democrats
                    of west-central Indiana were not subject to the same kinds of pressures that their Republican
                    neighbors experienced. Communities did not exert pressure on all the men they sent to war, and they
                    were not monolithic in their support for the war or in the kinds of influence they exerted on young,
                    longtime residents.
            The facts presented here also have potential implications for the study of women and family life in
                    the Midwest during the Civil War. Most of the best work on the impact of the war on women and
                    families has focused on the South, where the large manpower demands of the Confederacy had a very
                    serious impact on domestic institutions.31 When scholars turn their attention to
                    the Midwest, they are going to find a different situation. Large numbers of the early recruits in
                    this region were single men who were not significantly integrated into their communities. Not only
                    was this true of enlistment in early units like the 11th and 43rd, but it may have been true of
                    subsequent enlistment as well. For example, Beadle's 
                        Parke County
                     history contains information on some ninety-nine married men of all political types
                    born between 1826 and 1846. Only 26.3 percent enlisted, and some of those who did enlist did not do
                    so until the last year or so of the war. In addition, Democratic families were probably not affected
                    by the war to the same degree as Republican families.
            Finally, this study suggests that historians may need to be more sensitive to the limitations of the
                    literary materials available about the Civil War. While many of the recruits analyzed here were
                    single men with few ties to the communities in which they enlisted, 
                  
                     30 See the works by Mitchell, Linderman, and others cited in footnote

                     the collections of Civil War letters that historians rely upon
                    for information about soldiers are generally those of married men and of families who persisted in
                    one place for a long time. The major guide to the manuscript collections of the Indiana Historical
                    Society and Indiana State Library, for example, lists seventy-one major collections of Civil War
                        letters.32 At least 47.9 percent of these collections are in part or in
                    whole letters between a husband and his wife, while most of the rest are to parents,
                    fiancées, and loved ones in the community in which the soldier correspondent enlisted. In
                    addition, some 56.3 percent were written by officers or surgeons, men who were more likely to be
                    stable members of the community than the enlisted men they commanded.
            The material presented here and its implications suggest that despite the enormous number of studies
                    of the Civil War and its impact upon America there is still much yet to be discovered and learned.

            War at the Crossroads
            
                    Erich L. Ewald
                    ∗
                
            Reverend Samuel Sayford's Lutheran church still stands at the Crossroads, a spiritual
                    sentinel guarding 
                        Delaware County
                    's southwestern corner. The dark brown bricks have weathered just as traffic
                    has faded along the two lonely county roads that meet nearby. Several stone throws'
                    distance from the church lies the 
                        Henry County
                     line. That boundary's invisible presence, as if acting in accordance with pure
                    Lutheran doctrine, is dependent upon the faith of the believer.
            Like those of many other Hoosiers, Sayford's life became bound up in the American Civil War.
                    He could not have suspected that the little seminary from which he graduated in 1835 would be swept
                    with rifle shot three decades later. Poised on a ridge in 
                  Gettysburg, Pennsylvania
               ,
                    the building in which he studied Christ's grace witnessed some of the worst horrors of
                    battle. Nor could he foresee that his own son, a boy just three weeks shy of his twenty-first
                    birthday, would die in that war amid the brambles and cane-brakes of a desolate and nearly forgotten
                    portion of the South.
            Reverend Sayford arrived in central Indiana in 1848, and his hard years of riding and preaching
                    brought to life one of the earliest Lutheran congregations in that part of the state. Three years
                    after the war this same congregation, weary of an Ishmaelite existence and enjoying a brief spasm of
                    prosperity, built the church that still welcomes Lutheran faithful today.1

                                Henry County
                            , Indiana, 1822-1906 ("military edition," 2 vols., 
                            New Castle
                        , Ind., 1906), I, 288-89. Testifying to Reverend Sayford's persuasiveness
                        is the fact
            
            
            Many hands built the church, some belonging to battle-hardened survivors who had been friends of and
                    had corresponded with young Augustus Sayford in the days before he was killed by a bullet at Port
                    Gibson, 
                        Mississippi
                    . Others in that close circle of companions never returned: James A. Brown, killed in an
                    assault upon Vicksburg; Joseph VanMatre, died in a 
                        St. Louis
                     hospital; Thomas Graves, mortally wounded at Jackson, 
                        Mississippi
                    ; John Rinker, died at 
                        Shiloh
                    . The survivors themselves did not come back whole, but carried with them to the end of
                    their lives the physical and emotional scars that all wars produce.
            Crossroads itself never amounted to much, and its story is like that of many other Indiana
                    communities. The railroad never came through; roads, once thought to be paved with possibilities,
                    were bypassed by others; tolls fell off from precious little to absolutely nothing. Many of the
                    founders, astutely reading the writing on the economic wall, packed up surveyor instruments and plat
                    books and headed out for parts unknown. One hundred thirty years after the war, Crossroads, Indiana,
                    consists of one church and an atoll of houses surrounded on all sides by a sea of corn.
            In point of fact, Crossroads never even attained the status of a village. It remains today a dot on
                    the map where the roads meet in 
                        Delaware County
                    's 
                        Salem
                     Township. The township itself is a five-mile by seven-mile wedge of gently rolling
                    countryside unremarkable in appearance to the casual observer. There are no natural landmarks to
                    distinguish this part of east-central Indiana from neighboring townships. The only physical feature
                    of note is the White River, which makes a cameo appearance in the
                    township's northwestern quadrant before wandering down to 
                        Madison County
                    .
            The first settlers entered 
                        Salem
                     Township in the early 1820s and began clearing the land with typical Hoosier energy.
                    What consisted originally of temporary hunters' huts and Indian trails running through the
                    wilderness evolved eventually into one of Indiana's fine agricultural centers.
            The land, once cleared, proved so rich and black that it would have been a poor farmer not to have
                    prospered. Bearing testimony to 
                        Salem
                     Township's fertility, some of the earliest land purchases averaged
                    $7.81 an acre when public lands could be had for $1.25 in the rest of the
                    county. Between the clearings grew stands of black walnut trees in such profusion that residents
                    named them the "Rich Woods." One portion of this deep tract, aided and abetted by
                    a 
                  that, upon arriving in Indiana, he took over a temporarily leaderless Presbyterian
                            congregation and galvanized it into "Richwood's Evangelical Lutheran
                            Church," the immediate predecessor of Crossroads Lutheran Church. See Henry G.

                riot of wild cherry and poplar, bounded the 180-acre Sayford family farm.
            In such lush surroundings, with black land and valuable timber, with the White
                    River overflowing with fish and playing host to game of every description, it is not
                    surprising that industry never stood a chance except to serve as a handmaiden to agriculture. The
                    1860 census reveals 227 farmers and sixty-four farm laborers. Sixty-eight other 
                        Salem
                     Township residents listed their chief occupations as blacksmiths, millers, carpenters,
                    wagon makers and the like. The professional ranks were not exactly swollen, consisting of one
                    physician, two school teachers, and—to stretch the definition of
                    "professional" a bit—one "cigar maker." Reverend
                    Sayford, whose ministerial salary could be measured more often than not in bushels, listed himself
                    as "Farmer."
            By 1860, Miami Indians were nonexistent and merchants almost as scarce in 
                        Salem
                     Township. John Gustin had attempted a general merchandise shop at the Crossroads in
                    1832. He lost money and hope in quick succession and abandoned the enterprise. William and Erasmus
                    Moffitt entered the mercantile lists at Crossroads in 1838 and hung on stubbornly for several lean
                    years. At one time or another and in one form or another, between the mid-1830s  and the 1880s, Crossroads supported a church, wagon shop, cooper shop,
                    school, post office, general store, and a brace of blacksmith shops.
            Into this peaceful community blew the American Civil War. Like the legendary Indiana tornados that
                    come every spring, the war arrived and left in its wake unprecedented emotional destruction. The
                    citizens were no strangers to hardship. There could be no such immunity among people who created
                    farms and industries out of a frontier environment. However, when the great test came, Crossroads,
                    like the rest of the nation, stood blissfully unaware of the sacrifice to be demanded of it. It is
                    fairly said that every Indiana community, large and small, suffered the tragic consequences of the
                    Civil War. At the Crossroads, a small and unpretentious mark on the map, war's human cost
                    received magnification in a proportion far beyond the census statistics. Not one Crossroads
                    inhabitant escaped the war's fury. Candles burning by the window periodically announced to
                    neighbors that one of their own had paid the price of preserving the Union. Despite the cost,
                    loyalty to the old flag flowed unabated in 
                        Salem
                     Township, a tiny corner of the Union that consisted in the main of homegrown Hoosiers
                    and transplanted Pennsylvanians and Ohioans. A large contingent of former Virginians, 188 of them to
                    be exact, remained overwhelmingly loyal to their adopted state and the national cause.2
            
            The casualties of the war were immense, and every letter arriving from the front threatened to bring
                    sorrow to the people at home. It is true that the casualties of war littered such places as 
                        Gettysburg
                    's Seminary Ridge and the banks of the Chickamauga. But the war also reached
                    down into thousands of communities like the Crossroads, where each individual death produced dozens
                    of wounded back home in the form of grieving parents, children, wives, and sweethearts.
            The Crossroads Civil War soldiers were ordinary young men who fished and hunted together along the
                    creeks and in the woods surrounding the church. Most were farm boys, many hailed from

                    , Fred Tykle, Cyrus, William, and Abner VanMatre, and Perry Shoemaker joined the 8th
                    Indiana Infantry. George Baker, Joseph VanMatre, and John Rinker enlisted in the 57th Indiana
                    Infantry. The 69th Indiana Infantry received Thomas Graves, Sam Johnson, and Augustus Sayford.3
            
            After Sumter's fall the Crossroads boys enlisted as soon as their individual circumstances
                    would permit. Beginning in the late summer of 1861, Augustus Sayford received from his friends in
                    the service a series of letters that could have only increased his own desire to join. The first
                    came from 
                        Indianapolis
                    , where James 
                        Brown
                     and the reinlisted 8th Indiana were preparing to break camp and move south.4 Each line, simple and unpretentious, conveys the exuberance of boys playing at
                    war. Such early letters display the beginning of the transformation from civilian to soldier that so
                    many American men, North and South, experienced: 
                  
                     
                        Dear friend,
                        It is with pleasure that I take my seat to let you know how I am geting along. I am
                                    well all but my big toe it is verry sore, me and Harmon was cuting up the other
                                    night and I was bare footed and I got my toe snaged. I was out on drill this morning
                                    and my foot swelled up, and has got verry sore, however, I dont think it is a fatal
                                    wound. I think I will get over it pretty handy.
                        Gustus I must tell you how I like Camp life. I like it verry well so far. I would not
                                    come home under anny circumstances, when we get our uniforms, if I have a chance, I
                                    will come home to see you all. but I dont want to come to stay, they told us that we
                                    would get our uniforms this week but they tell us so menny lies that I dont believe
                                    anny thing they say.5
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            Within a few weeks the regiment found itself in 
                        Missouri
                     as part of a growing force designed to retrieve Federal fortunes after the disaster at

            Alert to a seeming lack of patriotism and suspicious that others back home might capitalize
                    romantically by the absence of those in service, Cyrus peevishly continued: 
                  
                     
                        Augustus I [want] you to answer this letter as soon as you can and give me the news

                                    particular for I am anxious to hear of him prospering. I dont suppose their are any
                                    danger of him going to war and I would like to hear of that he was doing something

            His fears that George would not serve proved groundless. By November, Cyrus was writing: 
                  
                     
                        Gust I have received eight letters this week and nearly all of them states that our
                                    Friend George Baker had enlisted for war; I will acknowledge that I was surprised,
                                    but it may be so. I hope it is. I reckon him and Liza had a good time before he
                                    left. I heard that he was over there.
                     
                  
                As to the Crossroads's soldiers in the 8th, he continued:

                                            General Ben McCulloch. Although the attack initially went well for the

                                    return home in a few days, but never will I come home again as long as there is a

            Possible romance could be but little consolation with a war in progress. Augustus, denied the

            Months passed, and the war deepened. Despite an occassional brush with the enemy, the Crossroads
                    soldiers had not seen much actual combat. That situation changed for the men of the 8th when in
                    March they saw action at Pea Ridge, 
                        Arkansas

                    drove the enemy from the field.13 Thus, to adventure and excitement was added
                    news of military glory. Augustus Sayford's desire to enlist must have accelerated. In June

            Sayford's turn came in August as Indiana braced for a bona fide emergency. From the 
                        Cumberland Gap

                    Hard on its heels arrived a much larger Confederate army under General Braxton Bragg, who had stolen
                    a march on the Union forces in lower 
                        Tennessee
                     and was now approaching the Ohio River. With

                        Cincinnati
                     in a state of panic, Governor Oliver Morton pressed into service several new regiments
                    and sent them packing for the front in record time.15 With friend Sam Johnson,
                    Augustus entered the newly recruited 69th Indiana and trained for a scant eleven days before moving

                     1862. The results were predictable. Assailed by rebel veterans,
                    the Federals were nearly obliterated. They suffered 5,300 killed, wounded, and captured, while the
                    Confederates sustained a mere 500 casualties. The 69th was destroyed. Two-hundred and eighteen of
                    its members were killed and wounded, and the remainder were captured almost to a man. News of the
                    disaster traveled fast and Indiana reeled under the shock.16 As word came that
                    Augustus and the survivors of the 69th had been exchanged and were heading home, Thomas Graves, a

                        Cap. Hoover was telling me that you had no drilling last week, several companies
                                    refusing to drill. He thinks he would have no trouble in geting his company to drill
                                    if the rest would. He said he heard on friday evening that if the regiment did not
                                    do better it would be sent to Camp Chase and put under Gen. Lew Wallace. (Perhaps to

                     located directly across river from the Confederate bastion at Vicks-burg, Sayford wrote
                    to a friend: 
                  
                     
                        Sandford, I have seen many strange and pleasing sights since I left old Ind. Then
                                    again, I have seen some sights that I hope I may never see any more like them, such
                                    as the battlefield. I have seen as much as that as I want to see…
                        We have a great deal of sickness in our army now. The number that dies daily is
                                    estimated at 100. The boys in our Regt will average one a day. We have buried six of
                                    our boys in one day, two which belong to our old Co. We only have 30 men able for

            Thursday, April 30, 1863: Admiral Porter's big naval guns thundered upriver at Confederate
                    installations at Grand Gulf, located immediately below Vicksburg. It was an impressive show, but as
                    the enemy seemed too well prepared there, the movement was only a feint. The soldiers in General
                    Sherman's corps sweltered in their transports while Grant and the remainder of the army
                    drifted south, looking for a better place to cross the 
                        Mississippi
                    . The main body crossed at 
                  Bruinsburg,
                            Mississippi
               , landing unopposed. During
                    the night the rebel garrison at Grand Gulf received intelligence that the Federal army stood on 
                        Mississippi
                     soil and sortied to the little crossroads at Port Gibson to contest the Union advance.
            The opponents collided there early on May 1. What began as one battle quickly degenerated into two
                    separate encounters with the enemy. The terrain dictated the action as the combatants grappled in
                    the clearings. The approaches to the rebel position were broken by brush-filled ravines and gullies,
                    rendering effective coordination among friendly units impossible. The Union left, including the 69th
                    Indiana, assailed the enemy's right flank while a division that contained the 8th Indiana
                    assaulted their left. After a hard fight the enemy was driven away. Casualties were heavy on both
                    sides, and Augustus Sayford himself was left dead on the field.21

                         Post was captured in January, 1863, by a force led by General John A. McClernand.
                        In the autumn of the previous year, President Abraham Lincoln had authorized McClernand to mount
                        an operation against Vicksburg. Instead of that city, however, McClernand chose to attack the 
                            Arkansas
                         Post, located about fifty miles upriver. The post fell after a combined land and
                        waterborne assault on January 10 and 11. Boatner, Civil War Dictionary, 24-25.

            In early June, long before Vicksburg fell in Grant's historic campaign, Captain David Yount
                    of the 69th Indiana's Company H wrote to Reverend Sayford: 
                  
                     
                        You know doubt have heard the sad news of the death of your son Augustus L Sayford.
                                    He fell pierced by a minnie ball in the left hip passing through and lodging in his
                                    cartridge box. He lived but few minutes. Says he tell my friends I die in peace. A
                                    few minutes after he was shot we fixed bayonets and he supposing we were going to
                                    charge exclaimed, that's right boys charge them. He died very easy [and]
                                    did not seem to mind his wound. At the time there were no carriers present to carry
                                    him off the field and we were so hard pressed by the enemy the Col would not let any
                                    one from the ranks carry him back. But Sergeants Fifer & Bigler carried him
                                    down and lay him in the shade on the grass and in a few minutes they brought me back
                                    the sad news that he was no more. There was never a better nor a braver soldier. He
                                    was always an example for his comrades in everything constituted a Christian and a
                                    Soldier. We feel his loss deeply. The boys talk about dear Gus a great deal. But
                                    such is the fate of war. Many have gone before him. Many will follow during this
                                    rebellion and whether they sleep in the lowly valleys of 
                                        Virginia
                                     or on the flowery prairies of

                                    memories and bless their names.22
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            After an absence of four years Cyrus VanMatre, suffering from wounds to face and neck, came back
                        home.23 One by one the other Crossroads Civil War survivors, in varying
                    states of physical wholeness, returned to their community. Some stayed to marry, have children, and
                    build a permanent church at the place where the roads joined. Others drifted off to where their
                    individual fortunes carried them.
            Lincoln had depended on such people to preserve the Union and counted on them to reconstruct it. They
                    had answered his every call: in battle, in camp, and on the march they saw the war through to the
                    bitter end. Only when the president spoke of "malice toward none" might he have
                    been asking too much. While the Crossroads community changed little physically, the scars from the
                    war ran deep, as illustrated by an ugly incident in 
                        Middletown
                     a few days after Lee's surrender. Upon hearing the news of Lincoln's

                     23 Following the Vicksburg campaign, the 8th Indiana fought in 
                                Louisiana
                             and

                            reenlisted. After a furlough back home, the regiment returned to 
                                New Orleans
                             and eventually made its way back to the eastern theater of operations,
                            participating in General Philip Sheridan's Shenandoah Valley
                            campaign. Terrell, Report of the Adjutant General, II, 55-56. VanMatre was

                            result, had been commissioned first lieutenant for gallantry. It can be fairly said that
                            Lieutenant VanMatre's gallantry was not confined exclusively to the battlefield. He
                            married Augustus Sayford's sister, Sarah, in 1867. Sarah died in 1901, whereupon
                            VanMatre besieged, wooed, and married Augustus Sayford's other sister, Laura, in
                            1905.
               
                     indiscreetly remarked, "It was good enough; he should
                    have been killed long ago." According to resident George 
                        Franklin
                    , a mob that included several soldiers home on furlough quickly surrounded the
                    southerner. They marched him out to the railroad bridge with a rope around his neck. Saner heads
                    prevailed, and the crowd contented itself with applying a thick coat of tar and feathers to the
                    offender before running him out of town.24 After four years of cruel sacrifice
                    the South would not hold a monopoly on bitterness and sorrow.
            Other wars came and went. The Crossroads soldiers, having done their duty, concentrated on peaceful
                    pursuits. A new world filled with technological marvels overtook them, and the events of the 1860s
                    faded into distant memory.
            Despite change, the men who survived the war could never forget what they had been through in their
                    younger days. One old Crossroads soldier, fast approaching the end, looked back wistfully upon
                    nearly eighty years of life. In the spring of 1925, Sam Johnson of the 69th Indiana wrote to
                    Augustus Sayford's brother: 
                  
                     
                        Well the first day of May is about to arrive and what happened in May 1863 at
                                    Vicksburg is on my mind.
                        We made an all night march from the Mississippi River to [P]ort
                                    Gibson Miss. where fighting began at two o'clock in the afternoon and
                                    continued until a little after four the following day. That is where your brother
                                    A[u]gustus was killed on May 1, 1863 just a little before four o'clock.
                        John A. Logan came in with his men about four o'clock and drove the
                                    Confederates away.25 We were all in and had it not been for
                                    Logan and his men we would have been captured. We went into camp on the battle field
                                    and made coffee and prepared a bite to eat for we had not had anything to eat since
                                    the day before and we were getting pretty lank. Then we gathered up our dead and
                                    wounded and cared for them either dug graves or dressed wounds then we took a little
                                    trip over the battle field. It certainly was a sight to see where the enemy had been
                                    slaughtered in the cane brakes by Logan's artillery. Early the next morning
                                    we moved on to Raymond where a big battle was fought and from there to
                                    Edward's Station and on in the direction of Jackson Mississippi and then we
                                    turned back west toward Champion[']s Hill where we
                                    landed on the fifteenth and fighting began on the sixteenth.26
                                    That was my birth-day and I wondered whether I would ever live to see another but as
                                    it is I have seen several. It was a pretty hot battle. We captured several rebel
                                    flags and took several prisoners. The next morning we moved on to Black
                                        River where we had another pretty hard fight. We captured about 5,000
                                    rebels and around 25 cannons.

                                            , was the site of a small battle on May 12, 1863, when a
                                            Confederate brigade under General John Gregg contested the advance of
                                            Ulysses S. Grant's army toward Jackson. Gregg held off General
                                            James Birdseye McPherson's corps for several hours before
                                            retreating to Jackson. After taking that city on May 14, Grant turned back
                                            toward Vicksburg and the army of General John Pemberton. At
                                                Champion's Hill, on May 16, advancing
                                            Union forces under McPherson and John McClernand defeated Pemberton in the
                                            most severe fighting of the Vicksburg campaign. Ibid.,

                                     From there we went on and shut Pemberton up at
                                        Vicksburg.2 On the 22[nd] of May we made a charge upon the
                                    fort but were defeated. Then we began digging up to the fort and at last captured it
                                    on the fourth of July 1863. Then we followed Johnston to Jackson where Thomas Graves
                                    was killed. A shell hit him in the head and came out low down on his left side.28
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            Some sixty years after the last shot was fired, the war had come to an end for the Crossroads
                    volunteers. The impact of the great struggle on the tiny Crossroads community, as on the entire
                    state of Indiana, had been profound. The volunteers left as boy-soldiers; the ones who survived came
                    back as men devoted to the blessings of peace. In the words of Augustus Sayford's captain,
                    "A grateful people shall cherish their memories and bless their names."
            
               
                  27 On May 17, 1863, General John Pemberton attempted to slow the Union
                        advance on Vicksburg by defending the Big Black River. The Confederates
                        were beaten handily, although Sam Johnson's estimates of the numbers of men and guns
                        captured are rather inflated. In fact, Union forces captured about 1,700 Confederates and 18
                        guns. Ibid., 876.

                    the contribution he has made to understanding a fundamental aspect of Indiana's past. This
                    is a magisterial work that will not likely be superseded in the foreseeable future.
            
               Hoosier Faiths is traditional in its conceptualization. After a chapter that deftly
                    sums up what little is known of Native American spirituality in Indiana, Rudolph focuses on
                    denominations–no less than forty-four have chapters to themselves by my count–
                    while adding other chapters on movements like Spiritualism and Holiness. In a few places, as in his
                    treatment of Orthodox Christians, Rudolph lumps several denominations together. Any group left out
                    of the table of contents is likely to show up in the chapter on "Some Major
                    Minorities." The book concludes with sections on science and religion and on the religious
                    aspects of the 
                        
                            Middletown
                        
                     studies carried out in 
                        Muncie
                     in the 1920s and 1930s and in the 1980s. This approach is certainly defensible, since
                    religion in Indiana has revolved around denominations.
            Within his denominational framework, Rudolph makes clear the significance of events in Indiana for
                    the rest of the 
                        United States
                    . There have been Hoosiers who were vital actors in American religious history, and they
                    receive their due here. They include William M. Branham, the 
                        Jeffersonville
                     boy who became one of the critical figures in the twentieth-century healing revival
                    movement; William Bell Riley, a 
                        Greene County
                     native who became a leader of modern fundamentalism; A. J. Tomlinson, a birthright 
                        Quaker
                     from 
                        Westfield
                     who founded one of the largest Pentecostal denominations; Seth C. Rees, another 
                        Westfield
                        Quaker
                     who was one of the founders of the Church of the Nazarene and the Pilgrim Holiness
                    Church; and John Francis Noll, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Fort 
                        Wayne
                     who made his weekly newspaper, Our Sunday Visitor, the most widely
                    circulated Catholic periodical in the country. Rudolph also illuminates how the Indiana branches of
                    certain denominations played critical roles in their larger bodies. For example, the longest single
                    chapter in the book is on Quakers. They were always a tiny percentage of the state's
                    population, but they exercised an influence out of proportion to their numbers. By 1900  Indiana had more Quakers than any other state in the
                    union–far more than 
                        Pennsylvania
                    . This in turn made Indiana one of the world's centers of Quakerism.
            Rudolph's greatest service is in offering a broad synthesis. For almost any denomination in
                    Indiana, there is a mass of annual conference minutes, reports of special meetings, biographies and
                    autobiographies, published sermons, local congregational histories, and periodicals; not to mention
                    unpublished records, sermons, and correspondence. For most denominations there are state or regional
                    histories and scholarly studies as well. Rudolph has done an extraordinary job of mastering this
                    mountain of material for all of the groups that he treats. Not only does he cover events in Indiana,
                    but he incorporates developments in the larger denominations to which these groups belonged. One
                    will learn much general American religious history in these pages.
            Still, Rudolph leaves some things undone. His denominational conceptualization, while certainly
                    appropriate, creates problems. There are some aspects of Indiana's religious history, as
                    Rudolph recognizes, that do not fit neatly within denominational boundaries. Thus the Ku Klux Klan
                    is in the "Major Minorities" chapter. Other subjects show up in unlikely places.
                    Rudolph's discussion of women's religious activities, central to the lives of so
                    many congregations, is in the chapter on holiness movements. Discussions of abolition are scattered
                    through treatments of Quakers, Presbyterians, Methodists, Wesleyans, and other groups. Significant
                    interdenominational efforts of the nineteenth century, like Sunday schools and Sabbatarianism, do
                    not find a place. For example, there is no entry in the index for the Woman's Christian
                    Temperance Union, certainly the biggest religiously based reform group ever to exist in Indiana.
            Rudolph's chronological scheme is also at times unclear. The treatments of some
                    denominations almost cease around 1900. For example, there is almost nothing on Methodists and
                    Disciples of Christ after 1920. Most of the twentieth-century history here is of new denominations,
                    like Pentecostals, or of denominations new to Indiana, like Southern Baptists or the Salvation Army
                    or Eastern Orthodox groups. Twentieth-century ecumenical activities like those of the Indiana
                    Council of Churches are not treated.
            Finally, the emphasis here is institutional. The accounts of denominations focus on leaders. While I
                    did not count, I would guess that over 90 percent of the individuals Rudolph mentions are clergy.
                    For the most part, Rudolph chooses not to enter into the scholarly dialogue among historians of
                    American religion about what was going on in the pews as opposed to in the pulpits. In some cases,
                    Rudolph does give us a sense of how religion reflected ethnicity, as in his treatment of ethnic
                    Catholics or nineteenth-century German groups. On the whole, however, we do not come away with  a clear sense of why some Hoosiers chose to be Methodists,
                    others Baptists, others Christians, and so on.
            To ask more of this work than it gives us is probably unfair. Instead, we should be grateful for what
                    Rudolph has accomplished in Hoosier Faiths. That accomplishment is impressive and
                    significant. What he leaves undone will set the agenda for a new generation of historians of
                    religion in Indiana, for his work will be their starting point.

               The Miami Indians of Indiana: A Persistent People, 1654-1994. By Stewart Rafert. (

                    : Indiana Historical Society, 1996. Pp. xxvii, 358. Maps, tables, illustrations,
                    appendices, notes, bibliography, index. $29.95.)
            The year 1996 marked the sesquicentennial of the forced removal of 323 Miami people from their
                    Indiana homeland to a reservation in the 
                        Kansas
                     Territory. This removal was followed by a second forced migration in 1867 from 
                        Kansas
                     to 
                        Oklahoma
                    , where the federally recognized and officially named Miami Tribe of 
                        Oklahoma
                     maintains its headquarters in the town of Miami today. But not all the Miami people
                    left Indiana in 1846. Following allocation of former tribal lands in the valleys of the 
                        Wabash
                     and Mississinewa rivers to village leaders and their families, 148 Miami Indians were
                    permitted to remain legally on these family reserves. By offering refuge to others who had evaded
                    removal and to still more who quietly returned from 
                        Kansas
                     and 
                        Oklahoma
                    , the Indiana Miami did not melt into the general population within a generation as had
                    been predicted but remained a viable and growing, though largely invisible, community. As far as the
                    federal government was concerned, the Miami tribal government was in the West after 1846, though the
                    treaty rights of the Indiana Miami continued to be acknowledged in principle if not always in
                    practice. Thus, before the end of the nineteenth century, two separate Miami tribes had emerged, one
                    in 
                        Oklahoma
                    , the other in Indiana, both enjoying federal recognition.
            The year 1997 will mark the centennial of a calamitous turning point in the history of the Indiana
                    Miami. On November 23, 1897, newly appointed Assistant Attorney General Willis 
                        Van
                     Devanter (later a justice of the 
                        United States
                     Supreme Court) rendered an administrative decision that terminated federal recognition
                    and assistance to the Indiana Miami on the grounds that their remaining (and drastically diminished)
                    allotted lands were individually owned and not tribal and that they were thus "citizens and
                         not Indians under federal law" (p. 173).
                    Reflecting prevailing federal policy under the Dawes (or General Allotment) Act of 1887, 
                        Van
                     Devanter's decision was in keeping with the stated objective that
                    "all reservations were to be divided, surplus land sold, and Indians made over into small
                    farmers…. tribal governments would cease to exist. Indians would be on their own to
                    compete in American society" (p. 173).
            Ironically, 
                        Van
                     Devanter knew the Miami people well. His father had accompanied those journeying to the 
                        Kansas
                     Territory in 1846 on their "trail of tears" and had later served as
                    an attorney for the Indiana Miami. His grandfather's farm bordered the Meshingomesia
                    reserve in the valley of the Mississinewa. Yet, like most of the general society at that time, he
                    apparently believed he was doing the Miami a favor by hastening the demise of tribal ties and
                    encouraging their complete acculturation into the larger American society. E pluribus
                        unum. Out of many, one.
            A century later, the tide of public opinion has turned and with it federal Indian policy.
                    Encouragement is given today to the concept of diversity in a pluralistic, multi-ethnic society.
                    Indian identity is now being celebrated, not hidden or submerged. As Chief Francis Shoemaker of the
                    Indiana Miami expressed it so well in July, 1985: "We've come out from under a
                    rock, and we're going to stay out" (p. 299).
            The story of the Indiana Miami (officially the Miami Nation of Indians in the State of Indiana) is
                    both timely and well told by Stewart Rafert in The Miami Indians of Indiana: A
                        Persistent People, 1654-1994. His argument is that the Indiana Miami deserve federal
                    recognition as a tribe. Indeed, much of his professional career has been spent working toward that
                    goal. The fact that the goal has not yet been reached, even in the present favorable climate of
                    public opinion and federal policy, lends particular poignancy to the telling of the story.
            Rafert's work with the Indiana Miami began with his University of 
                        Delaware
                     doctoral dissertation, "The Hidden Community: The Miami Indians of Indiana,
                    1846-1940" (1982). Rafert was the first recipient of a graduate fellowship for study in
                    midwestern history from the Indiana Historical Society. After receiving his doctorate, he became an
                    employee of the Indiana Miami, "a much different role than that of researcher of the
                    tribe" (p. 269). He "spent two years preparing the Indiana petition for federal
                    recognition…. which stretched into another seven years before the Bureau of Indian
                    Affairs rendered a decision" (p. 271).
            Far more than a rehash of his doctoral dissertation, Rafert's new book appropriately
                    considers the history of all the Miami people from the beginning of historical contact in 1654, when
                    they were living in 
                        Wisconsin
                    , to the removal of many from Indiana in 1846. For the period after removal,
                    Rafert's attention centers almost  exclusively on the
                    remaining Indiana Miami. He highlights not only the social, cultural, and subsistence changes
                    experienced by them, but also the persistence of older ways that have allowed them to avoid complete
                    acculturation and have kept them Indian.
            Though once a nation of an estimated 12,000 people, the Miami at the time of removal and separation
                    in 1846 numbered scarcely 500. In contrast, the 
                        Oklahoma
                     Miami today number more than 1,500, while the Indiana Miami number more than 5,000.
                    (Interestingly, Rafert rarely refers to either group by its official name, preferring instead to
                    call the one the "Western Miami" and the other the "Eastern
                    Miami.") Notwithstanding their numbers, the hope of the Indiana Miami for restoration of
                    federal recognition and attendant benefits remains just that–hope.
            Despite a campaign that began in 1979, the support of the Indiana congressional delegation, and all
                    of the research of Stewart Rafert, the effort to achieve federal recognition has been repeatedly
                    rebuffed. The culmination of all this frustration came on June 9, 1992, when the Bureau of Indian
                    Affairs made its final finding against recognition of the Indiana Miami "based on alleged
                    insufficient evidence of a distinct contemporary tribal community and lack of tribal political
                    process since the early 1940s" (p. 288). According to Rafert, however, the real stumbling
                    blocks were: (1) the large size of the Indiana Miami population (as much as ten times the size of
                    some tribes that have succeeded in gaining recent recognition) and consequent budgetary
                    considerations for federal services; (2) the fact that the 
                        Oklahoma
                     Miami were already recognized; (3) the opposition of "reservation tribes
                    [that] did not want competition for federal dollars from a new tribe that they regarded as highly
                    acculturated"; and (4) "the issue of casino gambling free of state
                    regulation" (pp. 290-92).
            In September, 1992, the Indiana Miami, led by Chief Ray White, marched from their tribal headquarters
                    in Peru to 
                        South Bend
                    , where they filed a lawsuit against the Interior Department to compel a restoration of
                    federal recognition. That action, too, ended in frustration with a judicial ruling "that
                    the tribe had waited too long to sue [1897-1992] and was blocked by the statute of
                    limitations" (p. 293).
            While their recent past has left some painful memories, the Miami Indians of Indiana have achieved a
                    revitalization that few would have dreamed possible at the beginning of this century. With the help
                    of Stewart Rafert and the Indiana Historical Society, they will celebrate their Miami-ness far into
                    the future.

            Readers of God's Government Begun are not likely to be left with the
                    feeling that Thomas D. Hamm, Earlham College's distinguished church historian, has engaged
                    them in a threshing of old straw. The story he tells of the Society for Universal Inquiry and Reform
                    has never been told before; surprisingly, few of even the most detailed accounts of antebellum
                    reform take note of it. Yet, as this book demonstrates, the organization and its personnel deserve
                    the intensive research Hamm devoted to them.
            Founded in 1842 by a small, inspired group of radical reformers, the society aimed to form ideal
                    communities that would provide models for the reconstitution of an America that from their point of
                    view had gone awry. By the 1830s misgivings about the course of American development had produced an
                    array of reform movements designed to remove the ills and evils that beset society and thereby
                    promote human welfare and, not incidentally, also render the nation more pleasing in the sight of
                    God. Among the most dedicated of these reformers were the founders of the Society for Universal
                    Inquiry and Reform.
            The society proceeded to establish eight communities designed to give form and force to their
                    renovating principles. Four of these were in Indiana: Union Home in 
                        Randolph County
                    , West Grove or Fraternal Home in 
                        Jay County
                    , Kristeen in 
                        Marshall County
                    , and Grand 
                        Prairie
                     in 
                        Warren County
                    . Although all had disappeared by the end of 1846, their short life does not mean that
                    they and the earnest men and women who created them left nothing of value to posterity and are
                    deserving of their long obscurity.
            Their record, brief though it is, reminds us that not all Americans welcomed the highly competitive,
                    atomistic economy and society that characterized Jacksonian America and to some extent persists
                    today. The founders of the society, it is instructive to note, were not foreign-born revolutionaries
                    nor adherents to alien ideologies. Their family roots as well as their ideas were at least as old as
                    the republic.
            Some of the strongest critics of the emergent American culture always were to be found among Quakers
                    and by the 1830s and 1840s among the Hicksite Friends. Not surprisingly, Friends, together with some
                    New 
                        England
                     evangelicals, provided the society with its leaders and members and most of its energy
                    and principles. The founders were extreme indeed and indiscriminate in their questioning of
                    prevailing values and practices. They gave respectful heed to most of the reforms, great and small,
                    that in those years were entertained by the speculative.
            
            The society's founders were closely associated with the most radical fringes of
                    abolitionism–not even William Lloyd Garrison outdid them in antislavery zeal. As
                    nonresistants, they renounced coercive earthly government in all its manifestations, relying instead
                    on their understanding of the Government of God. Retreating from the emergent competitive capitalism
                    of their day, they proposed an economy based on agricultural cooperation.
            Obviously, their aims in most respects ran counter to the forces that shaped the modern world, and
                    thus the society's efforts were doomed. Although their notions of possibility were
                    different from those of contemporary Americans, and although their solutions sometimes seem strange,
                    the record of their lives nevertheless offers fresh perspective on the present as well as on the
                    past and is therefore fully worthy of attention.

            As the Socialist Party of America's founder, organizational leader, perennial presidential
                    candidate, and principal spokesperson, Eugene V. Debs was American socialism's most public
                    face and gifted voice in the early twentieth century. Born and raised in 
                        Terre Haute
                    , Debs came of age as the conflict between labor and capital was intensifying and vast
                    concentrations of economic power were calling into question the democratic promise of the American
                    experiment. He served in the local Democratic party and his town's lodge of the Brotherhood
                    of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen as a young man, counseling the harmony of labor and capital. Yet
                    by the early 1890s he had broken with the narrow, conservative craft union whose journal he edited
                    and formed an industrially organized, rival federation of railroad workers known as the American
                    Railway Union (ARU). In 1894, he threw his support behind the boycott of Pullman cars in the most
                    celebrated sympathy strike of the nineteenth century. Debs and his allies lost–the
                    American Federation of Labor did not join the boycott, the ARU was destroyed, Pullman workers went
                    down to painful defeat, and Debs landed in jail for violating a federal court injunction protecting
                    the company. By the end of the century, Debs had emerged as the leading figure in the growing
                    American socialist movement.
            
               Gentle Rebel is a single-volume compilation of Debs's correspondence. It
                    is a condensation of the impressive three-volume Letters
                    
                    of Eugene V. Debs, published in 1990 by the University of 
                        Illinois
                     Press, and the larger microfilmed Papers of Eugene V. Debs,
                    1834-1945, which appeared in 1983. Designed to reach a more general audience than these larger
                    collections, the book omits significant annotation and includes a straightforward biographical
                    sketch (a shortened version of the introduction to the first volume of the Letters). Although the letters reprinted here span Debs's life, the nineteenth
                    century is given short shrift, while the decade and a half after 1910 receive the greatest
                    attention. Brief background statements provide minimal context for each letter. Debs and his
                    correspondents are allowed, to a large extent, to speak for themselves.
            The letters chosen here vividly bring to life important aspects of Debs's beliefs and
                    experiences. His speaking tours took him to hundreds of cities, where he mesmerized thousands of
                    crowds. Letter after letter reveals the physical toll exacted by such a schedule. "I am
                    willing to be killed for the cause but I don't want to die a fool's
                    death," an exhausted Debs confessed with annoyance in 1915 after an open buggy ride through
                    deep 
                        Idaho
                     snow that left him "half frozen, chilled to the marrow," his throat
                    raw and body aching. "Today I am unfit for anything…. Must I have such a damned
                    killing dose as [this] administered to me on every trip" (p. 96)? Debs nonetheless found
                    time to express his great love for literature and his appreciation of particular writers; among his
                    valued friends he included Upton Sinclair, Sinclair Lewis, and Carl Sandburg. Glimpses of the
                    private Debs reveal his reliance upon and love for his brother (who for years served as his
                    secretary), his affection for Mabel Curry, and the tremendous passion behind Debs's
                    beliefs.
            Debs's correspondence with his friends, colleagues, opponents, and well-wishers also
                    illuminates his views on a vast range of political, social, moral, and intellectual issues.
                    Selections explore his staunch opposition to the intense factionalism that continually wracked the
                    Socialist party, his sharp differences with communists, his internationalism and principled
                    opposition to World War I, his hostility to prohibitionists, and his opposition to capital
                    punishment and restrictions on political expression in both the 
                        United States
                     and the 
                        Soviet Union
                    . "If we … commit murder in the cause of justice, as the capitalists
                    do, we are not a damned bit better than they whose system we condemn as criminal and whose ethics we
                    renounce as barbarous and inhuman" (p. 210), he noted in reference to the Bolsheviks in
                    1922.
            What comes across least effectively, curiously, are the content and contours of Debs's
                    vision of socialism. Debs appears more the reformer–albeit with a distinct radical
                    vocabulary–than the revolutionary. If Debs "popularized ideas and ideals that
                    were denounced as radical, even un-American, early in the twentieth century," the editor
                    concludes, many of them "later became orthodox  and are
                    now viewed as traditional" (p. xxxviii). Yes, prohibition was repealed, but many of the
                    forces that Debs opposed survived and flourished. Capital punishment, heightened corporate power,
                    the dominance of the Democrats and Republicans, and persistent militarism –to name just a
                    few of the targets of Debs's ire–continue to loom large on the political
                    landscape. Debs's career was indeed "an honorable chapter in the history of
                    American dissent" (p. xxxviii), but it was also much more. The significance of
                    Debs's life lies less in the reforms he advocated and that American society eventually
                    adopted than in the sheer power of his indictment of American capitalism and his vision of a
                    socialist alternative, both of which were ultimately silenced.

               Ernie Pyle in the American Southwest. By Richard Melzer. (Santa Fe, N.M.:
                    Sunstone Press, 1996. Pp. 176. Illustrations, notes, bibliography, index. Paperbound,
                    $18.95.)
            Ernie Pyle's image is fixed in the American imagination. His daily travel column, describing
                    people and places in an intimate and anecdotal style, brought pleasure to thousands of people in the
                    late 1930s. The friendly persona he created in that column, which set new standards for human
                    interest reporting, comforted Americans struggling through the Great Depression. Even more
                    remembered is his work in World War II when as the friend and reporter of the ordinary soldier he
                    became the most loved correspondent of the war. His unparalleled reputation among American
                    G.I.'s accords him a special place in the annals of journalism. Until he died a
                    soldier's death, the victim of sniper machine gun fire on the Pacific island Ie Shima near
                    Okinawa, he was, as Richard Melzer notes, the "infantry's Homer" and the
                    "G.I.'s Boswell" (p. 78). People of Indiana have long taken pride in the
                    fact that Pyle was one of their own, and there was much in his writings to justify that feeling.
                    Nevertheless, while Dana, Indiana, was Pyle's early home, Albuquerque, 
                        New Mexico
                    , became his adopted home later in life.
            Much of the last ten years of Pyle's life had a southwestern orientation. He and his wife
                    Jerry became attracted to the region after a trip there in 1935. In his own words, affection for the
                    Southwest was "like being in love with a woman…. You just love her because you
                    love her and you can't help yourself (p. 35). Melzer's purpose in writing this
                    volume was to provide a fuller description of Pyle's association with the Southwest,
                    especially 
                        New Mexico
                    .
            
            Melzer develops that fuller description in a number of ways. He explores the reasons for
                    Pyle's settling in Albuquerque and the dimensions of his life there. The friendships he
                    made there, particularly that with Edward H. Shaffer, the editor of the Albuquerque Tribune, form an interesting subtheme of the book. Beyond that Melzer explores the impact
                    that 
                        New Mexico
                     had on Pyle and the ways in which he influenced 
                        New Mexico
                     and its citizens. These explorations represent the most original parts of the book, and
                    Melzer presents them in the context of Pyle's travels as a roving reporter and war
                    correspondent. Throughout the book, the author also underscores the interaction that existed between
                    Pyle's professional and private life.
            Melzer provides an interesting portrayal of Pyle's association with the Southwest and proves
                    that 
                        New Mexico
                     as well as Indiana is justified in celebrating his memory. The book merits attention
                    for this reason and because Melzer makes an interesting probe into Pyle's personal life. He
                    also accords Pyle's wife Jerry a prominent place in the book and treats her sad struggle
                    with mental depression and alcoholism in a sensitive and informed manner. Although previously
                    covered, Pyle's own mood swings and restlessness do not receive a similar in-depth
                    treatment. For a slim volume, however, this one is rich in intimate detail and reflects
                    Melzer's appreciated exploitation of personal paper collections and oral histories. He
                    achieved his goal in writing the book, but some readers will wish the book were more expansive.

                        Northwest, 1787-1861. By Nicole Etcheson. (

            The three Ohio River states of 
                        Ohio
                    , Indiana, and 
                        Illinois
                     were noted for their divided loyalties during the seventy years before the Civil War.
                    Beginning with the arrival of New Englanders in 
                        Ohio
                    's Western Reserve and Virginians and Kentuckians in southwestern 
                        Ohio
                     in the 1790s, the three states remained deeply divided until the Civil War brought a
                    measure of unity in defense of the Union. Nicole Etcheson has produced a brief and succinct
                    monograph in an effort to explain this phenomenon and in the process has helped show why these
                    residents of the Old Northwest were so often at odds with one another.
            
            Etcheson keeps her focus on the upland southerners but cannot avoid an equal emphasis on those from
                    the Northeast who moved into the regions around the Great Lakes. Building on the work of other
                    historians who have attempted to explain the southern identification with democracy and independence
                    and the distaste for Yankee cultural imperialism, she adds little to earlier, more extensive
                    interpretations. She does, however, effectively bring together the issues that divided and united
                    residents and shows how most eventually came to view themselves as westerners.
            Etcheson, who is an assistant professor at the University of 
                        Texas
                    , El Paso, originally produced this study as a doctoral dissertation at Indiana
                    University. She has done an impressive and exhaustive job of research in primary materials,
                    including letters, editorials, petitions, speeches, diaries, and memoirs. She pieces together these
                    highly subjective accounts into an objective explanation of midwesterners' views. She notes
                    how each of the three territories fought for statehood as a kind of second war for independence,
                    their citizens overcoming the often tyrannical executive authority of territorial governors. Not
                    only was Arthur St. Clair viewed as an outsider by Ohioans, but even William Henry Harrison was seen
                    by many in southern Indiana as representing wealth and speculator influence at the expense of small
                    struggling farmers. Such governors sometimes were viewed as less manly than the honest
                    farmer/mechanic.
            Various economic and social issues made upland southerners suspicious of northeasterners, issues that
                    included internal improvements, land policy, public education, immigration, and temperance. Yet it
                    was slavery and the threatened presence of free blacks that most effectively united these settlers.
                    All who sought racial equality were seen as a threat to the position of whites. Rejecting the
                    extremes of abolitionism and secession, they sought a compromise stance, most frequently embodied in
                    the concept of popular sovereignty. The sectional crisis of the 1850s nonetheless challenged their
                    newborn status as midwesterners and brought a resurgence of sympathy for the South. Yet their hatred
                    of the wealthy planter aristocracy, who they believed had originally driven them from their southern
                    homes, meant that to most Abraham Lincoln had more appeal than Stephen A. Douglas. Few were willing
                    to surrender to southern demands in 1861, and they emerged from the war far more western than
                    southern, albeit with a persistent hint of distrust of New Englanders.

            To Latter-Day Saints of the 1840s, and to chroniclers of their experience ever since, Nauvoo, 
                        Illinois
                    , has represented many things. For those who lived in that Mississippi
                    River town during its Mormon heyday, it was a piece of Zion, a model of the Kingdom of
                    God foreseen by the prophet Joseph Smith. Historians, with their bent toward critical analysis, have
                    explicated the meaning of the place in more incisive terms. Ronald K. Esplin, for example,
                    identifies Nauvoo as "the city of Joseph," in which the Mormon
                    leader "fulfilled his religious mission" (p. 20). The author of the standard work
                    on the village, Robert Bruce Flanders, sees it as a "volatile mixture of elements"
                    that sparked "escalating violence within and without" (p. 231). And to the editors
                    of the present volume Nauvoo "is as much a state of mind as it is a physical
                    place." It embodies "a seedbed" where Mormonism took root and flowered,
                    "a refiner's fire" in which the early Saints not only faced opposition
                    but also "demonstrated their spiritual superiority" (p. 1).
            All these images find a place in this masterful collection. Here, in one volume, are fourteen of the
                    most significant historical studies of Mormon Nauvoo to appear in recent decades. Through careful
                    selection and skillful organization Roger D. Launius and John E. Hall was expose the readers to
                    articles that exhibit the multiple dimensions of the debate among students of Mormonism
                    "over the nature and purpose of historical inquiry" (p. 30). Though the essays are
                    largely representative of the "new Mormon history," with its stress on secular
                    scholarship and rationality, they remain sensitive to the assumptions of faith which shaped earlier
                    Mormon historiography. Taken together they also provide a highly informative guide to life in 1840s
                    Nauvoo.
            The result is a comprehensive picture of the Mormon "Kingdom on the 
                        Mississippi
                    ." Virtually every facet of the Nauvoo experience receives treatment: the
                    city's unique charter and the "state within a state" it created (p. 39);
                    the flexing of the Saints' military muscles through the Nauvoo Legion; the role of Joseph
                    Smith as prophet, entrepreneur, and politician; the divisive presence of the Mormon press and of
                    plural marriage; even the nature of recreation, occupation, and education in the town.
            While all of the entries are carefully researched and documented, several deserve special attention.
                    Kenneth W. Godfrey insightfully employs the methodology of Ferdinand Braudel in a cogent examination
                    of "the structures of everyday life" (p. 72) in Nauvoo, and Kathryn M. Daynes
                    delivers a persuasive argument  that Mormon polygamy emerged
                    there due to social anxieties produced by "severe environmental changes" (p. 131)
                    and to the Saints' unwavering loyalty to Joseph Smith. Equally valuable is the study,
                    contributed by Valeen Tippetts Avery and Linda King Newell, of the bitter conflict between Brigham
                    Young and Emma Smith and its impact on the Mormons' last days on the 
                        Mississippi
                    . Likewise, editor Launius's account of the lessons Joseph Smith III learned in
                    Nauvoo, and later applied in launching the Reorganized Church, is a penetrating analysis of
                    leadership.
            Particularly helpful as well are forays into the nature and meaning of the prophet's vision
                    of a political kingdom of God by two of Mormonism's leading historians. Klaus J. Hansen
                    reminds us that "in history beliefs are as important as facts" (p. 63) and
                    proceeds to demonstrate how the Mormon belief structure led to an inevitable, and sometimes
                    hazardous, intertwining of politics and religion. Flanders agrees, artfully describing a
                    "politics of utopia" that ran amok because the prophet "was
                    simultaneously in the temple, … in the seat of government, in the land office, and on the
                    stump" (pp. 155-56). Another renowned Mormon scholar, though, is not as convincing. In his
                    investigation of whether there was "much that was religious in Nauvoo," Marvin S.
                    Hill contends that everything "of social or political nature" in the town was
                    "essentially religious" (pp. 120-21). Hill unfortunately applies a rather narrow
                    definition of religion, however, seeing it only as a quest for security and social
                    control–a startlingly negative assessment of religion's role in society and one
                    inadequately supported.

                    eminently usable bibliographical essay. In short, it is a laudable contribution to our understanding
                    of Mormon Nauvoo.

               Farm and Factory: Workers in the Midwest, 1880-1990. By Daniel Nelson. (
                        Bloomington
                    : Indiana University Press, 1995. Pp. ix, 258. Tables, notes, index. $29.95.)
            Daniel Nelson's Farm and Factory provides a much-needed synthesis of
                    scholarship on the history of work and working people in the Midwest. Moreover, Nelson not only
                    synthesizes this scholarship but also uses it to advance several arguments about the distinctive
                    character of the Midwest. A volume in the Midwestern History and Culture series, edited by James H.
                    Madison and  Thomas J. Schlereth, this book should inform
                    historians of work, working people, and the Midwest for years to come and thus is a welcome
                    contribution. At the same time, it leaves the reader wanting a bit more.
            Nelson is very clear about his geographical and topical focus. He wishes to explore work broadly
                    defined, including–as his title indicates–labor in agriculture and industry;
                    he also devotes significant attention to white-collar workers. Though he says that he
                    "arbitrarily defined the Midwest as the states of 
                        Ohio
                    , Indiana, 
                  Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin,
                            Minnesota
               , and 
                        Iowa
                    " (p. vii), this sensible definition will seem arbitrary to very few readers.
                    Most important, Nelson presents a convincing thesis: "the essential feature of the
                    region's labor history that set it apart from other American regions was the sustained,
                    simultaneous growth of agriculture and industry, a feature that produced notable patterns of
                    individual mobility and that left a distinctive and inescapable heritage" (p. vii).
            The rapid, simultaneous growth of agriculture and industry, Nelson argues, created two work forces:
                    one primarily native and agrarian, the other primarily urban and immigrant. The shift of labor from
                    farm to factory, a feature of the economic and social history of other regions, did not occur in the
                    Midwest until after World War II. A combination of resources, location, and opportunity made the
                    region a center of innovative practices in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
                    Another distinctive regional feature was the strength of workers'
                    "voice." Through unions, politics, and farmers' groups, working people
                    played an unusually large role in the region's economic history. Together, these factors
                    created in the Midwest a unique pattern of work and employment that produced prosperity and
                    stability. By the post-World War II years, however, the innovative methods of scientific agriculture
                    and mass production, upon which the region's prosperity was built, had ceased to be new,
                    and no comparable innovations succeeded them; the relatively underdeveloped service sector failed to
                    provide sufficient alternative economic opportunities to compensate. The collapse of industry and
                    agriculture in the region from the 1960s on represented both a consequence of this pattern and an
                    end of it. By the 1980s the region was suffering its most severe crisis since the Great Depression,
                    and there were visible only the barest outlines of a new, emerging structure of work and
                    opportunity.
            Clearly a brief review cannot do justice to an interpretation of such complexity. Nelson builds his
                    arguments on an impressively broad reading of the literature on midwestern history; historians will
                    find his notes a rich resource. The reliance on secondary sources means that those who have studied
                    the history of workers  or agriculture in the Midwest will find
                    much that is familiar, though they often will see familiar stories integrated into new patterns.
                    Suggestions for further research abound, as, for example, in the treatment of company unions as more
                    varied, and at times more influential and reflective of the worker's voice, than
                    conventional explanations allow.
            Of necessity, a work of this type must omit much. Perhaps of necessity, the texture and drama of the
                    lives of working people are largely invisible here. Aside from a handful of national figures, few
                    individual lives appear (and those only briefly). While Nelson effectively integrates the findings
                    of the past generation of labor and social historians, treating briefly such topics as ethnic
                    communities and workplace culture, there is little discussion of the efforts of working people to
                    create meaningful lives. Even events like the region's major strikes come across as
                    surprisingly colorless. Nor is the devastation brought by the past generation's economic
                    changes really evident. Few readers new to the history of work and working people will sense the
                    drama and excitement of the field.
            Less of necessity than by choice, Nelson does not address some broader questions. The book tells the
                    story of a region whose people played the game properly. Hard-working and innovative, the
                    generations described in this book created a regional economy of incredible productivity: midwestern
                    fields and factories were the envy of the world, bringing prosperity to millions and playing a
                    crucial role in the nation's economic development. Yet just a generation or so after this
                    system had reached maturity, it fell apart. While Nelson offers some interesting tentative thoughts
                    about the region's future prospects, he provides little comment on what one is to make of
                    the midwestern experience. From industrial heartland to rust belt in a generation–how
                    could such a seemingly solid economic base turn out to have been so fragile? What does this
                    region's experience offer to those who want to build stable, sustainable economies? Indeed,
                    what is one to make of an economic system that devastates regions in this way? Given
                    Nelson's deep understanding of economics, work, and workers, one wishes he had chosen to
                    offer the reader his thoughts on these matters.
            In fairness, though, in a book of this type the author is not obligated to address such questions.
                        Farm and Factory fulfills its purpose admirably: it provides an insightful,
                    wide-ranging look at work and workers in the Midwest. It will certainly be a basic resource on
                    regional history for years to come, as well as a book that adds to our broader understanding of the
                    nation's labor and economic history.

               Preserving the Family Farm: Women, Community, and the Foundations of Agribusiness in
                        the Midwest, 1900-1940. By Mary Neth. (

                    : Johns Hopkins University Press, 1995. Pp. xiii, 347. Illustrations, maps, notes,
                    bibliographical note, index. $39.95.)
            Mary Neth's Preserving the Family Farm, an eloquently written and
                    extensively researched study of community and family farm survival strategies from 1900 to 1940,
                    places gender at the center of the historical analysis. Neth includes data from 
                  Illinois, Missouri,
                            Kansas, Nebraska
               , and South Dakota, but her research deals primarily with dairy
                    farming in 
                        Wisconsin
                     and, to a lesser degree, corn and livestock farming in 
                        Iowa
                     and wheat farming in 
                        North Dakota
                    . Although Neth offers some insightful comparisons based on differences in commodity
                    specializations and geography, many of her regional generalizations rest heavily on evidence from 
                        Wisconsin
                    , particularly on the diaries of Anna Pratt Erickson. On balance, however,
                    Neth's ambitious book succeeds in placing individual and local experiences within the
                    context of the larger region and in juxtaposition to government policies.
            Despite technological changes and government policies that fostered farm consolidation and increased
                    production, Neth argues, the years between 1900 and 1940 constituted a period of flux in the rural
                    Midwest rather than one of steady change from traditional to modern practices. Farm families
                    "adopted, adapted, and resisted" new technologies and methods while continuing to
                    rely on traditional patterns of family and neighborhood mutuality (p. 121). Since men held property
                    and were the heads of families, women "had the most to gain within the family by
                    emphasizing the mutuality of family labor and the farm enterprise" (p. 18). After detailing
                    the integration of men's and women's gender-specific tasks in the productive work
                    of family farms, Neth demonstrates how mutuality also characterized neighborhood and community
                    patterns of social and economic sharing and reciprocity. Through the 1930s exchanges of products and
                    labor in gendered networks within rural neighborhoods were essential for the survival of small
                    family farms; families outside neighborhood networks had the most trouble staying in farming.
                    Exclusion, Neth posits, was the flip side of cooperation, and "length of residence,
                    economic or tenure status, ethnicity, religion, race often created barriers that farm people did not
                    attempt to cross" (p. 71). Her balanced handling of these variables suggests, however, that
                    barriers could be overcome and did not always preclude formation of diverse coalitions of rural
                    people.
            Neth joins several scholars in sharply criticizing 
                        United States
                     Department of Agriculture policies and agricultural and home economics extension
                    programs that "placed family and community  needs into
                    a separate ‘women's sphere,’ and then devalued them by subordinating
                    social and family concerns to economic production– the ‘business’
                    of farming" (p. 5). Professionals concerned with social and economic problems of rural
                    families lacked status in government agencies and academic institutions that placed higher value on
                    the scientific and commercial aspects of agriculture. Insecure themselves, they did little to
                    counter the dominant agribusiness orientation of policymakers and often joined in denigrating
                    farmers who did not adopt progressive methods as "backward" and farm women who
                    labored both on the farm and in the home as "drudges." Neth argues that women had
                    the most to lose in the eventual triumph of agribusiness in the post–World War II period.
                    Changes in marketing and agricultural production, she explains, eliminated women's economic
                    base on family farms and "they became more like their urban counterparts, contributing
                    wages and unpaid household labor to the family economy" (p. 241-42). By terminating her
                    study in 1940, Neth illuminates the persistence of traditional survival strategies in the midst of
                    change but leaves the reader longing for similarly deft analysis of the crucial war years.
                    Nonetheless, this is an ambitious and important study that provides a valuable analytical framework
                    and raises countless questions for more detailed examinations of twentieth-century rural change in
                    individual midwestern states.

            Philip A. Hart served three terms as 
                        United States
                     senator from 
                        Michigan
                     from 1958 to 1976. A liberal Democrat, he served during the most important period of
                    legislative social reform after World War II, a period that also was one of social and political
                    upheaval. Hart was, in addition, one of the most influential legislators, earning the respect and
                    then admiration of both constituents and colleagues for his intellect, humility, compassion, quiet
                    congeniality, and formidable tenacity. Senator Edward Kennedy said, "he was like a brother
                    to me." Before his death from cancer during his last year in office, his colleagues voted
                    to name the new Senate office building for him.
            Hart was a graduate of 
                        Georgetown
                     University and the University of 
                        Michigan
                     Law School and a World War II veteran (he was wounded by shrapnel on 
                        Utah
                     beach). He fell in love with and married Janey Briggs (daughter of the owner of the 
                        Detroit
                     Lions football  team), and they ultimately had
                    eight children. Hart entered politics at the local level after discovering that practicing law was
                    not fulfilling. After serving as 
                        United States
                     attorney and before being elected lieutenant governor of 
                        Michigan
                    , he was adviser to and protege of G. Mennen Williams, governor of that state. In the 
                        United States
                     Senate, his major post was chairmanship of the Antitrust and Monopoly Subcommittee of
                    the Senate Judiciary Committee. He also was responsible for passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965
                    and the establishment of the Sleeping Bear Dunes national lakeshore.
            A thoughtful individual who experienced bouts of depression, he could see both sides of an issue with
                    ease. His foremost concern was that the power centers of America, the corporations and government,
                    had lost contact with the average American and were thus thwarting democracy. He felt that if the
                    federal government acted properly on behalf of the consumer, racial minorities, and the poor, it
                    could restore the balance and at the same time fend off communism abroad. In the event, of course,
                    this was a huge challenge that in addition to social reform resulted in racial turmoil and the
                    failure in 
                        Vietnam
                    .
            Michael O'Brien's biography accomplishes in full what it sets out to do. Drawing on
                    the Hart papers, published sources, and interviews, his account, although brief, is detailed, well
                    organized, and engaging. The author allows his subject's life to unfold and provides a
                    balanced interpretation of it in a way that makes his book indispensable reading for anyone who
                    would understand 
                        Michigan
                     and midwestern politics along with the origins, strengths, and weaknesses of federal
                    policy during the Kennedy-Johnson-Nixon-Ford years.

               Henry Clay and the American System. By Maurice G. Baxter. (
                        Lexington
                    : University Press of 
                        Kentucky
                    , 1995. Pp. [viii], 261. Illustrations, notes, index. $34.95.)
            Maurice G. Baxter has performed a valuable service to American historians by compiling this brief
                    history of Henry Clay's promotion of his "American System" for national
                    economic development. Although 
                        Clay
                    's pet project has earned due attention from historians of the nineteenth
                    century, a monograph focused specifically on the issue has been long overdue.
            Naturally, historians have devoted enormous attention to 
                        Clay
                    's career and political philosophy. The 
                        Kentucky
                     statesman has been the subject of a number of excellent biographies as well as a
                    leading character in other histories of the period. Perhaps the 
                    "Great Compromiser's" contributions in resolving various sectional
                    disputes (in 1820, 1833, and 1850) have received the greatest attention, but his Whiggish
                    prescription for national economic progress has not been shortchanged.
            Despite this previous work, Baxter presents new information about 
                        Clay
                    's economic agenda and in the process manages to offer new insights about 
                        Clay
                     the politician and the man. Of course, there are numerous details about how 
                        Clay
                     formulated and promoted his program for economic expansion. Serious readers will
                    probably enjoy yet another rendition of the debates over tariff policy and internal improvements
                    and, not least, another account of the Bank War. 
                        Clay
                    's efforts during the Nullification Crisis, his battle with John Tyler, and his
                    unsuccessful presidential campaigns are also analyzed.
            Often, a familiar story well told brings renewed satisfaction. Yet Baxter's version of 
                        Clay
                    's record is not at all dated. He presents, for example, an updated view of the
                    Panic of 1837. Baxter is especially adept at showing the evolution of 
                        Clay
                    's positions; oftentimes 
                        Clay
                    's personal experiences in raising hemp or traveling over bumpy roads provided
                    convincing justification for his favored proposals.
            
               
                        Clay
                     partisans may not find their hero celebrated as much as expected. Indeed, Baxter can be
                    rather hard on the famous Kentuckian, albeit not because of 
                        Clay
                    's position on black bondage or sectional politics. The portrait presented is
                    not that of a careful, calculating politician. 
                        Clay
                     is criticized for lacking "practical statesmanship" (p. 107) during
                    the Bank War with Andrew Jackson and likewise scored for his dictatorial stance opposite Tyler
                    (although Baxter also admits that Tyler too was out of touch). At times Baxter verges on presenting 
                        Clay
                     as a committed ideologue and a somewhat naive one at that!
            
               
                        Clay
                    's economic nationalism certainly warrants the closer look Baxter provides.
                    While little revolutionary material may be revealed, the author successfully refines our view of 
                        Clay
                    's program and his participation in Jacksonian-era political disputes.
                    Undoubtedly a labor of love, this well-researched and well-argued volume deserves a careful reading.

               Glorying in Tribulation: The Lifework of Sojourner Truth. By Erlene Stetson and
                    Linda David. (East Lansing: 
                        Michigan
                     State University Press, 1994. Pp. [xii], 242. Illustrations, notes, appendices,
                    bibliography, index. $28.95.)
            One of the most exciting recent developments in black history and women's studies is the
                    scholarly interest in Sojourner Truth. It is about time that a historiography developed on this
                    fascinating,  unlettered nineteenth-century black activist,
                    whose words and deeds have been embraced by present-day Americans but unscrutinized for accuracy or
                    authenticity. In 1993, Carleton Mabee published the first scholarly biography of Truth (Sojourner Truth: Slave, Prophet, Legend), and I published the first annotated version of
                    Truth's slave narrative with a modern, contextual introduction (The Narrative
                        of Sojourner Truth). Erlene Stetson and Linda David's Glorying in
                        Tribulation is the third effort to offer a scholarly treatment of Truth. It has been
                    followed this year by Nell I. Painter's biography (Sojourner Truth: A Life, A
                        Symbol). My own Truth biography will appear at some future date.
            Readers might wonder about duplication as well as overlap. Mabee's dry, detailed biography
                    covered important events in Truth's life and took a fact versus fiction approach. It was
                    meant to dispel "myths" about Truth canonized by modern feminists. Stetson and
                    David's construction of Truth illustrates the range of interpretation that her life
                    invites. Glorying in Tribulation is refreshing and interesting because the authors
                    write with sensitivity, offer some critical analysis, and place Truth in a context of
                    women's activism.
            "Sojourner" is loosely constructed by the authors as a black female torchbearer of
                    struggle. Biographically, the authors cover the same ground as Mabee with less thoroughness and no
                    new evidence. Their most challenging analysis is their defense of the authenticity of Frances
                    Gage's "Ain't I A Woman" speech, which Mabee relegates to
                    "folklore" and Nell Painter and I at least call into question. The authors have a
                    good chapter on Truth's contributions to black struggle during and following the Civil War
                    yet end with an uncohesive chapter on the suffrage issue. Furthermore, the authors'
                    innovative perspective in assessing Truth's womanist politics is greatly weakened by a
                    failure to discuss the famous Indiana confrontation over her sexuality and to analyze the politics
                    of the black female body.
            The lack of a preface, introduction, and epilogue indicates not only structural formlessness but
                    confusion as to the authors' objectives. Nevertheless, Glorying in
                    Tribulation offers an original contribution to the scholarship on Sojourner Truth.

            Larry M. Logue's To 
                            Appomattox
                         and Beyond is another book in Ivan R. Dee's exemplary American Way
                    Series, which in a few  years has distinguished itself for its
                    short, readable, up-to-date syntheses of monographic literature. Like its companion, J. Matthew
                    Gallman's The North Fights the Civil War (1994), To 
                            Appomattox
                         and Beyond also contributes its own arguments to the literature it
                    synthesizes. Furthermore, it is one of the few books that puts together soldiers'
                    experiences during the war with veterans' experiences afterward.
            In his treatment of the war itself, Logue is most influenced by Gerald Linderman's Embattled Courage (1987), although there are a number of references to my own
                    work. Logue, however, distinguishes more between Union and Confederate soldiers'
                    experiences than has been customary in the literature.
            Logue is more careful to put the soldier's experience of war into the context of a changing
                    society than are many of the studies he synthesizes. He sees self-control, inculcated by a
                    modernizing northern society, as the essential cultural value of many northern soldiers. To this he
                    contrasts a southern ethos in which honor and feeling play a greater role. His characterization of
                    the importance of self-control among northerners is convincing, but self-control may have been
                    equally important among Confederate soldiers.
            Logue's portrayal of the postwar years accents the differences between North and South even
                    more. He argues that Confederate veterans, through organizations like the Ku Klux Klan and the
                    Democratic party, had more influence on the South than the Union veterans had on the country as a
                    whole. He sees the latter group's influence on politics as limited primarily to the issue
                    of pensions. While this might have been the case, it seems that Logue's argument might also
                    reflect the state of the literature on the postwar period more than reality. Oddly, the
                    "Lost Cause" has been far more studied than what might be called the "Won
                    Cause." For a generation the Republican party called on veterans to vote as they shot, and
                    it is not clear in what ways veterans as citizens as compared to a special
                    interest group might have felt slighted by the political process.
            Along with his mastery of the secondary literature, Logue's raising of issues for debate is
                    his great strength. Scholars studying Civil War soldiers and veterans have been reluctant so far to
                    admit the disagreements among them, let alone address those disagreements. Logue's splendid
                    book should go a long way to reinvigorate the field.

               Local People: The Struggle for Civil Rights in 
                            Mississippi
                        . By John Dittmer. (

                    : University of 
                        Illinois
                     Press, 1994. Pp. 530. Maps, illustrations, notes, index. $29.95.)
            In this carefully crafted, engaging, and well-written book, John Dittmer demonstrates an enviable
                    grasp of detail and nuance. This he uses to reveal important and often overlooked or understated
                    aspects of the civil rights movement in 
                        Mississippi
                     and the nation.
            Parts of this story are familiar and appear in most civil rights narratives: Robert Moses moving
                    alone into McComb, 
                        Mississippi
                    , in 1961; the deaths of James Chaney, Michael Schwerner, and Andrew Goodman; and the
                    emergence of Fannie Lou Hamer as a national spokesperson at the 1964 Democratic convention. Yet,
                    from beginning to end, Dittmer consistently re-situates and provides context for these more familiar
                    narratives through his focus on the work of local people and their allies, primarily the Student
                    Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). For example,
                    Dittmer devotes only two of eighteen chapters to the 1964 Freedom Summer and 
                        Mississippi
                     Freedom Democratic Party challenge in 
                        Atlantic City
                    , topics that typically dominate discussions of the 
                        Mississippi
                     movement. Here, the story of the 
                        Mississippi
                     movement is far more than the several-month period when hundreds of white volunteers
                    flooded the state.
            Dittmer begins the story in July, 1946, with Medgar Evers leading fellow World War II veterans in an
                    unsuccessful attempt to vote in the Democratic primary and ends roughly forty years later with the
                    seating of a black-led delegation from 
                        Mississippi
                     in the 1968 Democratic convention. With both its emphases and time frame dictated by
                    the people and events within the state, Local People provides a wonderful
                    alternative to the more common national orientation of civil rights historiography, which tends to
                    center on leaders, organizations, and legislation. The result is more than a longer story or a more
                    diverse focus.
            In his examination of the widespread, grassroots effort in 
                        Mississippi
                    , Dittmer exposes themes that are absent from other civil rights works. He describes the
                    day-in and day-out organizing of SNCC and CORE activists who moved in for the long haul and made
                    their homes with and found allies in local women and men. He explores the cooperation and common
                    vision of a wide array of individuals and groups as well as intergroup tensions and rivalries
                    (particularly between the national NAACP and the homegrown Council of Federated Organizations or
                    COFO). Perhaps even more telling is his account of the promises and the pitfalls found in the
                    interaction among the 
                        Mississippi
                     movement, the federal government, and the liberal wing of the Democratic party.
            
            After skillfully and sensitively portraying years of courage, hope, and hard work, along with
                    disappointment, resistance, and betrayal, and yet more courage and hope, Dittmer closes with
                    comments by activist Bob Moses. The movement, Moses said, "brought 
                        Mississippi
                    , for better or worse, up to the level of the rest of the country" (pp.
                    429-30).
            Dittmer's focus on local people and local priorities in this absorbing account brings the 
                        Mississippi
                     movement to the rest of us. It should be read by anyone interested in the civil rights
                    movement. Moreover, Local People will be one of the books that reshapes the way
                    historians view the civil rights movement as the cumulative weight of local studies challenges the
                    dominant national perspective on the movement's importance.

            In southwestern 
                        Virginia
                    's seven coal-mining counties, the War on Poverty lost its momentum during the
                    oil crisis cum coal boom that began in 1973. But since the early 1980s and the
                    return of stable oil imports, coal mining layoffs have snowballed and a new wave of grassroots
                    organizing has been under way.
            At first, that new wave was best symbolized by the Dungannon Development Commission (DDC), an
                    organization based in 
                        Scott County
                    , 
                        Virginia
                    , and intent on promoting poor people's empowerment–especially poor
                    women's empowerment–by combining GED programs and specially designed community
                    college courses with income generating projects, particularly cooperatives. The DDC's
                    greatest success was probably its Coal Employment Project, which fought both coal companies and male
                    miners' traditional machismo to help women achieve high-paying
                    underground jobs. In 1987, following much favorable publicity, the DDC received a large federal
                    grant to create a sewing cooperative, but internal power struggles for control of that project
                    lowered the morale of all concerned.
            Later, a less dramatic and more communal effort achieved greater success: the Ivanhoe Civic League
                    based in 
                        Wythe County
                    , 
                        Virginia
                    , and led by a charismatic local woman named Maxine Waller. But meanwhile the highly
                    abrasive 1989-1990 strike by the United Mine Workers (UMW) against Pittston Coal Company temporarily
                    propelled thousands of people into local activism.
            
            Into that heady flux stepped the author of this book, a sympathetic scholar interested in how
                    political activism can change women's lives. Seitz conducted lengthy interviews with about
                    twelve active women, and she makes no secret of her sympathy for those women. The bulk of
                    Seitz's book is a valuable selection of quotations from her interviewees, quotations that
                    she has organized into six thematic chapters ("Family," "Work,"
                    "Community," etc.) and that she controls within a generally impressive feminist
                    interpretation.
            Each of Seitz's interviewees has, or has had, men intimately involved in her life. Here
                    those men do not receive equal time–nor any time at all. About half of the interviewees
                    report major mistreatment by men in their past personal lives. Thus the absence here of male
                    testimony may be partly unavoidable. But just as the men in these women's personal lives
                    lack a voice here, likewise do the managers of coal companies and of garment factories and other
                    adversaries of Seitz's interviewees–they too appear only through the
                    women's testimony. Even leaders of the UMW come in for censure. Early during the
                    UMW's strike against Pittston, the union leaders authorized a much-publicized
                    "Camp Solidarity" for visiting sympathizers. The UMW also authorized a Family
                    Auxiliary to monitor local community interests. Among the women whom Seitz interviewed were several
                    auxiliary members who came to "feel that the union ‘sold them out’ in
                    its need for a victory in Southwest 
                        Virginia
                    : ‘All they really wanted was a contract that they could say was won with the
                    strike,’ was a comment from a fiercely pro-labor member [of the Auxiliary]. Many men have
                        not returned to work and more and more men are losing their jobs" (p.
                    176).
            Despite the absence of male voices, management voices, or union leaders' voices,
                    Seitz's book is valuable as direct testimony by women who are in the midst of
                    social–and personal–transformations. As for Seitz's interpretation,
                    that cannot fully receive justice in this short review. The best-known of her favorite authorities
                    are Paulo Freire (Pedagogy of the Oppressed, 1970), James C. Scott (Weapons of the Weak, 1985), Jaqueline Dowd Hall on "Disorderly Women,"
                    and Lydia Sargent on "the unhappy marriage of Marxism and feminism."
            This is a welcome book that is basically political but that could point its author, if she chooses,
                    toward a fully-elaborated theory of personal transformation through social activism.
