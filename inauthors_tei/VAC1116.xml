				<head rend="center b">PREFACE.</head>

				<p>It has been our purpose to prepare a manual of systematic an analysis, both qualitative
					and quantitative, of the common, easily accessible, poisonous compounds. It has seemed
					advisable to refer all descriptions of color to a standard of comparison, since the
					interpretation and descriptions of the primary colors, as well as their tints and shades,
					is so largely influenced by t:he personality of the observer. Such color descriptions are
					misleading and difficult to interpret. In refering to the spectrum-chart it must be borne
					in mind that the <hi rend="i">intensity</hi> of color obtained in the reaction is
					determined, by the amount of substance used.</p>

				<p>It has been assumed that the operator has had considerable training in qualitative and
					quantitative analysis. He must use his judgment as to the applicability of specific
					methods to the conditions under which he is working.</p>

				<p>The methods and descriptions here given should be supplemented by reference to the larger
					descriptive works on toxicology and materia medica, e. g.:</p>

				<list type="simple">
					<item rend="ti-1">(1) Lehrbuch der Intoxicationen, Dr. R. Kobert.</item>
					<item rend="ti-1">(2) Materia Medica, and Therapeutics, .J. V. Shoemaker.</item>
					<item rend="ti-1">(3) Poisons, Their Effects and Detection, A. W. Blythe.</item>
				</list>

				<p>Reference has been made to Lyons and Davis' Manual of Qualitative Analysis for the more
					elaborative investigation of certain mineral poisons.</p>

					<head rend="center b">ANTIMOXY.</head>

					<p>Antimony forms with the mineral acids two classes of salts: the "ic" and the "ous"
						salts. These compounds have a great tendency to form basic salts.</p>

					<p rend="i">Use the chloride of antimony.</p>

					<p>1. To a solution of antimony salt free from tartaric acid and acidified with
						hydrochloric acid, add 3-4 volumes of water; a cheesy, white precipitate will be
						formed.</p>

					<p rend="center">SbCl<hi rend="subscript">3</hi>+H<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>O = SbOCI+<hi
							rend="subscript">2</hi>HCl.</p>

					<p>2. Tartaric acid dissolves the white, basic salt.</p>

							rend="subscript">6</hi> = SbO.C<hi rend="subscript">4</hi>H<hi rend="subscript"
							>5</hi>O<hi rend="subscript">6</hi>+HCl.</p>

					<p>Distinction from bismuth.</p>

					<p>3. If the soluble tartrate in 2. is heated to about 70 deg. and a slow stream of
						hydrogen sulphide gas passed through the solution, all of the antimony will be
						precipitated as am orange-yellow sulphide.</p>

					<p rend="center">2(SbO.C<hi rend="subscript">4</hi>H<hi rend="subscript">5</hi>O<hi
							rend="subscript">6</hi>)+3H<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>S = Sb<hi rend="subscript"

							rend="subscript">4</hi>H<hi rend="subscript">6</hi>O<hi rend="subscript">6</hi>.</p>

					<p>The sulphide is soluble in ammonium sulphide, sodium hydrate or potassium hydrate.</p>

					<p>4. Introduce a little. of the solution described in 2. into a platinum dish which forms
						a galvanic element with a pencil of zinc and allow it to stand several hours; a black
						amorphous deposit of metallic antimony will be formed.</p>

					<div3 type="part">
						<head rend="left b">Quantitative Estimation:</head>

						<p>Introduce the solution into a large beaker, acidify with dilute hydrochloric acid,
							dilute to about 800 cc., heat the fluid to near 80 and pass a slow stream of hydrogen
							sulphide through the solution until it is saturated. Cover the beaker and let it stand
							12-24 hours. Warm the solution on a waster-bath or very cautiously on a gauze until
							the hydrogen sulphide is completely expelled, filter through a weighed paper, wash
							with dilute hydrochloric acid (1:100) and dry at 100 deg. until constant in weight.
							Transfer a portion of the dried precipitate to a large weighed crucible, and again dry
							at 100 to constant weight. Moisten <pb id="VAC1116-007" n="2"/> the residue with a
							little, conc. nitric acid and cover the crucible with a watch-glass. When the action
							is about ended, warm the mixture on a water-bath and finally evaporate to dryness.
							Heat the residue in the free flame, gently at first and finally to dull redness. The
							antimony sulphide will be changed to antimony tetroxide. Continue to heart the residue
							until it is constant in weight. Calculate the amount of antimony tetroxide that would
							have been formed from the total amount of the sulphide which was dried at 100 to
							constant weight.</p>

						<p>1 grm. of antimony tetroxide represents 0.7894 grm. of metallic antimony.</p>

					<head rend="center b">ARSENIC.</head>

					<p>Arsenic forms two classes of compounds, the arsenic and the arsenious. It is
						essentially acid in character and is therefore found usually as arsenious or arsenic
						acid anhydride or the salts of these acids.</p>
					<div3 type="part">
						<head rend="left b">1. Arsenious Compounds.</head>

						<p rend="i">Employ a solution of sodium arsenite.</p>

						<p>1. Hydrogen sulphide precipitates from solutions of arsenites acidified with dilute
							hydrochloric acid, yellow arsenious sulphide. The precipitate is soluble in the
							sulphides or hydroxides of the alkali metals, or in ammonium carbonate. If the
							alkaline solution is acidified with hydrochloric acid, the arsenic is reprecipitated
							as a sulphide.</p>

						<p>2. Silver nitrate precipitates yellow silver arsenite from neutral solutions of
							arsenites. The precipitate its readily soluble in nitric acid or in ammonium
							hydroxide.</p>

						<p>3. When arsenious oxide is heated over a free flame, in a dry test tube, with dry
							sodium acetate, a poisonous gas, Kakodyl<lb/>
							<hi rend="center">(CH<hi rend="subscript">3</hi>)<hi rend="subscript">4</hi>A<hi
									rend="sc">S</hi>O,</hi><lb/> Oxide, of exceedingly penetrating and disagreeable
							odor, is evolved.</p>

						<p>4. Arsenites heated on charcoal in the reducing blow-pipe flame, emit a
							characteristic garlic odor, with t!he formation of a white incrustation of the
							oxide.</p>

						<p>5. Minute quantities of arsenic may be detected in the following manner: Introduce
							the solution free from organic matter (See method for removing organic matter from
							inorganic bodies), into a 1,000 cc. flask, dilute to about 800 cc. with water, acidify
							with hydrochloric acid, heat on a water-bath to <pb id="VAC1116-008" n="3"/> about 70
							deg. and pass a slow stream of hydrogen sulphide (free from arsenic) through the warm
							fluid. Continue to pass the gas until the fluid is saturated. Fill the flask well up
							,in the neck with hot water, stopper well and set aside in a warm place for 12 hours.
							Filter off the supernatant fluid through an asbestos or glass-wool filter, wash the
							residue with dilute hydrochloric acid (1:30), transfer the precipitate with filter to
							a porcelain dish, moisten it thoroughly with fuming nitric acid and evaporate to near
							dryness on a water bath. The arsenic sulphide will be oxidized to arsenic acid. Take
							up the residue in 20-25cc. water, neutralize with sodium carbonate, filter through a
							small glass-wool filter and evaporate the filtrate to dryness; heat the residue
							carefully (not above 180 deg.) to expell all water.</p>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head rend="left">A. OTTO'S METHOD:</head>

							<p>Bring about 2 grm. of anhydrous sodium carbonate and 2 grm. of potassium cyanide
								into a porcelain crucible, cover, and heat gently until all water is expelled. Add 4
								parts of the perfectly dry mixture to one part of the dry sodium arsenate residue <figure>
									<p rend="center">FIG.I.</p>
								</figure>
								<pb id="VAC1116-009" n="4"/> (a small portion of the arsenate residue should be
								reserved for Marsh's test, see B, page (4<ptr targType="pb" target="VAC1116-009"/>),
								mix thoroughly and transfer the mixture (or a part of it if the bulk is
								considerable) to a small porcelain boast. When this mixture is heated strongly in an
								indifferent atmosphere, the sodium arsenate will be decomposed with the liberation
								of metallic arsenic which will deposit on the cooler parts of the reduction
								tube.</p>

							<p>The apparatus consists of</p>

							<p>(a) an hydrogen generator, (b) a straight chloride of calcium tube filled with
								freshly fused, granular calcium chloride), and (d) a piece of hard glass combustion
								tubing, 20-30 cm. long and 1-2 cm. in diameter, drawn out at one end to a capillary
								point.</p>

							<p>Connect the apparatus in the manner shown in the figure. The corks used should be
								sound and close fitting so that the apparatus will be air-tight when the capillary
								point of tube (d) is closed.</p>

							<p>The hydrogen is generated from metallic zinc and sulphuric acid (1:3). It is very
								essential to know that the zinc and sulphuric acid used in the generator are free
								from arsenic. To ascertain this fact, allow some of the acid to flow onto the zinc:
								if the current of hydrogen does not produce a black precipitate or turbidity in the
								silver solution after 15 minutes, the materials are free from arsenic. In case the
								silver solution becomes cloudy, continue the evolution of the gas, and heat the tube
								(d) very strongly near its center; if no black deposit or coloration occurs in the
								cooler part of the tube, the materials are free from arsenic.</p>

							<p>Allow the tube (d) to cool, introduce the boat containing the mixture of sodium
								arsenate, sodium carbonate and potassium cyanide, into the tube (d). Connect the
								apparatus, pass a slow current of hydrogen through it until all air is expelled.<ref
									id="ref_001" rend="super" target="note_001">*</ref> Then heart that part of the
								tube (d) immediately under the boat, gently at first, and finally to redness (the
								heating should continue 15-20 minutes). If arsenic is present, it will be condensed
								near the point of tube (d) in the form of a black or brownish-black, lustrous
								mirror. When the operation is ended, the tube (d) may be, broken with a, spray of
								cold water, or cut with a file, and the arsenic collected as thin flakes or small
								cubes.</p>
						</div4>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head rend="left b">B. MARSH'S METHOD:</head>

							<p>This is perhaps the most delicate test for arsenic.</p>

							<p>It is based upon the fact (1) that nascent hydrogen reduces all <milestone
									unit="typography" n="-------"/>
								<note id="note_001"><ref target="ref_001" rend="super">*</ref>Ignite a test-tube
									full of the gas collected from the capillary point, if the gas is pure hydrogen
									(not mixed with air) the ignition is attended with only the slightest
									report.</note>
								<pb id="VAC1116-010" n="5"/> arsenical compounds, especially the arsenates and
								arsenites, to arsenetted hydrogen gas; (2) that this gas burns in the air with a
								peculiar bluish flame to form water and arsenic tri-oxide; a cold surface depressed
								into the flame will be coated with a deposit or mirror of metallic arsenic and (3)
								that arsenetted hydrogen is easily decomposed by heat, into free arsenic and
								hydrogen.</p>

							<p>A convenient form of apparatus for Marsh’s test is shown in figure 2.</p>

							<figure>
								<p rend="center">FIG.2.</p>
							</figure>

							<p>For the hydrogen generator (g), select a heavy-walled flask and equip with a doubly
								perforated stopper. Through one perforation pass a separating funnel until the lower
								end reaches to near the bottom of the flask; through the other pass a short
								right-angled tube to connect with the U-tube (a) which is filled with fused,
								granular calcium chloride. Connect (,a) and (b) with a glass tube bent at right
								angles.</p>

							<p>The tube (b) is made from a piece of hard glass combustion tubing, about 40 cm. in
								length; it should be constricted in two places near its center and drawn out to a
								capillary point at one end, as shown in the cut.</p>

							<p>It is essential to know that the metallic zinc and sulphuric acid (1:3) used in the
								generation of hydrogen, are free from arsenic. This may be ascertained in the
								following manner: Allow enough acid (in the funnel) to flow into the generator to
								evolve a strong current of hydrogen, let the gas pass about 10 minutes to expell all
								the air from the apparatus (see foot note page 4<ptr targType="pb"
									target="VAC1116-009"/>), ignite the gas at the capillary point and depress a cold
								porcelain dish into the flame. If the surface of the dish remains clean and free of
								deposit, the materials are free from arsenic.</p>

							<pb id="VAC1116-011" n="6"/>

							<p>Dissolve the portion of the residue reserved in 5, page 3<ptr targType="pb"
									target="VAC1116-008"/>, or another residue prepared in the same manner, in 20-30
								cc. of water, introduce the solution into the funnel and allow it to flow VERY
								SLOWLY Into the generator which has previously been charged with sufficient acid to
								produce a strong and steady current of hydrogen. Again, depress the cold porcelain
								dish into the flame; a black or brownish-black, lustrous mirror of metallic arsenic
								will be deposited on the porcelain surface. The mirror is readily soluble in sodium
								hypochlorite. (Distinction from antimony.) If the glass tube (b) is heated to
								redness at the point (x) a mirror of metallic arsenic will be formed at the first
								constriction. In case the mirror does not appear at once, continue the heating at x
								for 10-15 minutes.</p>

						<p>When extracting aconitin from organic matter, one must have regard to the ready
							decomposability of the alkaloid. It is saponified by alcoholic potash, or by
							superheated steam, into methyl alcohol, benzoic acid and two new bases: pikroaconitin
							and napellin. Dilute sulphuric or hydrochloric acid saponifies it at 100 deg.,
							liberating benzoic acid. The following method may be recommended:</p>

						<p>Introduce the substance into a large mortar, trilurate it thoroughly with 95 per
							cent. alcohol to the consistence of a thin paste, add an equal volume of alcohol, make
							slightly acid with tartaric acid and digest the mixture 30 minutes at 20-30 deg.
							Filter off the alcohol and repeat the extraction with alcohol until the substance is
							free from alkaloid. Unite the alcoholic extracts and evaporate to a thin syrup.
							Extract the residue with absolute alcohol, filter, evaporate the filtrate to,near
							dryness, add 3-4 volumes of water, warm to, 60 deg. and filter while hot. Make the
							aqueous filtrate alkaline with sodium hydrate and extract with ether until the
							alkaline fluid is free from alkaloid. Unite the ether extracts, distill off the ether,
							dissolve the residue in very dilute sulphuric acid, dilute to 110 cc., filter off 100

					<p>Strychnin is found in the seeds and other parts of the Strychnos series of plants, e.g.
						Strychnos ignatii, Strychnos nux vomica, Strychnos columbrina, etc. It crystallizes from
						hot alcohol in colorless, shining prisms which melt at 265-266 deg. It dissolves in
						about 6000 parts of cold water to a colorless, exceedingly bitter, and extraordinarily
						poisonous fluid. The bitter taste is perceptible in a dilution of 1 in 670,000.
						Strychnin is readily soluble in chloroform, alcohol, and benzol; less soluble in carbon
						bi-sulphide, amylalcohol, and ether</p>

					<p rend="i">Use strychnin sulphate.</p>

					<p>1. Conc. nitric acid dissolves strychnin to a yellow fluid, with the formation of di-
						or tri-niitro-strychnin; the addition of alcoholic potash to alkaline reaction colors
						the supernatant fluid red or violet. The odor of ethyl aldehyde may be detected.</p>

					<p>2. When strychnin is heated by boiling with hydrochloric acid (1.12) it does not change
						perceptibly, but if a minute <pb id="VAC1116-072" n="67"/> quantity of nitric acid is
						added, to the boiling fluid, it becomes orange-red to red.</p>

					<p>3. The deportment of strychnin toward conc. sulphuric acid and potassium bichromate is
						very delicate and characteristic. The presence of a considerable quantity of atropin
						hinders the reaction.</p>

					<p rend="i">Process:</p>

					<p>Dissolve the substance in conc. sulphuric acid, avoiding any considerable excess of the
						acid. Generally 2-3 drops of the acid are sufficient. Place the acid solution on a
						porcelain crucible-lid, drop a small crystal of potassium bi-chromate into it (a crystal
						1/2 the size of a flax-seed its sufficient) and draw it back and forth through the
						solution, by means of a glass-rod. The path of the bi-chromate crystal will be marked by
						blue stripes, which quickly change to violet (shade 2), then to violet, red-violet, red,
						orange (shade 1) and finally to green-yellow (shade 1). Brucin interferes with the
						reaction.</p>

					<p>4. Strychnin gives no characteristic reaction with cane-sugar and conc. sulphuric
						acid.</p>

					<p>5. Mandelin's reagent gives a violet color (shade 2), which quickly changes to
						violet-red (shade 1), then to red-orange. (Distinction from Brucin). The violet does not
						appear if the reagent is added in great excess. Atropin prevents the reaction.</p>

						changes to a red (tint 1), then to an orange. Atropin does not prevent the reaction.</p>

						<p>In extracting and purifying morphin with amylalcohol, coloring matters and other

						<p>Edmund Schleibe<ref id="ref_017" rend="super" target="note_017">*</ref> has suggested
							the following process:</p>

						<p>Extract the powdered substance with sulphuric acid (1:20), filter and evaporate on a
							water-bath to a thin syrup. Extract the residue with 5-6 volumes of alcohol, filter
							and distill off the alcohol from the filtrate. Shake the alcoholic residue with
							amylalcohol, so long as coloring matters are dissolved, remove the alcohol, warm the
							acid residue to 50-60 deg. add an equal volume of amylalcohol, make alkaline with
							ammonium hydroxide, and shake the mixture for some time. Allow the alcohol to separate
							and pipette it off; repeat the extraction with fresh portions of amylalcohol, unite
							the extracts and distill off the alcohol. Take up the residue with dilute sulphuric
							acid, filter if necessary, shake with amylalcohol to dissolve any coloring matters,
							separate the alcohol, add a mixture of 10 parts ether and 1 part 95 per cent alcohol
							to the aqueous residue, make alkaline with ammonium hydroxide and shake vigorously.
							Separate the ether, repeat the extractions with fresh portions of ether-alcohol, unite
							the extracts, distill off the ether and finally expell the last trace of ether from
							the residue by heating on a water-bath. The residue is generally sufficiently pure for
							the successful detection of morphin.</p>

					<head rend="center b">SYSTEMATIC<lb/> TOXICOLOGICAL ANALYSIS.</head>

					<p>In toxicological analysis the operator must demonstrate: <list type="simple">

								body.</item>
							<item>(2) The quantity, if possible, of such a substance.</item>
							<item>(3) Whether or not it has been absorbed into the vital organs.</item>
						</list>
					</p>

					<p>There are three chief points to be noted which may give some suggestion as to the
						nature of the poisonous body.</p>

					<p>1. The physiological symptoms during the progressive poisoning. These symptoms are
						usually obtained from the attending physicians. It should be born in mind that these
						symptoms are largely influenced, <list type="simple">
							<item>(1) By the state of health of the subject.</item>
							<item>(2) By the fullness of emptiness of the stomach.</item>
							<item>(3) By the remedies which may have been taken at the onset of the
								poisoning.</item>
							<item>(4) By the idiosyncrasy of the individual.</item>
						</list>
					</p>

					<p>2. The physical appearance of the various organs under examination. <list type="simple">
							<item>(1.) They may be strongly corroded.</item>
							<item>(2.) They may be hyperaemic.</item>
							<item>(3.) They may be bleached.</item>
						</list>
					</p>

					<p>It must also be borne in mind that the same poison may super-induce a very marked
						hyperaemic condition in one organ, while it exercises a bleaching effect on others.</p>

					<p>3. The probability that a specific poison has been used.</p>

					<pb id="VAC1116-085" n="80"/>

					<p>There are a number of factors which point to the probable presence of a definite
						substance. <list type="simple">
							<item>(1.) Its accessibility.</item>
							<item>(2.) Its virulence.</item>
							<item>(3.) The popular knowledge that it is virulent.</item>
							<item>(4.) A history of the conditions incident to the poisoning.</item>
						</list>
					</p>

					<p>Neither the accessibility, the virulence, nor the popular faith in any poison as an
						agent of destruction, will justify the analyst in suspecting and examining directly for
						a specific substance, without due systematic methods.</p>

					<p>The work of the analyst is divided naturally into two chief stages:</p>

					<p>1. Collecting the material for analysis.</p>

					<p>2. Examination of such materials. <list type="simple">
							<item>(a.) A physical examination.</item>
							<item>(b.) A chemical examination.</item>
						</list>
					</p>

					<div3 type="part">
						<head rend="left b">1. Collecting the material for analysis.</head>

						<p>It happens often that the materials are brought to the analyst by some local officer.
							In any case the analyst should notice very carefully the manner in which the samples
							have been packed, whether the seals have been tampered with, etc. It is much more
							advisable, where practicable, for the analyst to collect the materials for
							examination.</p>

						<p>The subject should be opened and the following organs removed, kept separate, and the
							orifices tied with cat-gut or silk cord: stomach, heart, liver, pancreas, kidneys, and
							bladder.</p>

						<p>If there was vomiting and diarrhoea, the vomit and faeces should be collected, kept
							separate and examined. Each sample should be placed in a separate glass jar, sealed
							and kept as cool as possible during transportation. It is not advisable to add an
							antiseptic, e.g. alcohol, carbolic acid, etc., in order to retard or prevent
							putrifaction. When possible, the jars should be packed in ice during transportation,
							and the contents examined as soon as possible.</p>
					</div3>

					<div3 type="part">
						<head rend="left b">2. Examination of the material.</head>

						<p>(a) <hi rend="i">The physical examination.</hi></p>

						<p rend="i">It is an imperative ruling that each organ or object shall be examined
							separately.</p>

						<p>Weigh the organ and contents.</p>

						<p>Cut open the organ, remove its contents into a clean weighed beaker-glass of suitable
							size, wash the mucous surface with a little distilled water, using as little water as
							possible, and add the <pb id="VAC1116-086" n="81"/> washings to the contents in the
							beaker-glass. Spread out the organ on a glass plate and examine the surface carefully
							with a good lense noting any suspicious-looking substance. If there are marked
							physical changes in the mucous coat, wash it carefully with water and photograph it.
							If it is the stomach which is under examination, let the contents and washings settle,
							siphon off the fluid and examine the residue, which may consist chiefly of food
							particles. It is often of great value to know the nature of the food last taken. Note
							carefully the general appearance, odor, color, land reaction. It should be born in
							mind that the fluids in corpses undergo a rapid fermentation so that in 40-60 hrs.
							after death, the organs take on an alkaline reaction. This reaction is due to the
							probable formation of such bodies, as (1) Ammonium, (2) Di-methylamine, (3)
							Tri-methylamine, (4) Muscarin, (5) Oholin, (6) Betain and (7) Ptomaines.</p>

						<p>These products of fermentation possess more or less basic properties</p>

						<p rend="i">(b) The chemical examination.</p>

						<p>If the physical examination and the history of the case point to some specific
							poison, it may be that the operator is justified in examining the organ directly for
							that substance.</p>

						<list type="simple">
							<item>(1.) If a volatile poison is indicated, use <hi rend="b">100.</hi></item>
							<item>(2.) If an alkaloid poison is indicated, use <hi rend="b">101.</hi></item>
							<item>(3.) If an inorganic poison is indicated, use <hi rend="b">102.</hi></item>
						</list>

						<p>When the preliminary examinations fail to suggest the presence of some specific
							poison, the operator has the very difficult task of looking for the possible presence
							of any poisonous compound. Generally it is fair to presuppose that only one poison has
							been employed. Obviously this is not very scientific, but in the absence of a more

								Allow to cool, filter, wash the residue with alcohol, unite the filtrate and
								washings, distill off the alcohol and evaporate to a thin syrup on the water-bath.
								Add 100 cc. of water to the residue, heat to 70-80 deg., with careful stirring, let
								cool and filter through paper or cotton. If the filtrate is turbid, evaporate it to
								a thin syrup, extract with 60-80 cc. of absolute alcohol, filter, wash the residue
								with a little absolute alcohol, unite the filtrate and washings and evaporate on a
								water-bath to a thick syrup. Take up the residue in 80-100 cc. of water, filter if
								necessary and introduce the clear acid filtrate (A) into a narrow, glass-stoppered
								cylinder.</p>

							<p>1. Extract 3-4 times with 10-20 cc. of ether, unite the extracts and evaporate to

							<p>Introduce the finely divided substance (previously weighed) into a porcelain dish
								of suitable size, add sufficient nitric acid (1.3) to cover it, and heat the mixture
								on a water-bath until it has the consistence of a homogeneous paste. Neutralize the
								free acid with sodium hydrate, add a quantity of ammonium nitrate equal in weight to
								the original weight of the substance and evaporate tie mixture to complete dryness
								on a water-bath. Bring a portion (2-3 grm.) of the dried substance into a large
								porcelain crucible, cover with lid and heat gently until the mixture ignites. (The
								ignition its often attended with slight explosions). Remove the lid and observe the
								color of the mixture. If it is not perfectly white, add 0.5-1.0 grm. of ammonium
								nitrate, cover and again ignite. Continue the addition of small quantities of
								ammonium nitrate and ignition, until the residue is white. Bring a second portion
								off the dry substance into the crucible and ignite as before. Continue to add the
								dry residue and ignite with the nitrate, until the entire residue has been brought
								into the crucible and ignited. The resulting mass must be white and homogeneous.
								Place the crucible in a beaker-glass, cover it with dilute nitric acid (1:10) and
								boil until the residue is thoroughly disintegrated; filter and wash the residue with
								hot water. Mark the filter and its contents Residue 1. Proceed with the examination
								of Residue 1 as directed in <hi rend="b">112,</hi> page 99<ptr targType="pb"

							<p>Unite the filtrate and washings, add 4-5 cc. conc. sulphuric acid, mix, and

								add cautiously 5-7 cc. of conc. nitro-sulphonic acid (10 grm. potassium nitrite in
								100 cc. conc. sulphuric acid) and evaporate to near dryness; heat the residue
								cautiously over the free flame until completely charred. The temperature should not

								small.</p>

							<p>Introduce 5-10 grm. of the dry material into a porcelain boat. Equip a piece of
								hard glass combustion tubing at each end with a close fitting, singly perforated,
								rubber stopper. Pass a glass tube 12-15 cm. long through one stopper, allowing it to
								terminate on the inner surface. Connect the outer end of the small tube with a
								sulphuric acid wash-bottle which is attached to an oxygen receiver. The other
								stopper should also be provided with a similar tube which is connected with a
								Liebig's absorption bulb half full of water. Support the apparatus firmly on a
								retort stand, introduce the boat with its contents into the center of the combustion
								tube, make the connections as above directed and pass a slow current of dry oxygen
								into the tube until the air is expelled<ref id="ref_022" rend="super"
									target="note_022">**</ref></p>

							<p>Now apply a small flame to that portion of the combustion tube in which the boat is
								held. Continue to heat gently until the material in the boat its completely charred
								and black. Increase the heat to a dull redness and maintain it at this stage until
								the organic matter is completely consumed. At no time should the temperature be
								sufficiently high to cause the contents of the tube to blaze. When the oxidation is
								complete, allow the tube to cool without interrupting the flow of oxygen, turn off
								the oxygen, introduce the oontents of the boat into a small porcelain dish, wash the
								combustion tube and the smaller glass connection tubes, with conc. nitric acid, add
								the washings to the contents of the dish, transfer the water in the Liebig's bulb
								also to the dish and wash out the bulb with hot water, adding the washings to the
								remainder of the fluid. Now add 2-3 cc. of conc. sulphuric acid, and evaporate the
								mixture on a water-bath until the nitric acid is completely expelled. Add 150-200
								cc. of water and heat to near boiling; if complete solution does not take place,
								filter, wash the residue with hot water and examine it as directed in <hi rend="b"

								cover the contents of the flask, connect the apparatus as above directed, heat the
								fluid to near boiling on a water-bath and introduce through the thistle tube, a hot
								saturated solution of potassium chlorate, in small portions at a time, e.g. 10 cc.,
								allowing sufficient time to elapse between the additions of the chlorate solution,
								to effect the decomposition of the chlorarte. Generally 10 cc. of the hot saturated
								solution may be added every 5 minutes. Continue the digestion with hydrochloric acid
								and chlorate until the contents, of the flask are oxidized to a clear yellow fluid.
								Remove the thistle tube, introduce in its stead, a close-fitting glass tube allowing
								the lower end of the tube to reach to the bottom of the flask; connect the other end
								with a carbon di-oxide generator and pass a slow stream of carbon di-oxide through
								the fluid until the chlorine is completely expelled. Remove the cooler, disconnect
								the generator, dilute the solution in the flask to 800 cc., pass hydrogen sulphide
								through the liquid until it is saturated, stopper the flask and set aside for 48
								hours. Filter through an asbestos filter, wash it thoroughly with water, bring the

								sulphide is completely dissolved. Remove the thistle-tube, connect the flask with a
								carbon di-oxide generator and pass carbon di-oxide through the fluid (without
								removing the return cooler), until the last trace of free chlorine is removed.
								Filter into a graduated flask, wash thoroughly, adding the washings to the filtrate,
								and dilute it to a definite volume. Reserve an aliquot part for the quantitative

						<head rend="left b">The Volumetric Estimation of Alkaloids with Meyer's Solution.</head>

						<p>Meyer's reagent is prepared by dissolving 6.775 grm. of dry crystalline mercuric
							chloride and 25 grm. of potassium iodide separately in water, mixing the solutions,
							and diluting the mixture to 1000 cc. The solution thus obtained its n|20.</p>

						<p>The yellowish, precipitates yielded by the great majority of alkaloids with Meyer's
							reagent are more or less soluble in alcohol, ether, acetic acid, iodides and sometimes
							in an excess of the <pb id="VAC1116-108" n="103"/> reagent. The solution of the
							purified alkaloid to be tested must (1) be distinctly acid with dilute sulphuric or
							hydrochloric acid; (2) must not be more than slightly alcoholic; (3) must not contain
							acetic acid, and (4) must, as a rule, contain about 0.5 per cent. of the alkaloid. For
							accurate titration, it is essential that the solutions operated on shall be of nearly
							uniform strength and that the reagent be added in exactly the same manner. It is also
							advisable to make a control titration with the same volume of a solution containing a
							known weight of the same alkaloid in a state of purity.</p>

						<div4 type="section">
							<head rend="left b">Process:</head>

							<p>To the measured quantity of the alkaloidal solution, add Meyer's 'reagent from a
								burette as long as a precipitate is produced. To determine this end reaction it is
								necessary to filter a portion of the mixture. A filter 1/2 inch in diameter,
								supported on a ring of platinum wire, may be used. A drop of the filtered liquid is
								placed in a watch-glass on a black background and a droop of the reagent added. The
								faintest turbidity may be readily detected. All filters and test drops are to be
								returned to the solution before the titration is ended. The end of the reaction is
								that point at which Meyer's reagent ceases to form a precipitate.</p>

						<head rend="center b">PREPARATION OF SOLUTIONS FOR VOLUMETRIC ANALYSIS.</head>

						<p rend="center">(Standard Solutions, Normal Solutions and Indicators).</p>

						<p>1. Standard solutions are simply solutions of accurately known strength. That
							strength is selected which best fits the requirement of the reaction to be executed.
							Standard solutions are prepared (1) by dissolving an accurately weighted amount of
							substance in a definite volume of the solvent, e. g. 15 grm. of a salt in a 1000 cc.
							measuring flask, filled to the mark with water; or (2) by titrating a portion of a
							solution of an approximate weight of the substance with a standard solution, or
							solution of known strength. The strength of such solutions is expressed as the weight
							of the dissolved substance in 1.0 cc. or as the weight of another substance which will
							react with 1.0 cc.</p>

						<p>2. A normal solution is one which contains, dissolved in 1000 cc. of the solvent, the
							molecular weight of the substance in grammes, divided by its hydrogen equivalent.</p>

						<p>The hydrogen equivalent of an acid is the number of replaceable atoms of hydrogen it
							contains; of a base, the valence of the metal or metallic radical present; of an
							oxidizing agent, the number of hydrogen atoms that can be oxidized to water by one
							molecule of the substance; of a reducing agent, the number of hydrogen atoms which
							have the same reducing power as one molecule of the substance; of other substances,
							the number of hydrogen atoms which a molecule can liberate, unite with or with which
							it can in some way react.</p>

						<p>These facts point at once to the necessity of a proper understanding of the chemical
							work to be done by a given reagent, before the strength of a normal solution can be
							detetermined.</p>

						<p>Normal solutions are often inconveniently strong; in such cases 1|2, 1|5, 1|10, 1|20,
							1|100 normal solutions are prepared. These are usually designed as n|2, n|5, n|10,
							etc.</p>

						<p>3. Indicators are substances which have no influence upon the trend of the chemical
							action, but which give a characteristic color with one of the reagents. An indicator
							is used to determine the "end-point" of the reaction, when the reagent produces, no
							change in color and when it is not convenient or possible to demonstrate the
							disappearance of the last trace of the body acted upon, e.g. the titration of acid
							with alkali.</p>
