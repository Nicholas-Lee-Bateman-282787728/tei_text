            <p>The search for origins of American institutions, European and colonial, has provided endless, as well
                    as generally inconclusive, historical controversies. The pastime has been especially dear to
                    antiquarian partisans of racial, regional, and sectarian interests. Due to notorious liberties in
                    nomenclature, educational history has been especially open to such indulgences. Thus, to come to the
                    subject in hand, the question as to whether our state colleges and universities had their beginnings
                    in colonial colleges presents but another exercise in semantics. Church establishments gave their
                    colleges official sanction and virtual monopoly of higher education under the standing order. Beyond
                    this grant of powers the government was not obligated. In no case was there the recognition of a
                    responsibility for support and of a duty to promote general services as against that of safeguarding
                    the doctrines and prerogatives of the particular sect.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> To be sure the period
                    was one of genesis, and it may be said that the colonial colleges were the forerunners of our state
                    universities and land-grant colleges in the sense that the dame schools prepared the way for the

                    way to county consolidations. Such connections, however, put a hard strain upon the germ theory of
                    history.</p>
            <p>Realistically the colonial ventures in higher education were modest replicas of the typical English
                    university college with the same narrow content, formal method, and restricted aim and appeal. The
                    main departures were in growing evidences of restiveness to sectarian restraints, proposals and
                    small concessions in subject innovations, especially in the College of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and the democratizing influence of the log-colleges and seminaries. Nowhere was the
                    social purpose and the expansive and adaptable program of the matured state institution to be
                        glimpsed.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Consequently without radical alteration in control, curriculum, and objectives, these bulwarks of
                    traditional orthodoxy were entirely inadequate and inappropriate as agencies to propagate and
                    propagandize the democratic transformations of society that the devotees of the Enlightenment were
                    deliberately and sedulously striving for in the era of the Revolution. For in their day these
                    progressive educationists dared openly and confidently to essay the building of a new social order
                    through the public school system.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>Their planning involved the up–to–date ideas of the French system of unified
                    state control from elementary instruction to the university. The system was to be wholly secularized
                    with broad curriculum in which modern languages and literatures and the sciences, natural and
                    social, should have co-ordinate emphasis with the classics. The most thorough going reformers,
                    especially those of European background, felt that the nation itself was the only suitable agency

                    </placeName> and Benjamin Rush, who appreciated state sensibilities and jealousies, regarded a
                    national university as wholly appropriate. With the initial and persisting state loyalties, there
                    was no possibility of the nationalizing of so intimate a function as the public schools; and the
                    national university, except for the military division and certain research agencies, has never been
                    realized.</p>
            <p>As Jefferson, the master mind and the guiding spirit of the educational reformers, realized, the true
                    opportunity was in creating new state systems in accord with regional interests. The first step was
                    to liberalize and modernize the existing colleges by alteration of their charters. Efforts to
                    function-alize and socialize the old centers of sectarian orthodoxy were eagerly undertaken, but
                    academic inertia and natural conservatism of much of the constituency delayed and tempered the
                    innovations. As it proved, the defenders of the old ways were given legal relief by the Dartmouth
                    College decision which brought comfort to those who loved the small colleges, not so much for their
                    moral or cultural inspiration as for the defense which they gave to the established order.</p>
            <p>In newer states or in the cases of colleges too unresponsive to the <hi rend="i">Zeitgeist</hi>, new
                    public universities were made to order. Institutions of the approved pattern were launched in the
                    Carolinas and Georgia and in the <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName> frontier <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName>, while public land grants promoted the initial state universities in the Northwest.
                    Presidents and key faculty members sympathetic to the new program were widely sought at home and
                    abroad.</p>
            <p>The most complete expression of Jefferson's design was, of course, his own University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>—the apex of his proposed pyramid of state education. To safeguard the
                    liberal innovations in instruction and administration and to insure the fullest public control, a
                    theological department and clerical professors were excluded. Such a policy by no means reflected an
                    insensibility to religion as a social determinant or a lack of appreciation of theology, as such, as
                    a field of study and research. On the contrary, Jefferson had a rare understanding of the religious
                    influence in social progress and, in spite of his unorthodox trinitarian views, a truer and more
                    realistic conception of the Christian ethic than did his intolerant assailants. As a student and
                    observer of the European <pb n="346" id="VAA4025-046-4-004"/> universities he was familiar with the
                    place of the faculty of theology and his original plan included such a chair. Apparently he was
                    persuaded by Thomas Cooper of the impossibility, in practice, of separating basic religious
                    principles from an intolerant divisive sectarianism. Without risking such a devitalizing influence,
                    he was still confident that essential religious values might be taught by the professor of ethics.
                    He did not, however, leave the important matter at that.</p>
            <p>Characteristically of the philosopher's realism, he gave recognition to the benefits of
                    church organization and made a concession to the prevalent sectarian loyalties by a provision for
                    affiliated schools of theology for such denominations as cared to provide this special instruction
                    for their student constituencies. This invitation extended impartially to all denominations, in
                    accord with the spirit of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Statute of Religious Freedom, had the immediate effect of securing the support for the
                    state institution of the influential dissenting sects who were fearful of the restoration of an
                    establishment or of any favored treatment of a particular group.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The nearest counterpart of this plan in the West was the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> which was originally designed by a disciple of Jefferson after the French model. Both
                    universities were subjected to wearisome delays. <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s came a dozen years later. By that time the German system, following the
                    celebrated report of Victor Cousin, had come to supersede the French as the goal of the

                    the new order.</p>
            <p>The new social order, it appeared, was slow in emerging. As always the proposed changes were
                    discredited by over-zealous enthusiasts and irresponsible opportunists. With many liberty seemed but
                    a cloak for license. Undergraduates in the old centers of piety made ostentatious parade of their
                    infidelity and of their utter contempt for conventional morals.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Naturally the
                    keepers of the old order felt that the foundations <hi rend="i">of religion</hi>, morality,
                    government, and business <hi rend="i">were</hi> endangered and instituted a vigorous counter attack
                    at all these points. This was not difficult. With the average American citizen such new and alien
                    doctrines as deism, materialism, environmentalism, pacificism and the equal rights of the sexes,
                    classes, and races were repugnant. Especially in his religious beliefs did he keep to the
                    fundamental traditions. The more extreme rationalistic groups never secured popular following. As a
                    precaution in social stability, free thinking either in Europe or America was never made too free to
                    the general run of folk.</p>
            <p>In the ensuing "Protestant counter-reformation" or "second
                    awakening," sectarian influence in higher education was regained and greatly extended.
                    Champions of the faith like Timothy Dwight at <placeName>

                    </placeName> made such devastating rout of soph-omoric sophistries that those who came to college as
                    scoffers remained as humble converts.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> The old colleges became centers of
                    missionary recruitment, both to the benighted heathen in distant lands and to the wild westerners at
                    home. College extension paralleled church extension. Certain sects insisted from the first upon a
                    trained ministry and others, who had relied largely upon emotional appeal, were forced in self
                    defense to provide institutions for training their clerical and lay leadership. The result was an
                    inordinate founding of colleges which in some frontier states were so unsubstantial that the
                    mortality was a total one hundred per cent.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

            <p>Permanent or transient, high or low standard, these colleges dominated the nation's higher
                    education throughout the "denominational era" before the Civil War. These
                    regionally available and piously purposed centers of learning undoubtedly provided the sort of
                    educational opportunity that the public desired at this stage.</p>
            <p>In the middle fifties a valiant champion of higher education as an instrument of the faith could make
                    the complacent if not strictly accurate, report that "The whole number of Colleges in these <placeName>

                    forty-nine thousand graduates up to 1850, forty-two thousand were from institutions sustained by two
                    religious denominations, and in their Colleges west of Lake Erie alone seven hundred conversions
                    have occurred, and five hundred of these converts have been and are to be preachers of the
                        Gospel."<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At least down to the fifties, church provided and directed collegiate education was so in conformity
                    with popular desire that there was little demand for distinct state institutions. In fact the line
                    between the two sorts of higher education was often very indistinct. In spite of legal separation of
                    church and state, in education the two interests were frequently intermingled. In a considerable
                    number of cases states gave aid to purely sectarian colleges, and at least half a dozen public land
                    grants were made to such institutions.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> In the border states of <placeName>

                    prevented the establishment of real state universities.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The main incentive for establishing state universities at all in this period was the federal
                    university grant. In a number of states and territories denominational interests by diverting the
                    grant to seminaries or normal schools were able to delay indefinitely the founding of a state rival.
                    Another defensive scheme, especially when the demand for vocational training developed in the
                    fifties, was to have the state institution devoted largely to technical and professional training
                    while leaving the field of general education mainly to the colleges.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There need have been little anxiety regarding this rivalry as throughout the period to the seventies
                    the leading denominations were able to direct or at least to hold in check the so-called state
                    universities. Often the main struggle was between rival sectarian interests. There was the
                    assumption, generally supported by prevailing public opinion, that the leading denominations should
                    be represented on the governing boards with the prevailing faith in the majority.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> Consequently the organization and program were brought into conformity with a standard that
                    made evangelical religion the great objective. Neither Jefferson's French university system
                    in <placeName>

            <p>Regardless of jurisdiction the old-time college president was a clergyman. After a few venturesome
                    trials with lay executives the state universities kept to the conventional field of selection. After <placeName>

            <p>Alike for state and church institutions, the ideal leadership was a theologian renowned for effective
                    support of the faith once for all delivered. When in 1869 Tappan's successor resigned to
                    head a new university of his church, the preferred candidates were distinguished theologians. The
                    leading professor of the medical college, prominent alumni, and business and professional board
                    members were all agreed that a lay scholar would be wholly unacceptable to the public. The main
                    qualifications of James B. Angell as a second choice were that he had been licensed to preach and
                    that he had been regarded as a strong moral influence as president of the University of <placeName>

            <p>To support the clerical president key faculty positions were filled by fellow clergymen, whose

                    justified the predominance of clerical professors by the facts that most of the well trained were in
                    that profession, and that it was most akin to teaching in its reconciliation to small pay and

                    and exhortation, attendance on revivals and camp meetings was at times encouraged by the suspension
                    of college work. Courses like Evidences of Christianity and Moral Philosophy were required with no
                    thought of the violation of religious freedom. Ministerial students were welcomed and aided by the

                    would combine technical with general training in a manner to be most widely available. Progressive

            </p>
            <p>The resulting land-grant institutions with their emphasis upon scientific method and study and their
                    practical objectives might well have been expected to secure, at long last, that complete separation
                    of state functions from all sectarian direction and inhibition that state constitutions seemed to
                    contemplate. Such undoubtedly would have been the result had the "new education"
                    been directed from the first by leaders in science and technology rather than, as it most
                    characteristically was, by social reformers and popular agitators. Consequently the new higher
                    education in the initial years took not so much the form of polytechnic universities as of
                    peoples' or farmers' colleges. And the people were still strongly attached to
                    traditional religious views. To many of its zealous protagonists the industrial movement had the
                    spirit of a religious crusade. At one inaugural it was declared that the college was open to
                    "all of God's people" and at another to "all worthy comers
                    …. It knows not male nor female, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free." A member
                    of the board of a land-grant university, reflecting the popular concern at the indifference of the
                    president to daily chapel and the disappointment at the slow development of the agricultural work,
                    declared that "the institution has already got as far as possible from God and
                        agriculture."<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For their part, the old-line colleges, confronted by rising standards, increasing costs, and
                    declining enrollments, hastened with no sense of impropriety but with full assumption of
                    preparedness to provide the instruction in applied science, to seek all or a share of their
                    state's federal subvention. As a result of the ensuing legislative contests, in a number of
                    states the location was made within or in affiliation with sectarian institutions. In certain others
                    new state colleges or universities were erected on the foundations of religious establishments. In
                    no case, it may be said, did the sectarian contenders lose their prize without persistent and often

                    significant that during the struggle for the grant and in the formative period the charges of
                    materialism and godlessness were not made against the type and content of education proposed, with
                    its wide departure from the "disciplines" of the traditional college, when
                    conducted under sectarian auspices where, supposedly, the students would be immunized from the
                    dangers of vocational training by state funds. Evidently the menace of the new education was only in
                    its conduct and control by state agencies.</p>
            <p>Under whatever control, the A and M colleges gave no valid grounds for such fears. The separate
                    colleges in particular, being usually in rural areas and especially close to the constituencies,
                    were unusually responsive to prevailing moral and social standards and usages. With all the emphasis
                    upon science and scientists, clerical leaders still seemed the most available and, as in the past,
                    ecclesiastical as well as party and academic politics at times entered into the selection. The
                    versatility demanded by the federal-state campus relationships was suggested in the characterization
                    of a land-grant president who became a notable pioneer in the federal extension service:
                    "He could run a Methodist revival, an educational campaign, a domestic economy class, or an
                    agricultural and fine stock meeting with equal success."<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Lay
                    presidents were expected to conduct chapel, preach the baccalaureate sermon, and make appropriate
                    addresses to religious gatherings. Those who were deficient in these duties, whatever their other
                    attainments, were usually regarded as misfits.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> In launching <list type="footnotes">

            <p>In the social gospel crusade, which may be regarded as the religious phase of the large progressive
                    movement, social scientists in leading state universities were in the vanguard. As a whole their
                    showing was better than that of the children of light in many of the denominational centers of
                    learning, among whom, in too many cases, there were negative or defensive responses to this cyclical
                    reformation of current evils in society. The test of orthodoxy now appeared to turn on social and

                    religion as such could be taught with full scientific objectivity,<hi rend="sup">34</hi> were most
                    unconvincing for a background of unlimited sectarian self-determination, and immoderate not to say
                    ruthless rivalry. Religious education as a distinct field of teaching could find a place in the
                    rising schools of education to which the humble departments of didactics and pedagogy had evolved.
                    Content subjects, however, were limited to highly generalized rather incidental treatment in

            <p>An early partial approach was in the creation of chaplaincies with the incumbents usually alternating
                    among the leading faiths. The office of necessity was seriously limited, even when dual selections
                    were made to represent the two great branches of Christendom.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> However tolerant
                    and tactful the chaplain might endeavor to be, he was bound to be handicapped by his sectarian
                    background and at times by the unseemly denominational rivalries for the position (from which not
                    even the halls of the Congress seem to be entirely immune). At best the extent of his personal
                    counseling and devotional contacts was restricted.</p>
            <p>A forward step was taken in the provision of student pastors in the leading churches of the
                    university city, with more or less co-operation among them for common interests.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> The formation of clubs and foundations by the numerically significant sects gave enlarged
                    opportunity for student initiative and direct participation in programs of religious work on and off

                    the Y's or specially constituted co-ordinating organizations brought unity at many points

                    of strong secular trend and a high degree of consciousness by minority groups, from pietistic to
                    atheistic, the foundations and the affiliated schools have proved the most rewarding. The great
                    needs have been to attract devoted scholars both as pastors and teachers who could stimulate
                    interest and provide courses on a truly university level, that would enable students to develop
                    their religious thinking in this as in their other areas of study, and to secure adequate endowments
                    for a project bridging so measurably the gap between church and state functions. With all the
                    limitations under which they have operated, the foundations and religious schools have provided the
                    fullest realization to the present of Jefferson's plan for sectarian participation. As
                    surveys have clearly shown, the provisions for religious training and experience at the average
                    state university compare favorably with those at the church directed or related institutions. As
                    Dean Willard L. Sperry has judiously concluded,<hi rend="sup">41</hi> the traditional antithesis
                    between the pious church college and the secularized state university is, in the modern age, quite
                    unrealistic.</p>
            <p>This tendency toward common attitudes and reactions in religion has been characteristic of the
                    growing uniformity in the realm of higher education. Except for the more doctrinally devoted and

                    higher education in general has come increasingly to have a public interest. Some of the relations
                    mark extensions of early practices. As already noted, land grants and other aid has been given to
                    private colleges by the federal and state governments. For many years state aid for teacher training
                    has provided a welcome nucleus of support. The first state agricultural experiment station was
                    started in a pioneer church college, Wesleyan University, under the direction of an alumnus, Wilbur
                    0. Atwater, who was later to render unique service in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Department of Agriculture. During the world wars men's colleges and some of
                    the women's were enabled to continue their programs by national subvention for the various
                    branches of training and of defense research, and in many of the endowed institutions permanent
                    departments have been established in the different branches of the service, and programs of
                    research, particularly in nuclear studies, continued.</p>
            <p>In a number of cases, most notably in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, state colleges or schools have been located in church-related universities. Not a few
                    moribund academic derelicts, often after trial by several different sects, have eagerly offered
                    themselves to their states. Regionally distributed branch colleges have greatly extended the
                    coverage of state universities. In strategic centers former church colleges have become
                    municipalized, and the newer "community colleges" in order to provide the services
                    desired are being publicly maintained. The wide extension of public junior colleges is bringing
                    large areas of undergraduate instruction under public control and direction.</p>
            <p>The much controverted provosal for federal aid to all accredited institutions of higher learning,
                    with all the possibilities of standardization, is bitterly and indignantly spurned by some who feel
                    that they have attained to a reasonable measure of security. But most boards and presidents, who as
                    the final GI backlog is rolling away look forward to indefinitely increasing deficits, rationalize
                    it as only another essential function of the welfare state. Whatever the feeling about subsidies,
                    all educational interests, like all other service groups, are deeply concerned with the matter of
                    tax exemption and adjustment.</p>
            <p>No less in voluntary association modern academic activities and usages have involved co-operative
                    relationships at many points. Governing bodies have entered into affiliations <pb n="361" id="VAA4025-046-4-019"/> for the interchange of credits and degrees.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
                    Lectureships and professorships have been exchanged. Graduate study by students and staff members
                    has created bonds of common interest between state universities and colleges of the state and
                    region, as has membership in state, regional, and national professional societies. Educational
                    experiments sponsored by national societies and foundations have been carried on jointly by state
                    and private universities and colleges. Key specialists in the universities have had their basic
                    training in church colleges and an increasing number of ecclesiastical dignitaries has been drawn
                    from the alumni of state colleges and universities.</p>
            <p>From the world war era the religious, as well as the social reactions and standards of students of
                    state and of church institutions have been increasingly similar. Neo-ration–alism and
                    skepticism have had the same manifestations.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> No less religious attitudes and
                    activities have followed the same general pattern. State foundations have sent forth their gospel
                    teams and engaged in varied community services. Workers, general and special, have been recruited
                    for the foreign mission field by particular and combined groups. Representatives of the state
                    institutions have joined with their colleagues from the church colleges in student religious
                    movements both denominational and interdenominational and on all levels from local to international.
                    Church college graduates come to the university and state college for advanced technical and
                    professional training while the state college graduates go in increasing numbers to the theological
                    seminaries.</p>
            <p>Such enlightened co-operation arising from a recognition of common conditions and problems, has

            <p>This sketchy survey of an expansive and involved theme illustrates and confirms certain
                    characteristic American attitudes and tendencies in education and religion: the prevalence in the
                    pioneer nation of traditional and customary sanctions over formal legal systems; the popular
                    persistence of authoritarian beliefs, doctrinal and ethical, with a gradual, hardly attained,
                    reasoned tolerance; the peculiar sensitivity and responsiveness of state institutions of higher
                    education to the prevailing public opinion of region, state, and community; and the marked waning,
                    during the past generation, of sectarian influence in education with a corresponding trend toward
                    public provision and direction of higher as well as of elementary and secondary education,<hi rend="sup">45</hi> with all the problems of adjustment,–ideological and social, that
                    the change involves. For while the lessening of sectarian influence has made the older conflict
                    anacronistic, the need and responsibility for religious ministration and instruction remain in
                    magnified extent and complexity.</p>

                    journalism, does not identify the lugubrious young lady, the reader wishes for a modern newsman, who
                    would surely have got her name and address, not to speak of her opinions on a variety of matters,
                    from politics to eternity.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Twain," the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> goes on, "introduced himself,
                    as is his usual custom, with a touching encomium upon his high moral, intellectual and social
                    qualities, being anxious, as he said, ‘to get in all the facts,’ which a
                    stranger might not be able to do, however good his intentions might be." The reporter was
                    amused by the story of the Mexican plug, and he thought the description of Lake Tahoe so fine that
                    it "would have been applauded to the echo if the audience could have suppressed its
                    apprehension that the story would end humorously." Mark Twain had met audiences that
                    mistook his seriousness for humor, but here was one prepared to accept the serious note, yet was
                    fearful of being taken in. As he discovered himself, a humorist has difficulty convincing his
                    listeners that he is in dead earnest.</p>
            <p>How he passed his time in town and how he weathered the reception of the local committee are unknown,
                    since journalists of those days were indifferent to human interest and to minor facts. The size of
                    the audience is not stated, nor are there any interviews, names of committeemen, or any details of
                    how the distinguished guest was entertained before and after the performance. His was merely another
                    talk by one of a continual parade of talkers. Still, the affair apparently went off well, even
                    though <hi rend="i">The People</hi> did enter a mild demurrer in its remark: "It is the
                    decided opinion of all we have heard speak of Mark Twain's lecture that it read better than

                    success. To James Redpath, manager of the lecture bureau, he wrote on January 2: "Had a

                    </placeName> was not unanimous. The <hi rend="i">Pharos</hi> printed a short, perfunctory paragraph
                    about "a large and appreciative audience," which "frequently
                    applauded" a "lecture … well worth the time and money expended by our

                    weazened [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>], as if he had grown up amid the sand and alkali of
                    Nevada."</p>
            <p>Sourly it observed that "no man not insane enough to be a fit candidate for a lunatic
                    as(s)ylum, or who meant to be sarcastic, would dignify the performance by calling it a
                    lecture." Manner and style were "those of a very poor clown," the words
                    "magnificent" and "commonplace" were overworked, and though the
                    audience laughed heartily at first, "in a few moments the laughing was confined to the
                    boys." The habit of pausing after a supposedly witty remark was "very thoughtful

                    lecturer, Mark Twain is a ‘magnificent’ fizzle, or a first-class
                    humbug."</p>
            <p>There was stern reproof for "wit … of a low order, both as to quality and
                    matter," and the Washoe reminiscing was dismissed as "neither moral, elevating or
                    instructive." It was absolutely worthless "to improve and elevate the moral and
                    intellectual tone of society …. Does his picturing of Jack Harris, with his coarse
                    allusions, and his buffoonry [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] benefit the people? If not, then, in the name
                    of society, let us have no more such performances under the auspices of the Christian
                    Associations."</p>
            <p>Evidently that reporter would have felt more at home under a blistering barrage of
                    hell-fire–and-damnation, or being edified by the do-gooder who made a profitable thing
                    out of platform sanctimony and uplift. Apropos of Jack Harris, the only Harris in <hi rend="i">Roughing It</hi> (Chapter XXI) voices no allusions that seem coarse nowadays; either Mark Twain
                    embroidered upon the character, or coarseness was very easily conjured out of thin air in Victorian
                    America, particularly by so self-righteous a critic as this one.</p>
            <p>Mark Twain was never to escape the disapproval of the long-faced gentry, who carped at him all his
                    life, not only because of frivolity and allegedly low moral tone, but also because of heretical
                    views of the human race and of Christianity. A narrowness that condemned <hi rend="i">Tom
                    Sawyer</hi> and <hi rend="i">Huckleberry Finn</hi> as unfit for children was unsparing of heterodoxy
                    and of anything that, measured by the smug requirements of the day, was considered insufficiently
                    "elevating." By 1900 perhaps a reporter might have hesitated to write so damning a
                    review as the <hi rend="i">Sun's</hi>, but in 1872 Mark Twain could and did receive
                    cavalier treatment, for he was still on probation, both in <placeName>

                    some six counties in the south central segment of that state. These counties are located in the only
                    portion of the state which completely escaped glaciation, a consequence of which is that the land is
                    marked by steep hills as well as by relatively flat plains.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> During the last
                    century, the extensively timbered areas in this section of the state attracted many furniture
                    manufacturing companies to the region, and, in addition, lumbering for more general purposes
                    occurred. The sale of this lumber remained a major source of income for the local population for
                    many years, until the depletion of the forest reserves and the shift of many furniture factories to
                    the Southern States forced the farmers to obtain a larger portion of their incomes from crops and
                    livestock. In time, much of the steeply-sloping land was included in the crop rotation. Erosion
                    losses became severe, and ultimately much acreage temporarily devoted to crop production had to be
                    abandoned. Most of the originally rich soil no longer remained, and in some cases even pastures
                    could not be established.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                    (27,557 of a total of 172,907). <hi rend="sup">e</hi> This general pattern may be observed by using
                    many other indices as well: the overwhelming bulk of low soil productivity ratings are found in the
                    south central counties of the state; farms in southern counties in general are in much greater need
                    of liming and other fertilizers than farms in the counties to the north; the average value of farm
                    land and buildings per farm as well as the value of farm products per farm acre and the total net
                    value of taxables are much lower for the counties in the southern portion of the state than for

            <p>The most obvious change in off-farm work days during the period covered has to do with the number of
                    operators working 250 days or more during the year. The number of farmers engaged in nonfarm work of
                    any duration actually dropped slightly from 1939<hi rend="sup">1</hi> to 1944, although in the
                    latter year there were still some 37 more farm operators in the county than in 1934. However, for
                    those who did work off their farms, 62 per cent in 1944 worked 250 days or more, a sharp increase
                    from the 29 per cent in 1939, and a still sharper increase from the 15 per cent in 1934. One might
                    speculate that the effect of the war was to increase the off-farm work year for those <placeName>

                    the war was not to attract additional farmers to non-farm work. In other words, those who had been
                    employed off their farms worked longer; those who had remained on their farms continued to do so.
                    That this pattern may be changing, however, is evidenced by the estimate of the <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>It should be apparent that a very large proportion of the income of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe County</region>
                    </placeName> rural population is derived from nonagricultural sources. Unfortunately, no questions
                    as to the amount of such income have been asked in the recent past at least and no such question
                    included in the current Census of Agriculture. Income breakdowns of this type are not available from
                    the Bureau of Internal Revenue. For state income tax purposes, the farmers must divide their income
                    into two categories: that received from their sole proprietorship (their farms); and that received
                    from salary and/or wage. County breakdowns of this sort, however, have never been published and
                    apparently lie beyond the self-defined functions of the state gross income tax division. It is
                    unlikely that anything short of a complete analysis of the payroll records of local employers over a
                    period of years and thence a breakdown by place of residence of employee would provide any data on
                    the nonagricultural income of the rural population. That is beyond the intended scope of the study.</p>

                        includes, in general, all persons living outside cities and other incorporated places having
                        2,500 inhabitants or more who do not live on farms. The rural-nonfarm population thus comprises

                        section of the country and another, this group is much less uniform in its general composition
                        than either the urban or the rural-farm population. In some States the rural-nonfarm population
                        consists mainly of the inhabitants of small manufacturing villages or of unincorporated suburban

                    important for the local population.</p>
            <p>Another important qualification to the use of census data for 1940 and earlier years results from the

                    the southern terminus of the road was to cause much unnecessary and heated discussion. Governor Ray
                    was especially interested in the project and rightfully insisted on full credit for the necessary
                    grant. Having secured the land from the Indians, his next job was to convince disbelievers of the
                    road's necessity which he undertook in numerous speeches and public statements. The
                    governor's belief that since the road would split the Potawatomi territory their attachment
                    to the land would be weakened was not borne out, and ultimately removal by force became
                        necessary.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> In fact, one observer noted caustically the manner in which the
                    poor Indians were "sucked in" on the arrangement in the false belief that such a
                    road and land grant would be of great benefit to them. The resultant flood of emigrants belied that
                        inference.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>

            <p>Although personal enmity toward the governor jeopardized the land grants, and bitter controversy
                    raged in the General Assembly over location of the southern terminus, operations at the northern end
                    of the road were quickly initiated. By an act of January 24, 1828, three commissioners, John

            <p>Failure to effect greater improvement in the road was largely due to financial difficulties which
                    were met in part by two acts of February 1, 1834, that subjected Michigan Road lands to taxation and
                    also directed county commissioners to accept primary responsibility for the road's upkeep
                    within their jurisdiction.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> Although these acts somewhat alleviated the burden,
                    two additional years were insufficient for sale of the remaining land grants. Maintenance expense
                    continued, however, and provoked the tentative decision to abolish the state commissioner's
                    job by February 20, 1837, and to take action against all uncompleted contracts by September 10,

                    resemble improved German roads. He underestimated his countrymen's hardihood by asserting
                    that sparse population along the road accounted for primitive conditions which few Germans would
                    tolerate. On his return trip lack of inns forced him to take refuge in a vacant, doorless cabin

            <p>In an effort to dispose of unsold lands, including about three hundred practically worthless acres,
                    the legislature lowered the price to sixty-two and a half cents an acre in 1842. Thus, the long
                    struggle for the state's first "super highway" drew to a close. It should
                    be noted, however, that because expenses were paid from land sales the Michigan Road had cost the
                    state nothing. Therefore, it played no part in the financial collapse associated with the 1836

                    Henry Ward Beecher in October, 1845, maintained that no one knew what the ups and downs of life
                    meant until he had traveled north on the road after wheat wagons and rain had done their damage. In
                    some places the broken and punctured wood cross pieces made a dangerous trap for horses'

                    three pieces of square timber laid lengthwise. This made a fair road for one or two years, then it

            <p>In the winter of 1834-1835, Martin M. Post, the Presbyterian missionary there, complained of an
                    outbreak of bilious disorders and high living costs. He blamed Indian traders and adventurers, the
                    rapidity of settlement, the spirit of commercial enterprise, progress of public works, and the
                    laborers thereon for the "deplorable profanation of the Sabbath," which was more

            <p>By the spring of 1836 the north abutment of the <geogName>Eel River</geogName> bridge was under
                    construction, and the town was "thronged with strangers." Ezra Keller, a Lutheran
                    minister touring the Middle West, stopped at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> and was told by a native of <placeName>

                    </placeName> that there were many German Protestants in the latter town, and Keller felt they should
                    be visited. An estimated two thousand people inhabited Logans-port by July, 1837, and it struck
                    George Winter, the English artist, as an "interesting town" soon destined to
                    arrive at considerable importance. Churches, seminaries, and many large brick buildings built and
                    operated by industrious and enterprising merchants and mechanics encouraged the realization of his

                    building, a frame two-story chair and furniture factory, and a small hat factory whose product sold
                    for five dollars.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> Some of the town's early visitors were considerably
                    intrigued by prairie fires, which swept over large areas in the vicinity every fall, and were blamed

                    of 5,480 in 1840, the county's development did not keep pace with the growth of the town.

                    Other claims for settlers' preference were not so apparent, and it was observed in 1829
                    that wet prairie and black oak timber between the <geogName>Kankakee</geogName> and <geogName>Yellow
                        rivers</geogName> contained no land suitable for farming. The soil was pronounced most inferior
                    but this was too hasty a condemnation. Lake Maxinkuckee, over seven miles in circumference and
                    surrounded with rolling land of good quality in the southwest corner of the county, prompted the
                    anticipation that some day the lake would supply a feeder for a canal between the

            <p>James M. Greer, Sr., who came into the county about 1835, noted large numbers of wild deer which
                    frequently raided cornfields at the site of Bourbon. Cattle were often lost in the lowlands and
                    marshes. The practice of raising hogs, an excellent small game supply, and the frequency of ague
                    which sometimes raised the cost of quinine to four dollars an ounce also attracted his attention.<hi rend="sup">46</hi>

                    Nevertheless, an "earnest, enterprising" white population was coming in, and the
                    Methodist church was reorganized there in 1843. On Thanksgiving Day, 1844, a rude building was first
                    used exclusively for worship purposes, and the same year a log meetinghouse was begun in the woods
                    east of town.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>

            <p>It did achieve temporary prominence with various stores, a school, church, and postoffice serving the

                    within ten days, but Crocker sold out the next year. The business was gradually abandoned, and the

                    first court session held there in 1833. Its courthouse was a one-and–a-half story,
                    hewed-log structure with the legal chamber at one end, a tavern at the other, a grocery or saloon in
                    the middle, and sleeping rooms over all. The court room, with a floor of un-planed boards supported
                    by trestles, contained a bench three or four feet high below which the accused and the jurors sat on
                    opposite sides of a long table. The trial of the brief docket was noteworthy only for the
                    prosecutor's abominable English. About ten haphazardly constructed dwellings were ranged

            <p>Word of the new settlement was not sufficiently widespread in June, 1833, to attract Flavel Bascom, a
                    roving minister who had heard rumors of the new settlement on Door Prairie. He claimed to have found
                    only an unfinished cabin, and went on several miles to a hospitable farmer's home. Patrick
                    Shirreff, an Englishman sojourning in America the same year, expressed a more favorable opinion
                    while traveling in a four-horse open wagon from <placeName>

                    obtained shelter for the night at Clavering's Tavern, a crude log building with two
                    apartments, one of which contained five beds and nine travelers. The other was equally crowded. Next
                    morning his party breakfasted on flap cakes, bacon, potatoes, and bread at a cabin on the muddy road

            <p>Terre Coupée and Rolling prairies made up for the difficulties George David experienced
                    crossing the wet prairie in October, 1833. The English visitor stayed at Well's door less

                    deep and water often standing on both sides of the road conveyed the impression that the bottom had
                    fallen out. It was only universal hospitality in the opinion of some settlers that compensated for

            <p>After more than a year of endeavor, a small crowded place of worship and uncomfortable dwellings

                    who felt that ministers should labor as other men. The successful regulation of

                    high, however, because of the influx of newcomers. Wholesale produce prices in the county in

            <p>Of all the flora which the prairies supported, beds of strawberries were the most unusual to many
                    travelers, and expanses of rolling lands in the summer of 1841 recalled the earlier comparison to an
                    immense, beautiful lake of land extending as far as the eye could reach. Later that summer the fine
                    dry roads were again praised. Wheat was marketed at sixty-eight cents a bushel, and corn and
                    potatoes were very favorable. The oats crop, however, suffered from drought. It was an excellent
                    season for hay and grain, and hardly a trace remained of the almost universal wheat blight of 1840.
                    A new type thrasher that scattered the straw over the ground, blew out the chaff, and collected the

            <p>Three months after the town was incorporated on February 8, 1836, one vessel was noticed unloading in
                    the harbor. Other signs of progress were a recent sale of lots north of the creek that grossed forty
                    thousand dollars and the construction of from fifty to seventy new buildings. Strangers crowded the
                    town in June, and it had become quite a produce center, particularly for pork and wheat. Farmers

                    town, she found numerous stores and houses in various stages of construction scattered about in the
                    woods, although small swamps and stump-littered streets were objectionable. Residents believed that
                    the beautiful location surrounded by the lake and forests would soon be enhanced by two piers to be
                    built into the harbor. A sandy hill covered with pea vines near the town afforded an excellent view
                    of the lake. The white surf of its tumultuous waters pounded against the shore, and those
                    unaccustomed to large bodies of water were nearly stunned by its "perpetual roar."
                    The inn served a good supper of pork, bread, potatoes, preserves, and tea, but its unplastered walls
                    necessitated screening off the thirty bedchambers. Before retiring, however, the English guest

                    foreshadowed the crowning beauty, a sunset over the lake. These gradually became urn-shaped, then
                    assumed the form of a glistening golden acorn which soon gave way to a magnification of Saturn and
                    its rings. Finally, the sinking shaft of a golden pillar left only "a lustrous, deep

            <p>Doubt was expressed a year later whether the town built among the sand hills could exist were it not

                    however, especially since all manner of game was common around the town. In 1849 three deer skins
                    and seven minks sold for one hundred dollars, while fox hides brought two dollars and fifty cents in
                    addition to the five dollar bounty. In 1857 deer were hunted over the frozen sand hills near the
                    town, and also in canoes at night. The light from small fires in the bow of the boat reflected in
                    the animals' eyes and made them perfect targets.<hi rend="sup">85</hi>

                    his attention. He climbed one bluff on his hands and knees over a mixture of snow and sand, but his

                    was added to previous descriptions of the town when Isabella Trotter, an English gentlewoman, came
                    upon the "very remarkable spot" and compared the high dunes to those on the French
                    coast. Both were composed of deep, loose sand covered with a solid crust bound together by little

            <p>Even the most cursory examination of the five counties of northern Indiana served by the Michigan
                    Road supports the conclusion that something more than the road, important though it was, was
                    necessary for the greatest development of those areas. In fact, it would be oversimplification to
                    attribute their growth solely to the road. <placeName>

                    </placeName>, particularly the latter, lagged far behind the other three in population by 1860.
                    Since those three—Cass, <placeName>

                    </placeName>—were served by other important means of transportation, undoubtedly such
                    additional facilities at least partly accounted for their greater progress.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName> had become an important station for at least eight railroad lines. As the Michigan Road
                    declined in importance, these other facilities supplied the deficiency and carried the county to new
                    heights. The importance of the <geogName>St. Joseph River</geogName> to <placeName>

                    important east-west roads. Finally, <placeName>

                    harbor on <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName>. Although the town did not fulfill its
                    supporters' expectations in the latter respect, the very prospects for leadership served as
                    a spur to early emigration. Moreover, <placeName>

                        trappers of William Ashley's Rocky Mountain Fur Company, until 1840, <geogName>Green

                                            Bay Company. The majority who took the regular Fort Hall route then followed
                                            down the south bank of the Snake River, crossing Port Neuf, Bannock, Fall,

                                            of the opinion that this "cut-off," like most of the
                                            others, was an illusion, saving few miles and, while it saved some river
                                            crossings, it was otherwise over much tougher terrain. To judge from
                                            Farnham's statement, the cut-off was opened up just before his

                        <p>This morning for 10 miles had a good road through a hilly country and perfectly free
                                    from dust that had been layed by yesterdays rains Our cattle too seemed to look

                        <p>We commenced at 6 O C Our winding way over hills and through mountain gaps There was
                                    a fine field of grass along here and wild wheat grew brest high There was a good

                                    one mile came to large [spring] 120 yds in circumference it had a fine gravil bottom
                                    This afternoon after leaving the spring traviled up a kind of canyon in 7 m the top
                                    this kanyon was just wide enough for a waggon &amp; no more It was high time to

                                            crossed over to Humboldt Wells, near present Wells, Nevada, to pause there
                                            before undertaking the ordeal of Humboldt River. For all of its stingy and
                                            fetid water, its rockiness, choking dust, skulking Ute and Diggers, and
                                            rotted carcasses, this was the lifeline to <placeName>

                                            a vain effort to find a smooth grade. At times it cut across stretches of
                                            outright desert. Over half of the animals were lost on the Humboldt stretch,
                                            either run off by the natives or collapsed from exhaustion. The Humboldt,
                                            named by Frémont for the famous German traveler, was originally
                                            called Mary's River, so-named for the wife of the Hudson's
                                            Bay trader, Peter Skene Ogden. The old Trail along the Humboldt is roughly
                                            followed by the present U.S. Highway 30.</item>

                                    laying by on account of the indians having Stole their Cattle last night some of the
                                    Company had chased the Indians into the mountains but the Indians kept them at bay
                                    by roling rocks down onto them from the peaks The indians commit a great

                                    to the right this we took This was 13 m to the river again from acounts this was the
                                    best road not so sandy as the other two our only hard place was going up a sand hill
                                    from the river bottom Our cattle had nothing to eat this night but willows and

                        <p>Started early traveld until 11 O.C. A.M. and having went 7 m remained here until 1 0.
                                    c P M to let our cattle fill themselves all they could they had to do on Willow
                                    &amp; bulrushes Now we took the dessert road We went 14 m and stoped to take
                                    supper after one hours stop again went on The mountains which in the last rays of
                                    the sun on yesterdays afternoon looked like a blue cloud to our front now had the
                                    same indistinct aperence to our rear The night was warm and comfortable</p>
                        <p>At 10 O.C. on the morning of the 22 We stopped to take our breakfast at this place
                                    was wells dug in the white clay but we were unable to get water either for ourselves
                                    or cattle one or two crackers a handful of beans and a coupple swallows of water had
                                    to do us for breakfast &amp; dinner &amp; supper which we took at one
                                    sitting Started on after two hours rest and kept on a continual move untill 7 O. C.
                                    at night here we terminated our desert march by coming to a hot spring as large as a
                                    good sised lake anothere was obnoxious Sulfurick smell that came from it Yet we had
                                    got over safe we suffered a little for water but not as much as we might if some had
                                    [not] rode ahead and fetched [some] back for the rest There was some on the deasert
                                    of whom it looked like a hard sight that they would get over. This is a hard place
                                    on cattle it makes them give out fast There was one train had the forth of their
                                    cattle give in going up one hill so that they had to leave them and in the latter
                                    part of the road when sandy the cattle were given out to a surprising rate some of
                                    the first left were dead the others generally had about enough life to turn up their
                                    heads to look at us as we <pb n="415" id="VAA4025-046-4-073"/> passed Thus they were
                                    in every direction Thus finished our desert journey of about 60 m here our cattle
                                    got drink but no grass</p>

                                    roads that led over this ridge into the Kanyon The right hand road was so hard to
                                    assend that the teams had to double the left was [easier] to assend by [but] bad to

                        indefinite mileage figures, it is very difficult to trace Farnham's route with
                        exactness through <placeName>

                        train's captain decided to follow the above-noted <placeName>

                        main Trail dropped south from the vicinity of present Humboldt, Nevada, following the course of
                        the <geogName>Humboldt River</geogName> to the Sink, thence crossing the hottest part of the
                        desert to the head of the Truckee and Carson Rivers for a direct approach to Sutter's
                        Fort (<placeName>

                        west from the Meadows, across some more scorching desert and the Sierra. Farnham's
                        "Dry Lake" and "Goose Lake" seem to be identifiable with the
                        more commonly known <geogName>Mud Lake</geogName> and <geogName>Honey Lake</geogName>, the

                        the north of Lassen Peak, and had wandered off the Trail. As the entry of September 11 proves,
                        the Farnham train, following in the tracks of the train led by Myers, the same who blazed the

                                    have been thinking themselves near through to the Settlements for some time when we
                                    left the Humbolt only two days less than a month ago We expected to reach Fether
                                    river in going 150 m We relied in a One sur [Mister?] Mires who said this could be
                                    done he was an old trapper in these mountains he had in his previous life been on 4
                                    different excurtions a trapping for game in these mountains We thought that he knew
                                    all he pretended to know &amp; could do all the pretended he could do With this
                                    though [t] &amp; with the confidence We had in him that he knew the road as well
                                    as any old teamster of the States knows the pike we followed He with his train had
                                    also guided us once before in a cut off between ft Hale [Hall] &amp; the Salt
                                    lake That time he found us a good road much better than we had expected to find it
                                    and it was so much Shorter than the other ways that we were much pleased with
                                    ourselves in going it We beat by two days teams that took other tracks we expected
                                    to find like advantages here Now we have travild over 4 hundred miles since leaving
                                    the Humbolt A great many are talking about what they will do when they will get into
                                    the Settlements to morrow they are shure to do it They think they already have gone
                                    further than they would have had to in any other <pb n="418" id="VAA4025-046-4-076"/> rout to get to a Callifornia settlement to have went to the feather river we
                                    should have turned off by the mud lakes To our left and have drove over thier beds
                                    which these Pioneers or guids expected to find dry like that of the bed of the dry
                                    lake that we travild over a good deal before get- ting to the mountains We could not
                                    do it for then they were said to be to high so After the failure we had to take this
                                    round a bout way This was trying even to the patient to have to travil so far after
                                    imaging themselves to be near in and a great many had harbourd hard thoughts against
                                    Mirer although they were not solicited by him to take this road nor did he himself
                                    prais it up to anybody When he took it he did not encourage any but the special
                                    train that he was guiding through to follow him Yet he took the road himself he was
                                    guiding a train of about 70 waggons there were more Women and Children in it than in
                                    any other train Folks New that he took this they supposed that when he took it to
                                    better himself they supposed that if he could better himself They could stand the
                                    same chance They counted their risks to run as small as his if a train with women
                                    &amp; children could get through they supposed a trane of men of course could</p>
                        <p>With this kind of reasoning they were sufficiently prompted to follow in his track
                                    over this untroden wild We all at this stage of the journey get very anxious to get
                                    out of these wild And to one that had been here as often as he was said to be they
                                    gave thier dependence The confidence that they placed in him the great Deasert
                                    God—as some called him as if he were superhuman The most of the trains
                                    were getting hard run for provision and when we were in a good camp we could not
                                    make ourselves comfortable for this thing was wanting Sume were not entirely out of
                                    all but of some essencial portion Our beef had run out and we were again without
                                    meat We had bread &amp; we had coffee There Were some especily packers that had
                                    nothing of no kind such those that had had to help while they scrimped themselves
                                    But what matterd these things now For to morrow shure every one thought &amp;
                                    said We will be into Lawsons<hi rend="sup">23</hi> There we can certainly get all

            <p>This volume is the best history of the Confederate States; as a matter of fact, it is the only
                    history that covers the many aspects of the efforts of the eleven states to establish their
                    independence. All previous works have been heavily weighted in favor of military campaigns; Coulter
                    has relegated that topic to one ably-written forty-page chapter. Perhaps, he has overly
                    de-emphasized this phase, but in the final analysis he has helped to put military activities in the
                    proper perspective. In justification of his apportionment, he points out that his work is a history
                    of the <hi rend="i">South</hi> and not of the <hi rend="i">war</hi> principally, but indicates that
                    since there was little not related to the war, "in these pages where the war is not, its
                    shadows fall."</p>
            <p>This is a true history of the Confederate States in that it tells how the nation came into being;
                    what forces directed it; how it functioned; and, when it went to war, how it managed the many
                    domestic problems attendant to the conflict; how the purely military matters were directed or
                    misdirected; what the people did during the struggle; and what factors were most important in the
                    failure of the nation to achieve its objective.</p>
            <p>In examining the birth of the nation, Coulter probes into the many probable causes that have been
                    advanced and concludes that although slavery was undoubtedly a potent factor, "more
                    powerful than slavery was the Negro himself." After this acceptance of Phillips'
                    "central theme of Southern history," the author says that it was "what
                    lay back of the institution of slavery and was made possible by it which mattered most to
                    Southerners—not simply the money value of slaves" (p. 11). What was made
                    possible by the institution in this instance was the conservative way of life which the Southerners
                    desired to protect against the "infiltration of Northern radicalism."
                    Consolidation and concentration of government were more dreaded than disunion, and the revolt <pb n="422" id="VAA4025-046-4-080"/> of conservatism against the modernism of the North was the
                    "normal reaction of an isolated landed civilization against the world currents of trade and
                    industry" (p. 13). The South felt that equality and safety were no longer available in the
                    Union, so she withdrew from those who seemed to delight in insulting her and celebrated this
                    withdrawal as if a burden had been lifted. Coulter feels that secession was a counterrevolution
                    rather than a revolution (p. 25), though later statements (i.e., p. 113) seem to modify his earlier
                    conclusion. Whatever the war or the movement might be called, the discussion of the background of
                    the Confederacy is clear, mature, and levelheaded.</p>
            <p>It is interesting to note, as Coulter carefully points out, that the individuals who had been so
                    prominent in fanning the flames of secession—such men as Rhett, Ruff in, and
                    Yancey—received no position of prominence in the new government, and though not happy
                    about this they were not the greatest of the troublemakers. Davis and Stephens are depicted as men
                    highly in keeping with the conservative nature of the Southern movement. The failure to submit the
                    constitution to the vote of the people caused some dissatisfaction, but this is not considered a
                    deliberate denial of the democratic processes: it was a necessary political expedient in order to
                    face Lincoln on his inauguration with an established and functioning government. No simple answer is
                    found to Lincoln's role in the Fort Sumter affair, but the conclusion is reached that
                    between the election of November, 1860, and the firing on Fort Sumter Lincoln showed "less
                    understanding of conditions in the South and gave less evidence of broad statesmanship than was ever
                    again to characterize him" (p. 35).</p>
            <p>The South neither wanted nor expected war; the few who desired conflict were not given positions in
                    the government. The South was cognizant of the disparity between its resources and those of the rest
                    of the Union, but were not its manpower, its area, its trade, and its potential greater than those
                    of many of the more important nations? There was, then, an early wave of optimism and a high morale
                    during the first days of the new nation. Morale is termed the "most potent weapon"
                    the South had, but it began to sag in 1862, rumors took a toll, and
                    propaganda—uncoordinated as it was —could not sustain it; the South
                    "lost this weapon, and, therefore, the war" (p. 83).</p>
            <pb n="423" id="VAA4025-046-4-081"/>
            <p>The analysis of the government of the Confederate States is penetrating and critical. He points out
                    that Davis tried to attend to too many details of administration, that he was not the type of person
                    who could become a hero no matter how much he might be respected, that he had high ideals of office,
                    and that no detail was too small to bring an attack by such powerful opponents as Toombs, Brown,
                    Vance, Stephens, or by less important individuals or newspapers. Whatever weaknesses Davis
                    had—and they were numerous—when he is compared with the other men during the
                    course of the struggle, he "showed fewer … than any other" (p. 113).
                    Also, while the Confederate Congress was disappointing in not maintaining the standards of
                    statesmanship expected of it, much of the criticism was unreasoning and unwarranted. The military
                    drew away much of the glory from the civilian agencies, and the Congress showed much boldness of
                    imagination in handling unprecedented problems. One is struck by the vivid portrayal of the details
                    of bureaucracy and the realization that the printing of stamps could cause as many or more headaches
                    than the transformation of the Federal postal system into a Confederate one.</p>
            <p>In his analysis of the policies of the Confederate States, Coulter follows a conclusion of the late
                    Dr. Ramsdell that one of the most fundamental causes of the ultimate failure of the Confederacy was
                    its "unwise financial policy." He does feel, though, that Memminger's
                    plans for bonds, paper money, and taxes might have been made to work, but the Congress chose the
                    easy way out by paying the debts in paper currency and bonds with no early comprehensive tax
                    program. Coulter concludes, however, that it would have made no difference even if the money had
                    been based on gold or cotton for it would have become worthless with defeat and that it was lack of
                    faith or confidence in the ability of the government— among other factors—that
                    affected the value of the money. It is worth noting that the comprehensive tax bill of April, 1863,
                    contained many of the roots of the future tax structure of this country.</p>
            <p>The diplomatic affairs of the new nation are admirably summarized, care being taken to emphasize that
                    if the English and the French could be won over to recognition the attitude of the other nations
                    made no difference. In this section there is one point open to serious debate: was the English <pb n="424" id="VAA4025-046-4-082"/> recognition of belligerency of the Confederacy of more benefit
                    to the North than to the South because the North thereby gained the legal right to institute a
                    blockade? The chronological order of the blockade and the recognition of belligerency, plus the fact
                    that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> government did nearly everything that she had protested as wrong in the years preceding
                    the War of 1812, indicates that expediency quickly overcame any qualms concerning mere legality.</p>
            <p>The discussions of the problems of building an army and supplying that army are superior to those
                    found in many much more detailed works. Among the topics treated are manufactories; prices, profits,
                    and labor; agriculture, subsistence, and Negroes; raising troops; trade, blockade-running, and the
                    navy; and transportation and communication. The various problems encountered are pointed up; the
                    achievements and shortcomings are analyzed; and the dissensions created (summarized in a later
                    chapter) are noted. The reviewer wishes to raise a question in regard to two quotations from one of
                    these chapters: "Had secession taken place in 1850, when the railroads in both sections
                    were more nearly equal strategically, the South might well have established its
                    independence" (p. 269) and "Had the railroads been efficient enough and had Lee
                    possessed bold vision, part of his army in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> could have been sent to the relief of Vicksburg and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> campaign would have been averted" (p. 281). This is pyramiding the nonexistent
                    and the improbable into the unprovable.</p>
            <p>The chapter on internal dissensions emphasizes the significance of state-rights dogma and
                    personalities and the absence of a single goal or objective on the part of the great body of the
                    southern population. What they were seeking was not only not clear to many of the civilians, but
                    "Just what the Confederate soldier was fighting for stood out little more clearly in his
                    mind than what most soldiers fight for in any war" (p. 449). In other chapters desertion,
                    straggling, poor discipline, war heroism, decadence, "bread riots," bickering,
                    gambling, drinking, prisoners and prison camps, aid associations, monotony, <hi rend="i">ennui</hi>,
                    disease, the specter of hunger and nakedness, and the Confederate Kilroy (‘Bolivar
                    Ward") all come in for well-proportioned attention.</p>
            <p>Of especial interest to many readers—because of the relative scarcity of monographic
                    studies—will be the chapters <pb n="425" id="VAA4025-046-4-083"/> on fine arts and the
                    press and on literary activities, education, and religion. In the latter chapter the author shows
                    how war seeped into, corroded, and captured the soul of the writing Southerners, making them turn
                    their literary efforts to the support of the war. It was unthinkable that anyone who did not support
                    "the cause" should be allowed to teach, but, try as they may, the Southerners were
                    never able to convert education or religion to fanatical—or even
                    powerful—morale purposes.</p>
            <p>The book is well balanced in the space devoted to the several topics, and the author seems to have
                    used just about everything that has ever been published on or about the Confederacy as well as a
                    number of manuscript collections. From the latter and from the newspapers he has drawn many of his
                    aptly-chosen quotations. His easy and flowing style, punctuated with his humor, adds to the
                    attractiveness of the volume. This sense of humor, however, does not seem to extend to Alexander
                    Stephens who might be criticized a bit too harshly. Again, the author appears a little too critical
                    of the refusal of Davis to accept peace and Union at Hampton Roads in 1865.</p>
            <p>There is something of a temporary unbalance in the treatment of the causes of the defeat of the
                    Confederacy; when factors—or forces—such as money or conscription are
                    discussed, each appears to have been the basic or underlying cause of the fall of the new
                    government. But almost at the end these factors are tied together with the statement that the
                    "forces leading to defeat were many but they may be summed up in this one fact: The people
                    did not will hard enough and long enough to win" (p. 566). This will was strong in the
                    beginning, but ruinous inflation, dissensions and fractionalism, conscription, and other forces
                    caused it to wither and die. Just as the reader is prepared to say that one cannot win wars, or even
                    battles, on will alone, Coulter says "But, of course, if enemy morale always exceeded what
                    the Confederates could have mustered, then defeat was always inevitable; but there are reasons to
                    believe that the Confederacy had within its being the potentialities of a stronger and more
                    persistent will to win independence than the Federals had to save the Union. It is easy to argue in
                    circles as to why the Confederacy did not win" (p. 567). He does not seem to deplore the
                    failure of the Confederacy to capitalize on its potentialities; <pb n="426" id="VAA4025-046-4-084"/>
                    nor does he pursue the circular argument.</p>

            <p>In this compact and well-organized book, Professor Schultz has re-examined the slavery question in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> during the 1850's. His thesis, boiled down to its least common denominator, is
                    this: <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> politicians and statesmen were afraid of the abolitionists as a political force in
                    national politics and preferred secession to domination by a federal government controlled by
                    antislavery men. And by 1860, South Carolinians were rather certain that the anti-slavery group was
                    going to control the North and that there was no longer any hope of maintaining friends or allies in
                    the northern section. In support of this theory the Carolina leaders cited the Brooks assault, the
                    nomination of Buchanan instead of Pierce, the slim margin of victory enjoyed by the Democrats in the
                    election of 1856, the growing strength of the Republican party in Congress, the unreliable
                    friendship of northern democratic leaders such as Douglas, Seward's "irrepressible
                    conflict" speech of 1858, and finally John Brown's raid at Harper's
                    Ferry. They also declared that Helper's <hi rend="i">The Impending Crisis of the South</hi>
                    was the beginning of a dangerous propaganda movement instigated by antislavery leaders in an attempt
                    to array southern nonslaveholders against slaveholders. Consequently, throughout the decade of the
                    fifties when there was a strong nationalistic feeling in the other Southern States, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in thought, in speech, and in political action, manifested a strong disunion opinion.</p>
            <p>The idea that secession was caused by the slavery issue <pb n="427" id="VAA4025-046-4-085"/> is of
                    course, not new. As a matter of fact, this theory was elaborately developed by James Ford Rhodes
                    decades ago and has been more or less undermined by recent historical scholarship; at least, the new
                    school of thought entertains the idea that slavery was only one of several factors that caused
                    secession. Professor Schultz, in his well-documented study, brings us around the circle again to a
                    serious consideration of the antislavery crusade as the major factor in creating the crisis that
                    exploded into civil war. With respect to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> in particular, this book will become an interesting and challenging companion volume to

                            <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>

                    </placeName>'s desire for economic independence as a major cause of secession.</p>
            <p>In addition to bringing us fresh variations on the old theme of slavery, Professor Schultz presents
                    short but vivid accounts of some of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> leaders including the well-known fire-eater Rhett and the more judicious party man,
                    James L. Orr. Other highlights in the book include a dramatic description of the Brooks-Sumner
                    affair, a realistic and informative account of the role of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> was anything but popular among the Southern States after 1850. Some readers, too, may
                    be surprised to find that the versatile liberal sinner, Thomas Cooper of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> College, was a pioneer advocate of nullification although W. S. Jenkins in 1935 and
                    Clement Eaton more recently pointed out this fact.</p>
            <p>The bibliography lists manuscript sources, about thirty newspaper files, and published materials
                    including state documents, diaries, periodical essays, biographies, and monographs. The critical
                    bibliophile will note a few titles that perhaps should have been included. For example, Clement
                    Eaton's <hi rend="i">Freedom of Thought in the Old South</hi> is suggestive for background
                    purposes, and the studies of the Frank Owsley school of thought might have stimulated a greater
                    interest in what the common people of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> were thinking and doing about the problem of slavery. This, however, is a matter of
                    opinion.</p>

            <p>The Forty-eighters were "the group of German idealists who fought to establish a liberal and
                    unified <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>

                    </placeName> as refugees from the reaction" (p. vii). Throughout this volume the term
                    Forty-eighter refers to "one who came to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> from German-speaking territory as a result of his participation in the Revolution of
                    1848" (p. ix). Many who emigrated for economic reasons or political refugees of an earlier
                    date have been excluded.</p>
            <p>Eleven scholars pooled their knowledge and research to produce <hi rend="i">The Forty-eighters</hi>.
                    The "Preface" and "Biographical Dictionary of the
                    Forty-eighters," which contains 317 names, represent the contribution of A. E. Zucker.
                    Scholars will welcome the compilation of so many sketches of Forty-eighters in one book each of
                    which "deals with an uprooted life, with all the hardships and handicaps that such a career
                    entails" (p. 269).</p>
            <p>Arthur D. Graeff supplied the introduction, which is followed by information on the authors.</p>
            <p>The first chapter, "The European Background," by Carl J. Friedrich emphasizes
                    "the broad ideological and cultural elements" rather than specific events which
                    took place on the continent in 1848.</p>
            <p>In the next chapter, "The American Scene" by Oscar Handlin, the fact is stressed
                    that the newcomers were considered as an asset in the development of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Furthermore, in this country, there was a place reserved for refugees who had fled
                    from political oppression.</p>
            <p>Hildegard Binder Johnson in her chapter on the "Adjustment to the <placeName>

                    in one of the American ports. In most instances he was young, and a glance at his delicate hands
                    signified that he had not been subjected to physical labor. While some of this number were poets who
                    enjoyed the freedom of America, they also became victims of <hi rend="i">Heimweh</hi> which is
                    reflected in their lines. Nevertheless, <pb n="429" id="VAA4025-046-4-087"/> the westward movement
                    made an indelible impression upon the Forty-eighters many of whom settled in the Middle West. While
                    Milwaukee was the choice of a large number, those who located in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> played a more important role in politics. For approximately one generation the
                    Forty-eighters controlled the German life of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Davenport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>. Other areas could be mentioned in which these German political refugees of 1848 became
                    prominent. No mention is made of Indiana, although quite a few Germans who were victims of the
                    disturbance in Europe in 1848 settled in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. They made their mark in the field of journalism and in the <hi rend="i">Turnverein</hi>.</p>
            <p>Throughout the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> where there was a German settlement, as a rule a <hi rend="i">Turnverein</hi> also came
                    into existence. So one would expect to find a chapter on the <hi rend="i">Turner</hi> movement in
                        <hi rend="i">The Forty-eighters</hi>. Augustus J. Prahl was responsible for this section of the
                    book and in addition to a brief history of this organization has included a number of typical <hi rend="i">Turner</hi> poems.</p>
            <p>In view of the fact that the Forty-eighters were particularly interested in politics, a chapter on
                    this phase was written by Lawrence S. Thompson and Frank X. Braun. At the same time that the
                    Know-Nothing movement became prominent, many Forty-eighters assumed political and intellectual
                    leadership of the German masses. As a result some of the most radical groups of the day developed.
                    The term "radical," however, cannot be justly applied to the majority of the
                    Forty-eighters since they were a heterogeneous group.</p>
            <p>The only woman listed among the Forty-eighters, Mathilde Franziska Giesler Anneke, was a suffragist.
                    An unhappy marriage at the age of nineteen, a divorce the following year, and difficulties
                    encountered in her struggle to obtain the custody of her child made her an advocate of
                    women's rights. To promote her cause, she edited the <hi rend="i">Frauenzeitung</hi> in
                    Cologne until 1848 when it was suppressed. A year later she came to America and settled in
                    Milwaukee. Here again she pursued her journalistic talents for three years until she was forced to
                    leave that city, whereupon she took up residence in the East and continued in her chosen field.
                    Finally ill health forced her to withdraw from journalism, but she continued to campaign for
                    women's rights until her death in 1884.</p>
            <p>Because of the very liberal views of some of the Forty-eighters, <pb n="430" id="VAA4025-046-4-088"/>
                    they were referred to as radicals. A chapter, therefore, on this group by Eitel W. Dobert serves as
                    an important link in the chain of this book. "The radical Forty-eighters were not always
                    comfortable company" (p. 157). Many were tactless, impractical, and impatient. Dobert
                    claims that "radicals are born, not made. An unwillingness to follow the well-trodden path,
                    a very sensitive social conscience, the feeling of a personal responsibility for the world about, an
                    urge to reform—all these go into the making of a radical" (pp. 158-159). Some of
                    the more outstanding men who fall in the above-mentioned category furnish the bulk of the material
                    for this chapter.</p>
            <p>There is no question about the fact that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> during the days of the Civil War was greatly aided by the addition of the
                    Forty-eighters. A chapter on their contribution is ably treated by Ella Lonn. Of particular interest
                    to Hoosiers is the part August Willich, who commanded the Thirty-second Regiment Indiana Volunteers
                    (or first Indiana German regiment), took in this great strife. He was later succeeded by Heinrich
                    von Trebra. The Indiana regiment was commanded in the German language and each company was provided
                    with a book in which the orders of the colonel or superior officer were written in German.</p>
            <p>The Forty-eighters were also prominent in the field of special services as physicians and chaplains
                    during the Civil War. Among the latter were many freethinkers. Journalists were also associated with
                    the army, and one of the best known of the war reporters was Otto von Corwin.</p>
            <p>Miss Lonn concludes her chapter by stating that, "The value of the presence of the
                    Forty-eighters in the Union army was threefold: first, their help in winning the war; second, the
                    reaction on the Forty-eighters themselves; third, the advantage to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in appreciable assimilation of a hitherto critical group" (p. 217).</p>
            <p>Probably no Forty-eighter was better known or more closely touched the lives of the rank and file
                    throughout the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> than Carl Schurz. The last chapter of the book, therefore, has been devoted to a sketch
                    of this popular leader by Bayard Quincy Morgan. "Schurz was a true German-American, with a
                    double loyalty but not a divided one, a citizen whose foreign birth was not a detriment to his
                    Americanism but an asset to it" (p. 249).</p>
            <pb n="431" id="VAA4025-046-4-089"/>
            <p>While this is a very good book, a definitive work on the Forty-eighters still remains to be written.
                    There are few typographical errors, but the spelling of one man's name varies. On pages 46,
                    65, 69, 144, 151, and 323, it appears as Theodor Olshausen, and on pages 63, 75, and 370 as Theodor
                    Ohlshausen.</p>
            <p>The Carl Schurz Foundation is to be congratulated for making possible the publication of this volume.
                    Scholars interested in German immigration will want to add it to their library.</p>

            <p>This book includes approximately 126 pages of facsimile reproductions of newspapers, principally <placeName>

                    press and the general historical commentary is told in around one hundred pages. There is the usual
                    preface, foreword and introduction, a page concerning the facsimiles, a comprehensive table of
                    contents, but no index. Five pages offer an explanatory note and then list "<placeName>

                    "in an attempt to bring historical source material relating to <placeName>

                    </placeName> story" (p. 9). The specialist in the history of <placeName>

                    </placeName> and the American Middle West will also find the volume interesting and helpful;
                    however, Wheeler makes it clear that it "is not intended to be a history of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Journalism nor of early newspapers in general; rather it represents a compilation or
                    collection of newspapers, reflecting some of the important periods and events in the history of the
                    state" (p. 19).</p>
            <p>The use of facsimile reproductions is the most useful feature of the volume. Fortunately the pages
                    are almost twelve by eighteen inches so that the newspaper columns can be <pb n="432" id="VAA4025-046-4-090"/> read without too much difficulty. Perhaps the historical commentary
                    could have been reduced by one-half and the space saved more profitably have been given to the
                    evolution of newspaper style, news-gathering agencies, news staffs, along with further consideration
                    of problems arising from finance, circulation, political connections, and advertising. Possibly
                    relatively more attention should have been given to social and cultural history. The agricultural
                    press is not represented and cultural trends and institutions are not adequately portrayed. The
                    compiler indicates some difficulties in regard to the list of "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>'s Living Newspapers," where the founding dates are given for papers
                    which have survived to the present. Any who have attempted to compile such a list will probably
                    assume that the dates are merely approximate in many instances.</p>
            <p>The facsimiles concerning colonial and early western papers are exceedingly valuable as background
                    for the press of various western states, including Indiana. As one turns the pages of the newspapers
                    included in this volume, the atmosphere and contemporary slant concerning many episodes and trends
                    of national and Middle Western history becomes apparent. The reader is reminded that <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> was an important springboard for the early beachheads of civilization in the old
                    Northwest; he relives the days of Indian warfare and captivity; he realizes the speed and great
                    quantity of news concerning foreign affairs available today in contrast to the briefer accounts of
                    news about Napoleon which at times appeared about two months after it happened; he is startled to
                    find Americans offering bounties for Indian scalps (p. 75); and he wonders what pioneer papers would
                    have done without ads regarding patent medicines. Then comes the Civil War and one realizes that the
                    tragedy of war is perhaps better revealed in the press than in any other single source. Later pages
                    tell of the coming of gas, steel, and oil; all these reflect the impact of an evolving manufacturing
                    system.</p>

            <p>The <geogName>Rainy River</geogName> country has been historically of more significance to Canadian
                    than to American development. This is natural enough. <geogName>Rainy River</geogName> and
                        <geogName>Rainy Lake</geogName> were all part of the great east-west water highway which
                    extended from the Gulf of St. Lawrence, through the <geogName>Great Lakes</geogName>,
                        <geogName>Rainy River</geogName> country, <geogName>Lake Winnipeg</geogName> and
                        <geogName>Saskatchewan river</geogName> systems to the Rocky Mountains, along which the Canadian
                    trade has moved since the days of Jacques de Noyon. When the fur trade yielded place to lumbering
                    and then to mining, the <pb n="434" id="VAA4025-046-4-092"/> first lumberjacks and first miners
                    began their extractive industries on the Canadian side of the boundary line. It is not without
                    significance that Fort Frances preceded International Falls by many generations. It was, in fact,
                    not until the opening years of the twentieth century that the era of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> activity in this region began.</p>
            <p>Dr. Nute is well aware of this fact and she would appear to be happier when writing about
                    "the pines, caribou and Indians of McLoughlin's day" than when dealing
                    with "the grasslands, farms and industrialized cities of 1950 in the <geogName>Rainy
                    River</geogName> country." Nevertheless every chapter of her slender volume is most
                    readable. Her restraint when dealing with the story of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                    </placeName> Historical Society, is much to be commended.</p>
            <p>There is no point in criticizing this book as a contribution to historical knowledge. Dr. Nute has
                    not intended that it should be looked upon as a profound piece of work. Its value lies in the
                    effective use by the author of her extensive knowledge to illuminate, for the general reader, the
                    history of this small but important section of the border country of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. It is in no carping sense therefore that this reviewer suggests that one or two small
                    corrections should be made. Lord Selkirk did not purchase "a controlling interest"
                    in the stock of the Hudson's Bay Company in order to obtain the grant of land upon which he
                    settled his colonists. When the grant was made, he owned no more than 4,087. 10s worth of stock. It
                    was not until after the grant was made by the Company that Selkirk made huge purchases of stock
                    bringing his holdings up to 26,000. Again, Garnet Wolseley (later Field Marshal and Viscount) was a
                    colonel and not a lieutenant-colonel when he led the military expedition over the Dawson Route
                    against Fort Garry in 1870. One more criticism. The book is well illustrated and a good bibliography
                    is available, but this reviewer would like to see one or two maps in addition to the rather
                    unintelligible French map of 1740 and the too small map to be found on the inside of the covers.
                    Good maps help the reader to find his way through the pages of history.</p>

                    reviewed is concerned with the last part of the second and all of the third administrations of
                    Governor Ninian Edwards, and it also contains the Executive Register kept by Secretary Nathaniel
                    Pope for the entire period of territorial existence. The papers constitute for the most part
                    correspondence between the governor and the heads of government departments in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>

                    </placeName> and Shawneetown and the Commissioner of the General Land Office and the
                    Surveyor-General, but there are documents from other sources, too. Taken together these letters,
                    reports, etc., give a picture of the many problems that had to be solved by the officers on the spot
                    and by the higher echelons in the national capital.</p>
            <p>Most of the documents deal with land problems: the claims of pre-emptioners and those with bounty
                    rights, the setting aside from general sale of school lands and saline and mineral reservations, the
                    burden of clerical work borne by the land agents, and the difficulties arising from the often hasty
                    and inaccurate surveys. All of these problems were made more difficult to solve by the rush of
                    settlers into <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> when the War of 1812 ended.</p>
            <p>One of the most important duties of the territorial governor was to act as Indian superintendent. As
                    always the red men were troublesome, and their custom of disregarding the territorial boundaries in
                    their migrations brought Governor Edwards into jurisdictional dispute with Governor Clark in <placeName>

                    </placeName> Territory and Governor Cass in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>. Although the war was over, still British officers and fur traders intrigued with the
                    tribes to weaken the hold of American Indian agents. Occasionally there were Indian raids on
                    isolated settlers, with consequent demands that the miscreants be hunted down and punished. And as
                    always there was the pressure of an ever-increasing population for the extinguishment of the Indian
                    title to more and more land.</p>

                    approve a territorial law to improve the judicial system (the law is also printed in the pamphlet)
                    because the judges appointed by the President and the Senate would not execute the territorial law,
                    which was designed to provide for more frequent and more convenient court sessions.</p>
            <p>Most of the originals of the documents here published are from government department files now

                    in the history of the Middle West. The excellently organized and meticulously detailed index
                    provides an open door to the information. Genealogists will be especially pleased with many names of

            <p>The entire issue is characterized by its excellent illustrations, several of which are in color. The
                    articles in general are timely and the authors well qualified. A number of the articles are brief
                    statements of previously published works. Generally a nice balance is maintained between the desire
                    to popularize and to be scholarly and shallowness is thereby avoided. Although no attempt is made to
                    describe Indiana as a whole, a more adequate picture of the state may be gained than in some of the
                    other magazines which have devoted special issues to the Hoosier State.</p>

            <p>Around 1875, the inhabitants of Jackson Township, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, living about two miles north of Helms-burg felt the need for a house of
                    worship. Consequently plans were made to build, and the two sons of Jacob Frownfelter assumed the
                    leadership for the construction of the first log church. The next problem which confronted the group
                    was an appropriate name. Several meetings were held for this purpose but without success. Finally
                    when another meeting took place Jacob Frownfelter was determined to settle the question and at the
                    proper moment rose to his feet and remarked, "This is an oak ridge from one end to the
                    other [referring to the timber] so why not call it Oak Ridge Church?"</p>
            <p>By 1900, the size of the congregation necessitated larger quarters. Therefore, a few rods south of
                    the log church on land donated by William Snider a new white frame building was constructed which is
                    still used as a community church.</p>
            <p>Approximately one hundred graves may be found in the cemetery adjoining the church on the south. At
                    first there were few burials due to the poor condition of the roads, but as the highways were
                    improved more families placed their loved ones to rest in this cemetery, which includes a few Civil
                    and World War veterans. Among the oldest graves are members of the Snider family who originally had
                    been laid to rest in the Myers Cemetery, and one grave for a member of the Frownfelter family moved
                    from the Kuhn or Fleener Cemetery.</p>
