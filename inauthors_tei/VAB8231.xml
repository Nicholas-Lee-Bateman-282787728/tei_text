				<head rend="center">INTRODUCTION.</head>

				<p>There has long been need of a single comprehensive manual on the Orthoptera of the
					Eastern United States. The original descriptions and information regarding the
					distribution and habits of these interesting insects are scattered through scores of books
					and pamphlets which the student has to consult in order to correctly determine the various
					species which he may collect or have at hand. Many of these works are out of print or very
					difficult to obtain. For that reason the beginner is often discouraged at the very start
					and the study of Orthoptera has, therefore, not kept pace with that of other orders of
					insects whose literature is more available.</p>
				<p>The present work has been prepared to supply the need above mentioned. It is an outgrowth
					or expansion of my "Orthoptera of Indiana" issued in 1903 and long since out of print. In
					that work 148 species were described and keys given for their determination. Since its
					issue the researches of Rehn and Hebard, Caudell, Morse, Hancock, Walker, Davis and other
					special students of United States Orthoptera have brought about numerous changes in the
					nomenclature of the group and have added many new forms to the known fauna of our country.
					The great majority of Orthoptera inhabiting the United States east of the Mississippi
					River and Canada east of the 90th Meridian (the territory covered by this work) are now
					known. The nomenclature--always flexible and in the end largely dependent upon the
					view-point of the student--is fairly well established. The time is, therefore, deemed
					propitious for the appearance of such a work and it is offered as the best that I can
					accomplish with the facilities at my command.</p>
				<p>In the preparation of this manual I have ever had in mind the needs of the tyro and not
					those of the specialist in Orthoptera, the primary object in view being a simple work
					which would enable beginners in the most direct way possible to determine the scientific
					names and arrange and classify the Orthoptera in their collections. As far as possible
					easily understood words and terms have been used in the keys and descriptions, and many of
					the subdivisions adopted by other authors have been omitted in order to render the work
					less technical and more easily followed. Keys to families, subfamilies, tribes, genera and
					species have been made an important feature of the work. These keys are based on the more
					salient or easily recognized characters separating the <pb id="VAB8231-005" n="4"/>
					divisions to which they pertain. In most instances, to avoid repetition and save space,
					these characters are not re-mentioned in the descriptions which follow, and the keys
					should therefore <hi rend="i">always be used in connection with the descriptions</hi>.
					Moreover, it should be remembered that the characters used and statements made both in
					keys and descriptions are to be considered as applying only to those species occurring in
					the territory covered by this work. They may be, and in general are, capable of much wider
					application but it is not safe to assume that such is the case.</p>
				<p>Following the description of each species are notes on its distribution, food habits,
					song, etc. The general range or area of distribution given is based not only on my
					personal collecting in Indiana and Florida, but also on the specimens which have been
					examined in other cabinets and on the published local lists and other works cited in the
					Bibliography as well as manuscript lists furnished by several persons. The synonymy of
					many species is, however, so involved that the range as given, especially where it extends
					beyond our territory, is to be considered as open to correction. The dates of occurrence
					as given are usually the earliest and latest at which the species has been noted in the
					locality cited and do not therefore necessarily show the actual time of its appearance or
					disappearance.</p>
				<p>Of the 353 species and 58 varieties of Orthoptera recognized or recorded as inhabiting
					the territory covered I have been able to examine personally the types, or undoubted
					correctly identified paratypes, of all but five.<ref id="ref_001" rend="super"
						target="note_001">1</ref>The great majority of the species treated are represented in my
					own collection. The source of the specimens at hand as I wrote the descriptions is usually
					given in the notes following each description. Thus "Lakehurst, N. Jer. (<hi rend="i"
						>Davis</hi>)" means that the specimens at hand were taken at Lakehurst and loaned or
					presented to me by W. T. Davis; while "Ormond and Dunedin, Fla. (<hi rend="i">W. S.
						B.</hi>)" signifies that the specimens examined were taken by myself at the localities
					mentioned. After preparing the greater part of the text I visited Cambridge and Wellesley,
					Mass., Staten Island, N. Y. and Philadelphia, Pa., to examine the species not previously
					seen and to study the types and other specimens in the Scudder, Morse, Davis and
					Philadelphia collections. These contain the great majority of all the types of the United
					States species. Other cotypes or paratypes from <note id="note_001"><ref target="ref_001"
							rend="super">1</ref>These are <hi rend="i">Phyllovates chlorophæa</hi> Blanch., a
						mantid of doubtful occurrence in the Southern States; <hi rend="i">Heteronemia
							lævissimus</hi>, and <hi rend="i">H. texanus</hi> Brunner, two phasmids of doubtful
						status; <hi rend="i">Belocephalus excavatus</hi> Davis, the unique type of which is in
						the American Museum of Natural History, which Institution I did not find opportunity to
						visit, and <hi rend="i">Ceuthophilus scabripes</hi> (Hald.), a camel cricket, the type
						of which is lost and the status therefore doubtful.</note>
					<pb id="VAB8231-006" n="5"/> the U. S. National Museum collection at Washington were
					kindly loaned me from time to time by A. N. Caudell. The native and introduced and
					established species are numbered consecutively throughout the work, while those included
					but un-numbered represent adventive forms which have occasionally been taken within our
					bounds but which are as yet not known to breed and live throughout the year in any one
					locality.</p>
				<p>C<hi rend="sc">LASSIFICATION</hi>.--The classification followed in this work is not that
					of any one previous author, and may therefore not meet with the full approval of the
					up-to-date specialists in Orthoptera. In the names which I have adopted for the higher
					groups, I have not always followed "The Entomological Code"<ref id="ref_002" rend="super"
						target="note_002">2</ref> nor the rulings of the International Commission of Zoological
					Nomenclature. There has been in recent years, too much of a tendency to split hairs, to
					divide and subdivide the old well known groups into an infinite number of minor ones which
					lead nowhere in particular and only serve to confuse the beginner. The law of strict
						priority<ref id="ref_003" rend="super" target="note_003">3</ref> and its resultant
					ruling of basing the name of a subfamily or tribe upon the oldest generic name included
					are all right in the main, but when they lead up to two such similar names as Acridinae
					and Acrydiinae, confusion is sure to result, and priority should give way to simplicity.
					In such cases the names adopted by the more recent specialists are given in parenthesis
					and the student can use them if he so desires.</p>
				<p>As with the higher groups so with the' genera. I have not always adopted the generic
					names which have been proposed in recent years for certain of our species. A genus should
					be based on certain definite and fixed structures and once so founded all species then or
					thereafter assigned to that genus should possess those structures. Strictly speaking, a
					genus does not exist in nature but is only an artificial concept proposed by man to enable
					him the more readily to group his species. As to what really constitutes a set of generic
					characters there are about as many individual opinions as there are proposed or adopted
					genera. My reasons for rejecting or adopting certain questionable genera are usually set
					forth and the student can use his own judgment as to whether they are sound or not.</p>

				<note id="note_002"><ref target="ref_002" rend="super">2</ref>This code, prepared at
					Washington in 1912 by those two eminent American entomologists, Nathan Banks and A. N.
					Caudell, is, in the main, an excellent thing for beginners but a number of its rulings
					have not been adopted by some of the leading entomologists of the country.</note>

				<note id="note_003"><ref target="ref_003" rend="super">3</ref>If strict priority in the
					naming of the higher groups be insisted upon, the name <hi rend="i">Orthoptera</hi>
					itself, first used by Latreille in 1796 and later more definitely by Olivier in 1811,
					would have to give way to <hi rend="i">Dermaptera</hi>, the name proposed for the group by
					DeGeer in 1773, or to <hi rend="i">Ulonata</hi>, that proposed by Fabricius in
					1775.</note>


				<pb id="VAB8231-007" n="6"/>

				<p>The subgenera and other minor groups of certain authors are not generally recognized in
					this work. In their place and solely to shorten and simplify the keys I have sometimes
					used "groups" or "series," usually without definite names, as they lead up more easily and
					with less confusion to the main object sought--the scientific name of the specimen in
					hand.</p>
				<p>S<hi rend="sc">YNONYMY OF</hi> S<hi rend="sc">PECIES</hi>.--As already noted the synonymy
					of many species of Orthoptera is greatly confused. This is due to several causes, chief
					among which are the following: <hi rend="i">a.--Variation in the length of tegmina and
						wings</hi>. These organs of flight often vary exceedingly in individuals of the same
					species, thus causing the insects to appear so different in general facies that both the
					long- and short-winged forms have been often described under different names: <hi rend="i"
						>b.--Variation in color</hi>. Many of the first described species were based mainly upon
					color characters alone. As is well known, these are dependent largely upon local
					environment and are therefore usually unreliable in the fixing of species. Where the
					habitat is essentially the same throughout a large area the color is more stable and can
					then often be used as an important specific or varietal character; <hi rend="i"
						>c.-Variation in the secondary genital organs</hi>, especially those of the male. The
					size and form of certain abdominal appendages, as the male furcula and cerci, the form of
					and degree of emargination of the subgenital and supra-anal plates, the length, form and
					armature of the ovipositor, have been much used in the past as distinguishing characters
					in the separation of species. In the majority of forms these organs are fairly stable and
					can be satisfactorily so used, but in some they vary greatly. This is especially true of
					the cerci of the male and too many races, varieties and even species have been founded
					upon slight differences in the structure of those organs; <hi rend="i">d.--Brief
						descriptions of the early known American species by European writers</hi>. A number of
					the more common American species of Orthoptera were first described, usually in two or
					three lines, by foreign authors who never saw the insects in the field, and knew nothing
					of their distribution, habitat or variations. These brief descriptions were sufficient to
					enable their authors to distinguish the species at hand from all others known to them, but
					are wholly inefficient when it comes to separating them from the large number of closely
					allied species now known. The types of many of the species described by DeGeer,
					Burmeister, Serville and even Saussure and Redtenbacher, are destroyed or inaccessible, so
					that it is often impossible to state what form <pb id="VAB8231-008" n="7"/> they had in
					hand. Much confusion in synonymy has therefore resulted by "guessing" at what they had, as
					each of our American authors has usually come to a different conclusion, and described or
					named his own species accordingly. Unless some easily distinguished or reliable character
					was given by the European author by which the American insect has been or is readily
					distinguished, or until a direct comparison with the type, if the latter is available, has
					been made by some competent Orthopterologist and the American conspecies thereby reliably
					determined, it is often better, in my opinion, to disregard these old European names and
					to adopt later ones of undoubted status.</p>
				<p>While the law of priority has been usually followed in the naming of the species in this
					work, there are some instances where the rulings leading up to it were technical, or, in
					my opinion, nonsensical, and I have therefore retained a better known name in preference
					to the one which, in accordance with strict priority, has been recently assigned by other
					authors. In such cases I have mentioned in the text or footnote my reasons for not
					adopting the proposed change in names.</p>
				<p>Throughout the work I have used trinominals to designate races, varieties, variants,
					subspecies, incipient species and sometimes even color varieties, usually noting which of
					these minor forms I consider the third name to represent. The name of the typical variety,
					if more than one exists, is not printed as a trinominal. I thus use <hi rend="i"
						>Nomotettix cristatus</hi> (Scudder), not <hi rend="i">Nomotettix cristatus
						cristatus</hi> (Scudder). In many cases I have not recognized the so-called geographical
					races of recent authors. Where a well known species ranges over a large area, the
					different environments due to altitude, variation in mean annual temperature, atmospheric
					conditions, difference in topography, drainage and soils, varied food plants and many
					other causes, are sure to bring about certain changes in its external structure. If only
					the extremes of these variants be at hand they are often so different in appearance as to
					cause them to be considered races or even different species. However, where a large series
					from all parts of the range are present, intermediates are almost sure to be found and
					there is little use and often much resulting confusion in giving or recognizing a name for
					each slightly variable form.</p>
				<p>Where, in the original description, the specific name was placed by the author in a genus
					different from that to which it is now referred, the name of the author or its
					abbreviation is placed in parenthesis.</p>


				<pb id="VAB8231-009" n="8"/>

				<p>The known synonyms of each species of Orthoptera belonging to our fauna are usually
					mentioned, in the notes following the description of that species. A list of these
					synonyms, arranged, alphabetically by both genera and species, with reference to the
					species to which each is now accredited and the page of its description, will be found
					just before the general index of this work.</p>
				<p>B<hi rend="sc">IBLIOGRAPHY</hi>.--The bibliography near the end of this volume is not a
					complete list of the works pertaining to the Orthoptera of Northeastern America but
					contains only the names of those works to which especial reference has been made in the
					text, and a few additional ones which it was thought might at times be of use to the
					student of our fauna. In the bibliography the list of papers is arranged alphabetically by
					authors and each author's works chronologically by years. Where more than one paper by the
					same author appeared in any one year the letters <hi rend="i">a, b, c,</hi> etc. follow
					the year. Thus, a citation in the text to Davis (1912a, 124) will be found by reference to
					the bibliography to refer to page 124 of his paper entitled "Three New Species of
					Belocephalus from Florida," published in the Journal of the New York Entomological
					Society, Vol XX, pp. 122-125. After the name of each genus and each species, as recognized
					in this work, is given the name of the author with year and page number of the work where
					the genus was founded or the species originally described. Thus, <hi rend="i">Belocephalus
					sabalis</hi> Davis, 1912a, 123, refers to the original description of that species on
					page 123 of the paper above mentioned; while B<hi rend="sc">ELOCEPHALUS</hi> Scudder,
					1875, 458, means, as a reference to the bibliography will show, that the genus <hi
						rend="i">Belocephalus</hi> was founded by Scudder on page 458 of his "Century of
					Orthoptera Decade II. Locustarive," which appeared in the Proceedings of the Boston
					Society of Natural History, Vol XVII, pp. 454-462. As the joint works of Rehn &amp; Hebard
					are so numerous and the references to them so many, the abbreviations R. &amp; H. have
					been, for the most part, used for citation to them throughout the text.</p>
				<p>No attempt has been made to make reference to all the mentions of each species in the
					works cited, as such complete synonymy would fill a volume by itself. Special students,
					who wish a more extended synonymy, are referred to Scudder's "Index to North American
					Orthoptera," which includes every known reference to each species up to the close of the
					year 1900. A manuscript continuation of this index has been made by A. N. Caudell which,
					it is hoped, will soon be published. Another work, indispensable to the special student,
					is Kirby's "Synonymic Catalogue <pb id="VAB8231-010" n="9"/> of Orthoptera," published in
					three volumes (1904, 1906, 1910), which deals with the Orthoptera of the world, but
					contains many errors in the synonymy of the North American forms.</p>
				<p>M<hi rend="sc">EASUREMENTS</hi>.--The measurements used in this work are given in
					millimeters or decimals thereof. A millimeter (mm.)=.0394, or a little more than 1/25 of
					an inch. For all practical purposes it may be remembered that 2.5 mm.=1/10 inch; 3 mm.=
					1/8+inch; 4 mm.=1/6+inch; 5 mm.=1/5 inch; 7.5 mm.=3/10 inch; 10 mm.=2/5 inch; 12.5 mm.=1/2
					inch; 15 mm.=3/5 inch; 17.5 mm.=7/10 inch; 20 mm.=4/5 inch.</p>
				<p>The measurements as given are usually those of the extremes of the series at hand and
					thus represent fairly well the variation in size of the different parts measured. The
					length of the body is taken from the tip of the vertex to the apex of the subgenital plate
					in male and base of ovipositor in female.</p>
				<p>H<hi rend="sc">ABITS AND</hi> S<hi rend="sc">ONGS OF</hi> O<hi rend="sc"
					>RTHOPTERA</hi>.--The habits of any form of animal life are usually of especial interest
					to the student of natural history. Each individual of the myriad living moving forms found
					upon this old earth of ours has its daily routine of life,--its journeys great or small,
					its quest for food, its search for a mate, its care of offspring, its place of hiding, its
					means of self-protection, its limits in hours or days or years of life,--its final
					passing back to the dust of the common mother--to that matter which is indestructible, yet
					ever mutable--ever ready to become a living, moving part of a mite or a man, a mouse or an
					elephant. Of all these forms of life none are more interesting in habits than the
					Orthoptera which, while few in numbers as compared with the great bulk of insect life,
					have a history reaching back far beyond that of man himself. For they were the first
					musicians of the earth, and by the means of their shrilling organs enlivened the solitudes
					of the strange old Devonian forests with their love calls and wooing notes. Hancock in his
					charming work "Nature Sketches in Temperate America," has described the habits of many
					Orthopterons. Scudder has set their songs to music. Hebard and Walker, Somes and Morse,
					Davis and Allard, Piers and Fox have described their notes, their haunts, their daily
					habits. From the writings of all these and many others I have gleaned and have included in
					the notes on each species those observations which it was thought would be most
					interesting. To some this mingling of the poetical with the technical may be deemed out of
					place in a work like this, but Grant Allen has well said: "Our thoughts about nature and
					nature's objects are often too largely <pb id="VAB8231-011" n="10"/> interwoven with hard
					technicalities concerning rotate corollas and pedicellate racemes, and I, for my part, am
					not ashamed to confess that I like sometimes to see the dry light of science diversified
					with some will-o'-the-wisp of pure poetical imagination."</p>
				<p>A<hi rend="sc">CKNOWLEDGMENTS</hi>.--As already noted, this work is based largely upon my
					former one--"The Orthoptera of Indiana." In the preparation of that, as well as in my
					earlier studies of the group, I was greatly aided by two men to whom I wish to first pay
					tribute. One was Samuel H. Scudder of Cambridge, Mass.--a man noted for his varied
					accomplishments--a devoted student of insects, especially of butterflies and Orthoptera.
					He was the father of American Orthopterology, and to him more than to all his predecessors
					and contemporaries combined is due our present knowledge and classification of the group.
					When, in 1861, he wrote his first paper on Orthoptera fewer than 60 species were
					recognized from North America and a number of those were synonyms. In 1900, when he issued
					his second Catalogue 856 species were included, 385 of which had been described by him. A
					number of these have since been shown to be synonyms, for his later work, especially on
						<hi rend="i">Ceuthophilus</hi> and <hi rend="i">Melanoplus</hi>, was hurried and many
					mistakes naturally resulted. Of his published papers on Orthoptera no fewer than 81 are
					included in the bibliography accompanying this work, while a large number of others
					dealing with extra-limital species are not mentioned. Always willing to answer questions
					and ever interested in any new form which was discovered, his counsel was to me for many
					years both helpful and inspiring. His collection of Orthoptera with its many types is now
					in the Cambridge Museum of Comparative Zoology, where it is one of the lode-stars which
					attract to that Mecca of entomologists those interested in Orthoptera from all parts of
					the world.</p>
				<p>Another who aided in solving many a knotty problem in my old tyro days was Lawrence
					Bruner, then as now the Professor of Entomology in the University of Nebraska. He has long
					been interested not only in the Orthoptera of this country but in those of South America,
					and has published many papers and described many of the species belonging to our fauna.
					His cabinet of North American forms with its numerous types is now a part of the
					Philadelphia collections.</p>
				<p>When I began the preparation of this work I realized that I would have to call many times
					upon the present-day special students of North American Orthoptera, those who have kept
					the <pb id="VAB8231-012" n="11"/> science growing since the new century was ushered in.
					They are few in number but rich in lore, in enthusiasm and especially in a willingness to
					help a fellow-student when he sends out an S. O. S. for aid of any kind. To A. N. Caudell
					of the U. S. National Museum at Washington, D. C., I am indebted for many favors. Long a
					devoted student of the group, and an especial adept in the intricacies of the knotty
					problems of its nomenclature, he has been especially kind in answering the many questions
					which I have asked and in loaning me numerous volumes and many specimens for study. W. T.
					Davis of New Brighton, Staten Island, N. Y., who is not only a student of Orthoptera, but
					also a naturalist of high rank and interested in all forms of living things, has aided me
					greatly in many ways. His private collection of Orthoptera is rich not only in large
					series of some of the scarcer forms but in numerous types of the species he has described.
					From it he has loaned or presented me examples of many rare species. He has also furnished
					many notes on distribution and habits of various forms. Jas. A. G. Rehn and Morgan Hebard
					of Philadelphia, Pa., have loaned me numerous specimens and have verified or identified
					for me many others. Since 1900 they have built up at the Philadelphia Academy of Natural
					Sciences one of the largest and most complete collections of Orthoptera in the world--one
					rich in types not only of their own description, but of other authors. Their published
					monographs and other papers on North American Orthoptera are numerous and most valuable,
					and from them I have drawn freely for the pages which follow. Dr. J. L. Hancock of
					Chicago, Ill., the noted authority on the Tetrigidae of the world, has furnished me many
					notes on the distribution of the grouse locusts and loaned me numerous specimens of that
					interesting group. A. P. Morse of Wellesley, Mass., has shown me many favors. He has been
					for thirty or more years a special student of New England Orthoptera, and has also
					collected extensively in the Southern and Pacific states. His numerous types and other
					specimens have been placed freely at my service and he has furnished a number of notes on
					distribution and habits. Dr. E. M. Walker, of the University of Toronto, the leading
					student of Orthoptera in Ontario, has sent me much data regarding the forms found in
					eastern Canada, and from his writings and those of Piers and Morse I have gained much of
					the information given regarding the species found in the extreme eastern part of the
					territory covered. Dr. H. Fox of Macon, Ga., who has published interesting papers on the
					Orthoptera of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, <pb id="VAB8231-013" n="12"/> Indiana and
					Virginia, has furnished me numerous specimens and' has contributed a manuscript list of
					the species taken near Clarksville, Tenn. T. H. Hubbell of the University Museum of
					Zoology at Ann Arbor, Mich., prepared for me a similar list of Michigan species and kindly
					loaned specimens for examination. Others who contributed distribution data, specimens or
					other helpful aid were the late Chas. A. Hart of Urbana, Ill.; Wm. J. Gerhard of the Field
					Museum, Chicago; Prof. J. R. Watson, Dr. E. H. Berger and P. W. Fattig of Gainesville,
					Fla.; H. P. Loding of Mobile, Ala.; Prof. H. Garman of Lexington, Ky.; Nathan Banks of
					Cambridge, Mass.; Dr. Wm. A. Riley of the University of Minnesota; Myron H. Swenk of
					Lincoln, Neb.; J. R. Malloch of Urbana, Ill., and Chas. A. Dury of Cincinnati, Ohio.</p>
				<p>It is a pleasure to acknowledge and extend thanks to all the parties above mentioned,
					for, situated as I have been far from any large collection or reference library, the work
					in its present form would not have been possible had it not been for the aid so freely
					given.</p>

					<p>If we compare the body of a locust or other insect with that of any vertebrate animal,
						as a fish, bird or squirrel, we find at once great and important differences. The
						vertebrate is an animal with an inner bony skeleton, two pairs of jointed limbs or
						appendages, and breathes by means of lungs or gills, according as it dwells in air or
						water. The locust is an animal which has no inner skeleton or bones whatever, but only a
						hard crust on the surface which surrounds the muscles and vital organs. This crust is
						composed of separate rings, placed end to end.</p>
					<p>Animals whose bodies are thus composed of rings are called <hi rend="i"
						>Articulata</hi>. They are in turn divided into two great groups, the <hi rend="sc"
							>Vermes</hi> and the <hi rend="sc">Arthropoda</hi>. The <hi rend="sc">Vermes</hi>
						(worms) have all the rings composing the body very nearly alike, not hardened into an
						outer crust or exoskeleton, and without paired limbs which are jointed. The <hi
							rend="sc">Arthropods</hi> have a part of the rings bearing paired jointed appendages,
						and have the cuticle or outer surface consisting largely of a peculiar substance called
						"chitin," which is secreted or exuded by the cells which compose the cuticle. Chitin
						itself is insoluble and is not composed of cells, but consists of fine, irregular
						plates. It hardens the cuticle and thus aids the latter in protecting delicate vital
						organs within, and also in forming a framework to which the muscles of movement may be
						attached. Between <pb id="VAB8231-014" n="13"/> the joints the cuticle is devoid of
						chitin and is thin, delicate and flexible, thus allowing the necessary freedom of
						motion.</p>
					<p>The Arthropoda are divided into four classes, as follows: <list type="simple">
							<item>
								<hi rend="i">(a) Crustacea</hi> (crayfish, lobster, etc.), mostly aquatic; having the
								head and thorax usually united and distinct from the abdomen; breathing by means of
								gills or directly through the skin, the exoskeleton with carbonate and phospate of
								lime in addition to chitin.</item>
							<item>
								<hi rend="i">(b) Arachnida</hi> (spiders, mites, etc.), terrestrial; head and thorax
								usually combined, and bearing four pairs of legs; breathing by means of
								tracheæ.</item>

							<figure>

								<p>Fig. 1. Body of a locust, side view, showing the rings of which the body is
									composed, the thorax being separated from the head and abdomen and divided into
									its three segments. <hi rend="center">(After Packard.)</hi></p>

							</figure>

							<item>
								<hi rend="i">(c) Myriapoda</hi> (myriapods, centipedes, etc.), terrestrial; usually
								worm-like, with only the head distinct; legs numerous; breathing by means of
								tracheæ.</item>
							<item>
								<hi rend="i">(d) Insecta</hi> (grasshoppers, flies, beetles, etc.), in great part
								terrestrial; legs six; adults usually with one or two pairs of wings; breathing by a
								system of tubes called tracheæ, which branch and ramify through every portion of the
								body, and which open externally in about ten places on each side of the body instead
								of at the front end. The rings of the body are grouped in three regions; the <hi
									rend="i">head</hi>, the <hi rend="i">thorax</hi> and the <hi rend="i"
								>abdomen</hi>. In general it may be said that the head contains or bears the organs
								of sense and of prehension and mastication of food; the thorax the organs of
								locomotion, and the abdomen those of reproduction.</item>

					<p>Having thus shown that a locust belongs to the class <hi rend="i">Insecta</hi> it is
						thought best, before giving its relation to the other orders <pb id="VAB8231-015" n="14"
						/> of that class, to describe briefly the external parts of a typical specimen. The
						beginner may thus the more readily grasp the name and location of the parts used in
						classification, as well as the meaning of many of the technical terms which, of
						necessity, have to be used in such a work as this. The three regions of the body, the
						head, the thorax, and the abdomen, with their appendages, will therefore be considered
						in order.</p>
					<p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> H<hi rend="sc">EAD</hi>.--The head of the locust is composed of
						four or more segments or rings, solidly fused together to form a single cavity or hard
						box of chitin, known as the <hi rend="i">epicranium</hi>. This contains the brain and
						accessory ganglia, and the mouth cavity. It bears or gives support to the antennae,
						mouth parts, eyes and ocelli; also internally to the muscles moving the mandibles or
						jaws. The broad basal portion of the epicranium back of the eyes is known as the <hi
							rend="i">occiput</hi>, the narrower portion between the eyes, the <hi rend="i"
							>vertex</hi>, while the long frontal portion as far down as the prominent transverse
						suture is the <hi rend="i">front</hi> or <hi rend="i">face</hi>.</p>
					<figure>
						<p>Fig. 2. Front view of the head of a locust. (After Lugger).</p>
					</figure>
					<p>The short plate (<hi rend="i">cly</hi>), below or in front of the epicranium, is the
							<hi rend="i">clypeus</hi>. Below this and hinged to its front edge is a movable flap
						known as the <hi rend="i">labrum (lbr)</hi> or upper lip, to which are attached a pair
						of jointed <hi rend="i">labial palpi</hi>. This forms the roof or covering of the front
						part of the mouth, within which are the large, black-tipped, toothed jaws or <hi
							rend="i">mandibles (md)</hi>, which are so attached to the epicranium as to move only
						in and out or to and from a median line. As has been shown by Nininger <bibl>(Psyche,
							XXII, 13)</bibl> the two mandibles in Orthoptera are not alike as is generally
						supposed, but the left one is slightly the larger and projects beyond the right one
						ventrally when closed. The distal ends of the two mandibles are beveled differently so
						that when closed the beveled surfaces are contiguous throughout and do not meet on the
						median line but always to the right of it. Inserted on the sides of the head just behind
						the mandibles and arched over the tongue will also be found a pair of accessory jaws,
						the <hi rend="i">maxillae (mx)</hi>, each of which is composed of three parts, the most
						important being the jointed <hi rend="i">maxillary palpus</hi>. The segments of these
						palpi are usually five in number and vary in size and form in different groups therefore
						being often used in classification. The development and shape of these maxillæ in the
						locust, <pb id="VAB8231-016" n="15"/> as well as in other Orthoptera, depend very
						largely upon the nature of the food, as these organs serve not only to seize and hold
						the food in the mouth, but also as accessory jaws, aiding the mandibles in rendering the
						food more suitable for swallowing. Their palpi are not only organs of touch, but in many
						cases act as hands in helping to prehend and carrying morsels of food to the mouth.</p>
					<p>Above the clypeus, is a ridge extending upward along the median line of the face to the
						vertex. This is the <hi rend="i">frontal costa</hi>, and its characters are often used
						in classification. In one species it may be sulcate or grooved, in another, flat. Its
						edges, or <hi rend="i">carinæ</hi>; may be parallel the full length or may diverge or
						converge. Its width and prominence are also often mentioned.</p>
					<figure>
						<p> Fig. 3. Side view of head. (After Lugger.)</p>
					</figure>
					<p>The region on the side of the head, behind the eye and above the base of the mandibles,
						is the cheek or <hi rend="i">gena (gen.)</hi>. To its inner wall is attached the large
						muscle which moves the mandible.</p>
					<p>The eyes of a locust are five in number, two large compound ones and three small,
						simple ones. The compound eyes are present in all Orthoptera. In the locust they vary in
						shape, but for the most part are oval, and are located on the upper portion of the sides
						of the head. Each is made up of many thousands of six-sided facets or lenses, in each of
						which a single filament of the optic nerve ends. The simple eyes or <hi rend="i">ocelli
							(oc.)</hi> are absent in some Orthoptera, as the Tettigoniidae, some of the Gryllidae
						and the females of some Mantidae, but are present in the locust. Two of them are
						situated just above the base of the antennae, close to the inner margins of the compound
						eyes, while the third is located near the middle of the frontal costa. Their position
						varies in the different families of Orthoptera, and there are but two in the
						Gryllotalpinæ or mole crickets.</p>
					<p>These ocelli are thought to be inherited from the obscure eyes of the worm-like
						ancestry of the locust, while the many facetted compound eyes of insects and crustaceans
						have been evolved to satisfy the needs of the more recent existence of these groups.</p>
					<p>The <hi rend="i">antennæ (ant.)</hi> of the locust are simple, many jointed appendages,
						located on the face between the eyes and articulating with the head by a ball and socket
						joint. They are principally organs of touch, but are also supposed to contain the nerves
						of <pb id="VAB8231-017" n="16"/> smell. They vary much in length and form among the
						different families of Orthoptera, the variation being the result of adaptation to their
						peculiar surroundings and habits. For instance, in those camel crickets <hi rend="i"
							>(Ceuthophilus)</hi>, which dwell in caves, they are very much longer than in those
						members of the same genus which dwell above ground. Characters pertaining to their form,
						length, and point of union with the head, are much used in classification. Such terms as
							<hi rend="i">filiforn, clavate, setaceous</hi>, etc., relating to their form, are
						defined in the accompanying glossary.</p>
					<figure>
						<p>Fig. 4. Showing fastigium, disk and foveolæ of vertex. (After L u gger.)</p>
					</figure>
					<p>Characters pertaining to the vertex, or that part of the epicranium, between the eyes,
						are much used in separating the different species of Orthoptera. The central portion of
						the vertex, known as the disk <hi rend="i">(dv)</hi> or <hi rend="i">scutellum (sv)</hi>
						is often depressed, or separated from the remainder. Its bounding walls are termed <hi
							rend="i">lateral carinæ</hi> and often a median carina divides it into two parts. The
						front portion, or apex, often called the <hi rend="i">fastigium</hi>, is variable in
						form and its characters are also much used. On the outer side of, and a little below the
						front half of each lateral carina of the vertex there is, in many Orthoptera, a little
						space or concavity bounded by elevated ridges. These spaces are the <hi rend="i">lateral
							foveolæ (f.)</hi> and their variations in size and form also afford characters much
						used in classification.</p>
					<p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> T<hi rend="sc">HORAX AND ITS</hi> A<hi rend="sc"
						>PPENDAGES</hi>.--The middle region of the body of a locust or other insect is called
						the <hi rend="i">thorax</hi>. To study its parts aright, the wings and legs attached to
						it should be removed, when it will be seen to consist of three rings or segments. These
						are known as the <hi rend="i">prothorax, mesothorax</hi> and <hi rend="i"
							>metathorax</hi>. Within these rings are located the muscles for moving the wings and
						legs, as well as some of the digestive organs.</p>
					<figure>
						<p>Fig. 5. Side view of prothorax of a locust. (After Lugger.)</p>
					</figure>
					<p>The prothorax of the locust (Fig. 5) has its entire dorsal surface, and sides in great
						part, covered by a large sunbonnet-shaped piece known as the <hi rend="i">pronotum
							(pro)</hi>. This varies much in shape and size in the different families of
						Orthoptera. Its upper surface is called the <hi rend="i">disk</hi>, and its sides the
							<hi rend="i">lateral lobes</hi>. Raised lines known as the <hi rend="i">lateral
							carinæ</hi> usually separate the disk from the sides, while often a third line, the
							<hi rend="i">median carina</hi> runs lengthwise through the middle of the disk.</p>


					<pb id="VAB8231-018" n="17"/>

					<p>This may be high or low, crested, arched, distinct, aborted, etc. It is usually cut by
						one or more notches formed by shallow grooves or <hi rend="i">sulci</hi> which cross the
						disk of the pronotum and extend down its sides. The hindmost of these sulci or grooves
						divides the disk of the ponotum into two parts known as the <hi rend="i">prozona
							(pz)</hi> and <hi rend="i">metazona (mz)</hi>. The fore and hind margins of the disk
						of pronotum may be truncate, rounded, angled, notched, etc. The surface of the disk is
						usually smooth, but sometimes wrinkled and may be rugose or roughened with numerous
						tubercles. </p>
					<figure>
						<p>Fig. 6. Dorsal view of head and pronotum.(After Lugger.)</p>
					</figure>
					<p>The under or ventral side of the prothorax is a narrow, somewhat movable piece called
						the prosternum. On its center it often bears a tooth or spine <hi rend="i">(pro.
							sp.)</hi>, the presence or absence and shape of which form characters used in
						classification. Near the outer ends of the prosternum are shallow sockets in which are
						attached the front pair of legs.</p>
					<figure>
						<p>Fig. 7. Lower or ventral view of the thorax of a locust. (After Lugger.)</p>
					</figure>
					<p>The <hi rend="i">mesothorax</hi> and <hi rend="i">metathorax</hi>, the second and third
						segments of the thorax, are, in the locust, rather firmly united with the basal
						abdominal segment of the abdomen to form a firm walled box, though in the Blattidae they
						are distinct. The upper portion of these segments is, in most Orthoptera, partly or
						wholly covered by the pronotum or base of the outer wings. To the mesothorax are
						attached the tegmina or outer pair of wings and the second or middle pair of legs. To
						the metathorax are joined the inner wings and the third or hind pair of legs. The under
						or ventral portion of these segments are called respectively the <hi rend="i"
							>mesosternum</hi> and <hi rend="i">metasternum</hi>. (Fig. 7.) The former in the
						locust is composed of a front transverse portion, with two nearly rectangular lobes
						projecting backward. Between these lobes is dove-tailed a squarish tongue, or forward
						prolongation of the metasternum. The latter is united with the <pb id="VAB8231-019"
							n="18"/> basal abdominal segment by the dove-tailing of a similar but narrower tongue
						between its lobes. The side pieces of the mesothorax and metathorax are called <hi
							rend="i">pleurites</hi> and bear the prefixes <hi rend="i">meso</hi> and <hi rend="i"
							>meta</hi>.</p>
					<p>The <hi rend="i">wings</hi> are thin, broad, more or less leaf-like folds of the
						integument or body covering, which are joined to the thorax and moved by powerful
						muscles located within the thoracic cavity. The first or outer pair of wings of the
						locust and other Orthoptera serve as shields or covers for the more delicate inner pair.
						In the text which follows they are called <hi rend="i">tegmina</hi>. Each wing cover or
						tegmen is a thin, more or less transparent, leathery or parchment-like plate of chitin,
						strengthened by a network of tubes called nerves or veins. The spaces enclosed by the
						veins and their cross branches are called cells. When folded and at rest upon the body
						the outer face of the tegmen of a locust is vertical, with the front or costal margin
						below, and the posterior or sutural margin lying along the back; that of the left tegmen
						slightly overlapping the right.</p>
					<figure>

						<p>Fig. 8. Right tegmen of a locust, showing the venation. The names of the veins
							designated by the letters are given in the text. (After Saussure.)</p>

					</figure>
					<p>The principal veins of the tegmen of a locust diverge from the basal end and are seven
						in number. The one nearest the front or lower margin of the tegmen is the <hi rend="i"
							>submarginal</hi> or <hi rend="i">costal vein (c)</hi>. It is undivided, and may
						usually be traced for a little more than half the length of the tegmen, though in some
						locusts it is lacking. The second and longer vein, also undivided, is the <hi rend="i"
							>mediastinal (m)</hi>. The third and much larger vein is the <hi rend="i">humeral
							(h)</hi>, sometimes called the <hi rend="i">subcostal</hi>. It gives rise to several
						large branches, the subdivisions of which form the framework of the greater part of the
						tegmen. The larger of these branches <hi rend="i">(d)</hi>, is known as the <hi rend="i"
							>discoidal</hi> vein, its branches being designated as <hi rend="i">d', dd",</hi> etc.
						The fourth or median vein <hi rend="i">(n)</hi>, is much smaller and soon divides into
							<pb id="VAB8231-020" n="19"/> branches of nearly equal size. Above or behind the
						median vein is sometimes present a short, undivided vein <hi rend="i">(i)</hi>, known as
						the <hi rend="i">intercalary</hi> vein. Next in order is the <hi rend="i">ulnar</hi>
						vein <hi rend="i">(u)</hi>, which gives off several branches (<hi rend="i">u', u"</hi>,
						etc.). The upper division of this vein <hi rend="i">(o)</hi> is known as the <hi
							rend="i">posterior ulnar</hi> or the <hi rend="i">submedian</hi> vein. Close to and
						parallel with it near the upper or hind margin of the tegmen, is the undivided <hi
							rend="i">anal</hi> vein <hi rend="i">(a)</hi>, while the uppermost vein of the tegmen,
						also undivided, is the <hi rend="i">axillary</hi> vein <hi rend="i">(x)</hi>.</p>

					<figure>
						<p>Fig. 9. Right tegmen of the locust, <hi rend="i">Dissosteira carolina</hi> (L.).
							Showing the venation. (After Saussure.)</p>
					</figure>

					<p>The tegmen is divided by these veins into 'three areas: The <hi rend="i">costal</hi> or
							<hi rend="i">marginal</hi> area <hi rend="i">(M)</hi> forms the lower or front edge of
						the wing cover and is bounded above and behind by the humeral vein. The <hi rend="i"
							>median</hi> or <hi rend="i">discoidal</hi> area <hi rend="i">(D)</hi> is much the
						largest and lies between the humeral and posterior ulnar veins. The <hi rend="i"
							>anal</hi> or <hi rend="i">dorsal</hi> area <hi rend="i">(X)</hi> is the free margin
						lying along the back above and behind the anal vein. The posterior end of the tegmen <hi
							rend="i">(A)</hi> is known as the <hi rend="i">apical margin</hi>.</p>

					<figure>
						<p>Fig. 10. Right tegmen of a locust, showing the "areas" designated in the text. (After
							Saussure.)</p>
					</figure>

					<p>The inner or second pair of wings are joined to the metathorax, and when at rest lie
						folded beneath the tegmina. If, in a fresh example, the dark colored marginal vein be
						pulled outward or forward with a pair of forceps, it will be seen that the wing is a
						thin, parchment-like membrane, with a stiff front edge, which is nearly straight, while
						the rounded outer and hind margins are thin and flexible. When in flight, the wing is
						fully extended, its upper surface being convex, while its front margin is rendered still
						more rigid by being overlapped by the internal margin of the upper wing or tegmen. The
						numerous veins radiating from the base are so arranged that their elasticity causes the
						wing to fold upon itself like a fan as soon as its margin is released. The <pb
							id="VAB8231-021" n="20"/> principal veins correspond in position to those of the
						tegmina, and have the same names. Both tegmina and wings are wanting in a number of
						species of Orthoptera, while in others the tegmina are present and the wings absent.</p>
					<p>The <hi rend="i">legs</hi> of a locust are six in number, arranged in pairs, one pair
						being joined to each of the divisions of the thorax. The first and second pairs are, in
						the leaping Orthoptera, much smaller than the third, but the number and name of the
						joints is the same. They unite with the body at a different angle from the hind or third
						pair, and are therefore adapted to crawling and clinging to grass stems or other support
						rather than to leaping.</p>

					<figure>
						<p>Fig. 11. Hind leg of a locust. (After Lugger.)</p>
					</figure>

					<p>The hind pair or leaping legs of the locust are composed of five parts: The <hi
							rend="i">coxa (c)</hi>, or basal division, which is joined to the metathorax; a small
						segment, the <hi rend="i">trochanter (tr)</hi>, immovably joined to the upper apical
						portion of the coxa; the <hi rend="i">femur (f)</hi>, a long, swollen, club-shaped
						segment, which makes up nearly half the length of the limb. When the insect is at rest,
						it extends upward and backward, with its apical end above the dorsal surface of the
						body. This segment contains powerful leaping muscles. The <hi rend="i">tibia (ti)</hi>
						is about as long as the femur but is very slender and of uniform diameter. When at rest
						it extends downward and backward, at an acute angle from the apex or knee of the femur,
						but in the act of jumping it is jerked backward against the ground or other support,
						into which the tibial spurs are driven, then the sudden straightening of the legs by the
						powerful internal muscles propels the insect into the air. In leaping the tibia is kept
						from wobbling by a lobe extending back each side of its base, from the apex of the
						femur. The tibia usually bears on each of its upper outer margins a row of spines, and
						at the end one or more pairs of longer spines or spurs known as <hi rend="i"
							>calcaria</hi>. The tibiae of the fore legs of a number of Orthoptera are much
						modified for use in burrowing or prehending food. The <hi rend="i">tarsus (ta)</hi> or
						foot of the locust is made up of three movable joints.<ref id="ref_004" rend="super"

					<p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> A<hi rend="sc">BDOMEN</hi>.-The abdomen or hind portion of the
						body of the locust (Fig. 1) is composed of ten more or less complete segments, so united
						as to be movable in a small degree. Each segment is composed of two parts, a <hi
							rend="i">tergum</hi> or upper portion, and a <hi rend="i">sternum</hi> or under piece.
						The tergum is crested or bent in the median line to form a ridge, the two sides, sloping
						downward, being known as <hi rend="i">tergites</hi>. The sternum of the first or basal
						abdominal segment is united firmly to that of the metathorax. The tergites of this
						segment, in the locust, each contain a large opening closed by a membrane, the auditory
						organ or ear. However, the ears of many Orthoptera are borne upon the basal portion of
						the front tibiæ. Eight of the abdominal segments of the locust have a small opening on
						the lower margin of each tergite. These are <hi rend="i">spiracles</hi> or external
						openings of tubes which serve as air passages. The ninth and tenth abdominal segments of
						the locust are more or less modified in both sexes. The abdomen of the female ends in a
						double pair of short curved movable horny plates, known as the <hi rend="i">valves of
							the ovipositor</hi>. In the other families of Orthoptera in which the ovipositor is
						visible, these plates vary greatly in form and size. The valves in the female locust are
						used in forcing the earth aside, thus forming a pit in which the eggs are deposited.
						Between and hidden by them is the ovipositor proper.</p>

							Lugger.)</p>
					</figure>
					<p>The ventral portion of the last abdominal segment of the male locust is a large,
						upcurved, spoon-shaped piece known as the subgenital plate. Attached to the tergum of
						the next to the last segment are a pair of appendages known as the cerci. In the male
						locust these are unjointed, and in the different species vary much in size and shape,
						often affording valuable characters for classification. In many of the other families
						they are jointed, and more or <pb id="VAB8231-023" n="22"/> less hairy. The cerci of the
						female locust are much smaller than those of the male, and in other Orthoptera are often
						wanting. The tergum or upper portion of the tenth abdominal segment is a triangular,
						often thick solid plate, known as the <hi rend="i">supra-anal</hi> plate. At the base of
						this plate and resting upon it, a pair of projections, known as the <hi rend="i"
							>furcula</hi>, are usually present in the male. In certain genera of locusts the
						shape, size and relative position of these afford valuable specific characters. Lying
						within the cavity of the subgenital plate, and occupying the space beyond the tip of the
						supra-anal, there is in the Melanopli a structure covered with a soft integument. This
						is known as the <hi rend="i">pallium</hi> and is used to some extent in
						classification.</p>

					</figure>
					<p>The above constitute the more important external parts of the locust, the characters of
						which are used in determining the name and position of any member of the order
						Orthoptera. As will be seen in the pages which follow, these different parts vary much
						in size and in form, but the names given to them apply as well to the members of one
						family as to another. By referring to the accompanying figures, and by observing
						carefully the parts of the specimen in hand, the beginner need have little hesitation in
						deciding as to whether the description agrees with that specimen.</p>

					<p>All true insects can be separated into one or the other of two great groups, based upon
						the kind of changes or transformations which they undergo before reaching the adult or
						winged stage. To one group--the <hi rend="i">Metabola</hi>--belong those insects which
						undergo what is termed a <hi rend="i">complete metamorphosis</hi>. In this group there
						are four distinct stages--the egg, larval, pupal and imago--in the order named. No
						insect is hatched from the egg with wings, and when an insect reaches the winged stage
						it is adult, and never grows thereafter. Thus the gnats and midges are not the sons and
						daughters of the larger flies, but are full grown insects of themselves, which are
						undergoing the fourth or last stage of their lives. The second, the larval or worm-like
						stage, is the one in which the insect of this group is commonly the most injurious, for
						then it eats voraciously, and then is the only period of its life when it grows in size.
						The pupal, or third stage, is usually a quiescent one, the insect eating nothing and not
						increasing in size, <pb id="VAB8231-024" n="23"/>
						<figure>

							<p>Fig. 14. Partial metamorphosis of <hi rend="i">Melanoplus femur-rubrum</hi>,

								visible externally in 3, 3b, 3c. (After Packard.)</p>
						</figure>
						<pb id="VAB8231-025" n="24"/> but undergoing great changes of form. Thus the homely and
						often repulsive grubs, maggots and caterpillars, which are the larval forms of the
						beetles, flies and butterflies, respectively, enter the third stage as worm-like
						crawling creatures, and emerge from it as beautiful winged forms, sometimes glistening
						and gleaming with all the colors of the rainbow. This change of life and form is
						undoubtedly of great advantage to the most of this group of insects, as it tends to
						prevent the extinction of the species; since, if at a given moment the parents were
						swept out of existence, the young, living in a different station, would continue to
						represent the species.</p>
					<p>The second group, the <hi rend="i">Heterometabola</hi>, comprises those insects in
						which the <hi rend="i">metamorphosis</hi> is <hi rend="i">incomplete</hi>; the young,
						when hatched from the egg being wholly wingless and of the same general form as the
						parent. As the insect grows it moults its skin a number of times and wings develop
						gradually, there being no sharp line defining the larval and pupal stages. The young of
						all stages are called <hi rend="i">nymphs</hi> and continue active and feed from the
						time of hatching until they reach the final moult and emerge therefrom mature or in the
						imago stage. The number of moults which Orthoptera undergo varies in the different
						families. In the true locusts there are five, while cockroaches and some mantids are
						said to have as many as seven.</p>
					<p>It is to this second group, the <hi rend="i">Heterometabola</hi>, whose members undergo
						an incomplete metamorphosis, that the Orthoptera, the order of which this paper treats,
						belong. From other orders of the group, as the Hemiptera or true bugs, Odonata or
						dragonflies, etc., the Orthoptera may be known by <hi rend="i">having the wings, when
							present, net veined, four in number, the outer pair leathery or parchment-like and
							usually overlapping when at rest; the inner pair thinner, more delicate and folded in
							plaits like a fan; mouth parts biting; hind legs in the greater number of forms,
							greatly enlarged for leaping</hi>. The name Orthoptera is derived from two Greek
						words, <hi rend="i">orthos</hi>, straight, and <hi rend="i">pteron</hi>, a wing, and
						refers to the longitudinal folding of the hind wings. The fore wings, or tegmina, are
						not used in flight, the hind pair alone being used for that purpose.</p>

					<p>With the exception of the Mantids, all our Orthoptera are injurious, most of them being
						vegetable feeders. Were it not for the many natural enemies which prey upon them, they
						would <pb id="VAB8231-026" n="25"/> abound each season in such vast numbers as to prove
						a veritable scourge. These enemies are many of them parasites which live only upon
						Orthopterous forms, and when the latter are abundant the parasites also increase in
						number, and soon devastate the hordes of insects. Besides these parasites, many
						predaceous or beneficial insects feed upon locusts and crickets; and birds, both wild
						and domesticated, are exceedingly fond of them. These parasites, predaceous insects and
						birds are, therefore, of great benefit to the farmer, and he should do all in his power
						to increase their number, in order to keep within bounds the different species of
						Orthoptera.</p>

							(After Lugger.) </p>
					</figure>
					<p>V<hi rend="sc">EGETABLE</hi> P<hi rend="sc">ARASITE</hi>.--Among the most common
						parasites of locusts are two or three species of vegetable fungi, which in wet seasons
						attack them, sap their veins and in time destroy many of their tissues. One often finds,
						after a long, damp spell in late summer, many dead specimens of our larger locusts
						clinging to the tops of weeds. A close examination will show that their bodies are soft,
						and issuing from them in many places are the ends of fungus tubes. These locust fungi,
							<hi rend="i">Entomopthora calopteni</hi> Bessy, <hi rend="i">Empusa grilli</hi> Fres.,
						and <hi rend="i">Sporotrichum globuliferum</hi> Speg., for some unexplained reason often
						impel the insects affected to climb some tall weed or grass stem and cling to it with
						such tenacity that the body remains long after death. The spores given off from the
						fungus of the diseased or dead locust, are more widely scattered by this peculiar habit
						which the host insect has of climbing tall weeds, as they can the more readily be
						dispersed over wide areas. Besides these fungus parasites, other vegetable bacteria
						attack locusts in favorable seasons. But this takes place only in long warm, damp
						spells; during which the locust has sought shelter and been deprived of food. Many are
						then often congregated together and one individual affected by the disease may inoculate
						hundreds. In a dry season, the locusts and green grasshoppers are much more healthy and
						abundant and the damage which they do is much greater than in a wet one.</p>


					<pb id="VAB8231-027" n="26"/>

					<p>In our northern states the number of Orthoptera and other insects which will be present
						in any summer depends largely upon the character of the preceding winter. Most insects
						pass the winter in either the egg or the pupal stage; since these forms can readily
						withstand long and severe cold weather, in fact may be frozen solid for weeks and retain
						life and vigor, both of which are shown when warm weather and food appear again. Indeed,
						it is not an unusually cold winter, but one of successive thawings and freezings, which
						is most destructive to insect life. A mild winter encourages the growth of mold which
						attacks the hibernating larvae and pupae as soon as, from excess of rain or humidity,
						they become sickly; and it also permits the continued activity of insectivorous mammals
						and birds. Thus, moles, shrews, and field mice, instead of burying themselves deeply in
						the ground, run about freely during an open winter and destroy enormous numbers of pupæ;
						while such birds as the woodpeckers, titmice and chickadees are constantly on the alert,
						and searching in every crevice and cranny of fence and bark of tree for the hibernating
						eggs and larvæ.</p>

					<p>A<hi rend="sc">NIMAL</hi> P<hi rend="sc">ARASITES</hi>.--A number of parasites
						belonging to the animal kingdom use as their chief hosts the bodies of locusts and other
						member of the order Orthoptera. Among the more common of these animal parasites is the
						red locust mite, <hi rend="i">Trombidium locustarum</hi> Riley. On the first warm, sunny
						days of spring, as soon as the surface of the earth is fairly dry and warm, scores of
						minute "red spiders" can be seen along any pathway in the woods and fields. They are
						especially common if locusts were abundant <pb id="VAB8231-028" n="27"/> the year
						before. These red spiders are in fact mature red mites, the two sexes of which are shown
						in Fig. 17. Soon after appearing in spring, the sexes mate and the female soon deposits
						300 or more small, globular eggs at a depth of a few inches in the soil. From each of
						these eggs there hatches, about the time the young locusts appear, a minute six-legged
						mite, which runs actively about in search of some host to which it may attach itself.
						When it happens upon a young locust, it fastens itself to the wings, wing pads or
						abdomen and uses its mouth parts to suck up the fluid portions of its host. In a short
						time its body increases in size, the legs grow smaller, and the mite resembles a small,
						globular mass of blood attached to the locust. Sometimes as many as twenty mites can be
						counted on a single host. When thus infested, the locust often becomes disabled, and
						drags itself about<lb/>

						</figure><lb/> in a clumsy fashion, eats less and dies early, often before the mating
						and egg-laying season has arrived. In the swollen and almost legless condition which the
						mite soon attains, it can not move about, and so remains in one position until full
						grown, when it drops to the ground and enters the pupal stage from which it emerges as
						the "red spider-kin" of spring. It often becomes mature in late autumn and passes the
						winter in the ground where it is not idle, except when the temperature sinks below the
						freezing point. It feeds upon all sorts of soft food, and whenever it has access to the
						eggs of locusts it greedily eats them. In soil containing eggs of locusts large numbers
						of these mites congregate. They creep into every hole in search of these eggs and thrive
						upon such rich food. The great advantage of fall plowing over all <pb id="VAB8231-029"
							n="28"/> other remedies against locusts is seen in regard to these red mites, as the
						plowing of fields in which the eggs of locusts have been deposited will destroy the
						young locusts hatching from them, but not the mites, which can easily work their way
						toward the surface.</p>
					<p>Other parasitic animals besides these mites often attack the different species of
						Orthoptera. On a number of occasions I have found protruding from the abdomens of green
						grasshoppers and crickets a slender "hair worm" or "horse-hair snake," a species of <hi
							rend="i">Gordius</hi>. If the body of such grasshopper or cricket be cut open the
						interior is often found to be almost filled with this parasite, which is many times
						longer than its host, and it will be seen that all the important organs of the latter
						are pressed to one side and unable to perform their necessary functions. Locusts so
						affected are seldom able to propagate their kind.</p>
					<p>Among insect enemies of the Orthoptera, which aid largely in keeping down their
						numbers, are "Tachina Flies," "Flesh Flies," "Bee Flies," and "Blister Beetles." Tachina
						flies are mostly of a gray color, and resemble large house flies. In fields where
						locusts are abundant, one of these flies may often be seen hovering over a large
						specimen, awaiting a favorable opportunity to deposit one or more of its eggs on the
						neck or beneath the wing. These eggs hatch into larvae or maggots which eat their way
						into the body of the locust. There they seem to avoid the most vital parts, but feed
						upon the fatty secretions stored up for future use of the reproductive organs. Locusts
						so affected have a soft, flabby body, and can often be readily caught by the hand. They
						never mate, and perish much sooner than the healthy, unaffected individuals.</p>
					<p>The flesh flies of the genus <hi rend="i">Sarcophaga</hi> attack locusts, katydids and
						grasshoppers in much the same manner as do the tachina flies, and their maggots are
						often found existing as true parasites upon the vitals of these Orthopterous insects.
						When the maggots of these flies become full grown, they burrow through the body wall of
						the locust and drop to the ground, where they enter the earth and pass through the pupal
						stage from which they emerge as fully winged insects, ready for attack upon a new
						generation of locusts. <bibl>Webster (1907)</bibl> records the receiving from Wyoming of
						a large number of dead specimen of <hi rend="i">Melanoplus differentialis</hi> (Thos.)
						which had been doing much damage to alfalfa. When received the material was full of the
						maggots and pupæ of <hi rend="i">Sarcophaga georgiana</hi> Wied.</p>



					<pb id="VAB8231-030" n="29"/>

					<p>The egg clusters of locusts, crickets and other Orthoptera in the ground are often
						attacked by the larval forms of bee flies and blister beetles. The bee flies are of a
						blackish gray color, densely covered with pale yellow hairs, and in June and July may
						often be seen hovering above the ground, or feeding upon the honey of various species of
						wild flowers. Their eggs are laid among or close to the egg masses of the locust, and
						their larvæ feed upon and destroy myriads of the eggs of the locusts and crickets.</p>
					<p>A dozen or so species of blister beetles or "old fashioned potato beetles" of the
						genera <hi rend="i">Macrobasis</hi> and <hi rend="i">Epicauta</hi> occur in our Eastern
						States and in the winged or full grown stage are often very injurious to potatoes and
						allied plants. The eggs of the blister beetles are laid in the ground. in late summer,
						and the larvæ soon hatch and move actively about in search of animal food, in the form
						of egg masses of other insects. They have often been found feeding upon the eggs of
						locusts and other Orthoptera and are undoubtedly of much aid in keeping within bounds
						these injurious forms.</p>
					<figure>
						<p>Fig. 18. <hi rend="i">Macrobasis unicolor</hi> Kirby. The ash-gray blister beetle.
							Female. X 2. (After Chittenden.)</p>
					</figure>
					<p>Many of the ground beetles or Carabidæ feed, during both their larval and mature
						stages, upon locust eggs. More than 500 species of this family of beetles occur east of
						the Mississippi, and all are beneficial. In the mature stage they are long legged, rapid
						moving forms, which mostly hide by day beneath logs and rubbish and run actively about
						at night in search of some form of flesh upon which they may make a meal. Since insect
						life is the most common form which they find on or beneath the ground, it is but natural
						that most of their food is composed of it. The species of <hi rend="i">Calosoma,
							Agonoderus</hi> and <hi rend="i">Harpalus</hi>, examples of which are figured
						herewith, are among the most common and beneficial of this family of beetles. The larvæ
						of <hi rend="i">Harpalus</hi> may, in autumn, often be found feeding on the egg masses
						of the locust.</p>
					<p>Higher in the scale of animal life are many forms which are among the best friends the
						farmer possess, yet many of them he destroys on sight through ignorance of their
						beneficial habits. Chief among these are skunks, shrews, moles, salamanders, toads and
						snakes. Skunks are very fond of both grasshoppers and their <pb id="VAB8231-031" n="30"
						/> egg masses, as well as of white grubs and larvæ of many other injurious insects, and
						one can often see where they have dug small cavities in the ground in search of this
						form of food. They are regarded by the U. S. Biological Survey, which has made a special
						study of their habits, as the most useful of our wild mammals and therefore deserve
						protection rather than destruction by the farmer. Both shrews and moles are burrowing
						mammals which feed almost wholly upon insect life. True, the latter sometimes destroy
						the seeds of corn and vegetable's, but the good which they do in destroying the eggs and
						larvæ of injurious insects far outweighs the bad. Salamanders, or ground puppies, live
						beneath logs and chunks and burrow into the surrounding region in search of eggs and
						larvæ, while toads and snakes feed largely upon the young and mature of grasshoppers and
						locusts, yet all are usually destroyed at sight by farmers or their sons.</p>

					<p>More than 100 species of birds are known to use as food either the young or full grown
						individuals of many kinds of Orthoptera. The U. S. Biological Survey at Washington and
						other authorities, have made investigations of the stomachs of many species of birds,
						and have found that the following are some of the more common birds of our Eastern
						States which feed largely upon locusts and grasshoppers.</p>

					<p>Aside from the locusts or short-horned grasshoppers, few of our Orthoptera ever appear
						in such numbers as to do excessive damage. However, almost every summer there is in some
						of our Eastern States an outbreak of locusts which, for a time, cause serious loss. In
						1918 they appeared in greater numbers and were more destructive throughout Indiana than
						for many years. While <pb id="VAB8231-033" n="32"/> this work is not intended as an
						economic treatise there are four methods of preventing or dealing with a locust outbreak
						which are practical in application and of low cost. These should be known to every
						farmer and are briefly stated as follows:</p>
					<p>D<hi rend="sc">ESTROYING THE</hi> E<hi rend="sc">GGS</hi>.--This is a preventive
						measure which is practical when an outbreak is feared in any locality. It may be easily
						accomplished by either plowing, disking or cultivating in late fall or winter all waste
						lands such as roadsides, ditch banks, margins of cultivated fields, uncultivated fields
						and grassy margins along fences. Fields in young clover or alfalfa which cannot be
						plowed should be thoroughly disked in fall and harrowed in early spring. Stirring the
						soil to a depth of two or three inches will usually be sufficient, as the eggs are laid
						in clusters within that distance from the surface and the stirring breaks up the egg
						clusters, exposes them to their natural enemies or buries them so deep that the young
						never emerge.</p>

						of half hardwood sawdust and half bran, or of sawdust alone as a substitute for bran,
						gives very good results. The bait should be scattered broadcast early in the morning, at

							>RASSHOPPER</hi> C<hi rend="sc">ATCHER</hi>."--These two devices for catching
						grasshoppers where they are too plentiful have both been extensively used with great
						success. <bibl>Webster (1907)</bibl> describes a cheaply constructed but efficient
						hopperdozer as follows: "It is constructed of sheet iron, preferably galvanized, of
						reasonable thickness to insure strength, and, except for the end pieces, made of a
						single sheet ten or twelve feet long and 26 inches in width. . The front is formed by
						turning up one edge a couple of inches, and the back may be turned up a foot, thus
						making a shallow pan one foot wide, with the back the same height and with the front two
						inches high. Ends are riveted in and soldered. Runners of old wagon tire are placed at
						each end, and another in the center is turned over in the front and back to strengthen
						the pan at these points. These runners are riveted to the pan, and should extend both
						backward and forward in order to overcome to some extent the inequalities of the ground
						and cause the hopperdozer to run more smoothly. By soldering it about the heads of the
						rivets the pan will be made water-tight. A central partition six inches high will keep
						the contents from flowing to one side and running over the edge on uneven ground. The
						pan is filled with water on which is poured enough kerosene to cover it with a film, a
						horse is hitched to the end runners, and the outfit is then ready for use. As the
						hopperdozer is drawn over the ground the locusts will either jump into the kerosene and
						water direct or against the back and drop into it and there be killed. By using longer,
						wider, and heavier sheet iron a larger and stronger pan can be made and this further
						strengthened by additional runners; a horse can then be hitched to each end, or the pan
						may be mounted on low wheels. Crude oil or tar may be used instead of kerosene and
						water."</p>
					<p>The "Grasshopper Catcher" is a somewhat similar device, but instead of killing the
						locusts by having them fall into a kerosene mixture, it is arranged so that when they
						strike the upright metal back they fall to the bottom and back through a narrow trap
						opening into a screened box. This has a hinged lid and when full, the locusts can be
						easily removed into sacks and hung up to dry for poultry feed. Full details explaining
						the structure of this device are given in the Purdue circular above cited. The dried
						locusts are rich in protein and make an excellent winter food for poultry.</p>


					<pb id="VAB8231-035" n="34"/>

					<p>U<hi rend="sc">TILIZATION OF</hi> P<hi rend="sc">OULTRY</hi>.--Where locusts are
						abundant each season farmers can protect their crops and at the same time make a profit
						off the insects by keeping large flocks of poultry. This has been done many times in
						Kansas and other locust-infested States. Portable poultry yards which can be easily
						moved from one point to another will keep a flock of chickens in plentiful food and at
						the same time rid large areas of the locust pest.</p>
					<p>About the best remedy for Orthoptera on a farm is a large flock of turkeys. Under the
						leadership of an experienced gobbler, almost their entire time during the summer and
						fall months is spent in wandering over the fields and pastures in search of the fat and
						juicy nymphs of locusts, grasshoppers and crickets. Indeed, most of the luscious white
						and brown meat of our Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners was once grass, then
						grasshoppers, and finally turkey. No better and more practical remedy can be devised,
						for the damage which the insects do, especially in these days of "turkey trusts," is
						often more than compensated by the value of the pounds of flesh which this domesticated
						fowl stores up from its favorite food of locusts..</p>

					<p>As will be noted in the pages which follow, each species of Orthoptera has its favorite
						local habitat or chosen haunt, the place where it finds the struggle for existence least
						fierce, food most abundant, protection or concealment from its enemies most easy. Here
						the collector will find that species most abundant and for the beginner a few directions
						for its capture and preservation will perhaps be useful.</p>
					<p>I<hi rend="sc">NSECT</hi> N<hi rend="sc">ETS</hi>.--The most efficient device for
						taking the majority of forms of Orthoptera is a strong sweep net. The frame of the
						folding steel landing net made for fishermen and sold in most sporting-goods houses
						serves admirably for the frame of a sweep net. When unfolded it should have a diameter
						of about 16 inches; and the handle should be preferably of one piece and not over 30
						inches long. The bag should be made of light canvas or very heavy unbleached muslin and
						should be 20 to 24 inches in depth. Such a net can be easily used with one hand both in
						sweeping from side to side herbs and small shrubs as one walks leisurely along, or it
						can be used more forcibly in quick upward sweeps against the branches of larger shrubs
						and trees, thus <note id="note_006">
							<ref target="ref_006" rend="super">6</ref>For more detailed directions on this subject
							see Bruner (1895a) or Banks (1909.)</note>
						<pb id="VAB8231-036" n="35"/> jarring the insects into the net, where they can be
						captured with fingers or forceps, or by placing the mouth of the killing bottle quickly
						over them. This net also serves well instead of an umbrella as a beating receptable. For
						this purpose it is held under the foliage with one hand while the limb is struck a
						quick, sharp downward blow with a strong stick. The sweep net serves best in the capture
						of such Orthoptera as do not fly quickly as mantids, phasmids, most katydids,
						long-horned grasshoppers, tree crickets, ground and sand crickets, etc.</p>
					<figure>
						<p>Fig. 20. One form of a sweeping or beating net opened and attached to handle, with
							frame of same folded. (After Kiesenwetter.)</p>
					</figure>
					<p>For the quick flying or leaping Orthoptera, as the short-horned locusts, species of <hi
							rend="i">Scudderia</hi>, etc., a strong butterfly net with the bag of gauze, bruxelle
						or mosquito netting will be most useful. With this the insect may usually be taken by a
						quick swoop just as it rises, or by bringing the net suddenly down over it from above,
						as it rests on the ground. The thin meshed bag has the advantage of the insect being
						readily visible when captured, whereas one must open the sweep net and peer into its
						depths, thus giving many a fine specinen a chance to dart out and away. A cheap frame
						for either sweep or butterfly net can be made of a piece of heavy No. 4 or larger wire
						bent into the proper form with about three inches of each end bent in such a way that
						they can be made parallel and then forced into the end of a bamboo or other handle.</p>
					<p>Another device used by collectors is the forceps net made of two rings five or six
						inches in diameter, each with gauze stretched tightly across it, the two handles to
						which the rings are attached being hinged like a pair of large shears and the rings
						tightly fitting when closed. This net is useful in taking tree crickets and other
						Orthoptera which have been located by their song at night. <pb id="VAB8231-037" n="36"/>
						It is opened and then clapped suddenly together about the insect which is held tightly
						between the two pieces of gauze until removed. Many Orthoptera can also be taken by
						beating into an open umbrella, but quick action is usually necessary to capture the
						specimen after it is once in the ungainly receptacle.</p>
					<p>Most of the ground crickets hide by day in burrows or beneath stones, logs, piles of
						dead leaves or other debris, while roaches hide beneath loose bark or behind signs
						attached to trees. These nocturnal forms can usually easily be taken by overturning
						their cover and capturing with fingers or forceps. Mole crickets may often be found
						beneath a stone or chunk at the end of their burrows, or by digging with a spade or
						trowel into the muck about the border of a lake or pond.</p>
					<p>T<hi rend="sc">RAPPING</hi> J<hi rend="sc">ARS</hi>.--W. T. Davis and others have had
						much success in taking camel-crickets (<hi rend="i">Ceuthophilus</hi>) and other
						terrestrial species by trapping with a special molasses bait. This bait is made by
						taking a pint of cane or New Orleans molasses (not corn syrup) and adding to it a
						teaspoonful of fusel oil. Into an old tin or wide mouthed jar or bottle this bait is
						poured to a depth of about one-third of an inch. The jar is then sunk in the ground to
						the level of its mouth and a chip or flat stone placed at an incline just above it to
						keep out rain or falling debris. If visited two or three times a week many insects will
						be found which, when removed with forceps into a box, then thrown into water for half an
						hour and afterward dried, will be ready for mounting. These traps are most successful
						when placed along woodland paths, borders of fields, near an old log, a pile of stones
						or base of a cliff, especially where dead leaves or other debris occurs in quantity.</p>
					<p>N<hi rend="sc">IGHT</hi> C<hi rend="sc">OLLECTING</hi>.--Many rare species of nocturnal
						Orthoptera can best be captured by using a flash light or small camp acetylene lantern
						after night. They will then be found moving freely about over foliage or along pathways.
						Many can be located by their night song. By taking two cross-bearings, thus closely
						approximating the exact locality of the singer, it can be cautiously approached and
						captured with net or hand. Numerous species of Orthoptera are attracted by light, and
						good night collecting will often be found at the proper season beneath or near the
						electric street lights of cities and towns.</p>
					<p>K<hi rend="sc">ILLING</hi> B<hi rend="sc">OTTLES</hi>--After capturing a specimen for a
						cabinet it is best to kill it as quickly as possible before its antennæ, legs or other
						delicate appendages are broken. This is best <pb id="VAB8231-038" n="37"/> accomplished
						by the cyanide bottle, which is made by placing in a large mouthed bottle (one of the
						form shown in Fig. 21, about five inches high by two and a half in diameter, is
						preferable for Orthoptera) small broken pieces of potassium or sodium cyanide to a depth
						of two-thirds of an inch. Cover this with one-half inch of plaster paris. Moisten the
						latter with just enough water to cause it to set and hold the cyanide in place. Then
						cover with two thicknesses of blotting paper so cut as to closely fit the inside of the
						bottle. Keep the bottle tightly corked and <hi rend="i">in a place where children cannot
							reach it, as the cyanide in any form is a most deadly poison.</hi> Any Orthopteron
						placed in the bottle will usually be killed in a few minutes. Several bottles of
						different size for both large and small specimens should be taken on each day's trip.
						After six months or more the cyanide usually loses its poisonous qualities and must be
						renewed or the bottle discarded for a fresh one.</p>
					<figure>
						<p>Fig. 21. A cyanide bottle with paper strips enclosed to keep the insects from
							jostling too freely. (After Banks.)</p>
					</figure>
					<p>A small wooden or tin box with layers of felt or cotton should be taken into the field
						and after a half dozen or so specimens have been killed in the bottle they should be
						removed to this box, as they are apt to be broken if carried about for several hours.
						The cyanide bottle after being used several times for large Orthoptera will often be
						found to contain much moisture. It should then be wiped out with dry cotton and new
						pieces of blotting paper substituted for the moist ones. A large bottle with a solid
						lump or two of cyanide held in place by a mass of cotton or shreds of tissue paper can
						be temporarily used for very large specimens.</p>
					<p>After the day's collecting the specimens should be either mounted or, if away from
						home, packed for carrying or shipment. They are best transported by placing between
						layers of felt or cotton in small cigar boxes. If in a moist climate and packed too
						closely they are apt to mold in a short time. With the larger <pb id="VAB8231-039"
							n="38"/> specimens this can often be prevented by slitting the abdomen along the
						middle or sides of under surface with a pair of sharp pointed scissors and removing the
						intestines and other internal organs with a pair of forceps. Then wipe out the cavity
						with a small piece of cotton and stuff with loose raw cotton or very small pieces of
						cheese-cloth, taking care not to fill too full and distend the abdomen beyond its
						original size. Press the sides of the abdomen gently into shape and mount on a pin or
						pack for shipment. Specimens so stuffed do not become soft and turn dark, but retain
						their original color and are less apt to be attacked by museum pests or mold.</p>

					<p>L<hi rend="sc">ABELLING</hi> S<hi rend="sc">PECIMENS</hi>.--With each layer of
						specimens in a box place a label giving the date and place of capture and an accession
						number referring to a similar number in a note book giving any special data regarding
						the occurrence, song, food plant or other information concerning the specimens which may
						be of value in the future. When mounted each pin should bear below the insect a locality
						and date label and also an accession number referring to note book data. Without such
						labels a specimen is of little scientific value. Personally I would at any time rather
						have a label without a specimen than a specimen without a label. Dried specimens can be
						relaxed sufficiently for mounting by placing between thoroughly moistened layers of
						blotting paper in a tightly closed box or other receptacle for 10 or 15 hours. If the
						weather is very warm a drop or two of carbolic acid or alcohol had best be sprinkled
						over the blotting paper. The mold on specimens can be removed by using a camel's hair
						brush and alcohol to which a few drops of carbolic acid have been added.</p>

					<p>P<hi rend="sc">RESERVING THE</hi> N<hi rend="sc">ATURAL</hi> C<hi rend="sc"
						>OLORS</hi>.--Most Orthoptera retain their natural colors after drying, but the green or
						bright colored ones usually fade to a dull yellow or other hue. This can be prevented by
						placing the specimens, when first captured, in a solution of 19 parts water and one of
						commercial formalin. If on a long collecting trip, they should be packed closely enough
						to prevent jostling and should be removed, dried and mounted after two or three weeks'
						stay in the solution.</p>
					<figure>
						<p>Fig. 23. Showing manner of pinning Orthoptera, spreading wings, arranging antennæ,
							etc. (After Bruner.)</p>
					</figure>
					<p>P<hi rend="sc">INNING</hi> S<hi rend="sc">PECIMENS</hi>.--In pinning specimens of
						Orthoptera for the cabinet care should be taken to so locate and pass the pin as to hold
						solidly the insect and at the same time not interfere with its future study. In the
						locusts, katydids and other jumping forms the pin should be pushed through the right
						side of the metazona, inclining the point slightly backward so that it will pass through
						the metasternum, thereby holding the body rigidly in place. In the roaches, mantids,
						etc., it should be inserted behind the pronotum through the right tegmen near the middle
						of the body, care being taken not to run it through the base of any leg. After mounting
						and labelling, the pin should be run through the lid of a pasteboard box, or thin piece
						of cork placed on supports, far enough for the bottom of the specimen to be brought down
						to the level of the box cover or cork, the tibiae being folded back under the femora or
						the legs crossed so as to take up as little room as possible and yet be available for
						study. One specimen of each species should have the left tegmen and wing spread out and
						pinned at right angles to the body, so that the veining and color of the inner wing may
						be studied. The antennae, when long, should be bent back along the sides of the body.
						The "tray" or lid of specimens should then be placed in a drying cage, which is easily
						made by screening two sides of a narrow box standing on end with fine mesh wire, thus
						allowing the air to pass through and at the same time preventing the <pb
							id="VAB8231-041" n="40"/> specimens from becoming infested with the eggs of dermestids
						and other museum pests Small cleats tacked at intervals on the inside will serve to
						support the pasteboard trays. After drying for a week or so the specimens can be
						transferred to permanent cabinet boxes, which should be as nearly dust-proof as
						possible.</p>
					<p>Earwigs, small crickets and other minute forms should be mounted (as is the beetle in
						Fig. 24) with transparent glue or shellac on the tip of a small narrow triangular card
						through the base of which a pin has been run. Only a very small amount of the glue is
						necessary, it being most readily applied to the card with the tip of a wooden toothpick.
						The legs should be carefully spread before mounting and the body then pressed down
						firmly on the glued card, which should be placed at right angles on the left side of the
						pin with the head of the insect away from the person.</p>
					<figure>
						<p>Fig. 24. Showing method of gluing an insect on paper point. (After Banks.)</p>
					</figure>
					<p>M<hi rend="sc">USEUM</hi> P<hi rend="sc">ESTS</hi>.--On account of their bulky bodies
						Orthoptera are especially subject to the attacks of museum pests. Flakes of napthaline
						kept in each box will usually serve as a repellant for such pests. Each box should be
						examined three or four times a year, and if by dust, exuvia or other debris, the
						presence of pests is indicated, a few drops of carbon bisulphide should be poured in the
						box and the lid quickly closed. The vapor of this will soon destroy the eggs, larvæ or
						other living form of any pest.</p>

					<head rend="center">Suborder I. DERMAPTORIA.<lb/> (D<hi rend="sc">ERMAPTERA.</hi> E<hi
							rend="sc">UPLEXOPTERA.</hi>)</head>

					<p>This suborder is represented in the United States by the single family Forficulidae,
						which comprises those Orthopterous insects commonly known as "earwigs." They form a very
						compact and easily recognized group, though their relationship to other insects is
						somewhat difficult to ascertain. That they existed as far back as Mesozoic time is
						proven by their remains which have been found in the European rocks of that age, while
						in this country 20 or more fossil forms have been described by Scudder from the Tertiary
						formations of Cenozoic time, mainly from the famous Florissant Basin in South Park,
						Colorado. The first of the present living species described were placed by their author,
						Linneus, in the genus <hi rend="i">Forficula</hi> and assigned to the order Coleoptera.
						They were later shifted about from one order to another under the names Forficula,
						Forficulariae, etc., until 1831, when Latreille separated them from the other Orthoptera
						under the name Dermaptera, a name meaning "skin" + "wing" and already used by DeGeer in
						1773 for the entire group of Orthoptera. Other names since proposed for them have been
						Dermaptoptera by Burmeister and Euplexoptera by Westwood, both in 1839. By most American
						authors they have been hitherto regarded as a separate order under either the name
						Dermaptera or Euplexoptera. I prefer to treat them as a suborder of Orthoptera,
						coordinate with Cursoria, Gressoria, etc.</p>

						<p>The living species of earwigs range in length from 2.5 to 37 mm., and have the body

							heart-shaped and horizontal; mandibles strong; antennæ 10- to 35-jointed, the second

							only a portion of the abdomen. The inner wings, when present, are usually very large,
							rounded, and bear numerous radiating veins which act like the bars of a fan in folding
							and unfolding the wings. When at rest, these wings are folded both lengthwise and
							crosswise beneath the protecting tegmina. They vary much in size and development even
							in the same species, and <bibl>Burr (1910, 451)</bibl> has well said that "the
							abbreviation of the wings is a very common character among earwigs and is absolutely
							valueless as a specific character, although it somewhat alters the superficial
							appearance of the specimens." The abdomen ends in a pair of appendages which somewhat
							resemble forceps, whence the family name Forficulidæ. These doubtless represent the
							cerci of other suborders of Orthoptera, and vary much in shape according to species
							but are always more simple in the female than in the opposite sex. Were it not for
							these appendages the earwigs would resemble very closely some of the Staphylinidæ or
							rove beetles of the order Coleoptera, the semblance being increased by most species of
							each group curving the abdomen upward when disturbed. Those species which possess
							inner wings use the forceps to aid in folding these organs after flight, and they
							perhaps also aid to some extent as clasping organs during the mating of the sexes. The
							legs are of nearly equal size, the hind femora not enlarged; tarsi never more than
							three-jointed and usually without pads between the claws. No organs for producing
							sound are present, and as far as known hearing organs are also absent. The sexes are
							distinguished by the structure of the forceps, or by the number of ventral segments in
							the abdomen, there being eight in the male and six in the female. In some tropical
							species the forceps are longer than the abdomen, while in others they are noted for
							the variety of their teeth and curves.</p>
						<p>Certain earwigs possess what are known as fœtidd glands," which open at the hind
							margins of the dorsal plates of the second and third abdominal segments. From these
							they can squirt forth to a distance of three or four inches a yellowish-brown liquid
							or emulsion, having the odor of a mixture of carbolic acid and c creosote. This is
							used for defense as a repellant against their enemies.</p>
						<p><bibl>Latreille (1831)</bibl> states that: "The digestive canal of an earwig consists
							of an esophagus, a large elongated crop, and a short gizzard furnished internally for
							trituration with six ridges in the <pb id="VAB8231-045" n="44"/> form of lancets,
							separated by as many grooves. This gizzard opens by a valve into the stomach proper.
							Attached to the floor of the stomach are numerous hepatic vessels, each with a
							beak-like termination, a circumstance which removes these insects from the Coleoptera,
							where they were placed by Linnæus, and approximates them to the other Orthoptera. The
							stomach opens into a small intestine, which is followed by a cæcum and a rectum."</p>
						<p>The name "earwig" was given to these insects in Europe, where they are abundant and
							better known than in this country. There it is a common belief among peasants and the
							uneducated masses that they will, when opportunity offers, enter the ears of human
							beings and injure the sense of hearing. Such belief is, of course, nonsensical, the
							insect being wholly harmless. Howard (1902, 346) states that an early advocate of the
							doctrine of <hi rend="i">similia similibus curantur</hi>
							<ref id="ref_009" rend="super" target="note_009">9</ref> prescribed earwigs, dried,
							pulverized and mixed with the urine of a hare, as a remedy for deafness.</p>
						<p>Like the members of the family Blattidæ, the flat body enables earwigs to live in
							cracks and crannies in walls and floors, beneath rubbish and the barks of logs and
							stumps, or between the bases of the leaves and the stems of rushes and grasses. From
							these retreats they come forth only by night, some to feed upon dead insects, small
							snails and other sluggish moving forms, while others live chiefly upon decaying
							vegetable matter, but often do much damage by eating ripe fruit, tender shoots and
							corollas of flowers, etc.<ref id="ref_010" rend="super" target="note_010"> 10</ref>
							They seem to prefer damp situations, and the majority of species occur mainly among
							reeds and beneath debris near the borders of lakes, rivers or the sea. Latreille<ref
								id="ref_011" rend="super" target="note_011"> 11</ref> says: "These insects are very
							common in cool and damp places, frequently collect in troops under stones and the bark
							of trees, are very injurious to our cultivated fruits, devour even their dead
							congeners, and defend themselves with their pincers, which frequently vary in form,
							according to sex." Like other nocturnal insects they are attracted by light, and on
							the ground beneath the electric lights of cities in Florida and Old Mexico, the writer
							has found one or two of them in numbers.</p>
						<p>The female earwig is said to brood over the eggs. but to abandon the young soon after
							they are hatched. In this she resembles some of our common myriapods of the genus <hi
								rend="i">Lithobius</hi>, which are often found beneath logs and rubbish curled up
							around their eggs, <note id="note_009"><ref target="ref_009" rend="super">9</ref>Like
								things are cured by like things.</note><note id="note_010"><ref target="ref_010"

								Kingdom, 1831, IV, 5.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8231-046" n="45"/> but which are never seen in company with the young.
							Kirby and Spence, in their renowned classic (1859, 204), citing <bibl>DeGeer (1773,
								548)</bibl>, mention this habit as follows: "This curious insect so unjustly
							traduced by a vulgar prejudice, approaches the habits of the hen in her care of her
							family. She absolutely sits upon her eggs as if to hatch them, and guards them with
							the greatest care. DeGeer, having found an earwig thus occupied, removed her into a
							box where was some earth, and scattered the eggs in all directions. She soon, however,
							collected them one by one with her jaws into a heap, and assiduously sat upon them as
							before. The young ones, which resemble the parent except in wanting elytra and wings,
							and, strange to say, are as soon as born larger than the eggs which contained them,
							immediately upon being hatched creep like a brood of chickens under the belly of the
							mother, who very quietly suffers them to push between her feet, and will often, as
							DeGeer found, sit over them in this posture for some hours." <bibl>Fischer (1853,
								62)</bibl> also states that "the female lays the eggs, guards and even carries them
							about, so that they can always enjoy the moisture necessary for their
							development."</p>
						<p>About 400 species of earwigs have been described, mostly from tropical and
							semitropical countries, where they are common in the cities along the sea coast. Many
							of the species are cosmopolitan in distribution, their form enabling them to hide
							readily in the crevices of ships and their cargoes, and thus be borne to all parts of
							the earth. Inland, especially in temperate and cold regions, they are scarce. In
							Indiana, for example, only three species are known, and in all Canada but one, while
							in Florida 9 of the 12 species hereafter treated have been taken. Their wide
							distribution by commerce has led to much confusion in synonymy, some of the species
							having been described under a dozen or more names.</p>
						<p>Only 15 native or established species of earwigs are at present known from America
							north of Mexico. Of these 12, belonging to three subfamilies, occur in the territory
							covered by this work. The principal literature treating of these is as follows:<ref

								<p>The types of R. &amp; H. were taken by W. T. Davis, May 2, 1912, from the South

									South Bay, between the water and the thick growth of custard-apple trees, and on
									the low tangled vegetation bordering this path we found D. <hi rend="i"
										>davisi</hi> in considerable numbers." On March 2, 1913, this slender-bodied
									earwig was first seen by the writer when three pairs were taken on the north
									margin of Lake Okeechobee. On March 8 two additional males were found at Pelican
									Bay on the southeastern shore of the lake. At both places it was beaten or swept
									from vegetation within 50 feet of the border of the lake.</p>
								<p>In 1918 a second trip was made by me to Lake Okeechobee, one of the objects in
									view being a search for additional specimens of <hi rend="i">Doru davisi</hi>. On
									March 2, a single specimen was accidentally discovered while sifting for beetles
									in a low wet tract about five miles southeast of Moore Haven. The place where
									found was part of the old custard-apple margin of the lake, now drained and partly

									<pb id="VAB8231-058" n="57"/> the earwig was finally found to be between the bases

									almost exclusively covers thousands of acres of the Everglade Region south and

									just below the surface of the ground and shaking them over a rubber cloth. This
									incident is but evidence of the fact that almost any insect supposed to be rare is

								<p>While adventive examples of this cosmopolitan species have been recorded a number
									of times from the eastern United States, it did not become established as a
									resident member of our fauna until about 1912, when a colony appeared at Newport,
									Rhode Island, which was first reported by Glaser <bibl>(Psyche, XXI, 1914,
										157)</bibl>. This has increased so rapidly in numbers and threatens to become
									such a pest that a special bulletin<ref id="ref_016" rend="super"

										June 18, 1917.</note>
									<pb id="VAB8231-059" n="58"/> prepared and issued by the U. S. Bureau of
									Entomology. In this it is stated that the sexes mate in late autumn, the male
									dying soon after. The female soon deposits 50 to 90 eggs in the ground and then
									hibernates near them at a depth of two to eight inches, those which survive
									emerging in the spring to attend the larvæ in their early stages. The young appear
									about May 5th, and, passing through four larval stages, become adults by the
									middle of July. As larvæ they feed on the tender green shoots of clover, grass,
									lima beans and on the buds and petals of dahlias, roses and other cultivated
									plants. The adults feed largely on the stamens and petals of flowers, doing
									immense damage where present in such numbers as at Newport, where Jones says that
									on one estate, when the porch awnings were let down each morning, over a quart of
									the earwigs dropped out and were swept up and burned, and that 300 specimens were
									seen by him at one time in one of the servants' halls. By 1916 the colony had
									spread over ten square miles of territory. As remedies poison baits of stale bread
									and Paris green proved very effective in early spring, and poison and contact
									sprays later in the season.</p>
								<p>In my former work (1903, 171) I recorded this earwig, on the authority of
										<bibl>Rehn (1903, 125)</bibl>, as having been taken at Lafayette, Ind., by the
									late F. M. Webster. <bibl>Caudell (1907a, 170)</bibl>, has shown that the
									specimens so recorded were taken by Webster in Tasmania. <bibl>Burr (1897,
										16)</bibl> states that in England <hi rend="i">auricularia</hi> is well known to
									every one and is quite ubiquitous, but its home seems to be under bark of trees,
									planks, stones, on flowers, fruit, etc. <bibl>Latreille (1831, 6)</bibl> says that
									the two sexes of this species when in coitu, are united end to end, a statement
									not substantiated by any other author.</p>
								<p>Aside from the species above considered but one other earwig has been recorded
									from the eastern United States. This was an adventive example of <hi rend="i"

					<p>This suborder, as characterized in the key, p. 41, contains only one family, the

						from the Latin and meaning "runner," was first used by <bibl>Latreille (1817)</bibl> to
						comprise all the non-saltatorial Orthoptera, or the earwigs, cockroaches, mantids and
						walking-sticks. Westwood in 1839 restricted the name Cursoria to the Blattidæ or
						cockroaches, giving to the other groups the names Euplexoptera (Forficulidæ),
						Ambulatoria (Phasmidæ) and Raptoria (Mantidæ). Fieber, in 1853, united the last two in
						the one suborder Gressoria. The characters of the suborder Cursoria are those of its

						</q>

						<p>The members of the family Blattidæ, commonly known as cockroaches, may be known from
							the other families of non-saltatorial Orthoptera by their depressed, oval form; by
							their nearly horizontal head which, when at rest, is bent under and almost concealed
							by the broad pronotum, so that the mouth projects back between the bases of the first
							pair of legs; by their slender, depressed legs of almost equal length and size, and by
							the absence of either ovipositor or forcipate appendages at the end of the
							abdomen.</p>
						<p>They have the antennæ setaceous, rarely swollen and plumose near base, inserted just
							below the middle of the eyes, composed of very many exceedingly short segments and
							often longer than the body; mandibles strong, toothed; maxille with 5- and labium with
							3-jointed palpi; eyes usually large, reniform, finely facetted; ocelli or simple eyes
							usually present in the fully winged forms, located near the inner borders of the
							antennal sockets, absent or greatly reduced in size when the wings are abbreviated or
							wanting, and then often represented by small, pale ocellar spots; pronotum generally
							more or less elliptical or suborbicular, with rounded angles, and often projecting
							over the head; tegmina <pb id="VAB8231-061" n="60"/> membranous, corneous or leathery,
							usually more or less translucent and, when well developed, overlapping along their
							sutural margins; in the female of many species rudimentary or sometimes wholly
							wanting. Four main veins or nervures arise near the basal margin of each tegmen, their
							position and names being shown in Fig. 30. The wings are always shorter than the
							tegmina, but are usually fully developed when the latter are long, though sometimes,
							even then, rudimentary or absent. When the tegmina are reduced in size, the wings are
							correspondingly smaller. They are membranous in structure, often very delicate, the
							names and position of their principal veins being shown in the accompanying digram,
							Fig. 30.</p>

						<p>The abdomen is large, broad, and composed of ten segments, each with a dorsal and a
							ventral plate ; however, only seven or eight of these are usually visible. The wing of
							first one behind the metanotum above is known as the <hi rend="i">median dorsal</hi>
							segment, the next as the <hi rend="i">basal</hi> or <hi rend="i">first dorsal</hi>
							segment. In the males of many species one or both of these have the upper surface more
							or less specialized or modified. The tenth dorsal plate is known as the <hi rend="i"
								>supra-anal</hi> and its shape and structure are much used in classification. Nine
							ventral plates are visible in the male and seven in the female, the last one in both
							sexes being known as the <hi rend="i">subgenital</hi> plate. This in the male usually
							bears near its apex two small unjointed appendages called <hi rend="i">styles</hi>.
							The tenth dorsal segment also bears a pair of jointed appendages known as <hi rend="i"
								>cerci</hi>, which vary much according to species, in length, number of joints, etc.
							The rings or segments of the abdomen overlap each other and are capable of great
							extension and depression, so that these insects seem to be pre-eminently fitted <pb
								id="VAB8231-062" n="61"/> for living in the narrow crevices and cracks which they
							inhabit. This peculiar structure was doubtless acquired when living beneath stones and
							bark before man came into being, and has enabled them, like the earwigs, to hide in
							the crevices of ships and especially in cargoes of fruit, and tropical and
							semitropical forms have thus been scattered to all parts of the earth.</p>
						<p>The legs of a cockroach are of a peculiar structure in that they have the coxæ very
							large and flattened, thus serving to protect the ventral surface of the thorax; femora
							long, compressed, their lower border with two keels or margins which are usually armed
							with spines, these varying much in size and number; tibiæ heavily armed with spines
							both above and beneath; tarsi 5-jointed, the first joint much the longest, the last
							one with two claws, with or without a lobe or arolium between them, the others usually
							each with a pad or pulvillus beneath. The structure of the legs enables the
							cockroaches to run with such great swiftness that they seldom use the wings in trying
							to escape pursuit, and has given the name Cursoria or runners to the suborder of which
							they form the only family.</p>
						<p>From the other Orthoptera the Blattidæ differ widely in the manner of oviposition, as
							the eggs are not laid one at a time, but all at once in a peculiar capsule or egg case
							called an oӧheca. These capsules vary in the different species as regards the size,
							shape, and the number of eggs they contain, but they are all very similar in structure
							(Fig. 31). Each one is divided lengthwise by a membranous partition into two cells.
							Within each of these cells is a single row of cylindrical pouches, somewhat similar in
							appearance to those of a cartridge belt, and within each pouch is an egg.</p>
						<figure>
							<p>Fig. 31. Oӧtheca of <hi rend="i">Periplaneta americana</hi> (L.) <hi rend="i"
									>a</hi>, side; <hi rend="i">b</hi>, end view. Natural size indicated by outline
								figure. (After Howard.)</p>
						</figure>
						<p>The female cockroach often runs about for several days with an oӧtheca protruding
							from the abdomen, but finally drops it in a suitable place and from it the young, in
							time, emerge. While this method of oviposition is the one practiced by all the species
							of common occurrence in the United States, there seem to be exceptions to it, as Dr.
							C. V. Riley has recorded (1891a) the fact of an introduced tropical species, <hi
								rend="i">Panchlora cubensis</hi> (Sauss.), being viviparous, the young emerging
							alive from the body of the parent, <pb id="VAB8231-063" n="62"/> and a careful
							dissection of the latter showing no trace of either eggs or oӧtheca.</p>
						<p><bibl>Shelford (1906, 235)</bibl> states that "the position of the oӧtheca when
							carried by the female before deposition is not a character of <hi rend="i"
								>subfamily</hi> importance." I do not regard it as even a character of <hi rend="i"
								>specific</hi> importance, for in two females of each of two species of <hi rend="i"
								>Parcoblatta</hi> at hand with oӧtheca protruding, viz., <hi rend="i">uhleriana</hi>
							and <hi rend="i">pennsylvanica</hi>, one of each has the oӧtheca projecting with edge
							uppermost, the suture above, the other with side uppermost, the suture at side.
								<bibl>Hebard (1917a, 4)</bibl> has also recorded the females of <hi rend="i">P.
								pennsylvanica</hi> "with oӧtheca both dorsad and laterad," and has mentioned also
							two closely related species of <hi rend="i">Cariblatta</hi> with similar
							conditions.</p>
						<p>All young cockroaches resemble the parent in form, but are wholly wingless, the wings
							not appearing until after the fifth or last moult. The young are often mistaken for
							the mature by persons who have not made a careful study of the life history of the
							insects; and those of one or two well known and common forms have, in the past, been
							described or figured as distinct wingless species by some of the leading Entomologists
							of the country.</p>
						<p>Most roaches are omnivorous but they live chiefly upon animal and vegetable refuse.
							The majority of our species, especially those which are natives, live under leaves,
							bark and other cover in the country, but many of the introduced species are
							domiciliary and where present in numbers are among the worst of insect household
							pests. In Brazil they are so common in country houses that nobody pays much attention
							to them. There they have, says Herbert H. Smith, "an unpleasant way of getting into
							provision boxes and they deface books, shoes and sometimes clothing, and eat off the
							wall paper in unsightly patches in search of the paste beneath. At Corumba, in the
							house where we were staying there were nearly a dozen children, and every one of them
							had their eyelashes more or less eaten off by the cockroaches, a large brown
							species. The eyelashes were bitten off irregularly, in some places quite close to the
							lid, and as the children had very long black eyelashes, their appearance thus
							defaced was odd enough."</p>

						<p>R<hi rend="sc">EMEDIES</hi> F<hi rend="sc">OR</hi> R<hi rend="sc">OACHES</hi>.--A
							common remedy for roaches consists in the liberal use of pyrethrum powder or buhach,
							and when this is persisted in considerable relief will be gained. It is not a perfect
							remedy, however, and is at best but a temporary expedient, while it has the additional
							disadvantage of soiling the shelves or other objects over which it is dusted. When
							used it should be fresh and liberally applied. Roaches are <pb id="VAB8231-064" n="63"
							/> often paralyzed by it when not killed outright, and the morning after an
							application the infested premises should be gone over and all the dead or partially
							paralyzed roaches swept up and burned. Flour of sulphur dusted about where roaches
							abound has proven very effective as a repellent.</p>
						<p>Another remedy which may be used for any of the household species is a mixture of
							plaster of Paris, one part, and flour, three or four parts; in a saucer, and placed
							where the roaches abound, with another flat plate nearby, containing pure water, both
							supplied with several bridges to give easy access, and one or two thin boards floating
							on the water touching the margin. The insects readily eat the mixture, become thirsty
							and drink, when the plaster sets and clogs the intestines. The insects disappear in a
							few weeks, the bodies no doubt being eaten by the survivors.</p>
						<p>There are many proprietary substances which claim to be fairly effective roach
							poisons. The only one of these that has given very satisfactory results is a
							phosphorous paste, also sold in the form of pills. It consists of sweetened flour
							paste containing 1 to 2 per cent. of phosphorus, and is spread on bits of paper or
							cardboard and placed in the runways of the roaches. It is also a repellent.</p>
						<p>For no other insects have so many quack remedies been urged and are so many newspaper
							remedies published. Many of them have their good points, but the majority are
							worthless. In fact, rather than put faith in half of those which have been published,
							it were better to rely on the recipe current among the Mexicans : <q rend="blockquote">
								<p>"T<hi rend="sc">O</hi> G<hi rend="sc">ET</hi> R<hi rend="sc">ID OF</hi> C<hi
										rend="sc">OCKROACHES</hi>.--Catch three and put them in a bottle, and so carry
									them to where two roads cross. Here hold the bottle upside down, and as they fall
									out repeat aloud three <hi rend="i">credos</hi>. Then all the cockroaches in the
									house from which these three came will go away."</p>
							</q></p>

						<p>To the paleontologist interested in tracing back the ancestry of insects, the
							Blattidæ become at once a group of surpassing interest, for the oldest known insect is
							a fossil cockroach, <hi rend="i">Palæoblatta douvillei</hi> Brogn., from the Silurian
							sandstone of France. Between 130 and 140 fossil species of the family are known from
							the Paleozoic rocks of the United States, principally from the Carboniferous
							formations, but some from all ages as far back as the middle Silurian. That most
							eminent authority on insect paleontology, S. H. Scudder, has written of the cockroach:
							"Of no other type of insect can it be said that it occurs at every horizon where
							insects have been found in any numbers; in no group whatever can the changes wrought
							by time be so carefully and completely studied as here; none other has furnished more
							important evidence concerning the phylogeny of insects."</p>
						<p>The Blattidæ are pre-eminently tropical insects, and though abundantly represented in
							individuals, the number of species inhabiting the United States is comparatively few,
							but 43 and one variety being treated in Hebard's Monograph of the Group. These <pb
								id="VAB8231-065" n="64"/> are divided among nine subfamilies and 26 genera. Aside
							from several subtropical forms, which are often introduced in bananas and other fruit,
							but which soon die, and are, therefore, considered only as adventives, 30 species and
							two varieties or races are recognized as residents of the territory covered by this
							work. These represent ten of the subfamilies and 19 of the genera recognized by
							Hebard. Of the 30 species, 12 are established adventives, the other 18 being native or
							indigenous species, as are also the two races. In addition to these, three of the
							adventive species representing one additional subfamily and two genera, are included,
							as they are so frequently introduced with tropical fruits that they will probably be
							seen by many of our future students.</p>
						<p>Aside from the general works on Orthoptera cited in the Bibliography, the principal
							literature treating more or less extensively of the Blattidæ occurring in the Eastern
							United States is as follows:</p>
						<p><bibl>Saussure, 1863, 1869a, 1870, 1872</bibl>; <bibl>Brunner, 1865</bibl>;<bibl>
								Rehn, 1903, 1903a, 1903b</bibl>; <bibl>Shelford, 1906, 1907, 1907a, 1908, 1908a,
								1910a</bibl>; <bibl>Rehn &amp; Hebard, 1910</bibl>; <bibl>Caudell, 1913</bibl>;
								<bibl>Hebard, 1916a, 1916b, 1916c, 1917a</bibl>.</p>
						<p>The following key to subfamilies is mainly a composite of parts of those of
								<bibl>Scudder (1897c, 12)</bibl>, <bibl>Caudell (1913, 600)</bibl> and <bibl>Hebard
								(1917a, 11-22)</bibl>, the last named being a key to genera and species only. It
							must be remembered that a subfamily is only an artificial individual concept created
							for the purpose of facilitating the systematic naming of the species of any group.
							Subfamilies do not exist in nature and the recognition of them here is only to render
							shorter and more easily followed the keys to the genera of which they are composed.
							The characters of chief importance generally used in separating the subfamilies of
							Blattidæ are those pertaining to the armature of the lower border of the femora, the
							structure of the tegmina and wings, the form of the supra-anal and subgenital plates
							and the presence or absence of arolia and pulvilli. To these have been added other
							characters pertaining to size, color, etc., in order to enable beginners to more
							easily place their specimens.</p>

								<p>Abundant throughout Indiana, especially, in the cities and towns; Moore Haven and

									in a hotel cupboard <bibl>(<hi rend="i">Hebard</hi>, 1917a, 59)</bibl>. Ranges
									throughout the United States and the greater part of Canada, being most abundant
									in the Central States. In addition to the two common names already given it is
									known as the "Water Bug," and <bibl>Burr (1897, 24)</bibl> states that in Russia
									it is called the "Preussenschabe" or Prussian Roach, while in Germany it is known
									as the "Russen" or Russian Roach. Piers <bibl>(1918, 247)</bibl> says that the
									local name in Nova Scotia is the "Yankee settler."</p>
								<p>In Indiana and the Eastern United States it is best known as the "Croton bug," so
									called because it made its appearance in New York City in numbers about the time
									the Croton Aqueduct was completed. It is a native of Central Europe, but like the
									Oriental roach, has become cosmopolitan. In Europe it is found in woods as well as
									in houses. In America it seldom, if ever, occurs in numbers in the country, but is
									one of the worst insect pests with which the inhabitants of the larger cities of
									the United States <pb id="VAB8231-075" n="74"/> have to deal. It is the most
									fecund of all roaches and the seasons of mating and hatching of the young are
									perhaps, more irregular than in any other species. Adult forms are evidently to be
									found at all seasons of the year, as I have taken them in December, April and
									October. It is not so much a lover of filthy surroundings as is the Oriental
									roach, and hence frequents more often than that species the dwellings of the
									better class of people. It delights in warm, moist places, and is especially
									abundant and destructive in buildings which are heated by steam. As an evidence of
									its abundance under favorable conditions it may be stated that in 1890 a single
									person captured for me over 30 adult specimens and fully half that number of
									young, in less than ten minutes, in the kitchen of the leading hotel of the city
									of Terre Haute. Where it once obtains a foothold and the surroundings of
									temperature and food supply are favorable, it is almost impossible to eradicate,
									as its small flattened form enables it to hide and breed in cracks and crevices
									which none of the other roaches can enter.</p>

								<p>Like many other omnivorous animals, Croton bugs find in wheaten flour a food
									substance which is rich in nutrition and easily digested, and so they prefer wheat
									breads and starchy materials to all other foods. On account of this liking they
									often do much harm to cloth bound books by gnawing their covers in search of the
									paste beneath.</p>
								<p>They also seem to have a peculiar liking for paints of various kinds, and Glover
										<bibl>(1875, 132)</bibl>, states that in his office "They made a raid on a box
									of water colors where they devoured the cakes of paint, vermilion, cobalt and
									umber alike; and the only vestiges left were the excrements in the form of small
									pellets of various colors in the bottom of the box."</p>



								<pb id="VAB8231-076" n="75"/>

								<p>The oötheca of the Croton bug is very light brown, a little over twice as long as
									broad, 7.5x3.5 mm., with the sides somewhat flattened and the edges parallel.
									Within it the eggs, thirty-six in number, are arranged in the usual two rows. It
									is carried about by the mother roach for several days with from half to
									three-fourths of its length protruding from the abdomen, and when dropped in a
									favorable place the young, evidently very soon, emerge from it; for in a bottle in
									which a female with protruding oötheca was placed at eleven o'clock p. m. the
									young were found to have emerged on the following morning at eight. They were then
									wholly white, except the lateral edges of the abdomen, where a blackish tinge was
									evident. By five o'clock in the afternoon of the same day, having meanwhile eaten
									their fill of moistened wheaten bread, they had become too large for their skins,
									and had moulted for the first time. They then measured 3 mm. in length, and the
									head, pronotum, abdomen, and apical half of antennæ were black, while the other
									two thoracic rings and the basal half of antennæ were a grayish white. The half
									grown young are very dark brown, with the first four or five segments bordered
									with yellow, and with traces of a lighter median stripe.</p>

								<p>This handsome native species, described by Brunner in 1865 from "Amerique du

									taken by me on May 28 and June 18 beneath logs in a low sandy woods near Terre
									Haute, Ind. These I soon afterwards described and recorded (1893a, 160) as <hi

									female was captured while feeding upon a fleshy fungus (<hi rend="i"
									>Agaricus</hi>) in dense woods eight miles west of Terre Haute, in Marshall Co.,
									Ill.; while in June, 1902, a number were taken from beneath flat stones and
									rubbish on the tops of high hills near Wyandotte Cave, Crawford Co., Ind. These
									and the Vigo Co. specimens were described and recorded by me (1903, 177). Since
									that date the species has been found to be widely distributed over the Eastern
									United States, its known range being from West Creek, N. J., and Enola, Pa., west
									and south to Ottawa, Kansas, and Victoria, Texas.</p>

								<p>Twelve species, all native to America, are recognized by Hebard, nine of which
									occur in the Eastern United States. Until Hebard issued his excellent Monograph
									(1917a), the species of this genus, as far as synonymy goes, were a badly mixed
									lot. This was due to the fact that the sexes differ so widely in appearance that
									they have been described as different species, and often placed in wholly
									different genera. Most of the original descriptions were made by foreign
									entomologists, who never saw a specimen in the field, and for that reason knew
									nothing of the relationship of the different individuals before them. However, the
									two sexes are so seldom found mating, that even the field naturalists cannot be
									certain as to their relationship. Previous to 1903, Saussure, followed by Scudder,
									had described both sexes of <hi rend="i">Temnopteryx</hi> as being short-winged,
									and the females of several species of <hi rend="i">Parcoblatta</hi> had been
									described as distinct species and placed in that genus. They had also stated in
									their "Keys to genera of Blattinæ" that in the genus <hi rend="i">Ischnoptera
										(Parcoblatta</hi> of Hebard) the "tegmina are completely developed or in the
									female rarely abbreviate." In my work of 1903 I first showed that the males of <hi
										rend="i">Temnopteryx</hi> were macropterous, and first properly correlated <pb
										id="VAB8231-079" n="78"/> the sexes of <hi rend="i">Parcoblatta
										pennsylvanica</hi>, and also concluded as the result of extended field work and
									comparisons, "that the species of <hi rend="i">Phyllodromia</hi> and <hi rend="i"
										>Temnopteryx</hi> listed<ref id="ref_018" rend="super" target="note_018"
										>18</ref> by Scudder in his Catalogue (1900, 8) are but the females of certain
									species of <hi rend="i">Ischnoptera</hi>," and they were first so placed, though
									not always correctly as to species, in my "Orthoptera of Indiana."</p>
								<p><bibl>Rehn &amp; Hebard (1910)</bibl>, in studying all their known species of
									North American <hi rend="i">Ischnoptera (Parcoblatta)</hi>, followed up this
									problem of sex correlation, and when through stated that "every species of the
									genus known from within our limits has the sexes correlated, with the result that
										<hi rend="i">Temnopteryx</hi> and <hi rend="i">Loboptera</hi> (with the
									exception of one species) are eliminated from our fauna." They failed, however, to
									properly place the sexes of several species, and thus left the group still very
									much confused.</p>
								<p>Hebard has shown that the males of each species of <hi rend="i">Parcoblatta</hi>
									have one or more of the dorsal abdominal segments modified or "specialized" in a
									different way, and has used this as the principal character in separating that
									sex. Since the removal or spreading of both tegmina and wings is necessary to see
									this character, and since the specialization is more or less microscopic in
									nature, an attempt has been made in this work to separate the males by more
									obvious characters, but the modification of the segments for each species is
									mentioned either in the key or in the descriptions.</p>

										>Ischnoptera intricata</hi> sp. nov. (1903, 186). Those from Crawford Co. were
									found beneath cover on the slopes of high wooded hills, those from Steuben Co.
									beneath chunks near the border of a lake, two of the females (Aug. 7) with oötheca
									protruding. In Florida <hi rend="i">P. uhleriana</hi> is known only from Pablo

									Massachusetts <pb id="VAB8231-083" n="82"/> and Saginaw Bay, Mich., west to Iowa
									City, Iowa, and south to Florida and Mississippi.</p>
								<p>This is essentially a forest-loving species, usually occurring beneath leaves and
									other debris on or along the borders of heavy hardwood timber. The males are often
									attracted to light and the females to a bait of molasses. The latter sex appears
									to be much the more abundant, especially in Indiana, and 994 of the 1232 adult
									specimens examined by Hebard were females. The short separated tegmina and shining
									black color easily distinguishes them from allied species, while the males are

								<p>In Indiana the Pennsylvania wood-roach is the most common of our native species,
									having been taken in the State wherever collections have been made, beneath the
									loose bark of logs and old stumps. It is usually seen in the wingless stages, the
									mature individuals being common only from May 15th to October. The half grown
									young are of a shining, dark brown color, the dorsal surface of thoracic segments
									often paler. As the long-winged males are attracted by light, country houses are
									often badly <pb id="VAB8231-088" n="87"/> infested with them; and where food is
									scarce, the wall paper is sometimes much injured for the sake of the paste
									beneath. What the hordes of young which dwell under the bark of logs live upon is
									a question as yet unsettled, but the larvæ of other insects undoubtedly form a
									portion of their food, as in two instances I have found them feeding upon the dead
									grubs of a <hi rend="i">Tenebrio</hi> beetle; while living as well as decaying
									vegetable matter probably forms the other portion. The mating of the imagoes
									probably occurs in late spring and early summer, the newly hatched young being
									most abundant from mid-August until December. Females with oötheca protruding have
									been taken as early as May 19th and as late as September 3d. The young in various
									stages of growth survive the winter in the places mentioned, they being the most
									common insects noted in the woods at that season. Cold has seemingly but little
									effect upon them, as they scramble away almost as hurriedly when their protective
									shelter of bark is removed on a day in mid-January with the mercury at zero, as
									they do in June when it registers 100 degrees in the shade.</p>

								<p>The empty oötheca of this species are very common objects beneath the loose bark
									of logs and especially beneath the long flakes of the shellbark hickory. They are
									chestnut brown in color, from 5 to 9 mm. in length by 4 mm. in breadth, and are
									much less flattened than those of <hi rend="i">Blattella germanica</hi>. The
									dorsal or entire edge is slightly curved, or bent inward, after the fashion of a
									small bean, while the other edge is minutely serrate. The young, after hatching,
									evidently escape in the same manner as do those of the Oriental roach, as no break
									is visible in the empty capsule. The tegmina of the female are more variable in
									length than in other of our native species of Blattidæ, in two Indiana specimens
									at hand reaching the apex of the 7th dorsal segment, while in two others they
									cover only one-third the abdomen.</p>

								<p>Ranges from New Jersey and Pennsylvania, south and west to Thomasville, Ga., and

									of specific value separating this form from <hi rend="i">pennsylvanica</hi> has
									been pointed out by Rehn &amp; Hebard in either their 1910 or 1916 papers, and the
									only one given by <bibl>Hebard (1917a)</bibl> is the lack of specialization in the
									basal abdominal segment of <hi rend="i">divisa</hi>. <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1916,
										115)</bibl>, state that "<hi rend="i">divisa</hi> is clearly a derivative of the
										<hi rend="i">pennsylvanica</hi> stock representing an adaptation of that type in
									the lower country of the southeastern States as <hi rend="i">I. p. inæqualis</hi>
									is in the central States," the difference being that intergraded specimens have
									been found between <hi rend="i">inæqualis</hi> and <hi rend="i">pennsylvanica</hi>
									but not between the latter and <hi rend="i">divisa</hi>. <bibl>Hebard (1917a,
										134)</bibl> states that "due to the decided individual variation found in <hi
										rend="i">divisa</hi> and the very great plasticity in <hi rend="i"
										>pennsylvanica</hi>, rare females are most difficult to distinguish, as in them
									great convergence in many features usually of distinct value occurs." The
									measurements as given under the two forms show that in every case the maximum in
										<hi rend="i">divisa</hi> is greater than the minimum in <hi rend="i"
										>pennsylvanica</hi>, and in several <pb id="VAB8231-090" n="89"/> instances both
									minimum and maximum of <hi rend="i">divisa</hi> fall between those of <hi rend="i"
										>pennsylvanica</hi>. Taking these facts into consideration and after examining
									both forms as represented in the Davis and Philadelphia collections, I believe
									that <hi rend="i">divisa</hi> is but a southern race or variety of <hi rend="i"
										>pennsylvanica</hi> and have so placed it above. Two females of <hi rend="i"

								<p>In Indiana the Oriental roach is found in all the larger towns and cities, and is
									one of the most noisome and disagreeable insects with which certain classes of
									their inhabitants have to contend. It seldom occurs in houses in thinly settled
									localities, and never, as far as my observation goes, beneath the bark of logs and
									stumps. In Florida it probably occurs in the larger towns throughout the State,
									but is recorded only from Miami and West Palm Beach <bibl>(<hi rend="i"
											>Caudell</hi>, 1905, 216)</bibl>. It is a cosmopolitan species which has
									spread throughout the tropical and temperate zones and is known in this country
									from Halifax, N. S., Toronto, Ontario, and New Haven, Conn., west to Minnesota and
									Southern California and south to Florida and Texas. <bibl>Hebard (1917a,
										176)</bibl> states that in Philadelphia it appears in swarms during the month of
									May co-incident with the arrival of the shad in the Delaware River, and is
									therefore locally known as the Shad Roach.</p>

								<p>As its name. indicates, the Oriental roach is a native of Asia, but has been
									carried from one country to another by shipping. It delights in filth and
									darkness, and hence in the holds of vessels, the cellars and basements of tenement
									houses and in all damp, dirty places it swarms by thousands, undoubtedly doing
									much good as a scavenger, but infinitely more harm on account of its omnivorous
									and insatiable appetite. Like most other members of the family, it feeds mainly at
									night, appearing to detest and avoid light, as one can readily prove by taking a
									lighted lamp suddenly into its haunts, when a hurried scrambling will take place
									toward its daylight retreats, and but a few <pb id="VAB8231-097" n="96"/> moments
									will elapse before the last of the busy marauders will have disappeared. Of this
									and other species <bibl>Marlatt (1902)</bibl> has written: <q rend="blockquote">
										<p>"The damage they do is not only in the products actually consumed, but in the
											soiling and rendering nauseous of everything with which they come in contact.
											They leave, wherever they occur in any numbers, a fetid, nauseous odor, well
											known as the 'roachy' odor, which is persistent, and can not be removed from
											shelves and dishes without washing with soap and boiling water. Food supplies
											so tainted are beyond redemption. This odor comes partly from their excrement,
											but chiefly from a dark colored fluid exuded from the mouth of the insect,
											with which it stains its runways, and also in part, doubtless, from the scent
											glands, which occur on the bodies of both sexes between certain segments of
											the abdomen, and which secrete an oily liquid possessing a very characteristic
											and disagreeable odor. It frequently happens that shelves on which dishes are
											placed become impregnated with this roachy odor, and this is imparted to and
											retained by dishes to such an extent that everything served in them,
											particularly liquids, as coffee or tea, will be noticed to have a peculiar,
											disgusting, foreign taste and odor, the source of which may be a puzzle and
											will naturally be supposed to come from the food rather than from the
											dish."</p>
									</q></p>

								<p>The Oriental roach is probably the most carnivorous of all our Blattidæ, though,
									like most others, it is fond of starchy food. It is known to feed upon meat,
									cheese, woolen clothes, and even old leather, and is said to be especially fond of
									the festive "bed-bug," <hi rend="i">Acanthia lectularia</hi> L., which soon
									disappears from a house infested with the Oriental roach. This roach is, however,
									far too great a nuisance in itself to be introduced as a means of eradicating even
									the bed-bug.</p>
								<p>The eggs of the Oriental roach are sixteen in number, and the large, horny
									capsule or oötheca in which they are packed is carried about by the mother for a
									week or longer when she drops it in a warm and sheltered place. Along one side of
									the capsule, which resembles in form and color a diminutive seed of the papaw, <hi
										rend="i">Asimina triloba</hi> Duval, is a seam where the two edges are cemented
									closely together. When the young are hatched they excrete a liquid which dissolves
									the cement and enables them to escape without assistance, leaving their infantile
									receptacle as entire as it was before they quitted it.</p>
								<p>This species is notably gregarious in habit, the individuals living together in
									colonies in the most friendly way, the small ones being allowed by the larger ones
									to sit on them, run over them and nestle beneath them without a show of
									resentment. The young pass through a variable number, sometimes as many as seven,
										<pb id="VAB8231-098" n="97"/> moults, the skin splitting along the back and the
									insect emerging white and soft, but soon hardening and assuming its normal
									color.</p>

								<p>This, one of the two native species of the subfamily, abounds throughout Florida,
									including the southern keys, and is one of the most ill-smelling insects on the
									Continent of America, far outstinking any member of the order Hemiptera. Outside
									of Florida it has been recorded only from St. Simon's and Billy's Islands, and St.
									Mary's, Ga., and Biloxi, Miss., though it doubtless occurs in many localities in
									southern Georgia and Alabama. In central-western Florida it is abundant in all
									stages during the winter and spring months, especially between the basal leaves of
									the large air plant, <hi rend="i">Tillandsisa utriculata</hi> L., beneath the
									loose bark of logs and stumps, in and beneath decaying palmetto trunks and leaves,
									under piles of weeds and rubbish, in fact, anywhere it can find shelter <pb
										id="VAB8231-099" n="98"/> from the orb of day; for, like others of its kind, it
									is a night-prowling insect, going forth only after darkness has come in search of
									provender or a mate. Davis states that "at night, with the aid of a lantern, it
									was often found walking about on low bushes, for it is a fair climber in spite of
									its clumsy appearance." When disturbed the adults emit a greasy liquid which
									saturates the atmosphere for a rod or two in every direction with its repellent
									odor.</p>

								<p>Putnam and Marion counties, Ind.; April 29--Dec. 15. Gainesville, Dunedin and
									Sanford, Fla., March 6--May 30 (<hi rend="i">W. S. B.</hi>). This is by far the
									largest cockroach found in Indiana and doubtless occurs in all the larger towns of
									the State. It was formerly found in numbers in some of the leading hotels and in
									the State House at Indianapolis, but usually confines itself to the basement and
									first floor, and appears to be much more cleanly in its choice of an abiding place
									than does the closely allied Oriental roach. It is, as its specific name
									indicates, a native of tropical and subtropical America; but, like <hi rend="i">B.
										orientalis</hi>, it has spread to the four corners of the earth. In Florida it
									has been taken by R. &amp; H. and others at numerous localities throughout the
									State, being abundant in a houseboat at Pine Channel, and in a fruit store at Key
									West. Elsewhere it occurs in this country from New York west to Minnesota and
									south to California and New Mexico, but in the more northern states is probably to
									be considered as adventive rather than firmly established. South of the United
									States, it is found generally over the Continent and adjacent islands <bibl>(<hi
											rend="i">Hebard</hi>, 1917a, 181)</bibl>.</p>
								<p>Catesby, as far back as 1748, wrote of this species in Carolina<ref id="ref_020"
										rend="super" target="note_020">20</ref> as follows: "The cockroaches here are
									very troublesome and destructive vermin, and are so numerous and voracious that it
									is impossible to keep victuals of any kind from being devoured by them without
									close covering. They are flat, and so thin that few chests or boxes can exclude
									them. They eat not only leather, parchment and woolen, but linen and paper. They
									disappear in winter and appear most numerous in the hottest days in summer. It is
									at night they commit their depredations, and bite people in their beds, especially
									children's fingers that are greasy. They lay innumerable eggs, creeping into the
									holes of old walls and rubbish, where they lie torpid all the winter. Some have
									wings and others are without--perhaps of different sexes."</p>
								<p>Catesby's wingless examples were in all probability the young, as, like most
									other insects, the wings are not acquired until the final moult. <bibl>Marlatt
										(1902, 8)</bibl> says that the "domesticity of the American roach resulted from
									ages of association with the aborigines. It has now become thoroughly
									cosmopolitan, and is unquestionably the most injurious and annoying of the species
									occurring on vessels. It is sometimes numerous also in greenhouses, causing
									considerable injury to tender plants. It is a notorious house pest, and
									occasionally vies with the German roach in its injuries <note id="note_020"><ref
											target="ref_020" rend="super">20</ref>Natural History, Carolina, 1748, Vol.
										II, p. 10.</note>
									<pb id="VAB8231-102" n="101"/> to book bindings. The backs, sometimes entirely, of
									both cloth and leather bound books, are eaten off to get at the starchy paste used
									in the binding."</p>
								<p>The young of the American roach require about a year to reach maturity. The rate
									of growth of it and other species depends, however, largely on the food and
									temperature conditions, and under unfavorable circumstances the nymph stage is
									much prolonged. The abundance of roaches is, therefore, apparently not accounted
									for so much by their rapidity of multiplication as by their unusual ability to
									preserve themselves from ordinary means of destruction and by the scarcity of
									natural enemies.</p>

					<head rend="center">Suborder III. <hi rend="b">GRESSORIA.</hi></head>

					<p>Orthopterous insects having the body long and slender; head exserted, often separated
						from the prothorax by a deep constriction; legs slim, the hind femora not enlarged. The
						name Gressoria, proposed by Fieber in 1853 to include the mantids and walking-sticks, is
						derived from the Latin and means "a walker." <bibl>Fischer (1853)</bibl> and
							<bibl>Gerstacker (1863)</bibl> adopted the name as proposed by Fieber. While it has
						not been much used in America, it affords a valid and easily understood term and is
						therefore used in this work, as proposed by Fieber, to include the two following
						families:</p>

					<list type="simple">
						<head rend="sc">KEY TO FAMILIES OF SUBORDER GRESSORIA.</head>

						<item>a. Front pair of legs raptorial, fitted for grasping; head strongly
							compressed, oblique, mouth inferior; eyes very large; ocelli three, rarely wanting;
							pronotum usually longer than any other segment; cerci jointed; subgenital plate of
							males bearing styles. <hi rend="right">Family III. M<hi rend="sc">ANTIDÆ, p.

						<item>aa. Front pair of legs not raptorial, their femora usually slender and curved

							<hi rend="right">Family IV. P<hi rend="sc">HASMIDÆ, p. 130.</hi></hi></item>
					</list>

					<p>The priority or rather inferiority of the Mantidæ is well set forth by <bibl>Scudder
							(1869b)</bibl> as follows: "The specialization of their anterior legs marks the higher
						structure of the Mantidæ, but they show their affinity to the Blattidæ and their
						inferiority to the Phasmidæ in their flattened abdomen, the tendency of the prothorax to
						become broad and flat, the structure of the external genital organs, the position of the
						head, and the exclusion of the eggs in a single cluster, enclosed in an oötheca.</p>
					<p>"The relation of the Phasmidæ to the saltatorial Orthoptera is also shown in the
						cylindrical body and, to some degree, in the structure of the external genital
						organs."</p>

								M<hi rend="sc">ANTIDS OR</hi> P<hi rend="sc">RAYING</hi> I<hi rend="sc"
							>NSECTS</hi>.</head>

						<p>This family is composed of elongate, slow moving insects, the most noticeable
							character of which is the possession of a front pair of legs so modified as to be
							fitted for grasping and holding their prey. The old name given to the group by
							Westwood was therefore <hi rend="i">Raptoria</hi> or graspers. The head is short, much
							wider than long, triangular, vertical, and loosely joined to the thorax in such a
							manner as to be freely movable; antennæ slender, usually filiform, rarely half as long
							as the body; eyes very large, convex, prominent; ocelli three in number,<ref
								id="ref_023" rend="super" target="note_023">23</ref> arranged on a triangular
							elevation just above the insertion of antennæ; pronotum in most of our species usually
							several times longer than broad, with the broadest portion in front of the middle and
							above the point of attachment of the long fore coxæ; both inner and outer wings
							present (except in the females of <hi rend="i">Oligonyx</hi> and <hi rend="i"
								>Thesprotia</hi>) but often shorter than the abdomen in the females; the abdomen of
							that sex often much broader than that of the male, and without a visible ovipositor.
							Both sexes have a pair of short jointed cerci attached to the sides of the supra-anal
							plate, while the males have also a pair of much shorter styles near the apex of the
							subgenital plate. They have the fore legs stout and raptorial, the tibiæ terminating
							in a long claw and with the long, slender, five-jointed tarsi, when at rest, bent back
							into a groove on the under side of the spinous femur; middle and hind pairs of legs
							long, slender, and fitted for slow motion. As with the other non-saltatorial families,
							ears and organs for producing sound are absent.</p>
						<p>The members of this family have numerous popular names, the most common of which are
							the "praying insects" or "soothsayers," given them on account of the position which
							they take when at rest or when waiting to grasp another insect. The knees are then
							bent and the front legs held as though in supplication. In the southern States they
							are often called "mule killers," from the foolish belief that the brownish liquor
							which they give off from the mouth is fatal to mules. This name is, however, also
							applied to the "whip-scorpion," <hi rend="i">Thelyphorus giganteus</hi> Lucas, a large
							member of the order Arachnida, which inhabits that region. Other common names for the
							mantids are "devil-horses" and "rear-horses," given them on account of the long,
							slender thorax which, <note id="note_023"><ref target="ref_023" rend="super"
								>23</ref>The ocelli are wanting in the females of <hi rend="i"
								>Thesprotia</hi>.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8231-117" n="116"/> when raised, makes them look like tiny giraffes. This
							attitude is assumed for defense and aggression and the insects are noted for their
							ferocity, pugnacity and tenacity to life.</p>
						<p>The mantids are all carnivorous, feeding principally upon the different forms of
							other insects. They are thus in the main beneficial, in this respect differing widely
							from all other members of the order Orthoptera, unless it be the tree crickets of the
							genus Oêcanthus, some of which are said to feed upon plant lice. They capture their
							prey by stealth, either awaiting motionless its near approach or crawling towards it
							very slowly, and when within reaching distance, seizing it with a sudden and rapid
							movement. Like other predatory insects, they have very voracious appetites. A male of
							the European species, <hi rend="i">Mantis religiosa</hi> L., which was introduced on
							nursery stock into New York State, was observed to eat, in one day, three large
							grasshoppers and a daddy-long-legs, and then tackled another mantis from which he was
							separated with difficulty. The eggs of mantids are numerous and are enclosed in a
							corresponding number of cells, arranged in regular rows and united in an ovoid mass,
							attached to twigs, walls or other support (Fig. 52). They are covered by a fibrous
							substance exuded by the female, which hardens when exposed to air and holds them
							firmly together.</p>

								</figure>

								<p>A species of southern range, occurring frequently in the southern half of Indiana
									and quite common in the counties bordering <pb id="VAB8231-120" n="119"/> the Ohio
									River. It extends as far north as Marion and Putnam counties, where it is found
									sparingly, though a dozen or more specimens have been brought to me in
									Indianapolis, all of them females. S. G. Evans, of Evansville, in a letter says:
									"The Mantids are found here of all sizes and colors, the eggs and young being
									almost as common as mosquitoes. I have, on several occasions, placed male and
									female together in a glass jar, and the female always devoured the male, and
									generally while in the act of copulating, the bodies remaining together until the
									male was almost consumed." At Indianapolis the females evidently reach maturity
									about September 1st, most specimens being brought in about that date or later; the
									green and brown forms of the female being about equally numerous. In Putnam County
									it has been noted by John S. Michaels, near Bainbridge. A pair, both of the dark
									hue, were found mating in Perry Co., Sept. 25. They were on the stem of a weed
									within a foot of the ground and the abdomen of the female was greatly distended by
									the large mass of eggs enclosed.</p>
								<p><hi rend="i">S. carolina</hi> occurs throughout Florida, having been recorded
									from numerous localities from Jacksonville, Live Oak and Pensacola south to
									Homestead and Key West, the dates ranging throughout the year. Nymphs have been
									taken by me at Okeechobee City, Cape Sable and Key West in February and March. A
									female from Punta Gorda is recorded by <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1914d)</bibl> as "having
									the body 75 mm. and the pronotum 27.5 mm., in length." In Florida this mantis is
									usually found in the undergrowth of pine woods, palmetto scrub, etc., though it is
									liable to occur anywhere about orchards, gardens and borders of cultivated
									fields.</p>
								<p>The Carolina mantis ranges from central Ohio (<hi rend="i">Kostir</hi>) and
									Indiana east to Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey, west to Nebraska and Utah
									and south to Arizona, Mexico and Cuba. Adventive specimens have also been recorded
									from Rhode Island and New York. The type of <hi rend="i">Bactromantis virga</hi>
									<bibl>Scudder (1896, 213)</bibl> at Cambridge shows that it was based upon an
									immature male of <hi rend="i">S. carolina</hi>, so that both the genus <hi
										rend="i">Bactromantis</hi> and the species fall in synonymy. <hi rend="i">Mantis
										wheeleri</hi>
									<bibl>Thos. (1875, 849)</bibl>, <hi rend="i">M. stolli</hi>
									<bibl>Sauss. (1869, 65)</bibl> and <hi rend="i">M. dimidiata</hi>
									<bibl>Sauss. (1871, 48)</bibl> are also regarded as synonyms.</p>
								<p>When in the presence of its prey the Carolina mantis moves almost imperceptibly
									along, stealing toward its victim like a cat approaching a mouse. When
									sufficiently near, the foreleg is <pb id="VAB8231-121" n="120"/> suddenly extended
									to its full length and the unlucky insect is immediately caught and impaled by the
									spines between the tibia and femur, carried to the mouth and deliberately eaten
									piecemeal while yet alive and struggling to escape. When the two sexes are
									captured and placed together the female soon begins to feed upon her liege lord,
									and finally devours all portions of him which are in the least degree digestible.
										<bibl>Riley (1869, 169)</bibl> states that their prey consists mainly of flies,
									but that he has "know them to attack various kinds of butterflies, including the
									male bag-worm, grasshoppers and caterpillars of many kinds, and in one instance a
									single female mantis devoured eleven living Colorado potato beetles during one
									night, leaving only the wing cases and parts of the legs."</p>
								<p>The eggs of the Carolina mantis are laid in cases or masses, about an inch long,
									which are attached to the twigs of trees or other support (Fig. 52). The case is
									tough and horny, and the eggs are laid in parallel rows, twenty to forty in a row,
									issuing from a common longitudinal middle line. All of the eggs stand on end and
									are inclined somewhat toward the central channel. A cluster of eggs has a braided
									appearance, but consists simply of a continuous ribbon of mucus folded in close
									flutings and having an egg deposited in the bight or angle of each fold. The eggs
									are deposited simultaneously with the deposition of this ribbon by the mother
									insect, and the whole mass is at first soft and flexible, but rapidly hardens by
									exposure to the air. In this manner the species survives the winter and in May,
									when insect life begins to abound, the young emerge and use their prominent,
									staring eyes to good advantage in seeking plant lice and other minute forms which
									furnish them their first of many meals. The eggs are frequently parasitized by a
									very peculiar chalcis fly, <hi rend="i">Podagrion mantis</hi> Ashm., which
									penetrates the tough egg mass with its long ovipositor, and whose larva feed upon
									the eggs. Thus egg masses taken by the observer in the winter and kept for the
									hatching of the young will frequently in the spring give out those parasites
									instead of the young mantids.</p>

										target="note_025">25</ref> under its true name. The specimens at hand were taken
									at Rochester in September, 1913, so that it appears to have become thoroughly
									established, not only at Rochester, but also through eggcases from there at Ithaca
											<bibl>(<hi rend="i">Davis</hi>, 1918)</bibl>. <bibl>Kirby (1904, 250)</bibl>
									gives its distribution as "Southern and Central Europe, Northern and Western Asia
									and Northern Africa." <bibl>Latreille (1831, 9)</bibl> states that it is very
									common in the southern parts of France and Italy, that it is sometimes brown and
									immaculate, and that the Turks entertain for it a religious respect. An egg-case
									at hand is oval, 20x40x15 mm. in size, and less compact than that of the Carolina
									mantis. The young, when first hatched, are said to be much elongated and to have a
									singular habit of suspending themselves from the egg-case by slender threads
									attached to the cerci. The females are said by Schmaltz,<ref id="ref_026"

								<p>This large Asiatic species was accidentally introduced by a nurseryman at Mt.
									Airy, near Philadelphia, Pa., about 1896, and seems to have become thoroughly
									established. Laurent states <bibl>(<hi rend="i">Ent. News</hi>, 1902, 62)</bibl>
									that at Mt. Airy it "likes blackberry and briar bushes as a place of abode and
									avoids low ground with low herbage." From 150 to 300 young emerge from each egg
									mass in June, and mature about the first of October. It is a very beneficial
									insect and egg masses from the Mt. Airy colony have been introduced at many points
									in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, but at no place do they seem to have done
									as well as at the point of original introduction. <bibl>Davis (1918)</bibl> has
									given an interesting account of the attempts to increase the distribution of this
									beneficial mantis in the region mentioned. Saussure's types were from Ningpo,
									China, and it is a well known insect in that country and Japan. Although a native
									of a semi-tropical region, it seems to be able to withstand without difficulty the
									rigors of the Pennsylvania winters.</p>

								<p><bibl>Weiss (1914)</bibl> has given a description of the egg-case of <hi rend="i"
										>P. sinensis</hi> stating that it is peculiar in that it consists of a central,
									somewhat horny core containing the eggs. These are arranged in from 12 to 18
									layers, averaging 15 eggs each, or a total average of 225 eggs in each case. The
									central core is surrounded by a porous rind or outer fibrous envelope "which
									undoubtedly serves to protect the eggs from moisture and sudden changes in
									temperature." A number of tests made by him showed that the interiors of nests
									entirely immersed in water for an hour and three-quarters remained perfectly dry.
									At the end of two hours the outer rind became moist but the water had not reached
									the core. The average thickness of the core was 12 mm., and of the enveloping rind
									5.6 mm., while the average weight of a nest or case was 1.63 grams, of a core,
									1.34 grams and of a rind .29 grams, "showing that five-sixths of the total weight
									consists of the core containing the eggs, the remaining sixth of the porous
									protecting rind."</p>

							rather stout; eyes small, ocelli often absent; pronotum very short; abdomen elongate,
							composed of ten segments, the basal one usually closely united with the metathorax,
							often invisible; tegmina and wings absent (except in the genus <hi rend="i"

						<p>Our species of Phasmidæ are remarkable for their resemblance to twigs of different
							plants, while some of the tropical species are so modified as to resemble leaves,
							frequently bearing so close a resemblance to the foliage as to deceive a keen
							observer. Their movements are, in general, very slow, though the males can run with
							some rapidity when in pursuit of the opposite sex. They feed during their entire lives
							upon leaves, being especially fond of those of oak and wild cherry. The eggs are
							dropped loosely and singly upon the ground by the mother, where they remain through
							the winter, thus tiding the insect over the cold season. The outer case or shell of
							the egg is hard and often sculptured, and those of our common species resemble seeds
							or small beans. The young, when hatched, trust to chance and their peculiar shape to
							escape those higher animal forms which are ever ready to prey upon every moving object
							which promises them a bit of sustenance. The largest living insects are
							walking-sticks, found in Borneo and other East India Islands, two of the wingless
							forms having the body 33 cm. or 13 inches in length.</p>
						<p>That the Phasmidæ have the power of reproducing their lost or broken legs has been
							shown by Scudder. Such restored limbs are much smaller and have but three or four
							tarsal joints,<ref id="ref_027" rend="super" target="note_027">27</ref> the usual

								<p>This walking-stick is quite a common insect throughout Indiana, though the
									average observer will probably see but one or two of them a year. They reach
									maturity in August, and may then often be found upon the leaves of oak or wild
									cherry, especially on isolated trees along fence rows. One of my students at Terre
									Haute once brought in on October 15, a hundred or more which he had gotten from a
									wild cherry tree on whose leaves they had been feeding. It moves very slowly and
									has a habit of remaining motionless and apparently dead for a considerable length
									of time. On such occasions it usually stretches itself out from a twig with its
									front legs and antennæ extended, and can then <pb id="VAB8231-135" n="134"/>
									scarcely be distinguished from a prolongation or branch of the twig. Many people
									who see them thus for the first time and afterwards watch them moving slowly away,
									can scarcely be persuaded that they are not real twigs, gifted in some mysterious
									manner with life and motion. On September 18, 1918, they were found in numbers in
									a grove of the black locust in Putnam County, 40 or more specimens being secured
									in a few minutes. They were usually found mating on the boles of the locust and
									when approached and touched would drop to the ground and there remain
									motionless.</p>
								<p><hi rend="i">D. femorata</hi> is the most common and widely distributed Phasmid
									in the United States, ranging from Maine to the Rocky Mountains, north to central
									Ontario and Selkirk, Manitoba, and south and southwest at least to northern
									Florida, northern Texas and the Organ Mountains, New Mexico. In Florida it has
									been recorded from Monticello by <bibl>Davis (1915)</bibl> and several specimens
									labelled "Gainesville, Aug. 15" are in the collection of the Florida Experiment
									Station. <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1916, 124)</bibl> record it from Virginia, North and
									South Carolina, and from numerous stations in Georgia, and state that a male from
									Albany, Ga., is 84.5 mm. in length, and that the material from the four states
									mentioned "was all taken in the undergrowth of pine and oak woods." A female at
									hand from near Mobile, Ala., 101 mm. in length, has one of the hind legs aborted,
									the length of the femur being but 19 and of the tibia 11 mm. as against 24 and 27
									mm. for the same segments of the opposite leg. The basal joint of the tarsus is
									less than one-third that of the corresponding normal one and only two additional
									joints are present.</p>
								<p>This is the only North American walking-stick abundant enough to be of economic
									importance. In feeding they eat the edges of a leaf, preferably those of an oak or
									wild cherry, usually straddling it with their legs, and in an hour will devour a
									piece an inch long by a third of an inch wide. <bibl>Riley (1879)</bibl> records
									that on occasions they are so numerous as to do much damage to oak, hickory,
									locust and other trees. In Yates Co., New York, he once found them very abundant
									in a woodland of 50 acres, which they had attacked in numbers two and four years
									previously. He states that: <q rend="blockquote">
										<p>"By the middle of August the bulk of the pests were going through their last
											moult, and by the end of autumn they had stripped most of the trees, showing,
											however, a decided preference for the black, red and rock-chestnut oaks, over
											the white oaks and hickories, which they affect but <pb id="VAB8231-136"
												n="135"/> little until after the first mentioned trees are stripped. The
											underbrush was also effectually cleaned of its foliage, and the insects hung
											from and clung to the bare twigs and branches in great clusters. They settled
											to roost on the witch-hazel, but did not defoliate it until the other trees
											mentioned were pretty bare. Sumach and thorn were also little affected, while
											peach and apple in an adjoining orchard were untouched. Whenever they had
											entirely stripped the trees and shrubs they moved in bodies to fresh pastures,
											crowding upon one another and covering the ground, the fence rails, and
											everything about them so that it was impossible for a person to enter the
											woods without being covered by them. The timber affected could be recognized
											by its seared and leafless appearance from a great distance, and upon entering
											the woods the ear was greeted by a peculiar seething noise, resulting from the
											motion of the innumerable jaws at work on the leaves. Their depredations first
											began to attract attention soon after wheat harvest, and were most noticeable
											in September. The injury to the trees done in 1874 and 1876 was manifest in
											the death of most of the black oaks, and, according to the owner's
											observations, trees die in three years after the first attack."</p></q>
								</p>
								<p>The eggs, of which each female lays about 100, are a little less than 3 mm. in
									length, long oval in shape and of a polished black color with a whitish stripe on
									one side. They resemble a small, plump bean or seed of other leguminous plant.
									They are simply dropped loosely upon the ground from whatever height the female
									may happen to be, and says Riley: "During the latter part of autumn where the
									insects are common, one hears a constant pattering, not unlike drops of rain,
									which results from the abundant dropping of these eggs, which in places are so
									thick among and under the dead leaves that they may be scraped up in great
									quantities. The eggs remain upon the ground all through the winter and hatch for
									the most part during the month of May. Some of them, however, continue hatching
									much later, so that all through the summer and even into the fall, young
									individuals may be found. When first hatched the young measure 4.5 mm. and with
									their feelers and legs outstretched, near double that length. They are invariably,
									during early life, of a pale yellowish-green color. The insect changes very little
									in appearance from birth to maturity except so far as color is concerned, and
									moults but twice. Growth is rapid, averaging, under favorable circumstances, about
									six weeks from birth to adult. With age the green color gives way to various
									shades of gray and brown. In this way we find great correspondence with its
									surroundings. While the vegetation is green, the walking-stieks are green also;
									when the foliage turns in autumn, they change color correspondingly, and when the
									foliage is stripped they so closely resemble, both in appearance and color, the
									twigs upon which they rest--the habit of stretching out the front legs and feelers
									greatly enhancing the resemblance--that when they are few in number it is
									difficult to recognize them. A few green specimens, more particularly of the
									males, may always be found, even among the mature individuals."</p>
								<p>It will be noted that Riley, in the above account, which was the first one
									attempting to give in detail the life history of <hi rend="i">D. <pb
											id="VAB8231-137" n="136"/> femorata</hi>, states that the young "moult but
									twice." Our knowledge of the life history of other Orthoptera would tend to show
									that this was an error and Severin has proven it to be so by rearing 100 examples
									of the species under conditions as normal as possible. He states (1911) that "23
									per cent. moulted four times, 76 per cent. five times and only one per cent. six
									times." He adds that since the insect usually eats parts, or all of its cast-off
									skin it is possible that Riley overlooked some of the moults on this account. He
									also states that those specimens "which moulted four times reached sexual maturity
									on an average in 50 days, while those which moulted five times required 57.5 days,
									on an average before beginning the egg-laying period. * * * The eggs, after
									passing out of the vaginal orifice, may be retained for a number of hours within
									the peculiar 'external uterus' formed by the ovipositor."</p>
								<p>The thick-thighed walking-stick appears to be abundant in any certain locality
									only every other year. This is in part due to an increase of the insect's natural
									enemies on those years in which they are most abundant. These enemies are several
									species of true bugs (Heteroptera), crows and other birds. The main reason for the
									greater number of walking-sticks in alternate 'years is, however, thought to be
									due to the fact that the larger proportion of the eggs, especially those laid late
									in the autumn, take two years in hatching. If at any time the insect threatens to
									become injurious in woodlands, it can be held in check by burning the leaves on
									the ground in the winter season, thus destroying the hibernating eggs.</p>

								<p>Walsh's male type of this walking-stick was from Nebraska, and one of his female
									cotypes from Illinois. Its main distribution is west and southwest of the
									Mississippi, extending from Staples <pb id="VAB8231-138" n="137"/> and Pipestone,
									Minn., to Colorado, Texas and Mexico. East of that river it has been recorded from
									New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, Georgia and Illinois, but Caudell has

									of his <hi rend="i">Manomera blatchleyi</hi>, a species very closely resembling
										<hi rend="i">D. veliei</hi>. The eastern limits of the range of <hi rend="i"

									lateral stripes, the pleura being light colored in life, though after drying the

								<p>This genus is characterized very briefly by its authors thus: "From <hi rend="i"
										>Diapheromera, Manomera</hi> can be separated in the male by the slender head,
									absence of caudal femoral spines, uninflated median femora and more elongate

								<p>A Southern species whose known range is from Selma and Winter Park, North
									Carolina to Southern Florida. Numerous nymphs have been taken about Dunedin in
									February and March. They are pale grass-green and were swept from huckleberry and
									other low shrubs in open pine woods. Scudder's types were from Cedar Keys and
									Capron, Fla., and it has been recorded from numerous localities from Jacksonville
									and Live Oak in the north, to Homestead and Punta Gorda in the south. Adults are
									found from April to November on wire grass, saw palmetto and other undergrowth in
									open pine woods, rarely on vegetation in low, damp places. <hi rend="i">Manomera

								<p>The types of this walking-stick in the U. S. National Museum were taken by me
									near Bass Lake, Starke Co., Ind., Aug. 20, 1902, and no additional specimens have
									since been personally collected. It doubtless occurs, however, throughout the
									northern half, perhaps over the entire State. A female is at hand from Cedar
									Point, Ohio, and <bibl>Kostir (1914, 371)</bibl> states that numerous females but
									no males were taken at that place. <bibl>Hart (1907, 259)</bibl>, recorded it as
									occurring on rank prairie vegetation throughout Illinois, and also from Geneva,
									Wis. Gerhard has sent me a male and two females <pb id="VAB8231-142" n="141"/>
									taken at Argo, Ill., July 27, and has collected others at Palos Park and Fourth
									Lake, Ill. Somes (1916) records <hi rend="i">M. blatchleyi</hi> from Iowa and
									Missouri, the sexes occurring in about equal numbers. Elsewhere the males seem to
									have been very scarce.</p>
								<p>As noted above under <hi rend="i">D. veliei</hi>, many if not all the eastern
									records of that species probably refer to <hi rend="i">M. blatchleyi</hi>, the
									females especially of the two forms being very difficult of separation. Davis
									(Ms.) states that he now considers the species occurring about New York City, and
									formerly thought to be <hi rend="i">D. veliei</hi>, as <hi rend="i">M.
										blatchleyi</hi>, but that no males have as yet been taken on either Long or
									Staten Islands, although the females are fairly common on golden-rod, asters and
									associated plants. <bibl>Morse (1919, 16)</bibl> records an adult female and nymph
									of <hi rend="i">blatchleyi</hi> from Greenwich, Conn. The known range of <hi
										rend="i">blatchleyi</hi> therefore extends from Kansas and Oklahoma to Virginia
									and Connecticut.</p>
								<p>Under the generic heading I have referred to the close relationship between the
									genera <hi rend="i">Diapheromera</hi> and <hi rend="i">Manomiera</hi>. The species
										<hi rend="i">blatchleyi</hi> seems to be a sort of connecting link between the

									former and the unarmed hind femora to the latter genus.</p>

								<p>This is the only winged Phasmid known from the United States. The first specimens
									were taken at Loggerhead Key, Dry Tortugas, Fla., and were recorded, described and
									figured by <bibl>Caudell (1904)</bibl> as <hi rend="i">Haplopus evadne</hi>
									Westwood, a Santo Domingo species. A number of additional specimens, taken later
									on the same island by Dr. A. G. Mayer, were afterward submitted to the same
									authority, who concluded that his first identification was wrong, and described
									them (loc. cit.) under the name they now bear. In 1912, R. &amp; H. visited
									Loggerhead Key and secured a number of specimens, finding them only on bushes of
									the bay cedar, <hi rend="i">Suriana maritime</hi> L. They record (1914c, 387) the
									species also from Bird Key and Garden Keys of the Tortugas groups, and from Key
									West and Long Key, July 3--13. It is also known from Key Largo and Everglade,
									Fla., a specimen from the latter point, taken by Davis, being the only one known
									from the mainland of the State. The large size and bizarre appearance of this
									Phasmid suggest its tropical origin, and it is very probable that in time it will

								<p>This walking-stick has been taken in Indiana only near Wyandotte, Crawford Co.,
									Grand Chain, Posey Co., and Medora, Jackson Co., having been found in large
									numbers in all three localities. The first ones noted were in Crawford Co. on June
									28, 1902, when the young about an inch and a half long were found beneath loose
									flakes of bark on oak and other trees. In the first week in September I again
									visited the locality and found scores of pairs of them, all mating, beneath the
									loose bark of old oak snags and stumps. A half dozen or more pairs were often
									found within an area of a foot or two square, the large, heavy bodied female
									bearing her diminutive liege lord upon her back. None of the specimens noted were
									feeding, though they probably live upon the leaves of oak and other trees. The
									species was later found in numbers in Posey and Jackson Counties, and probably
									occurs in most of the counties bordering the Ohio River. It is but one of many

					<p>The name Saltatoria is derived from the Latin <hi rend="i">saltator</hi>, "a dancer,"
						and was first applied by <bibl>Latreille (1817)</bibl> to those Orthoptera having the
						hind legs fitted for leaping. Belonging to this class or suborder are four families
						which comprise the great majority of our best known Orthoptera. They are the true
						"hoppers" or leapers of the order; their hind limbs, in the course of ages, having
						become so modified as to be adapted in the highest degree to the life which they lead.
						Possessing, also, in many instances, ample organs of flight, which enable them when
						disturbed to move rapidly to a distance, the males have evolved in connection therewith
						organs of sound, by which they may call the members of the opposite sex to them. Were it
						not for these calling organs the two sexes would, during their varied movements, often
						be widely separated, and perhaps be unable to locate one another after settling in a new
						position. The males alone possess these organs of sound, and they only when wings are
						present. All the wingless forms lack also "auditory organs" or ears, since these would
						be useless unless, some means of producing sound were present.</p>

						<p>The members of this family<ref id="ref_029" rend="super" target="note_029">29</ref>
							are our smallest locusts and among the smallest of Orthoptera. They are easily known
							from all other Saltatoria by having the pronotum prolonged and tapering backward to
							such an extent that it reaches to or beyond the tip of abdomen; tegmina rudimentary,
							represented only by small oval lobes or scales, placed on the sides of the body and
							usually covering only a small portion of the base of wings; the latter usually present
							and well developed, especially in their anal area, though both they and tegmina in a
							few species wanting; prosternum prolonged in front by a half circular "chin piece"
							which envelopes the maxillæ and other mouth parts like a muffler; arolia absent. The
							males of most species are much narrower <note id="note_028"><ref target="ref_028"
									rend="super">28</ref>Rarely in Tridactylinæ one- or two-jointed or in part
								wanting. The antennæ in that subfamily and the Gryllotalpinæ are shorter than the
								body.</note>
							<note id="note_029"><ref target="ref_029" rend="super">29</ref>The characters
								separating the grouse locusts from the larger short-horned locusts (Acrididæ) are so
								fixed and striking that I have raised the former to family rank. Not only are the
								external differential characters between the two families far greater than those
								separating any two families of Coleoptera, but they present in their spermatogenesis
								a distinction of family rank. In the subfamilies Tryxalinæ and Oedipodinæ the
								spermatogenial number of chromosomes is twenty-three, while in the Tetrigidæ,
								according to <bibl>Robertson (Journ. Morph. XXVI, No. 1)</bibl> there are fourteen
								in the female and thirteen in the male. <bibl>Harmon (Biol. Bull. XXIX, No.
									4)</bibl> also found only thirteen in <hi rend="i">Paratettix</hi>. This great
								reduction in the number of chromosomes is additional evidence in support of their
								being ranked as a family. I have not followed the rule of basing the family name on
								the oldest generic one included as it would then be too similar to Acrididæ. The
								student can use Acrydiidæ instead of Tetrigidæ if he so desire.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8231-151" n="150"/> bodied than the females and have the subgenital plate
							conical or triangular, and supra-anal plate lanceolate or triangular; cerci very
							small, cylindrical or conical. The valves of the ovipositor are armed with small
							rounded teeth on their outer edges, and their extremities are sharply divergent.</p>

								parts. The face is shown at the right, the pronotum and head below. (After Han-
								cock.)</p>
						</figure>
						<p>In addition to the characters mentioned the Tetrigidæ have the eyes conspicuous,
							globular or subelliptic; ocelli three, arranged in the form of a triangle, the median
							or apical one being in the lower portion of the groove of frontal costa; antennæ 12-
							to 22-jointed, usually cylindrical or filiform; face with a frontal costa extending
							down its middle, this often more or less forked, its branches sometimes widely
							divergent; head above bounded in front by the fastigium, the latter usually with a
							transverse carina; vertex behind the fastigium and between the eyes, varying much in
							form and size and usually divided by a lengthwise median carina; upper or dorsal
							surface of pronotum extremely variable in form and rugosity, lateral lobes with hind
							border more or less sinuate, usually with two distinct notches or sinuses, the
							uppermost one, known as the tegminal or superior sinus, enclosing the base of tegmina,
							the lowermost or inferior sinus usually much the wider, the median lobe between them
							variable in form, as is also the lower posterior lobe or angle, beneath the inferior
							sinus; legs more or less compressed; hind femora much enlarged; hind tibiæ with
							numerous spines; fore and middle tarsi with only two visible segments, the terminal
							one three or four times as long as the <pb id="VAB8231-152" n="151"/> basal; hind
							tarsi with three segments, the first usually longer than third, the second very short.
							These various external parts of a grouse locust are excellently shown in the
							accompanying figure from Hancock. The pronotum varies much in length and color, even
							in the adults of the same species, and much of the earlier synonymy is due to a
							failure to recognize the long and short pronotal forms or the color variations as
							belonging to the same species. During the last moult the tegmina, which in the earlier
							stages are hidden beneath the pronotum, take their place at the side of the body in
							the superior posterior sinus and the wings become folded and extended beneath the
							pronotal process.</p>
						<p>In Indiana these little Orthoptera are the only locusts which pass the winter in the
							imago or mature stage. On the approach of winter they hide beneath chunk, chips,
							rubbish, the loose bark of logs, or beneath the bottom rails of old fences. Sometimes
							a warm sunny day in mid-winter tempts them forth in numbers, and on such occasions,
							the earth seems to swarm with them as they leap before the intruder, their hard bodies
							striking the dead leaves with a sound similar to that produced by falling hail. If the
							winter is an open one, with alternate periods of thawing and freezing, many of them
							doubtless perish. On the first warm days of spring they can be collected by hundreds
							from any grass-covered hillside having a sunny southern exposure, or from sandy places
							along the margins of lakes and streams.</p>
						<p><bibl>Allard (1916)</bibl> has aptly described their habits thus: "Smallest of all
							the Acridiidæ and among the most interesting are the odd-shaped grouse-locusts. These
							tiny creatures, which leap almost as actively as fleas, are exceedingly difficult to
							discern in their natural environment of earth and dead vegetation. As one sweeps a net
							over the surface of the dry leaves in the woods there is an audible rustling as the
							tiny creatures hop about very much like tiny toads. At rest, their odd little bodies
							and sombre hues of grays, yellows and browns assimilate them perfectly with the
							mottled carpet of dried leaves, grasses, pebbles, bits of dead bark and woods among
							which they dwell."</p>
						<p><bibl>Hancock (1902)</bibl> has also written entertainingly of their habits as
							follows:</p>
						<q rend="blockquote">
							<p>"The jump of the grouse locust is peculiar in that it is quick and inconspicuous
								and in this that it alights almost invariably on the ground The young of the larger
								Orthoptera usually alight on grass or stems of plants, dodging behind them for
								protection. The remarkable color of these little Tetrigians, harmonizing in every
								instance with the soil, makes <pb id="VAB8231-153" n="152"/> it sometimes difficult
								to locate them. This protective resemblance is carried out to perfection, the little
								insects living on the soil scattered with debris faded out by the hot sun, and the
								lights and shadows, in whatever way they play, are copied exactly. No shade, color
								or arrangement of markings seems impossible of simulation, and every individual is a
								study in color harmony.</p>
							<figure>
								<p>Fig. 59. Showing variations in the color of the short form of a common grouse
									locust, <hi rend="i">Acrydium ornatum</hi> Say. (After Hancock.)</p>
							</figure>
							<p>"The grouse locusts feed upon the vegetable mold or decomposing soil sometimes
								mixed with algæ, or on the lichens, mosses, tender sprouting grasses, sedges,
								germinating seeds of plants and debris found in such situations. Particularly
								sought-after morsels are the various colored surface clays and the black muck,
								consisting of rich vegetable mold. They are ravenous eaters, as one might infer from
								the dietary list just mentioned, and the fecal excrement, on reaching the end of the
								abdominal appendages, is thrust away from the body by a rapid kick of the hind
								tibia.</p>
							<p>"In the middle of May (Illinois) the first eggs are laid in the ground, the female
								accomplishing this act by making a shallow burrow with her ovipositor. The young
								larvæ, hatched from this brood, mature by fall, passing the following winter in the
								adult state. The broods hatched in late June and early July are often immature by
								the time winter arrives, and we find them hibernating in the pupal state. Thus it is
								that the Tetrigidæ are about the earliest insects to be found in the spring,
								appearing as early as March. The time of incubation varies with the temperature, the
								early broods of <hi rend="i">Acrydium (Tettix)</hi> hatching in twenty-three days,
								but as the days become warmer this period is shortened to sixteen days. The number
								of eggs of <hi rend="i">Acrydium</hi> and <hi rend="i">Paratettix</hi> vary
								considerably, but there are more often ten, thirteen or sixteen in each burrow; in
									<hi rend="i">Tettigidea</hi> varying from twelve to twenty-six.</p>
							<p>"During the life of these little Tetrigians they are more or less constantly in
								danger of enemies among the arachnida, insecta, and some of the vertebrata. The
								larva of a red mite <hi rend="i">(Trombidian)</hi> is one of the most frequent
								sources of annoyance. Acting as a parasite the Trombidian larva clings on the body
								and attaches itself out of the reach of the victim. There it remains to sap the
								juices of the host's body. It is found on many species. Among insect pests, ants and
								bugs are sometimes deadly to them. In a wet ditch in June the writer found a number
								of small, dark-brown ants dragging along the ground a female <hi rend="i">Acrydium
									ornatum</hi> which had just been killed by them. When endeavoring to capture some
								grouse locusts at the same place my attention was drawn to a colony of these ants
									<pb id="VAB8231-154" n="153"/> acting in a panicky state of excitement, the cause
								of this being that they had darted upon the insect the author was pursuing, tumbling
								it over and biting it savagely about the neck. The little locust finally escaped by
								a vigorous jump.</p>
							<p>"According to <bibl>P. R. Uhler, (1884)</bibl>
								<hi rend="i">Galgulus oculatus</hi>, a true bug, is a serious enemy. 'This insect
								may often be seen,' says Uhler, 'in the month of May walking about between the
								stones on the low banks of brooks and streams, where <hi rend="i">Tettix</hi> and
									<hi rend="i">Batrichidea</hi> abound, watching an opportunity to seize one of
								these insects, and when the favorable moment arrives, leaping suddenly upon one of
								them, clasping it with tight embrace between the front femora and tibiæ and then
								sucking out its vital juices.' Toads. fishes and birds also feed upon them when
								opportunity offers."</p>

						<p>The Tetrigidæ are widely distributed over the earth, many of the tropical species
							having the pronotum strongly compressed and bearing a resemblance to the dried leaves
							among which they live on the ground, while some have it extremely rough, or even spiny
							to aid in imitating their natural surroundings. In his principal treatise on the group
							(1906) Hancock recognized 98 genera and 434 nominal species as known at that time. Of
							these 21 genera and 99 species had been previously (1902) described by him as
							inhabiting North and Central America, Mexico and the West Indies. While several valid
							species have since been described from this country, a number of those recognized by
							Hancock have been proven to be mere races or varieties of the older known species, so
							that in the present work only seven genera, 16 species and eight varieties are
							recognized as occurring in the Eastern United States and Canada. These represent but
							two of the nine sections or subfamilies of <bibl>Hancock (1906)</bibl>.</p>
						<p>The principal literature treating especially the North American species of Tetrigidæ
							is as follows: <bibl>Bolivar, 1887</bibl>; <bibl>Morse, 1894, 1894a, 1895, 1899,

									<item>Typical examples of this race or form differ from typical <hi rend="i"
											>cristatus</hi> in having the front margin of pronotum projecting more

								</list>

								<p>Originally described from North Carolina, this race or form <pb id="VAB8231-159"
										n="158"/> of the crested grouse locust is known from southern New Jersey and
									eastern Pennsylvania west to Michigan and Illinois and south to Georgia. It is the
									only form of <hi rend="i">Nomnotettix</hi> known from Indiana where it probably
									occurs throughout the State. In the southern counties it makes its home on
									semi-barren rocky ridges and the sides of dry sunny banks in pastures where the
									grass is scant or has been cropped short, and where the species of "everlasting"
										(<hi rend="i">Antennaria</hi> and <hi rend="i">Anaphalis</hi>), delight to grow.
									In such places it may be taken by the score in late autumn or early spring. At
									Dune Park, Porter Co., it lives, says <bibl>Hancock (1902, 59)</bibl> "on dry
									sandy soil, lightly covered with fragments of twigs, leaves, and various fine
									debris accumulated from past seasons. Among the sand dunes it frequently seeks
									retreat in the clumps of prickly pear cactus on mossy covered ground slightly
									sheltered by trees. It is a curious little species, and though sometimes quite
									common locally, it requires the exercise of tact on hands and knees to capture the
									sprightly little insects. In the cool October mornings they do not appear to jump
									far, but as the sunlight warms the ground they become more active. Some are then
									in the last pupal stage, but the majority are adult."</p>
								<p>But three specimens of the long form, <hi rend="i">atavus</hi>
									<bibl>Blatchley (1903, 219)</bibl> have been taken among the hundreds of
									short-winged ones collected in Indiana, a male in Vigo county and a female in each
									of Lake and Perry counties. On account of the greater length of the pronotum, its
									median crest does not appear so prominent nor so strongly arched in the long form
									as in the more common one.</p>
								<p>Morse, in his notes following the original description of <hi rend="i">N.
										compressus</hi>, doubted its validity, and R. &amp; H. and Hancock have showns
									that it merges and intergrades with <hi rend="i">cristatus</hi> so that at most it

										floridanus</hi> and <hi rend="i">N. arcuatus</hi> shows little appreciable
									difference, except in the less rugose surface of the pronotum and slightly more
									curved median carina of the latter. <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1916, 133)</bibl> state
									that <hi rend="i">floridanus</hi> "was founded merely on an intensification of the
									characters which constitute the race <hi rend="i">arcuatus</hi>," and that <hi
										rend="i">floridanus</hi> is "known only from southern and central Florida, in
									the northern part of its range, gradually intergrading with <hi rend="i"
										>arcuatus</hi>." Since <hi rend="i">floridanus</hi> has page priority I have
									dropped the name <hi rend="i">arcuatus</hi>, the form to which it has been
									referred being only a connecting link or intermediate form between the southern
									race <hi rend="i">floridanus</hi> and typical <hi rend="i">cristatus</hi>, and,
									quoting <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1916, 151)</bibl>, "the uselessness of a name for
									intermediates between weakly defined geographic races does not require comment."
									Were no intermediate forms known, the examples from central and southern Florida
									are sufficiently distinctive in their larger eyes and strongly rugose pronotum to
									have specific rank.</p>
								<p>A single male of <hi rend="i">N. c. floridanus</hi> with caudate or long pronotum
									was taken near Lakeland, Feb. 16, 1919, and is the first long form of this race to
									be recorded. In color it is pitchy black with a small white spot on each shoulder.
									The tip of the pronotum extends 2 mm. beyond the hind femora and is surpassed .8
									mm. by the folded inner wings. As in <hi rend="i">N. c. compressus</hi> the long
									pronotum with apparently lower, less curved crest gives it a very different facies
									from the short form.</p>
								<p>In addition to the localities given the race <hi rend="i">floridanus</hi> has
									been recorded by R. &amp; H. under that name from Lakeland, Ft. Myers, and
									LaBelle, Fla. (1914d), and as <hi rend="i">arcuatus</hi> from Jacksonville,
									Baldwin, Atlantic Beach and Live Oak (1916, 132). They record the race <hi
										rend="i">arcuatus</hi> Hancock also from North and South Carolina, Georgia and
									Mississippi, while under the name <hi rend="i">Nomotettix cristatus
										denticulatus</hi> it was described and recorded by <bibl>Morse (1906,
										119)</bibl> from Oklahoma and Texas. <bibl>Scudder (1877a, 90)</bibl> recorded
										<hi rend="i">Batrachidea cristata</hi> from Ft. Reed, Fla., his specimens
									probably representing the race <hi rend="i">floridanus</hi>.</p>
								<p>About Dunedin <hi rend="i">N. c. floridanus</hi> occurs in numbers from November
									to April, perhaps throughout the year, in the low grasses and other vegetation
									along the sandy margins of ponds or small lakes, its habitats being much more
									hygrophilous than those of the northern forms <hi rend="i">cristatus</hi> and <hi
										rend="i">compressus</hi>. It seems also to vary more in color than does <hi
										rend="i">compressus</hi> in Indiana, a number of the <pb id="VAB8231-161"
										n="160"/> specimens taken near Dunedin being a uniform pitchy black, while
									several of them have a large white saddle-shaped blotch across the middle of the
									pronotum. Others are grayish-white with a pair of velvety black spots in front of
									humeral angles and another larger pair behind them. That the intermediate form,
									hitherto known as <hi rend="i">arcuatus</hi>, has a similar love for moist
									surroundings is shown by R. &amp; H., who state that in North Carolina and Georgia
									"it was widely distributed and sometimes abundant in the undergrowth of the
									long-leaf pine woods, particularly where the ground is low, sandy and
									water-soaked. It has also been found abundant in low spots covered with short
									green grasses in the midst of saw palmetto flats."</p>

								<p>This slender grouse locust has an especial liking for marshy and boggy tracts
									about the margins of lakes and tamarack swamps, though it is likely to occur
									anywhere in low wet woods, and one specimen was taken in Marion County April 15,
									while swimming on the surface of a woodland pond. It is sometimes, however, found
									in dry localities as <bibl>Somes (1914, 11)</bibl> records noting a colony in a
									sandy cultivated field in Iowa, at least a mile from any stream or body of water,
									where they were feeding upon the tender stems of young grain. In Vigo Co., Ind.,
									it was found hibernating February 20 beneath logs along the sandy border of a
									large river-bottom pond. The light band along the middle line of pronotum is in a
									high degree protective when the locusts dwell among the grasses and sedges of
									marshy tracts, as it harmonizes with the dried blades of these plants.</p>
								<p><bibl>Hancock (1902, 72)</bibl> records the finding of <hi rend="i"

									the little locusts by the sound made as they jumped upon the dried leaves."
										<bibl>Morse (1894a, 163)</bibl> says that "in New England this species prefers
									sedgy meadow lands and swales on sandy soil occasionally flooded by rains or
									freshets and perpetually moist. The bulk of my specimens were taken on a boggy

								<p>The ornate grouse locust is a common species throughout Indiana, and may be found
									any month in the year, but is most abundant in late autumn and early spring,
									occurring then usually along the edges of dry open woods and on gravelly
									hillsides,, while in summer it is occasionally found in company with <hi rend="i"
										>Paratettix cucullatus</hi> (Burm.) about the borders of streams and ponds. It
									sometimes makes its home in grassy plots and lawns, especially those which are
									wooded, in the outskirts of cities, and is then often seen sunning on the cement
									and other sidewalks along their margins. The form <hi rend="i">triangularis</hi>
									more often occurs in sandy localities, and in some places far outnumbers the
									typical form.</p>
								<p>On a bright sunny afternoon in late November, I once found both forms of <hi
										rend="i">ornatum</hi> very common on a sloping hillside two miles north of
									Indianapolis. A clover field was here adjoining an open woods pasture, and the
									second crop had been cut in October for the seed. Many of the dead stalks had
									fallen close along the fence row separating the fields, and here the little
									locusts were in abundance, their bodies all grayish-brown, and corresponding very
									closely to the dead clover stems; so closely, indeed, that they were not visible
									until they hopped, and then had to be "marked down" before they were captured.
									Beneath the bottom rails of the old fence they had found a comfortable abiding
									place and winter retreat, and on this bright afternoon had been tempted forth to
									bask in the sunlight and perchance to feed upon the green clover leaves which were
									yet abundant in places among the dead and fallen stems.</p>
								<p><hi rend="i">A. ornatum</hi> ranges from New England and Ontario west to Alberta
									and Colorado and south and southwest to North Carolina, Tennessee, Mississippi,
									Texas and New Mexico. It is recorded by Scudder from the summit of Mt. Washington,
									and in the northern states is often found in company with <hi rend="i">Nomotettix
										cristatus</hi> and <hi rend="i">Acrydium granulatum</hi>, though usually
									preferring dryer localities than does the latter species.</p>

								<p>In Indiana the hooded grouse locust is found throughout the year, hibernating in
									winter beneath logs and other cover close to its favorite summer haunts. These are
									the damp sandy or muddy banks of ponds, lakes and streams, where from midsummer to
									late autumn it is found by hundreds, usually in company with <hi rend="i">Galgulus
										oculatus</hi> and other semi-aquatic insects. Its modest hues agree admirably
									with such surroundings, thus furnishing the insect valuable protection against its
									foes. When disturbed it more often flies than leaps, its flight being more
									prolonged than that of any other of the Indiana Tetrigians, and often alights upon
									the water, where it swims with ease, its dilated hind tibiæ being then of much aid
									to its onward progress. <bibl>Morse (1894a, 164)</bibl> states that it is common
									at Ithaca, New York, "along the stony margins of the creeks and exactly matches in
									tint the fragments of slate-gray shale on which it delights to sun itself,
									becoming in consequence <pb id="VAB8231-178" n="177"/> almost invisible on
									alighting." The short-winged form appears to be very scarce, <bibl>Morse (1907,

									New Mexico, it was taken by R. &amp; H. in wet grassy places along the borders of
									streams and at Tucson, Arizona, was found 3,876 feet above tide. Specimens in my

									<item>This, the northern race of <hi rend="i">lateralis</hi>, differs from the

										more robust, the humeral angles more pronounced and the outline of the dorsal

										distinct angulation of the front border of the pronotum (Pl. II, Fig. 5.) in <hi
											rend="i">parvipennis</hi> are the most obvious characters separating the two
										forms. In color they are alike, while in Indiana specimens the pronotum is more
										strongly rugose than in <hi rend="i">lateralis</hi>. The measurements are

								<p><hi rend="i">T. parvipennis</hi> is a very common grouse locust throughout
									northern Indiana, frequenting dry upland woods, fence rows, and low marshy tracts;
									but in the southern portion it is largely replaced by <hi rend="i">lateralis</hi>.
									Its mating season appears to be the whole year round, as I have taken specimens in
									copulation in nearly every month, even on sunny days in mid-winter. It hibernates
									usually in small colonies or groups--as many as eleven having been found huddled
									together within the space of a few square inches on the under side of a log or
									chunk. Walker has found it hibernating in a beetle-boring in a log, the hole being
									completely hidden by the bark. The general color of the pronotum varies greatly in
									different examples, each insect seemingly seeking that local habitat which
									corresponds closely to its hue.</p>
								<p>It ranges throughout the Transition and Upper Austral life <pb id="VAB8231-185"
										n="184"/> zones of the eastern United States, occurring generally in Ontario and
									New England, and at least as far south as Ocean City, N. J., thence west to Iowa
									and Minnesota, its southern range overlapping that of <hi rend="i">lateralis</hi>
									in the lower portion of the Upper Austral zone. <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1916,
										151)</bibl> state that intermediate forms connecting the two races occur in the
									pine barrens and adjacent coastal strip of New Jersey, in Delaware, Maryland and
									northern Virginia, southern Illinois, Missouri, Tennessee and northern Georgia,
									Hancock's <hi rend="i">medialis</hi> being based on such connecting forms. In Iowa
										<hi rend="i">parvipennis</hi> is said by <bibl>Ball (1897, 238)</bibl> "to be
									abundant in low timberland where the undergrowth is short."</p>
								<p><bibl>Hancock (1902, 149)</bibl> gives an interesting account of the color phases
									of <hi rend="i">parvipennis</hi> as noted near Twin Lakes, Wis., stating that they
									were "amazingly variable but the hue of every insect was perfectly in keeping,
									with the environment. Here one would be on the lichens, another on the swamp
									grass, and still others on the black muck, and yet all, generally speaking,
									accorded with the surroundings. The dried specimens have since changed so that
									whole rows of specimens which, when fresh, presented the prettiest variations, now
									present a dark uninteresting hue." He also describes (1894, 483) a migration in
									September, 1893, when the long-winged form of <hi rend="i">parvipennis</hi> was
									present in great numbers in the city of Chicago, and <bibl>Rehn (1902c)</bibl>
									mentions a similar flight as occurring in Philadelphia in September of that year.
									The long form of <hi rend="i">parvipennis</hi> described by <bibl>Morse (1895,
										109)</bibl> under the name <hi rend="i">pennata</hi> is more common in Indiana
									than the typical short one described by Harris, and Ball states that in Iowa <hi
										rend="i">pennata</hi> is much the more abundant, but <bibl>Morse (1894a,
										166)</bibl> says that in New England the short form is about three times as
									common as the long one.</p>

								<p>This grouse locust occurs sparingly throughout Indiana, adults being found from

								<p>The above is the original description of <hi rend="i">T. spicata</hi>, which was
									described from one male from Georgia and two females from Florida. Specimens taken
									by me in Knox and Posey counties, Ind., and named <hi rend="i">spicata</hi> by
									Hancock, and others taken and so named by Davis from Wilmington, N. Car., and Lake
									Okeechobee, Fla., and by Hancock from Opelousas, La., are at hand, and a careful
									comparison shows that the vertex proper is not more projecting but the point of
									union of its median carina with the frontal costa is slightly more prominent. As
									pointed out by R. &amp; H., "the more arcuate character of the dorsum of pronotum
									in transverse section between the humeral angles is one of the most apparent
									characters" distinguishing <hi rend="i">spicata</hi> from typical <hi rend="i"
										>armata</hi>. These differences, however, are of less systematic value than
									those separating <hi rend="i">lateralis</hi> from its northern race <hi rend="i"
										>parvipennis</hi>, and I therefore regard <hi rend="i">spicata</hi> as only a
									slender-bodied southern race or form of <hi rend="i">armata</hi>. In addition to
									the localities above given <hi rend="i">T. a. spicata</hi> has been taken by me at

								<p>A study of the type of <hi rend="i">T. apiculata</hi>

										>spicata</hi> is only an intermediate or connecting link between the other two,
									and that all three are in reality but one species, which will have to bear the
									name <hi rend="i">apiculata</hi>, since that form was described in March, the
									others in September of the same year. I might add that aside from the prolongation
									of the front margin <pb id="VAB8231-188" n="187"/> of pronotum into a cuspidate
									point, which <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1916, 152)</bibl> show to be a variable character,
									there is little to separate <hi rend="i">T. armata</hi> from <hi rend="i">T.

						<p>To this family of saltatorial Orthoptera belong those short-horned grasshoppers or
							locusts which are so common in our meadows and pastures and along our roadsides from
							mid-April until after the heavy frosts of late autumn. They have the antennæ, with few
							exceptions, much shorter than body, filiform, clubbed or ensiform in shape, the joints
							distinct, and often, especially toward the base, depressed; head usually short, and in
							the leading subfamilies extended horizontally; ocelli always present, and foveolæ
							usually so; pronotum variable in form and size, forming a buckler or saddle-shaped
							shield covering the three segments of thorax; tegmina and wings, when present and in
							repose, resting partly horizontal on the dorsal surface of abdomen and partly reflexed
							against its sides; auditory or hearing organ located on the side of the basal ring of
							abdomen; front and middle legs subequal in size, much smaller and shorter than the
							hind ones, the femora of the latter being, as in the other saltatoria, very much
							enlarged in their basal halves; tarsi 3-jointed and similar in structure on all the
							legs, the first joint, usually the longest, with the under side marked with two cross
							impressions which, when viewed from below, make it appear to be composed of three
							segments; third or apical segment of tarsus ending in a pair of curved claws which
							enable the insect to catch and cling to blades of grass and other objects on which it
							may alight, these claws with a pad (arolium) between them; ovipositor consisting of
							four short, horny pieces, the so-called valves, projecting from the tip of the
							abdomen, two of which curve upward and two downward.</p>
						<p>The family name Acrididæ is derived from the Latin <hi rend="i">Acridium</hi> meaning
							"a locust" and to the people of ancient times the "grasshopper" of to-day was the
							"locust," one of the seven plagues of Egypt. The scientific men of this country have
							long endeavored to have our American Acridians called "locusts" but the majority of
							the people persist in calling them "grasshoppers," and give the name "locust" to those
							noisy insects which once each seventeen <note id="note_037"><ref target="ref_037"
									rend="super">37</ref>Locustidæ of <bibl>Kirby (1910)</bibl> and recent
								authors.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8231-189" n="188"/> years invade our fields and forests in such countless
							numbers. The name "jumping grasshoppers" is also sometimes given our Acrididæ to
							distinguish them from the "green" or "long-horned" grasshoppers belonging to the
							genera <hi rend="i">Orchelimum</hi> and <hi rend="i">Conocephalus</hi> of the family
							Tettigoniidæ. <bibl>Latreille (1831, 15)</bibl>, in comparing the Acrididæ with the
							other families of Saltatoria says of the former: "They leap better, fly higher and
							longer, and feed voraciously on vegetables."</p>
						<figure>
							<p>Fig. 67. Inside of hind femora of a locust; <hi rend="i">s</hi>. ridge with

						</figure>
						<p>The call notes made by the males of the Acrididæ are produced in two ways and in the
							daytime only. One group, whose members call only when at rest, stridulate by rubbing
							the inner surface of the hind femur against the lower outer edge of the tegmina.
							Landois has shown that in this group the inner surface of the femur is furnished along
							the lower margin with a longitudinal row of minute, lancet-shaped, elastic teeth,
							ranging in number from 85 to 93, which are scraped across the edge of the tegmina,
							thus causing them to vibrate and produce a low, buzzing sound (Figs. 67, 68). Those
							Acrididæ which stridulate in this manner are mostly members of the subfamilies
							Tryxalinæ and Locustinæ. <bibl>Allard (1916)</bibl> says that "at best their
							stridulations are hardly more than a brief lisping or a noisy crepitation," and states
							that the notes of two of the Tryxalinæ, <hi rend="i">Chorthippus curtipennis</hi>
							(Harr.) and <hi rend="i">Eritettix simplex</hi> (Scudd.) are produced by "sawing both
							thighs simultaneously upon the edges of the tegmina." In the genus <hi rend="i"
								>Mecostethus</hi> the teeth are borne on the intercalary vein of the tegmina and
							some of its branches, the ridge of the femur being smooth.</p>
						<figure>
							<p>Fig. 68. Ridge and teeth of hind femur greatly enlarged. (After Landois.)</p>
						</figure>
						<p>The members of the subfamily Oedipodinæ usually sound their call during flight by
							rubbing together the upper surface of the front edge of the wings and the under
							surface of the tegmina, thus producing a sharp, crackling sound which has been likened
							to that of burning stubble. However, some of the Oedipodinæ stridulate at rest as well
							as during flight. Thus says <bibl>Scudder (1893, 63)</bibl> "Acridians shuffle, rustle
							and crackle, while crickets shrill and creak and Locustarians scratch and scrape." By
							paying close attention, the observer can soon learn to know each species by its <pb
								id="VAB8231-190" n="189"/> peculiar call. Like the other families of saltatorial
							Orthoptera, the males alone of the Acrididæ have musical organs, which is quite the
							reverse among some animals higher in the scale of life, where the females make most of
							the music and oftentimes much of the noise.</p>

							<p>Fig. 69. Locust in the act of laying eggs. (After Riley.)</p>
						</figure>

						<p>The great majority of Acrididæ in the latitude of Indiana pass the winter in the egg
							stage, the eggs being deposited by the mother insect in early autumn. When ready to
							oviposit she forms a hole in the ground or other nidus to a depth corresponding to the
							length of her abdomen. The eggs are then deposited one at a time to the number of 30
							to 60, being placed in regular order in this hole. During the process a glutinous
							fluid is emitted around them which at length hardens and binds them together, thus
							forming a bean-shaped mass. The hole above the mass is then closed with dirt
							intermixed with this fluid which, when it hardens, renders it partially impervious to
							water. However, if the winter is an open one with numerous changes of temperature,
							many of the eggs are apt to be destroyed. By far the larger number of eggs are
							deposited in the earth in the manner shown in Figs. 69 and 70. A few species, however,
							oviposit in rotten or decaying wood. About mid-April the eggs begin to hatch and the
							sprightly little insects, devoid of wings but otherwise like their parents, are soon
							seen on every hand.</p>

						<p>Born with one earthly desire--a voracious appetite--and with one valuable
							possession--a pair of strong, broad jaws, which move in and out like the blades of a
							pair of scissors--the little hopper soon begins to use the latter to appease the
							former, and during his early life spends most of his time in gnawing away at the soft,
							green succulent grass which surrounds him on every side. Such a procedure can have but
							one result. His body soon becomes too big for its surroundings: Something must give
							way, and that something is his skin. He casts it aside, however, with but little
							reluctance, for a new one is ready to take its place, and immediately begins to
							satiate his appetite once more. Five successive times his skin gets too small for his
							body and is cast aside. Between each of these moults the wings are growing, and when
							the fifth skin is shed he emerges a mature and full fledged insect.</p>

						<p>However, all locusts do not pass the winter in the egg stage. In the southern States,
							especially in Florida, the adults of a number of species can be taken almost any time
							between November and March if one will only search for them in the proper places.
							During the seven winters spent by the writer in central-western Florida the adults of
							30 species of the family Acrididæ have been secured, some of them being very abundant
							in their favorite abiding places. A number of others winter there as nymphs, and in
							Indiana and other northern states three or four species hatch in early autumn and the
							young in various stages can, in suitable localities, be seen jumping vigorously about
							on any warm sunny day in mid-winter. If their presence at such a season comes to the
							attention of a newspaper reporter, the press of the entire region is apt to teem with
							warnings of a coming "grasshopper <pb id="VAB8231-192" n="191"/> plague," of which the
							youngsters are thought to be the advance guard. These hibernating young are the first
							to reach maturity the next spring, in Indiana usually becoming full grown about the
							20th of April.</p>
						<p>In the latitude of central Indiana the heyday of the mature locust's life lies
							between the dates of mid-August and mid-October. Then it is that their love calls are
							most numerous, that their ambitions in life are satisfied, and that the eggs, destined
							to carry the race through the rigors of an approaching winter, are deposited in the
							earth. As the cooler days of November draw nigh their ranks grow rapidly less, and
							yet, with the exception of one place, their dead bodies are seldom met with. That
							exception is the tops of tall weeds where, oftentimes even so early as September, the
							bodies of the more common species are seen (Fig. 15), their limbs tightly grasping the
							branches or leaves of the plant on which they rest. Why this position is taken by them
							before death I cannot say. Of course it is nonsense, but I have often asked myself the
							question: "Is it assuming too much of them to suppose that, having lived their
							allotted time, or being preyed upon by some invisible but insidious animal or plant
							parasite, and feeling their death throes coming on, they choose to fly or climb to the
							most elevated position available, there to take a farewell view of their summer's
							home?"</p>
						<p>A number of species of Acrididæ, especially of those belonging to the genus <hi
								rend="i">Melanoplus</hi>, possess, in the adult stage, only rudimentary tegmina and
							wings, and resemble immature insects or nymphs in appearance. A close examination will
							show, however, that these adults have the tegmina in the proper position, while in the
							immature stages of these and other forms, the tegmina and wings are inverted, being
							twisted about so that the faces and margins are just the opposite to what they are in
							the perfect insect.</p>
						<p>About 140 species of the family Acrididæ are known from the eastern United States.
							These are divided among three subfamilies, each of which is represented in our eastern
							fauna by numerous species.</p>

								foveolæ sometimes present and well developed, in most of our eastern genera absent
								or invisible from above; eyes usually longer than that portion of the cheeks below
								their orbits; antennæ variable, sometimes depressed toward base and acuminate,
								usually inserted between the middle or below the middle of eyes; pronotum with
								surface of dorsal field generally smooth, prozona not shorter than metazona, front
								and hind margins of nearly equal width, lateral caring usually distinct; tegmina and
								wings often short and imperfectly developed, long and short winged forms of the same
								species being not uncommon; tegmina with intercalary vein generally wanting, costal
								area often expanded and regularly reticulate by transverse veins.</p>
							<p>Certain forms of Tryxalinæ are very difficult to distinguish from some of the
								Oedipodinæ, and their reference to either group, as <bibl>Brunner (1893, 103)</bibl>
								has said, "est un peu arbitraire et repose sur l'estimation personelle"; i. e.,
								somewhat arbitrary and a matter of individual opinion. In general it may be said
								that the Tryxalinæ have more slender bodies than the Oedipodinæ, and often somewhat
								elongate, cone-shaped heads, recalling the Copiphorinæ of the Tettigoniidæ. The
								coloration is also more variable, there being often distinctly green and brown forms
								with all the intermediate tints in the same species. In our eastern species of
								Oedipodinæ this variation occurs only in the genus <hi rend="i">Chortophaga</hi>.
								This variation of coloration is used as a means of protection, often rendering the
								insect almost invisible when feeding. The hind legs are more slender than those of
								most of the Oedipodinæ and the <pb id="VAB8231-194" n="193"/> leaping power is
								therefore lessened; while in many of the smaller species the wing expanse is too
								small to admit of sustained flight.</p>
							<p>Our eastern members of Tryxalinæ for the most part frequent the borders of marshes
								and damp prairie meadows, making their home among the tall rank grasses and sedges
								which there abound. They usually move by flying, making no noise while on the wing.
								Several species, however, delight in sandy or clayey places, where clumps of bunch
								and wire grass furnish them protection and food. Their inner wings are never bright
								colored and showy as in the next subfamily, and their tegmina have, for the most
								part, remained a green or straw color in order to harmonize with their chosen
								abiding places. The males stridulate, or call the opposite sex to them, only when at
								rest by rubbing the inner surface of the hing thighs against the lower edges of the
								wing covers. No one of our species, unless it be <hi rend="i">Chorthippus
									curtipennis</hi> (Harr.), occurs in sufficient numbers to do much damage to
								vegetation, and some of them are among the least common of the Acrididæ. In Indiana
								and other northern states the winter of all is passed in the egg stage, but farther
								south, especially in Florida, adults of a half dozen or more species occur in
								numbers during that season.</p>

								genera and 26 species are known from the Eastern States, no fewer than 9 genera
								being represented by only a single species. For convenience of treatment the genera

								<p>This easily recognized locust occurs everywhere throughout the mainland of
									Florida on the wire grass and other undergrowth of open pine woods and among the
									tall grasses and sedges along the margins of ponds and lakes. In the northern and
									central parts of the State the majority of the eggs probably hatch in late summer
									and early autumn, as the most of those mentioned in the numerous records of Davis
									and R. &amp; H., as noted at that season, are nymphs. About Dunedin the nymphs far
									outnumber the adults between November and February 1st. After that date the adults
									begin to be more plentiful and by April 15 the most of those noted are mature.</p>
								<p>In general appearance <hi rend="i">R. brevipenne</hi> is one of the most peculiar
									of our North American Acrididæ, its form and color serving it admirably for
									protection among the tall grasses and pine needles. The first specimens ever seen
									by me were taken near Ormond, Fla., in March, 1899, and my field notes regarding
									them were afterwards published (1902, 149) as follows: "The first mature males of
									the slender-bodied, grayish-brown locust, <hi rend="i">Radinotatum brevipenne</hi>
									(Thos.) were seen on March 22. To-day (April 5) the adult females are abundant. It
									is the most curious Orthopteron found here at this season and has been recorded
									only from one or two points in Florida. Here it is common on the clumps of wire
									grass, in sandy places along the edges of woodland paths and old fields. Its short
									wings prevent it from flying, and as it is but a poor leaper, it is readily taken
									with the fingers. It relies upon protective mimicry as its chief mode of defense;
									hence its organs of locomotion, wings and legs, have developed but little, the
									former being mere pads, the latter very slender and used mainly for walking and
									for clasping the stems of grass. The brown, linear body, when extended lengthwise
									along a dead grass stem, is scarcely noticeable, so closely does its hue
									correspond to that of the grass. The insect remains motionless until about to be
									seized, when it sometimes gives a short leap to one side."</p>
								<p>The known range of <hi rend="i">R. brevipenne</hi> extends from Yemassee, S.
									Car., Augusta and Macon, Ga., south throughout Florida, and as <pb
										id="VAB8231-198" n="197"/> far west as Greenville, Alabama, and Agricultural
									College, Miss. <bibl>Kirby (1910, 101)</bibl> gives "Florida and Mexico" as its
									habitat. I can find no other record of its having been found in the latter
									country.</p>

								<p>A so-called geographic race or subspecies of <hi rend="i">R. brevipenne</hi> was
									described by <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1912, 246)</bibl> as <hi rend="i">R. b.
										peninsulare</hi> (Fig. 74), they stating that it differs from typical <hi
										rend="i">brevipenne</hi> "in the longer head with much more produced rostrum and
									more concave face, longer antennæ, pronotum with shallower lateral lobes, more
									linear and usually shorter tegmina, longer and more slender caudal femora and more
									delicate, shorter, genicular angles." All the distinctions as given are
									comparative only and may be found in any large series of specimens taken almost
									anywhere in Florida. They later (1914d, 103) state that two males and four females
									taken at Lakeland, Fla., "are absolutely intermediate between typical <hi rend="i"
										>brevipenne</hi> and <hi rend="i">b. peninsulare</hi> in character."
									Notwithstanding this admission, they state in their latest mention of <hi rend="i"
										>R. brevipenne</hi> (1916, 155) that "in central Florida the species intergrades
									with its geographic race <hi rend="i">R. brevipenne peninsulare</hi>." I have
									given above the distinctions of <hi rend="i">peninsulare</hi> as set forth by its
									authors in order that the future student may apply that name to his southern
									Florida specimens if he so desires.</p>

								<p>This curious long-headed locust occurs in suitable localities throughout Indiana.
									It frequents only the tall grasses and sedges along the margins of lakes, ponds,
									streams and swales, and in such localities is usually locally abundant. In central
									Indiana it reaches maturity about July 20, and in the northern part of the State a
									fortnight later. The hind legs are very slender as the insect seldom leaps when
									disturbed, but uses the wings in strong, zig-zag, noiseless flight, usually
									alighting on a stem of grass or sedge a dozen rods away. Frank Hay, of Bass Lake,
									Starke County, reported a flight of this species after dark on the evening of
									August 13. Large numbers flew onto his porch and against the house and many were
									captured and used for fish bait.</p>

								<p>Although Scudder in his Catalogue gives the range of <hi rend="i">T.
										brevicornis</hi> as "southern U. S.," it has been taken by <bibl>Walker (1902a,
										251)</bibl> as far north as Point Pelee, Ont., while <bibl>Beutenmiiller (1894,
										291)</bibl> has recorded it from Long Island, N. Y., and Smith from New Jersey,
									where it is found in both fresh and salt marsh areas, but more abundant in the
									latter. From the points mentioned its known range in this country extends west to
									eastern Nebraska and south and southwest to northern Florida, Mobile, Ala.,
									Franklin, La., and central Arkansas, the Nebraska and Arkansas records being the
									only ones from west of the Mississippi. East of that stream, from Illinois and

								<p>Sherborn, Mass., July 15 (<hi rend="i">Morse</hi>) ; Gardiner's Island, N. Y.,
									Aug. 23 (<hi rend="i">Davis</hi>). Of its habits Morse has written (1896, 382) as
									follows: "This peculiar locust is not uncommon locally on the coarser grasses
									found in waste lands, especially upon a species of bunch-grass (<hi rend="i"
										>Andropogon scoparius</hi> Michx.) everywhere abundant. Though a good leaper and
									fairly active, it is not shy and seeks safety in attempting to escape observation
									by sidling around the grass stems rather than by active retreat. I once saw a
									long-winged female fly several feet, proving that with the possession of the means
									came the power of flying. Its sluggish habits, however, in connection with its
									linear form, render it less likely to attract the attention of its enemies, and to
									the biologist it is perhaps the most interesting of our New England locusts on
									that account. It must be seen in the living state to have its full beauty
									appreciated. The singular, almost grotesque, yet graceful form interests even the
									casual observer, and its coloration of lilaceous <pb id="VAB8231-202" n="201"/>
									drab, giving it almost the appearance of being clothed with a delicate bloom,
									pleases the most fastidious eye." <bibl>Fox (1914, 486)</bibl> states that inland
									in New Jersey and Pennsylvania it frequents dry scrubby areas, usually in sylvan
									surroundings, but along the coast it is partial to the fringes of marsh elder, <hi
										rend="i">Iva frutescens L</hi>., along the edge of the salt marshes. At Fern
									Hill, Pa., it was noted as exceptionally common on serpentine barrens.</p>
								<p>Scudder's type of <hi rend="i">P. brachyptera</hi> was from Princeton, Mass., and
									Morse states that it doubtless occurs throughout New England. <bibl>Scudder (1900,
										46)</bibl> gives its range as "Northern United States east of the Rocky
									Mountains"; but it is as yet not known from Indiana, and west of New England has
									been definitely recorded only from New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Michigan,
									Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota and eastern Wyoming. In Nebraska Bruner mentions it
									(1893a) as "not at all rare over the entire State; most common eastward and
									northward." <bibl>McNeill (1897, 210)</bibl> gives its range as "Northern United
									States east of the Sierra Nevada Mountains," and adds: "Its distribution
									throughout the territory it inhabits is comparatively irregular. There is a gap in
									this range extending from Illinois to New York and Pennsylvania, but since it is
									found in New England and from Iowa to Utah, there is little doubt but that its
									non-occurrence in the intermediate area is due to the fact of its extreme rarity."
										<bibl>R: &amp; H. (1905)</bibl> erroneously recorded it, on a specimen wrongly
									labelled, from Chokoloskee, Fla.</p>
								<p>Although the males of <hi rend="i">P. brachyptera</hi> have well developed
									stridulating organs the only record of their use which can be found is that given
									by <bibl>Shull (1911)</bibl>. He states that adults were observed at Sand Point,
									Saginaw Bay, Mich., June 27-July 21, where they occurred in open woods, patches of
									tall grass, and on grassy sand dunes. "The males were often found in song,
									especially in the morning. They usually perched on some dead grass stem, drew up
									the tibiæ against the femora like a folding pocket-rule, and scraped the leg up
									and. down over the wing covers. The rate of stridulation varied from five and a
									half to nine double strokes (up and down) per second, and some twenty complete
									vibrations were made in succession, followed by a period of rest about half as
									long."</p>

								<p>This prettily colored locust is nowhere common in Indiana, having been taken
									sparingly only in the southern half of the State and Tippecanoe Co. in the north.
									It frequents, for the most part, high, open uplands, where the soil is poor and
									covered with scant vegetation, though it is sometimes found in timothy meadows and
									along roadsides where the grass has been cropped short. But few individuals have
									been noted in any one locality. It reaches maturity about August 1st. The males
									differ so much in size and color from the other sex that they are very apt to be
									considered a distinct species. As the slender legs indicate, the movements are
									made mostly by the wings, the flight being rapid and noiseless.</p>
								<p>In Florida it appears to be widely distributed through the northern part of the
									State, numerous records having been made as far south as Gainesville. Below that
									place, so far as known, only two specimens, both females, have been taken, one at
									Miami by R. &amp; H., Sept. 1, which measured 45.2 mm. in length, the other by the

								<p>Charlottesville, Va.; Clarksville, Tenn., Apr. 21--May 24 (<hi rend="i"
									>Fox</hi>); Fayetteville, Ark., April 20 (<hi rend="i">McNeill</hi>). The Arkansas
									specimens were sent to me about 1900, under the name <hi rend="i">Eritettix
										virgatus</hi> Scudder. They agree in all particulars with specimens of the
									typical form of <hi rend="i">E. simplex</hi> received from Fox. McNeill's table
									(1897, 218) separating the species of <hi rend="i">Eritettix</hi> was based
									largely upon the color of the pronotum and the presence or absence of its
									supplementary carinæ, characters which are now known to be exceedingly variable in
									the same species. There is little doubt, therefore, but that the records of the
										<hi rend="i">E. virgatus</hi> of Bruner and Hart (nec. Scudder) from Nebraska
									and Illinois refer also to <hi rend="i">E. simplex</hi> as at present recognized
									by R. &amp; H. Since they have combined <hi rend="i">E. carinatus</hi> (Scudd.)
									with <hi rend="i">simplex</hi>, there is but the one species known east of the
									Mississippi, its known range extending from New Haven and other points in
									Connecticut <bibl>(<hi rend="i">Britton</hi>, 1904)</bibl> west to eastern
									Nebraska and northwestern Arkansas, and southwest at least to northeastern Alabama
									and Buckhead, Georgia.</p>
								<p><bibl>Fox (1917)</bibl> states that in Virginia <hi rend="i">E. simplex</hi> is
									"frequent in old neglected fields and pastures, especially those overrun with <hi
										rend="i">Andropogon</hi> and other coarse grasses." <bibl>Rehn &amp; Hebard
										(1910a, 626)</bibl> recorded it as locally plentiful at Sulphur Springs, N.
									Car., where it occurred "in the low grasses of the treeless slopes and <pb
										id="VAB8231-213" n="212"/> valleys." They first called attention to the marked
									dimorphism in the species, but stated that "between the two types are numerous
									individuals which seem to bridge more or less completely the gap between the
									extremes." Later (1916, 159) they stated that 159 adults in their collection
									showed that "individuals having a strongly defined median pronotal stripe have
									strongly defined supplementary carinæ, while those having the dorsum of the
									pronotum unicolorous wholly lack supplementary carinæ." This is true of the series
									at hand from which the above description was drawn up. Fox says that "both forms
									are frequent at Charlottesville, Va., the typical form being the more abundant.
									Both have the same habitat preferences and life histories and are almost
									invariably associated with each other. Although typical examples of both races are
									common, the writer has never found any individuals bridging the gap between them."
									As both these authorities assert that the absence of supplementary carinæ on the
									pronotum is <hi rend="i">always</hi> associated with a lack of the dorsal dark
									stripes, this fact is evidence that the atypical form possessing these characters
									is at least a distinct variety or color phase. Since it has no name, I herewith
									propose for it that of <hi rend="i">dorsalis</hi> var. nov.</p>

										<bibl>Walden (1911)</bibl>, of <bibl>Morse (1907)</bibl>, and of <bibl>Allard
										(1916)</bibl>. The last named author has given a description of its stridulating
									habits as follows: "I first met this little Acridian early in April at Thompson's
									Mills, Ga., in an old pasture grown up to broom grass. It keeps well down in the
									grass, moving about occasionally to stridulate. If it leaps and alights near the
									top of a grass stalk, it moves backward down the stalk until near the ground. Its
									notes are faint, lisping phrases of a few seconds duration, and are at intervals
									repeated six or eight times in quick succession :
									sic-a-sic-a-sic-a-sic-a-sic-a-sic-sic-a-sic-a-sic-a-sic,-etc. This grasshopper is
									most active when the sun is shining. Its notes resemble those of <hi rend="i"
										>Stenobothrus curtipennus</hi> very much, and are produced in the same manner by
									sawing both thighs simultaneously upon the edges of the tegmina."</p>

								<p>This handsome wood-brown locust occurs throughout Indiana, but nowhere in
									numbers. It makes its home in thickets, in the borders of open woods, in grassy
									plots alongside old rail fences, and oftentimes along the borders of streams in
									woodland pastures, but is seldom seen in damp localities. In such places its hues
									correspond so closely with those of the dead leaves, fallen grass stems and other
									surroundings that it is seldom the insect is noted until it leaps clumsily to one
									side. Mature males have been taken in Vigo County on June 19th, an early date for
									locusts which have hatched from the egg in spring. A single female with tegmina
									reaching slightly beyond tip of abdomen was taken in Vigo County. The ordinary
									short-winged female is apt to be confused with the brown females of <hi rend="i"
										>Dichromorpha viridis</hi>, but can be readily distinguished by the presence of
									the median carina of vertex, and the curved lateral carinæ of pronotum.</p>
								<p>The general range of <hi rend="i">C. conspersa</hi> is northern, extending as far
									as known, from Maine north and west to the Severn River, <pb id="VAB8231-217"
										n="216"/> Ontario, Banff, Alta., northern Minnesota and northern Colorado, south
									and southwest to Virginia, North Carolina and northwestern Arkansas. In Virginia
									and North Carolina it is mainly confined to the mountainous regions. In
									Pennsylvania Fox records it (1914, 493) as "typically a denizen of moist woodland,
									frequenting grasses and sedges around wet depressions," a habitat widely at
									variance with that noted by me in Indiana and Connecticut. The long-winged form,
										<hi rend="i">prima</hi>
									<bibl>Morse (1896, 420)</bibl> is very scarce, not over a dozen specimens, all
									females, having been recorded.</p>
								<p>Of its habits near Pequaming, Mich., <bibl>Rehn (1904d)</bibl>, quoting Hebard,
									says: "The females are very easy to capture when found. They are, of course,
									unable to fly, and their jump lacks entirely the elasticity so characteristic of
									the males, the latter being about the best jumpers of any of the Orthoptera found
									in the eastern United States. They have a powerful spring, but it is their
									quickness which renders them so difficult to capture. When alarmed, they are not
									content with one spring to a place of apparent safety, but jump about with such
									speed that they can hardly be followed with the eyes, and never cease their rapid
									succession of jumps until deep under the nearby vines, twigs or dead grasses,
									where they cannot be induced to stir, and owing to their color are perfectly safe.
									I have never seen a specimen where there was not a thick tangle somewhere near in
									which to hide. I was only able to catch them by listening until one of the
									musicians gave his <hi rend="i">tsikk-tssikk-tssikk</hi>, which was always lustily
									delivered; then approaching within a few feet I would wait, knowing that, if not
									as yet alarmed, the sound would be repeated in a few seconds. If my approach had
									been sufficiently stealthy, the musician would at length disclose his position by
									giving a cautious <hi rend="i">tsik</hi>. Pouncing upon him while busy
									stridulating, I could usually take him before he could get in position to spring.
									So keen and shy are they, however, that often, after a careful advance, occupying
									several minutes, the singer would notice me when still several feet distant, and
									would not again make a sound, no matter how long I remained motionless."</p>
								<p>Interesting accounts of the egg-laying habits of the female of <hi rend="i"
										>conspersa</hi> have been given by both <bibl>S. I. Smith (1868, 146)</bibl> and
										<bibl>Scudder (1874, 372)</bibl>. I have, on a number of occasions, noted the
									females with the abdomen inserted in soft or decaying wood, and once in Vigo Co.,
									Ind., on August 11, a female was discovered in the act of boring a hole in the
									upper edge of the topmost board of <pb id="VAB8231-218" n="217"/> a six-plank
									fence. The abdomen was curved downward, and the toothed forcipate valves of the
									ovipositor used as pincers with which small pieces of wood were broken off. When
									discovered the abdomen was inserted nearly one-half an inch in the pine board, and
									the upper edge of the opening about the sides of the abdomen was covered with
									small pieces of the wood, just as the dust or borings will accumulate about the
									edge of a hole which a carpenter is boring. I stood by and watched her work for
									ten or more minutes, when she suddenly stopped, withdrew her ovipositor and hopped
									away. Along the fence, within a distance of 30 feet, I found 15 other holes, 11 of
									which were fresh, while the others had evidently been bored the previous year.
									Most of these holes were on the upper edge of the top board, which was in all
									cases of pine and perfectly sound. None of the holes contained eggs, most of them
									being less than half an inch in depth. On July 21st, and September 21st, I have
									found them with the abdomen inserted full length in stumps or logs, and when
									removed, eggs were found in the lower horizontal portion of each cavity. On the
									former date the female was ovipositing after dark in an oak log which served as
									part of a bridge across a stream. <bibl>Smith (loc. cit.)</bibl> has suggested
									that the reason for so few holes being finished is that the wood proves too hard,
									and the insect tries for a softer place, or, many of them may be disturbed during
									the process of oviposition.</p>
								<p><bibl>Scudder (loc. cit.)</bibl> says: <q rend="blockquote">
										<p>"The wood must be firm enough to retain the eggs well in place, and soft
											enough to absorb much moisture in the spring. Upright pieces of timber are
											never chosen, but rather short sticks of decaying, charred or pithy wood,
											which can not easily be broken or blown against the rocks. Holes are
											frequently made three-quarters of an inch deep, and abandoned because the spot
											proves unsuitable. In a stick about a foot and a half long, and two or three
											inches wide, I counted 75 borings, only three or four of which had been used
											as nests. The number of imperfect to perfect holes must be as 25 to one. When
											a good piece of wood is discovered, the nests are crowded thickly together;
											and a stick less than two inches in diameter and five inches in length
											contained 13 completed nests. The holes are pierced at a slight angle to the
											perpendicular, away from the insect; they are straight for about a quarter of
											an inch, then turn abruptly and run horizontally along the grain for about an
											inch.</p>
										<p>The eggs (from 10 to 14 in number) are almost always laid in the horizontal
											portion of the nest; they are cylindrical, tapering toward the ends, but not
											at all pointed, and measure from five to five and a half millimeters in
											length, by one and one-eighth in breadth; the ends are equally and regularly
											rounded. They vary in tint, some being almost colorless, <pb id="VAB8231-219"
												n="218"/> and others of a faint yellow. After the eggs have been carefully
											packed away in the sawdust made by the abrasion of the sides of the hole, they
											are covered above with a whitish froth, and the hole is sealed up just below
											the surface of the wood with a black glutinous secretion, excessively hard,
											smooth and shiny, and the upper surface slightly concave. In the spring the
											moisture doubtless softens these coverings so that the young grasshoppers can
											easily escape. Many old nests may be found uncovered and filled with the
											shells of the eggs, but none in which the cover is still retained."</p>

								<p>The stridulation of the sprinkled locust has been described by <bibl>Scudder
										(1874, 370)</bibl> thus: "Its song is of varied rapidity, according to the
									amount of sunshine; in the sun it makes from nine to twelve notes, at the rate of
									53 in 15 seconds; the usual number of notes is ten. In the shade the rate falls to
									43 in 15 seconds, the number of notes remaining the same (Fig. 81, <hi rend="i">a,
										b</hi>.). The femur is evidently scraped gently upon the elytron to produce the
									sound, for frequently, at the commencement, two or three noiseless movements are
									made, the leg failing to touch the wing-cover. I once found three males singing to
									a single female, who was busily engaged in laying eggs in a stick of wood, two of
									the males being near enough each other to cross antennæ."</p>

								<p>This handsome Tryxalid is a species of western range or, as Bruner has put it, a
									"characteristic species of the Great Plains." It is included here on account of
									its occurrence in Illinois, it having been recorded by <bibl>Hart (1907,
										231)</bibl> as occurring at the "Devil's Neck," a large area of barren sands and
									blowouts ten miles north of Havana. There it was found only on grassy dune summits
									near the middle of an old post-glacial lake. <bibl>Hart (1917, Ms.)</bibl> says:
									"We have numerous specimens, all from the one vicinity north of Havana. I have not
									found it established elsewhere, but expect it may occur in the sand regions
									between Galena and Savanna along the Mississippi in northwestern Illinois which I
									have not yet visited."</p>
								<p>Specimens at hand are from Colorado, Valentine, Nebraska and Morton and Ford
									counties, Kansas. Thomas gave the locality of his types as "Colorado and Wyoming
									east of the mountains, where it is quite common." <bibl>McNeill (1897, 225)</bibl>
									records it also <pb id="VAB8231-222" n="221"/> from Montana, Kansas and Nebraska,
									and <bibl>Walker (1906, 55)</bibl> from as far northwest as Vernon, B. C. It is
									also known from Aweme, Manitoba, and has been recorded by <bibl>Bruner
										(1885a)</bibl> from Yakma River, Wash., and by R. &amp; H. from Salt Lake City,
									Utah. <bibl>Gillette (1904, 24)</bibl> mentions it as "a very common species on
									dry grassy slopes over all the eastern portion of Colorado, particularly
									northward, near and for some distance within the first foothills. Specimens have
									been taken at an altitude of 8,000 feet. This insect doubtless causes heavy losses
									on the native pasture lands of the State."</p>
								<p>The name of this species was changed by <bibl>Thomas (1873, 82)</bibl> from <hi
										rend="i">bicolor</hi> to <hi rend="i">coloradus</hi>, the former name being
									preoccupied in <hi rend="i">Stenobothrus</hi>. It is therefore mentioned by many
									of the older authors as <hi rend="i">Stenobothrus coloradus</hi>
									<bibl>Thos. McNeill (1897, 224)</bibl>, when he founded the genus <hi rend="i"
										>Amnphitornus</hi>, restored the original name <hi rend="i">bicolor</hi>. In
									many specimens the median dorsal stripe extends only to base of thorax. A variety
									having the dorsal surface wholly brown was given the name <hi rend="i"

								<p>In Florida this sombre-brown Tryxalid has been taken by me at every place
									collections have been made, and, judging from the numerous records, it doubtless
									occurs throughout the State, including the southern keys. About Dunedin it is one
									of the most common Acrididæ of the winter months, occurring both as adult and
									nymph in old fields and open pine woods. The adults, when flushed, often fly long
									distances and frequently dive headlong into a tuft of grass where they attempt to
									burrow out of sight. In the pine woods, however, they often remain motionless
									until closely approached, depending upon their color resemblance to that of the
									pine needles for protection.</p>
								<p>The range of <hi rend="i">occidentalis</hi> is given by McNeill as "the Gulf
									States north to Tennessee and Georgia and west to Colorado and Arizona." His
									mention of the last two states was evidently a mistake as it cannot be
									substantiated from any other source, and the only Tennessee record extant is that
									of the type by Saussure. It occurs, however, as far northeast as southeastern
									Virginia, where <bibl>Fox (1917)</bibl> found it in late autumn near Deanes and
									Gilmerton in "the low grassy undergrowth of open woodlands of oak, loblolly pine
									and sweet gum." North of Florida its known range is therefore from Virginia west
									and south to Tennessee, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas, it having been recorded from
									Bonita, Denison, Houston and Dallas, in the latter State. Scudder's type of <hi
										rend="i">A. subhyalina</hi> (1875g, 511), now recognized as a synonym of <hi
										rend="i">occidentalis</hi>, was from the last named place.</p>
								<p>The <hi rend="i">Chlœaltis canadensis</hi> of <bibl>Provancher (1876,
									135)</bibl>, described from Quebec, Can., is stated by <bibl>Scudder (1877a,
										88)</bibl> to be the same as his <hi rend="i">A. subhyalina</hi>. If so, it must
									have been based on introduced specimens, as it has not since been noted north of
									Virginia. The description of the <hi rend="i">Stenobothrus subconspersus</hi> of
										<bibl>F. Walker (1870, 755)</bibl> from St. John's Bluff, Fla., agrees in most

								<p>Although this small spotted locust is said to occur in abundance in the United
									States east of the Rocky Mountains, it is seldom met with in Indiana. I have taken
									it but twice within the State, viz., July 21, 1897, when it was found in abundance
									about the margins of a small lake in one of the valleys among the sand dunes near
									Millers, Lake Co., and July 16, 1912, in some low meadows near Bass Lake, Starke
									Co. When flushed it uses both wings and legs, and when close pressed often burrows
									into the fallen grass in an attempt to escape detection. Of 22 specimens <pb
										id="VAB8231-227" n="226"/> taken but four were females, three of these being of
									the green variety. Five of the males were also partly green, the remainder brown
									and fuscous.</p>
								<p>In Florida <hi rend="i">0. pelidna</hi> is a common insect everywhere throughout
									the mainland and on the adjacent keys. It is also found in various parts of Cuba
									and the Isle of Pines. About Dunedin it occurs in small numbers throughout the
									winter but becomes more frequent in February and March, when it is found
									especially in grassland which is becoming green, after having been recently burned
									over. Some of the specimens taken in such places are almost black, their hue then
									corresponding very closely to that of the charred and blackened soil.</p>

								<p>The range of <hi rend="i">0. pelidna</hi> north of Florida is about as wide as
									that of any other North American locust, it having been recorded from various
									parts of New England to Texas, New Mexico and Los Angeles, Cal. It is known also
									from Sarnia, Ontario, Minnesota and Colorado, and between the limits of these
									records it may be looked for anywhere. <bibl>Morse (1896, 409)</bibl> states that
									in New England <hi rend="i">pelidna</hi> "begins to appear about the middle of
									July, being a week or two later than <hi rend="i">speciosa</hi>, and may be found
									during the remainder of the season. It is an active and alert species, leaping
									well and also flying freely and well, sometimes for two or three rods. It is found
									on the drier portions of the land adjoining salt marshes, on the more densely
									grassed portions of ground just inshore of the sandy beaches, and on sandy or
									loamy soil farther inland."</p>
								<p>The only reference to the stridulation of <hi rend="i">pelidna</hi> which can be
									found is by <bibl>Walker (1902a, 252)</bibl> as follows: "The males produced a
									rapid, rattling sound when flying, like the various members of the Oedipodinæ, but
									the sound did not last more than a second."</p>
								<p>The <hi rend="i">0. pratorum</hi>
									<bibl>Scudder (1899, 179, 186)</bibl> was separated from <hi rend="i">pelidna</hi>
									only by the comparative length of the antennæ of male and by the greater size; his
									table giving "antennæ considerably longer than head and pronotum together" for <hi
										rend="i">pratorum</hi>, and "no longer or scarcely longer than head and pronotum
									together" for <hi rend="i">pelidna</hi>. As <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1910a, 627)</bibl>
									have pointed out, almost all eastern specimens of what is generally known as <hi

								<p>Dunedin and Key West, Fla., Dec. 12--March 14 (<hi rend="i">W. S. B.</hi>). At
									Dunedin this seaside Tryxalid has been taken only about the middle of Hog Island,
									two miles or more from the mainland. There it occurs along the low sandy stretches
									just inside the border of mangroves which fringe the eastern side of the island.
									These sandy areas are often overflowed at high tide, and are scantily covered with
									a species of wire-grass and a fleshy-leaved seaside plant, <hi rend="i">Batis
										maritima L</hi>. Here the locust and the fiddler crabs flourish together in
									harmony, the former having been taken on several occasions throughout the winter.
									In life the females are often a purplish-gray with the numerous black blotches of
									tegmina standing out prominently and giving the owner a strikingly mottled
									appearance. At Key West the species was abundant in early March in company with
										<hi rend="i">O. pelidna</hi> among the scattered vegetation growing on the coral
									rocks northeast of the city.</p>
								<p>As the specific name indicates, <hi rend="i">C. halophila</hi> is, like <hi

										H. (loc. cit.)</bibl> from Punta Gorda, Key West and other islands south of

										<hi rend="i">olivacea</hi>, of which it may prove to be only a southern variety,
									along the coasts and on the keys of southern Florida, but occurs in company with
									it at Corpus Christi, Texas.</p>

								<p>Of this species, usually abundant where found, only three specimens have been
									collected by me in Indiana, and it is known from only three locations in the
									State. A male and female were taken July 25 from the side of a railway a mile
									southeast of Hammond, Lake Co., and a single male near Bass Lake, Starke Co., Aug.
									30. <bibl>Fox (1915, 22)</bibl> records the taking of four specimens near
									Lafayette from dry, open, grassy tracts on untilled land. Its scarcity in Indiana
									is strange as <bibl>Hart (1907, 231)</bibl> states that it is found in "all
									Illinois, especially on dry soils; taken at light."</p>
								<p>The records of the species show its known range to extend from New England, where
									it is apparently very common, north and west to Toronto, Ont.,<ref id="ref_038"
										rend="super" target="note_038">38</ref> Minnesota and western Nebraska, and
									south and southwest to Virginia, Shreveport, La., northern Alabama, and
									northwestern Arkansas, where <bibl>McNeill (1899, 53)</bibl> mentions it as
									occurring only in a few widely scattered localities. In northern Illinois he found
									it confined to the tops and sides of hills. Morse calls it "a northern offshoot of
									an austral genus adapted to more boreal conditions," and has written of it (1896,
									410) as reaching maturity in New England the first week in July, and being "one of
									the most plentiful and wide-spread of our locusts, but owing to its small size and
									non-migratory habits, it does not attract the attention given to the larger and
									consequently more destructive species. While somewhat local, it is found nearly
									everywhere on dry, sandy or loamy soils. It moves chiefly by leaping, but readily
									takes wing on occasion, flying, however, but a few feet. Active and alert in the
									hot, sunny weather of mid-summer, it can best be secured by sweeping the net
									rapidly over the ground, a dozen or more specimens being the result of a few
									minutes work."</p>

								<p>This is a common locust throughout Indiana, frequenting the borders of open
									woods, fence rows, roadsides, and especially the vicinity of the coarse grasses
									which grow along the margins of lakes, ponds and other wet places. There, as long
									as motionless, they are invisible, and there they flourish in peace and countless
									numbers. In southern Indiana <hi rend="i">D. viridis</hi> reaches maturity by July
									1st, and the sexes may be found mating from then until after heavy frost. The
									brown female far outnumbers the green one in this State, especially during the
									autumn days, when their hues <pb id="VAB8231-232" n="231"/> correspond so closely
									to the dead leaves which cover their haunts of the summer months. The green backed
									males are, however, the prevailing form of that sex at all seasons. The
									long-winged form has not, as yet, been taken in Indiana. The wings of the other
									form are too short for flight, and it tries to escape when disturbed only by
									leaping clumsily.</p>
								<p>In Florida it is also common, having been taken by me at Sanford, Lakeland,
									Sarasota and Dunedin and recorded from numerous stations on the mainland as far
									south as Fort Myers, Citrus Center and Palm Beach. About Dunedin both nymphs and
									adults are found throughout the winter, usually along the margins of ponds and wet
									depressions in old fields and open pine woods. There the brown form of the male
									occurs more plentifully than in Indiana, and pairs have been noted mating in
									December.</p>

									Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire, west to Minnesota and middle Nebraska
									and south and southwest to northwestern Arkansas, central Oklahoma and Houston,
									Texas. It has not been recorded from Canada nor from Michigan, though it doubtless
									occurs in the southern part of that State. The long-winged form, <hi rend="i"
										>punctulata</hi>
									<bibl>Scudder (1862, 455)</bibl> appears to be very scarce outside of New England,
									and is apparently confined to the female sex. <bibl>Morse (1896, 383)</bibl>
									reports that out of 330 New England adults in his collection 20 are macropterous
									females with tegmina averaging 19 mm. in length, five being brown and 15 green;
									the others all brachypterous, 13 males and 43 females being of the brown and 147
									males and 107 females of the green phase. The brown form is the <hi rend="i"

									Bessey, an interesting account of which appeared in <bibl>Bull. 22, U. S. Dept.

								<p>This is a very common locust throughout northern Indiana, but has not been taken
									south of Putnam and Vigo counties. It abides in low, wet prairies, swales, damp
									meadows, and especially in the vicinity of tamarack swamps. These conditions of
									local habitat are common in the northern half of the State, but scarce or wanting
									in the southern half, except in the extensive lowlands along the Wabash River in
									Knox and Gibson counties, but there the locust seems to be absent. In Putnam
									County it occurs in blue-grass pastures along the banks of streams in open
									woodland, and begins to reach maturity about June 20th. By July 1st, it has become
									fairly common, and it may be taken until mid-October or even later, if the frosts
									are not too severe. In Indiana the male seems everywhere less abundant than the
									female, and is an active and noiseless flier. The female, being usually shorter
									winged, endeavors to escape by leaping and tumbling, and, says McNeill, "its
									astonishing facility as a tumbler and contortionist generally discourages all but
									the most determined efforts for its capture."</p>
								<p>If the records can be relied upon, the range of <hi rend="i">C. curtipennis</hi>
									is almost as great as that of any other North American locust. It is mainly,
									however, an inhabitant of the Transition and Canadian zones, and of mountainous
									regions where similar climatic conditions prevail. It occurs in all parts of New
									England, and is found from Cape Ray, Newfoundland <bibl>(<hi rend="i">Hebard</hi>.
										1915a)</bibl> north and west in Canada to Nipigon, Ont., and Vernon, B. C., it
									being by far the most abundant Orthopteron in the less dry parts of Saskatchewan
									and Alberta (<hi rend="i">Walker</hi>). In the United States it is known to occur
									as far west as Soldier Mountain, Idaho and Sappington, Mont., and southwest to
									Beulah, N. Mex. In the eastern States it is not known south of the mountains of
									North Carolina, where it ranges from an altitude of "about 3,200 feet to the
									highest points in the State where suitable environment occurs." From Maryland west
									to eastern Nebraska it is not recorded south of central Indiana and central
									Illinois. At Pequaming, Mich., Hebard found it fairly swarming by the middle of
									July in meadows of tall grass, and was able at any time to take a dozen or more
									with a few sweeps of the net.</p>
								<p><bibl>Scudder (1874, 373)</bibl> has given a description of the song habits of
										<hi rend="i">curtipennis</hi> as follows: "When about to stridulate, these
									insects place themselves in a nearly horizontal position, with the head a little
									elevated; they then raise both hind legs together, the <pb id="VAB8231-237"
										n="236"/> hind tibiæ bent back snugly against the femora during the movement,
									and grate the thighs against the outer surface of the tegmina. The first one or
									two movements are frequently noiseless or faint. In sunny weather the notes are
									produced at the rate of about six a second, are continued from one and a half to
									two and a half seconds, and when undisturbed are repeated with intermissions of
									from five to six seconds (Fig. 81, <hi rend="i">c</hi>.). When the sky is overcast
									the movements are less rapid."</p>
								<p><bibl>Piers (1918, 269)</bibl> says that the stridulation or call of <hi rend="i"
										>curtipennis</hi> "sounds like the lisping syllables <hi rend="i">thru, thru,
										thru,</hi> repeated from about seven to ten times and lasting altogether three
									or four seconds. It is a soft, dreamy, lulling sound of the country and quite
									characteristic of a quiet, hot forenoon in August and September and is still heard
									(in Nova Scotia) in October."</p>

									from the sandy bed of the old Wabash and Erie Canal, five miles north of Terre
									Haute, Vigo County. Here it was first found on July 6, 1892, and afterward in
									September and October, 1893. On one side of the canal, at the point mentioned, was
									a large pond, occupying perhaps 50 acres of the Wabash River bottoms, and on the
									other side a sandy hill or bluff of the river, which was covered with typical
									prairie grasses and plants. The locust was found only in an area of about five
									acres, on the side of the hill, and in the bed of the canal. When disturbed it
									leaps vigorously, and without noise, for several times in succession; then
									settling down on a sandy spot, it will allow a close approach, evidently relying
									upon the similarity of color between its body and the sand to shield it from
									observation.</p>

								<p>This large and handsome Tryxalid occurs in isolated areas in the northern half of
									Indiana, where it is found only in low, boggy meadows, being more abundant in
									those bordering lakes or tamarack swamps. The males seem to far outnumber the
									females, and <pb id="VAB8231-241" n="240"/> are much more wild and active, taking
									to flight when a person is a dozen yards distant. They use the wings only in
									escaping, flying swiftly and noiselessly for 50 to 100 feet and alighting on the
									stems of the tall grasses and sedges among which they have'their homes. The only
									way in which I have been able to effect their capture was by running after them
									and swooping them with the net as they arose or before they had time to arrange
									their legs for the upward impetus at the beginning of a new flight. The females
									are more bulky and lubberly than the males, and are usually seen in more open
									places, where the grass is shorter, and hence are more easily taken. The earliest
									date at which mature specimens have been seen was July 13th, in Fulton County, and
									the latest, October 25th, near Bass Lake, Starke County, though they may occur
									both before and after these dates.</p>

									quite common in meadows and along streams.</p>
								<p>Of its habits in New England <bibl>Morse (1896, 444)</bibl> says: "Both sexes fly
									well, but the male is the more active and appears three or four times as
									plentiful. I have found it in wet sedgy meadows, in bushy swamps and on mountain
									tops. On Greylock it is common in the low grasses and bushes of the extreme
									summit, and on Mt. Washington in the sedgy area called the 'cow pasture.' It is
									rather shy, taking readily to wing and flying straight for two or three rods, then
									dropping rather suddenly into the grass." <bibl>Somes (1914)</bibl> calls it "an
									especially attractive insect, its trim, neat lines and pleasing coloration serving
									to distinguish it from its congeners. All of our captures of it in Minnesota were
									accidental in sweeping and in every case it has been taken from <hi rend="i"
										>Carices</hi>."</p>
								<p>Near Pequaming, Mich., Hebard found it abundant in a clearing of several acres in

										<p>"The grass growing over the lower portion of this clearing was very thick and
											high and on approaching it on the morning of Aug. 1, a new sound met my ears,
											a loud, harsh, connected stridulation, repeated at intervals of a few seconds.
											Following up these sounds I was at length able to procure several specimens of
											this beautiful insect. They had all very recently emerged and were easy to
											capture with the net as they flew up, but when on alighting they hid in the
											grass, they were almost impossible to find, as they blended exactly with their
											surroundings. The females did not appear till a week later and, at the best
											time of the season, a morning's search would never reveal more than two or
											three of them; they were very lubberly and could hardly jump. The life color
											of the male was a rich grass-green, beautifully shaded and contrasting
											strongly with the carmine of the inner surfaces of the hind femora; while that
											of the female was yellowish-brown, the red inner surfaces of hind femora much
											paler than in the male."</p>

									any other Tryxalid and can be heard at a distance of 50 feet. "It usually makes
									four notes but the number is sometimes <pb id="VAB8231-243" n="242"/> greater. The

									>HE</hi> B<hi rend="sc">AND</hi>-W<hi rend="sc">INGED</hi> L<hi rend="sc"
									>OCUSTS</hi>.</head>

							<p>This subfamily includes those genera of locusts having the prosternum unarmed with
								tubercle or spine; face nearly vertical instead of oblique, head rounded at point of
								union with vertex and face; fastigium or front of vertex sloping sharply downward;
								foveolæ present but usually small and shallow; antennæ filiform or sublinear and
								usually inserted above the middle of eyes, sometimes almost above the eyes
								themselves; eyes shorter than in the Tryxalinæ, being rarely longer than that
								portion of the cheeks below their orbits; dorsal field of pronotum with hind margin
								much wider than front one, its surface generally wrinkled or covered with small
								tubercles; lateral carinæ faint, often wanting; median carina (except in <hi
									rend="i">Arphia</hi>) cut by one or two sulci, often raised in a sharp ridge or
								crest; tegmina and wings always fully developed, the latter, in most species,
								brightly colored. All of our genera belong to the division Oedipodini<ref
									id="ref_040" rend="super" target="note_040">40</ref> of Saussure, in which the
								ocelli are placed near the eyes and in which the outer margin of hind tibiæ lacks an
								apical spine next the spurs.</p>
							<p>The members of this subfamily are, when at rest with the tegmina closed, usually
								dull brown or grayish in color, and they dwell, for the most part, on bare clayey or
								rocky slopes, stretches of sand, along roadsides and railways, or in closely cropped
								meadows. There the hues of the tegmina usually harmonize in a marvelous manner with
								the background of the environment. Earth tints, rock and sand textures, the
								infinitely varied browns, greens and grays of living and dead vegetation, are often
								represented in spots and streaks on the tegmina of the locust, the effect being to
								merge the insect so intimately with its background that as long as motionless it is
								effectively hidden from the observation of its foes.</p>
							<p>The great majority of our species of Oedipodinæ have the inner wings in part black,
								the greater portion being yellow or red. When in flight they are therefore very
								conspicuous objects, being often mistaken for butterflies by persons who have given
								little attention to nature. The purpose of this bright coloration has been discussed
								by many naturalists and several theories have been set forth, explaining why it is
								of advantage to the locusts. <bibl>Morse (1897, 7)</bibl> claims that the bright
								colors of the wings are "in no sense protective and bear no relation to the
								environment of the insect, but are probably of value in the mating of the sexes."
									<note id="note_040"><ref target="ref_040" rend="super">40</ref>Based upon the old
									world <hi rend="i">Oedipoda</hi>
									<bibl>Serville (1831, 287)</bibl> meaning "swollen" + "foot."</note>
								<pb id="VAB8231-245" n="244"/> Later (1907, 9) he adds: "The flight of one of these
								locusts attracts attention by its crepitating character; the conspicuous
								wing-colors, red or yellow and black, in strong contrast, render its flight easy to
								follow, and it is very frequently followed by, others of its kind, which drop to the
								ground in close proximity to it. There can be no doubt in the mind of one who has
								watched these. actions repeated over and over, of the value of these colors as a
								means of signalling, of attracting attention, and thereby effecting or maintaining
								communication between the sexes or the individuals of a community."</p>
							<p><bibl>Vosseler (1902, 16)</bibl> has suggested that the bright hues of the inner
								wings constitute a "contrast mimicry," enabling the owner to dazzle or confuse any
								pursuer by suddenly closing them and dropping quickly to the ground, where the dull
								colored tegmina blend so closely with the surroundings that the enemy searches in
								vain for the brilliant object it was endeavoring to capture a moment before. As
								mentioned by both Hart and Somes, the Catocalæ among moths present a similar case of
								bicolored protective coloration, having the outer wings dull gray or brown
								corresponding to the hue of the tree bole on which they habitually rest, while the
								inner ones are as brightly colored as that of any butterfly. "When the moth alights,
								the gray outer wings instantly fold over the bright inner ones, thus causing the
								insect to 'fade away' in a bewildering manner."</p>
							<p>Since the flight of the Oedipodinæ is almost always accompanied by a stridulation
								or crepitation, I believe that the theory of Morse is much the more plausible, and
								that the bright colors are for the keeping in touch one with another of the members
								of a locust colony rather than to be used as a sort of camouflage to dazzle their
								pursuers. Since the bright colored wings are possessed by both sexes, they cannot be
								accounted for by the theory of natural sexual selection, as might be the case were
								they present in the males alone.</p>
							<p>The ground color of the inner wings and the hind tibiæ often varies much in the
								same species, shading from dull white through yellow and orange to vermilion red,
								and, in the case of the tibiæ, sometimes to blue. The greater intensity of color is
								in part due to age, and perhaps in part to the higher temperature of the locality
								where found, though other factors doubtless enter into its cause. <bibl>Bruner
									(1893c)</bibl> and <bibl>Hart (1907, 214)</bibl> have cited evidence to show that
								a red coloration of wings and tibiæ seems to be associated with that of a humid
								environment, while individuals or <pb id="VAB8231-246" n="245"/> species with inner
								wings yellow or hind tibiæ blue usually occur in an arid or sandy region.</p>
							<p>The members of the subfamily Oedipodinæ are peculiar in that the males of most of
								them and the females of a few stridulate while on the wing, producing a rather
								harsh, crackling or rattling note by rubbing the under surface of the tegmina
								against certain veins on the upper surface of the inner wings. The sound seems to be
								under control of the insect, for they often make it when suddenly alarmed, or cease
								making it if too greatly frightened. Some of them produce a uniform rattling note
								during the entire period of flight, which is generally in a straight course. Others
								make the call only during certain intervals of flight. These change the direction of
								flight at will, and at every turn emit two or three short, rattling sounds. A number
								of species also sound a different call when at rest, in the same manner as do the
								Tryxalinæ, by rubbing the hind femora against the intercalary vein of the tegmina,
								which is toothed or roughened to aid as a sounding organ.</p>
							<p>In general the Oedipodinæ, especially those with colored wings, are very shy,
								alert, and difficult to capture. Owing to their wariness they can usually be taken
								only by first flushing them and then marking down the exact spot on which they
								alight. Then by approaching carefully one can either throw the net suddenly flat
								down over them, or, holding it in readiness, can swoop them quickly as they arise.
								Those with unicolored or faintly clouded inner wings, as the species of <hi rend="i"
									>Camnnula, Chortophaga</hi>, etc., are less wary, usually more abundant in
								individuals and frequent more open places, so that they are less difficult to
								capture. In the latitude of Indiana three or four species of Oedipodinæ pass the
								winter as nymphs or half-grown young. These nymphs reach maturity about mid-April
								and are the first Acridians of large size to be seen in the spring. The majority of
								our species, however, pass the winter, as do most other locusts, in the egg
								stage.</p>
							<p>Aside from the general works on Orthoptera the literature which will be of especial
								interest to the student of the Oedipodinæ of the eastern States is as follows:
									<bibl>Scudder, 1875a, 1875c, 1876, 1890, 1892, 1900c</bibl>; <bibl>Saussure, 1884,

									1901</bibl>; <bibl>Blatchley, 1903</bibl>; <bibl>R. &amp; H., 1916</bibl>.</p>
							<p>The subfamily is represented in our territory by 12 genera, 25 species and three
								races or varieties. All the genera are indigenous, and their species are confined to
								North and Central America. For convenience of treatment the genera are grouped into
								two tribes as follows:</p>

								<p>This is a common locust throughout Indiana, beginning to reach maturity in the
									central part of the State, from eggs hatched in the spring, about July 20, and
									existing until November 1, or later. It frequents the stubble of wheat, clover and
									timothy fields, the banks along railways and the borders of high, dry, open
									woodlands and roadsides. One-third or more of the males have the inner wings a
									deep orange yellow, but not more than one-sixth of the females have them so
									colored. The orange-winged males are usually darker in color, sometimes almost
									black, and the clacking sound made in stridulation is seemingly louder and more
									prolonged than in the yellow-winged forms. This sound is made as the insect rises
									from the ground, and at times at the points of turning in its zigzag flight. It is
									a stronger and more active flier than <hi rend="i">sulphurea</hi> and its note is
									louder and readily distinguished from that of the latter.</p>

								<p>In Florida <hi rend="i">A. xanthoptera</hi> has been taken from numerous stations
									in the northern third of the State, where it occurs in pine woods undergrowth, but
									it is not known south of Orange City Junction. The range of <hi rend="i"
										>xanthoptera</hi> extends from southern New England, where it is common, west to
									Minnesota and western <pb id="VAB8231-251" n="250"/> Nebraska, and south and
									southwest to central Florida, Oklahoma and northern Texas. It is not recorded from
									Canada, nor from Michigan, but it doubtless occurs in the latter State.</p>
								<p>In Illinois Hart reports the proportion of orange-winged individuals to be much
									greater than that noted above for Indiana specimens, but states (1907, 258) that
									in a sand region in southern Wisconsin, where hundreds were seen every day, but a
									single orange-winged specimen was observed during five weeks' collecting. He
									therefore concludes that the yellow-winged form is that of the more arid
									environment. On the contrary, in New England, only the yellow-winged form is
									known, and <bibl>Fox (1914, 496)</bibl> states that he has never seen in the field
									a red or orange-winged specimen in Pennsylvania or New Jersey, and adds: "The
									usual explanation that the red-winged phase is due to greater humidity is
									difficult to harmonize with the almost exclusive prevalence of the yellow-winged
									type in our region, which is much more humid than the States west of the
									Appalachians." Of its habits in Virginia he says (1917) : "In a general way <hi
										rend="i">xanthoptera</hi> shows greater latitude in its choice of habitats than
										<hi rend="i">sulphurea</hi>. Both are dryland forms and flourish only in
									untilled areas, but <hi rend="i">xanthoptera</hi> does not show any marked
									preferences for woodland associations; occurring as frequently in campestral
									stations as in sylvan. In open country it usually occurs in old waste fields and
									pastures over-run with coarse grasses and weeds, and the grassy tangles bordering
									cultivated fields; in woodland surroundings it frequents the low, briery scrub and
									coarse herbage of clearings and borders."</p>

								<p>This modest brown yellow-winged locust has been taken by the writer in Florida at
									all points where collections have been made. At Ormond it was found mating on

								<p>South Haven and South Frankfort, Mich.; Sidney and Valentine, Neb.; Golden,

										<bibl>Saussure (1888, 165)</bibl> from as far west as Vancouver and California,

									name <hi rend="i">A. tenebrosa</hi> are undoubtedly distinct. In Colorado, Montana
									and Utah it appears to be common, <bibl>Gillette (1904)</bibl> stating that in
									Colorado it occurs to the New Mexico line.</p>
								<p>Of the habits and stridulations of <hi rend="i">pseudonietana</hi> in Minnesota
										<bibl>Somes (1914, 36)</bibl> has written: "For the most part it is found in
									open places on dry soil, being often very abundant on gravel hills. It has a
									flight which is strong, but not so vigorous as that of <hi rend="i">carinate</hi>
									or <hi rend="i">xanthoptera</hi>, and its ærial stridulation is less noticeable
									than in these. It is a very beautiful insect and in flight appears almost like
									some brilliant butterfly. On a clear, hot day in June we once noted two males of
									this species standing facing one another about two inches apart. First one would
									raise the hind femora and rub them briskly against the sides of the tegmina a
									number of times, producing a dull, rasping sound which to our ears was certainly
									poor music; then he would drop to a position of attention and his vis-a-vis would
									go through the same performance. This was continued for some time and we at length
									left the two isolated 'fiddlers' on their hillside. Was this in some way a
									competition or merely for the pleasure of the music?"</p>
								<p>Of its stridulation as observed at Sand Point, Mich., <bibl>Shull (1911)</bibl>
									says: "The flight of this species is often accompanied by a rapid clacking of the
									wings. When this occurs the flight is irregular and butterfly-like. Without
									clacking flight is direct and well controlled. A flight of 13 yards without sound
									occupied 3.2 seconds, while one of 12 yards with stridulation required 4.8
									seconds. All the individuals observed alighted on sand."</p>

								<p>The sulphur-winged locust is a common insect throughout Indiana, making its home
									in dry upland pastures and meadows. along roadsides and on gravelly and rocky
									slopes. It passes the winter in the nymph stage, sheltered beneath logs, chunks
									and rubbish, and begins to reach maturity in central Indiana about May 1st, being
									preceded only by <hi rend="i">Chortophaga viridifasciata</hi>. It is most abundant
									in June, and about July 15th begins to be replaced by its congener, <hi rend="i"
										>A. xanthoptera</hi>. However, examples have been taken in Marion County as late
									as September 10th. The male, when disturbed, moves in short, jerky flights,
									sounding its cymbals while in the air at every turn. The sound is a sharp,
									crackling note, and is seemingly under the control of the insect. Many of the
									young and a few of the adults which appear in spring, or those which live on high,
									rocky woodland slopes where lichens are abundant, often have the pronotum and hind

								<p>In Indiana this is the first locust to reach maturity in spring from hibernating
									nymphs, specimens having been taken in Vigo County as early as April 15th. It is a
									common species throughout the State, making its home in blue-grass pastures, and
									especially in the grassy tracts along rail fences between upland woods <pb
										id="VAB8231-257" n="256"/> and cultivated fields and meadows. It also occurs on
									sunny sloping hillsides and railway embankments. In fact, mature individuals may
									occur anywhere in dry grassy places from mid-April till November 1st. In such
									localities the young, in company with those of <hi rend="i">Arphia sulphurea</hi>,
									may be seen on all sunny winter days when the mercury is above the freezing point.
									At such times they often climb or leap upon the lower rails of fences or sides of
									stumps, there resting in and apparently enjoying the sunshine. The species is said
									to be double brooded in some localities, but in Indiana, as far as known, it is
									single brooded, the young hatching in August and September and undergoing three or
									four moults before winter.</p>
								<p>In Minnesota <bibl>Somes (1914, 40)</bibl> says of it: "Excluding the <hi
										rend="i">Tettigidæ, C. viridifasciata</hi> may be considered our Orthopteron
									'harbinger of spring,' being normally the first locust to appear as adult. We have
									noted it in some numbers near Minneapolis as early as April 1, while in Iowa we
									have taken it a month earlier. It is apparently double-brooded, as we have found
									the young swarming in lowland meadows as early as June 26 and again in
									September."</p>
								<p>Of the egg-laying habits of <hi rend="i">viridifasciata</hi>
									<bibl>Hancock (1911, 410)</bibl> writes: "At Millers, Ind., June 5, I found a
									female laying her eggs in damp sand at the border of a pond. When I approached she
									had her abdomen buried quite deeply. After 15 minutes she moved away from the
									place. I carefully unearthed the burrow, finding it to be 27 mm. deep, and at the
									bottom, the eggs, 25 in number, were laid in a compact mass. They were bound
									together with a white mucous, and there was quite an amount of this substance
									lying above the eggs in the burrow."</p>
								<p>This green-striped or dusky locust is one of the most widely distributed of North
									American Oedipods, its known range including the New England states and southern
									Ontario and extending west to Moose Jaw, Sask., Minnesota and northern Colorado,
									and south and southwest to Georgia, Oklahoma and Texas. <bibl>Morse (1907,
										34)</bibl> calls it "one of the most ubiquitous locusts of the eastern half of
									the continent, inhabiting a great variety of environments, chiefly campestral and
									on soil containing a moderate amount of moisture. It is one of the few species
									which has apparently extended its range down the Mississippi River along the
									levees, being common on the higher ground near the river and on embankments along
									canals."</p>
								<p>In Indiana, as elsewhere throughout its range, green females and brown males are
									the predominating forms, not more than 20 <pb id="VAB8231-258" n="257"/> per cent.
									of the females in Indiana being brown, and a much smaller proportion of the males
									being green. The male, when disturbed, usually flies but a few rods, moving in a
									circling or zigzag course, and producing a low but distinct shuffling or rattling
									noise during the whole of its flight. The female moves noiselessly and more
									directly to a greater distance, her flight being often abruptly ended by a
									headlong dive into weeds or other concealing vegetation.</p>
								<p>The more important known synonyms of <hi rend="i">C. viridifasciata</hi>, the
									names of which have many times been used in American literature when referring to
									that species, are <hi rend="i">Gryllus virginianus</hi>

								<p>The above are the essential parts of the original description of this southern
									form. A careful comparison of many individuals of <hi rend="i">viridifasciata</hi>
									from Indiana and <hi rend="i">australior</hi> from Florida, shows that only one
									structural character between the two is apparently fixed, viz., that pertaining to
									the proportional greater width of the vertex in <hi rend="i">australior</hi>. The
									height of the median carina and the degree of angulation of hind margin of
									metazona show individual variations, which are as marked in specimens from the
									north as from the south. <bibl>Scudder (1875c, 482)</bibl> set forth in parallel
									columns the differences between New England, Texas and Florida specimens of <hi
										rend="i">viridifasciata</hi>, and the only structural difference of any note
									which he gives between the first and last is that pertaining <pb id="VAB8231-259"
										n="258"/> to the width of the fastigium of vertex. As to the color, <hi rend="i"
										>viridifasciata</hi> is notable for its variation in that character; so much so,
									indeed, that it has more synonyms than any other North American locust, the
									majority of these being based on color alone. Specimens at hand from Dunedin,
									Fla., are wholly without trace of fuscous blotches on the dorsal face of hind
									femora, so that in the key this difference, thought to be constant, had to be
									modified by the word "usually." I therefore regard <hi rend="i">australior</hi>
									as, at the most, only a southern geographic race or variety of <hi rend="i"
										>viridifasciata</hi>. <bibl>R. &amp; H. (loc. cit.)</bibl> have stated that it
									is closer to <hi rend="i">cubensis</hi> Scudder than to <hi rend="i"
										>viridifasciata</hi>, and as it cannot be any closer to the latter species than
									it is without becoming an absolute synonym it is very probable that time will show
									that all three forms, <hi rend="i">viridifasciata, cubensis</hi> and <hi rend="i"
										>australior</hi>, named in the order of their description, are but variations of
									one widely distributed and exceedingly variable North American species which will
									retain DeGeer's name.</p>
								<p>In Florida <hi rend="i">C. v. australior</hi> has been taken by me at all points
									where collections have been made, and it is recorded from many different
									localities by other collectors, so that it doubtless occurs everywhere throughout
									the State. Like the northern form it frequents old fields, gardens and waste
									places along roadsides, railways and the borders of forests, but is rarely if ever
									found far within the woodlands. About Dunedin both adults and nymphs occur
									throughout the winter, the latter being, however, in various stages, by far the
									more common. As in the north, the brown males greatly outnumber the green ones,
									but the brown females are much more numerous proportionally than in the northern
									form. A number of individuals have been taken with the head, pronotum and hind
									femora of a handsome and striking reddish-purple hue, but this also happens
									occasionally in <hi rend="i">viridifasciata</hi> as noted by the writer (1903,
									259). The range of the form <hi rend="i">australior</hi> is given by <bibl>R.
										&amp; H. (1916, 179)</bibl> as extending "from the Dry Tortugas, Fla., northward
									to Savannah, Ga., the most northwestern localities at which it has been found
									being Tifton, Albany and Spring Creek, Ga., and Fort Barrancas, Fla." It has
									several times been recorded from Florida under the names <hi rend="i">Chortophaga

								<p>The clouded locust is common throughout Indiana, maturing in the central portion
									about August 1, from eggs hatched in spring, and existing till December 1,
									provided the autumn is a favorable one. It frequents only dry upland timothy and
									clover meadows, blue-grass pastures, roadsides, etc. When living in woodland
									pastures it frequents sunny spots, seldom alighting in the shade when flushed. The
									male stridulates <pb id="VAB8231-261" n="260"/> on the wing during short flights,
									seldom, if ever, in the more prolonged ones, which it makes when frightened. The
									note is a harsh droning or buzzing sound, somewhat resembling that of a
									bumble-bee, but louder. It is begun after the insect has risen three or four feet
									above the ground, and is continued until it begins to descend, being kept up
									continuously while it is flying horizontally. The females usually leap for the
									first two or three times they are disturbed, but if flushed a number of times they
									use the wings in endeavoring to escape.</p>

												i-chi-i-chi-i-chi.'</hi> Another sound of an entirely different character
											was made in a different manner. The hind thighs, instead of being closely
											applied to the wing covers, were spread somewhat apart and violently vibrated,
											moving, as nearly as could be judged, up and down with extreme rapidity and
											striking as they did so upon the bottom of the box. The sound produced was a

											Its flight is swift and direct without marked aerial stridulation. In the
											field this species oviposits during the latter part of August, the pods being
											rather short, stout, considerably curved, and not firmly cemented. These pods
											are deposited just below the surface of the soil, among the roots of grasses
											or in some cases even above the surface amid the dead grass, and contain from
											20 to 30 eggs each"</p>

								<p>Species of large size and robust form, having the head large, <pb
										id="VAB8231-264" n="263"/> subglobose, the cheeks swollen; vertex with disk
									usually broadly triangular, its sides distinct but not sharp; apex rounded or
									obtusely angulate, more or less declivent; median carina present, at least on
									posterior half, and continued back over the occiput in the form of a small central
									ridge; foveolæ present, shallow, usually triangular in form; antennæ little, if
									any, longer than head and pronotum together, filiform, the joints of apical halves
									feebly flattened; pronotum with disk flat or nearly so, usually rugose and bearing
									a number of rounded or oblong tubercles, its front margin truncate, hind one
									usually obtuse or right-angled; median carina rather prominent, in our eastern
									species cut once by the principal sulcus; lateral carinæ usually extending a short
									distance in front of this sulcus, but not cut by it; lateral lobes of pronotum
									about as long as deep, constricted near middle, their front margin slightly
									sinuate, hind one oblique or subvertical, lower one with its posterior half
									rounded, front half obliquely ascending, its lower hind angle usually broadly
									rounded; tegmina considerably exceeding the abdomen; hind femora stout, depressed,
									dilated at base, the inner face usually bicolored; hind tibiæ pale red or yellow,
									their spines black; valves of ovipositor robust, strongly exserted.</p>
								<p>As already noted, R. &amp; H., following Kirby, have raised Saussure's subgenus
										<hi rend="i">Pardalophora</hi> (1884, 83) to generic rank. That subgeneric name
									was based primarily on the absence of cross carinæ of the vertex, thus leaving its
									disk entire instead of quadripartite as in <hi rend="i">Hippiscus rugosus</hi>. I
									have pointed out (footnote, p. 246) that this is a minor character, the transverse
									carina being almost as often present as absent in individuals of the same species.
									The other characters used by Saussure in separating the two subgenera, viz., the
									form of the frontal costa and length and form of metazona, I regard as of specific
									value only as they are so regarded in <hi rend="i">Arphia</hi>. I therefore follow
										<bibl>Scudder (1892, 265)</bibl> in discarding <hi rend="i">Pardalophora</hi>
									and placing all our eastern species under the older name <hi rend="i"
										>Hippiscus</hi>. Under the two names, <hi rend="i">Hippiscus</hi> and <hi
										rend="i">Pardalophora</hi>, <bibl>Kirby (1910, 203, 206)</bibl> places 14
									species, 12 belonging to the U. S. fauna, the other two to that of Mexico. Some of
									these are known synonyms and only four occur in the eastern States. They comprise

								<p>The female of the coral-winged locust is the largest and most bulky of our
									Indiana Oedipodinæ. The males, as the measurements show, are much smaller. This
									locust probably occurs throughout the State, but is most abundant in the southern
									or driftless portion, where the soil is poor and the hills high, and in the
									northwest portion, where the sand covered area is extensive. It has not been noted
									in the richer and more level regions of the central and eastern portions of the
									State. The winter is passed in the nymph stage, the young being "curious little
									depressed, toad-like objects" (Fig. 98) of a dull leaden color. Mature examples
									have been taken in Monroe County as early as April 20th, and in Crawford County as
									late as July 10th. The northern examples are smaller, darker colored, and may
									probably be found a month later.</p>

								<p>This locust frequents, for the most part, timothy meadows, upland pastures,
									roadsides, and especially bare or scantily vegetated slopes and sandy plains. When
									in flight it is very conspicuous, owing to its large size and bright-colored inner
									wings. The males are ready and active flyers, moving rapidly for quite a distance,
									making, meanwhile, a loud rattling note which can be heard at a distance of
									several rods. The females seldom take to wing, but leap clumsily when approached,
									and are more readily captured. The head, pronotum and hind femora are often
									largely greenish.</p>
								<p><hi rend="i">H. apiculatus</hi> occurs throughout New England and ranges from
									Maine and Montreal north and northwest to Hudson Bay, <pb id="VAB8231-267" n="266"
									/> Great Slave Lake and Alberta, Canada, west in this country to Montana and
									Wyoming and south and southwest to North Carolina, Virginia, Missouri and Kansas.
									It is recorded from Florida by <bibl>Saussure (1884, 88)</bibl> and from Mexico by
									F. Walker, but these records were probably based on wrong identifications.
										<bibl>Scudder (1892, 303)</bibl> reports it from Nova Scotia, but it is not
									listed by either Piers or Gooderham, and <bibl>Piers (1918, 278)</bibl> says that
									he is "very strongly of the opinion that some mistake was made by Scudder in his
									record." In Ontario, <bibl>Walker (1898, 260)</bibl> found "great disparity in the
									relative number of the two sexes," stating that in five years he had seen more
									than 100 males, but only four females. There it occurs "on light sandy soil,
									covered preferably with rather long grass and generally with other plants, as
									lupine, scrub oak, blueberries, etc. It appears from about the 12th of May till
									near the end of June, the nymphs being found late in autumn and again in early
									spring. Wherever I have found this species it has been associated with <hi
										rend="i">Arphia sulphurea</hi>."</p>
								<p>The rarity of the females noted by Walker is probably not so much a reality as a
									successful hiding by that sex, as in this and many other of our larger locusts the
									female relies upon concealment for escape rather than upon flight, as does the
									more active male. The <hi rend="i">Oedipoda obliterata</hi> Burm. and <hi rend="i"
										>Locusta corallina</hi> Harris are synonyms of <hi rend="i">H. apiculatus</hi>.
									The latter has also been confused many times by American writers with <hi rend="i"
										>H. phœnicopterus</hi> (Burm.), it having been treated under that name by
										<bibl>Scudder (1862)</bibl> and <bibl>Thomas (1873)</bibl>.</p>

								<p>This large and handsome locust has been taken in Indiana only in Crawford,
									Lawrence and Jennings counties. In the vicinity of Wyandotte Cave, Crawford Co.,
									it is in the latter half of June and first part of July, one of the most common of
									the Oedipodinæ. It occurs only on the uplands, where it frequents grain fields,
									open bare places in the woods, roadsides and timothy meadows. The male, when
									flushed, flies rapidly for a long distance, making a low rattling note while in
									the air; the female, as in kindred species, is too heavy-bodied to take to wing
									gracefully, and therefore more often moves by leaping. In the vicinity of North
									Vernon and Mitchell, males only were seen. It probably occurs throughout the
									southern third of the State, where it doubtless winters in the nymph stage.</p>
								<p>The range of <hi rend="i">H. phœnicopterus</hi> is, in the main, confined to the
									Austral life zone, extending from southern New Jersey westward to southern
									Indiana, Moline, Illinois, and eastern Nebraska, and south and southwestward to
									Florida, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas. In Florida it has been taken by me only
									in the nymph stage, at Ormond, Sanford and Dunedin. About Dunedin the nymphs are
									quite common in February and March along the railway embankments, roadsides and
									sandy spots in open pine woods. It is recorded from numerous places in northern
									Florida, but is uncommon in the southern portion, though taken at Miami.</p>
								<p><bibl>Morse (1907, 34)</bibl> states that "in early summer it is the commonest
									species of the genus from Arkansas eastward, frequenting fields and waste grounds,
									and sometimes entering the more open forests." <bibl>Vestal (1913, 21)</bibl> says
									that in central Illinois it is common in bunch grass on sand prairies, winters in
									the nymph stage and matures probably late in May. He adds: "There is in Illinois a
									time adjustment with species of <hi rend="i">Hippiscus</hi> much as in <hi

								<p>This species has been taken in Indiana only near Pine, Lake County, where eight
									specimens were secured on June 20. They were found on open, sparsely vegetated
									sandy tracts, about a fourth of a mile back from the shore of Lake Michigan. One
									of the females has the inner wings pinkish or coral-red, as in <hi rend="i"
										>tuberculatus</hi>; two have them orange-red, the other yellow. Of the four
									males, two have yellow and two orange-colored wings. This is the most eastern
									record for the species, and it probably occurs in Indiana only in the sand-covered
									area of the northwestern portion.</p>
								<p>The known range of <hi rend="i">H. haldemanii</hi> extends from northwestern
									Indiana to Colorado, south to southern Illinois and middle Kansas. It is not
									recorded in any of the Canadian lists, though it probably occurs in southern
									Manitoba. From Illinois <bibl>Hart (1907, 232)</bibl> has recorded it as common in
									the sand region, associated with <hi rend="i">H. phœnicopterus</hi>. He adds: "The
									intercalary vein in <hi rend="i">Hippiscus</hi>, especially in this species and
										<hi rend="i">phœnicopterus</hi>, is quite prominent and bears a row of minute
									tubercles, as in <hi rend="i">Mecostethus</hi>; and the upper carina of the
									internal face of the hind femur is rubbed against it, causing a distinct rasping
									stridulation. The sound may be easily produced in this way in freshly killed
									individuals. In all the Illinois Oedipodinæ the same structure of the intercalary
									vein occurs, and presumably also the same habit of stridulation by means of it
									when not flying."</p>
								<p><bibl>Bruner (1897, 131)</bibl> says that <hi rend="i">haldemanii</hi> is "one of

								<p>This is the most common species of <hi rend="i">Hippiscus</hi> in Indiana, being
									especially abundant in the central and southern portions, but scarce in the north,
									where it has been collected only in Fulton and Marshall counties. In central
									Indiana it begins to reach maturity about July 20th, from eggs hatched in the
									spring. Like others of its kind, it frequents only dry, upland localities, being
									especially abundant in open woodland pastures, timothy and clover meadows, along
									roadsides and rail fences. The males are shy, usually taking to flight when an
									intruder is a rod away and moving in a straight line in the direction they happen
									to be headed, without noise, save the rustling of their wings. The females are
									very clumsy, being readily picked up with the fingers. I have often placed one of
									them on the palm of one hand and with <pb id="VAB8231-272" n="271"/> the other
									stroked gently its back and antennæ without having it attempt to escape. Mating
									takes place in late August and September, and the males then mostly perish, while
									the females are to be found much longer, sometimes as late as November 5th.
									Orange-winged females of <hi rend="i">rugosus</hi> are more common than males,
									probably one third of them having the wings of that hue.</p>
								<p>The general range of <hi rend="i">H. rugosus</hi> extends from Maine and

									northern Florida, Mobile, Ala., Oklahoma and central Texas. It is not recorded
									from Canada or Michigan, but occurs throughout Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska, and
									has been taken at several points in Minnesota. In Florida it has been recorded
									only from De Funiak Springs, Live Oak and Jacksonville. <bibl>Allard (1916,

								<p>The black-winged locust occurs everywhere throughout Indiana and to the casual
									observer appears to be our most common species, but there are a dozen which are
									more abundant. Its numbers appear multiplied because it frequents the highways and
									by-ways of man rather than the pastures and meadows where other grasshoppers are
									wont to congregate. Moreover, when disturbed, it more often betakes itself to the
									bare earth than to the green grass. Why this absurd taste asks the person
									uninitiated in the doings of nature's objects. For the simple reason that the dust
									of the roadside and the gravel ballast of the railway correspond so closely with
									the color of its back that its best friends and worst enemies will overlook it if
									it will only remain quiet. Yea, even that sharp-eyed connoisseur of grasshopper
									tid-bits, the <pb id="VAB8231-274" n="273"/> turkey gobbler, oftentimes walks
									right over it, mistaking it for a wayside pebble.</p>
								<p>Mature specimens of this "Carolina locust," hatched from eggs in spring, have
									been taken in Vigo County, Ind., as early as June 14th and as late as November
									22d. It is usually common and mating by July 5th. Either there are two broods each
									year, or else the eggs hatch at irregular intervals, as freshly moulted
									individuals have been observed on a number of dates in September, and as late as
									October 14th. On one occasion, while passing through a wheat field in late
									September, I observed clinging to the stems of weeds, several specimens of what
									appeared to be the bodies of grasshoppers with the wings of the common
									sulphur-yellow butterfly attached to them. Such a combination aroused my
									curiosity, but a closer examination proved them to be specimens of this common
									black-winged locust which had just moulted for the last time, and spread out their
									soft wings to dry. The inner wings, instead of being black, were light yellow, but
									in three or four hours thereafter had changed to their usual color.</p>
								<p>This locust is often seen along the walks and in the yards of our larger cities
									and I have seen specimens about the base of the Soldiers' Monument in the very
									center of the city of Indianapolis. Both sexes use the wings almost wholly in
									their travels, and when flushed move in a noiseless, zigzag, seemingly aimless
									manner for quite a distance, the flight being often more like that of a butterfly
									than of a locust. Their hind legs are used only in giving themselves an upward
									impetus from the ground and hence are much smaller proportionally than are those
									of such locusts as leap rather than fly, while their wings are much longer and
									stronger.</p>
								<p>The Carolina locust is apparently scarce in Florida and confined to the northern
									portion of the State. It has not been taken by me therein, but has been recorded
									from Jacksonville and Enterprise by <bibl>Scudder (1877a, 89)</bibl> and from
									Marianna by Morse. Specimens are in the Gainesville collection from Lake City, and
									a pair at hand from Gainesville were taken Sept. 20 by Fattig.</p>
								<p>The distribution of <hi rend="i">D. carolina</hi> is as wide as that of any other
									of our locusts, being practically coextensive with America north of Mexico.
									Scudder gives its range as "U. S. and Canada, ocean to ocean;" Kirby, as "N.
									America," and Fox, "All temperate North America from the Atlantic to the Pacific."
									It is, says <bibl>Morse (1897, 87)</bibl> : "Probably the best known of any of the
									Oedipodinæ, owing to its conspicuous black wings and habit of frequenting
									roadsides. From the prevailing brown tints of its color it has in some localities
									received the name of 'Quaker.' In correlation <pb id="VAB8231-275" n="274"/> with
									its large wing expanse its flight is powerful and erratic, and in hot August
									afternoons it may often be seen hovering motionless in the air or dancing up and
									down above a particular spot and stridulating, an act which is doubtless to be
									considered as a sort of courtship. It is an alert species, well able to take care
									of itself, and on warm days rather difficult to capture."</p>
								<p>In Indiana I have often observed this curious ærial hovering, not only by. the
									black-winged locust, but by <hi rend="i">Spharagemon bolli</hi> and other
									Oedipods. <bibl>Townsend (1891, 44)</bibl> has written of it as follows: <q
										rend="blockquote">
										<p>"On August 24 I noted an individual of <hi rend="i">D. carolina</hi> perform
											three times in succession, and then another alighted on the ground by its
											side. They ran by each other several times, apparently clasping, probably in
											conflict, for I am quite sure they were both males. At last one of them flew
											away and the other soon after renewed the performance. In going through with
											it they rise at first about three or four feet, making a light purring or
											beating sound, and then rising higher, change the motion of the wings, when a
											curious sharp, see-sawing sound is produced. Some rise even higher than six
											feet in the last act, others only two or three feet. Many do not remain in
											just the same place while hovering, but vary, falling or jerking about while
											endeavoring to keep the same point in the air. Of course some excel others in
											the beauty and ease with which they accomplish the feat and I am of the
											opinion that the females are sensitive to the grace with which it is
											performed."</p>
									</q></p>

								<p><bibl>Somes (1914, 53)</bibl> says: <q rend="blockquote">
										<p>"From a distance this performance of <hi rend="i">D. carolina</hi> resembles
											the hovering of the 'Mourning Cloak' butterfly, <hi rend="i">Euvanessa
												antiopa</hi>, more than the actions of a grasshopper. This habit is
											occasionally seen in a few other related insects, such as some of the <hi
												rend="i">Arphias, Camnula pellucida</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Circotettix
												verruculatus</hi>. It has been thought by some to be in some way attractive
											to the opposite sex, but as <bibl>Hancock (1911, 342)</bibl> has noted, we
											often find this demonstration occurring only when males are near, and on the
											whole it appears more likely a form of play, possibly akin to the jumping
											contests of small boys. The insect is very social in its habits and
											individuals meeting will sometimes pause and wave the antennæ with every
											appearance of an informal conversation. The males are very ardent in their
											courtship, and on one occasion we found four unsuccessful males clinging to a
											mating pair so closely as to form a compact mass of locusts, not even
											releasing their hold when we rolled them gently down an incline."</p>
									</q></p>
								<p><bibl>McNeill (1887, 58)</bibl> has shown that while the length of body is
									greater in <hi rend="i">D. longipennis</hi> Thos. than in <hi rend="i">D.
										carolina</hi>, the tegmina are proportionally longer in both sexes of <hi
										rend="i">carolina</hi> and absolutely longer in the male of that species, so
									that the latter, in spite of the names, is the long-winged form. However, <hi
										rend="i">D. longipennis</hi>, which ranges from "Idaho and Montana to New Mexico
									and Texas," has other characters sufficiently defining it as a valid species.</p>

								<p>Medium sized species, having the body slender, more or less compressed; head
									somewhat swollen above; vertex shaped much as in <hi rend="i">Dissosteira</hi>,
									but the sides converging more rapidly, median carina faint or wanting, angled
									front margin absent, foveolæ wider and more distinct; frontal costa narrow,
									sulcate, at least below the ocellus, its margins feebly converging above the
									antennæ and continuous with those of vertex; antennæ in both sexes about as long
									as hind femora, filiform, the joints of basal third slightly flattened; pronotum
									with disk of metazona flat, that of prozona more or less tectiform; median carina
									usually high, strongly compressed, cut slightly in front of middle by a deep but
									narrow notch, that portion on metazona usually more or less arched; lateral carinæ
									usually distinct only on metazona; lateral lobes as in <hi rend="i"
										>Dissosteira</hi>; tegmina relatively shorter than in <hi rend="i"
										>Dissosteira</hi>, the intercalary vein less distinct and nearer the median than
									the ulnar vein; wings yellow, with a dark curved median band, the outer portion
									hyaline; hind femora rather stout and short, equalling or slightly surpassing the
									tip of abdomen; hind tibiæ, in our species, usually with at least the apical half
									red; valves of ovipositor short, but little exserted.</p>
								<p>This genus is so closely related structurally to <hi rend="i">Dissosteira</hi>
									that <bibl>Saussure (1884, 135)</bibl> placed it as a subgenus under that name,
									though <hi rend="i">Spharagemon</hi> has priority. Both <bibl>Scudder
										(1875a)</bibl> and Morse (1895a) have published revisions of the genus, treating
									the species known to them at the dates given. All the forms are very closely
									related, so much so, indeed, that a satisfactory separation of the species is a
									most perplexing problem to the systematist. Morse considered several of our
									eastern forms as only geographic races of the older named species, but Scudder
									evidently did not agree with him for in his catalogue (1900) he failed to list
									Morse's var. <hi rend="i">scudderi</hi> either as a variety or synonym, and placed
										<hi rend="i">wyomingianum</hi> as a distinct species and not as a variety of <hi
										rend="i">collare</hi>. If this omission and placement were intentional and not
									an oversight he was, from my viewpoint, not far wrong in his conclusions.</p>
								<p>In regard to the general color of the various forms, <bibl>Morse (1895a,
										288)</bibl> has well said: "Variation in color in this genus, in common with
									other Oedipodinæ, counts for very little; the same species or race may be of all
									shades from a general dark fuscous to a pale buff or even a bright reddish-brown,
									even in specimens from the same spot, yet it is probable that the general tint of
									a large series will be found to agree with the color of the soil of the locality
									or other peculiarity of environment."</p>

								<p>Kirby, who does not recognize races or varieties in his Catalogue, though he

									of woodlands and in old fields. In Crawford County mature specimens from eggs
									hatched in spring, have been taken on June 25th; in Vigo County, on June 30th. The
									males fly much farther than the females and on arising from the ground emit a

									In Florida it appears to be scarce, the only definite known locality being
									Tallahassee, the other records from the northern part of the State being based on
										<hi rend="i">S. crepitans</hi>. In Ontario <bibl>Walker (1898, 261)</bibl> found
									it common <pb id="VAB8231-279" n="278"/> locally between June 24 and October, its
									stridulation being "a rapid and rather loud rattling sound resembling that of <hi

									fuscous band of wing is wider than in <hi rend="i">bolli</hi>, not narrower as

								<p>Saussure's type of <hi rend="i">crepitans</hi>, evidently a unique female, was

									Jacksonville, Carrabelle, Cedar Keys and Key West, they stating that it has never
									been found far inland from the ocean. However, specimens in the Gainesville

								<p>Living specimens of this handsome rock frequenting locust were first seen by me
									at North Madison, Conn., Aug. 26--28, 1896. Specimens had been previously received
									from Morse, and I was on the lookout for it. They were found only on the highest
									ledges in sunny open glades along the Hammonasset River. In my field note book I
									wrote at the time: "<hi rend="i">Spharagemon saxatile</hi> occurs only on the
									lichen-covered tops of the ledges. The males are very shy and difficult to
									approach, moving short distances with a quick, almost noiseless flight, in longer
									ones making a rather loud rattling sound. Their hues accord so perfectly with the
									lichens and gray rocks that they must be marked down carefully and even then
									cannot always be seen until they move. A female flutters down within three feet of
									where I am seated. No sooner does she alight and compose herself than two males,
									resting nearby but before unnoticed, make a rush for her. With short ado one
									mounts her back and the other jumps on top of the two. Soon discovering <pb
										id="VAB8231-281" n="280"/> his mistake he leaps down behind them and sulks in
									disappointment. Arising stealthily with a quick motion I throw the net flat down
									over them and capture the trio at one stroke."</p>
								<p>In the notes following his original description, Morse says: "I have named this
									species <hi rend="i">saxatile</hi> for the reason that it finds life most to its
									taste in unsettled somewhat wooded districts of a rocky, often elevated character.
									Here it finds a congenial home and may be seen during the latter half of the
									season crawling actively about over the lichened ledges, whose tints harmonize
									with its own, or flying from one to another, stridulating loudly as it goes. In
									its fresh state it is one of the most handsome of our New England locusts and even
									cabinet specimens vividly recall the cool gray of the rocks, the glory of the
									golden-rod and the tints of the reddened stems of trailing vines. So well do the
									colors of its body match those of its chosen haunts--the pale greenish-gray and
									ashy of the paler rocks and their lichen coverings, the brown and black of other
									lichens and the darker hornblende and iron-stained weathered rocky
									fragments,--that it is quite difficult to distinguish when at rest, and being an
									extremely alert insect some strategy is required for its capture."</p>

								<p>Jarman Gap, Va., Aug. 1 (<hi rend="i">Fox</hi>). This locust was, strangely to
									say, placed as a variety of <hi rend="i">saxatile</hi> by Morse, but in color, in
									structure of facial costa, and especially in form and height of median carina of
									pronotum, it is very distinct. Aside from the structure of the median pronotal
									carina it is much closer to <hi rend="i">bolli</hi> than to <hi rend="i"
										>saxatile</hi>, not only in form and size, but also in color and general facies.
									Moreover, it is not a saxicolous species, restricted to bare rock surfaces, as is
										<hi rend="i">saxatile</hi>, but has the same haunts as <hi rend="i">bolli</hi>,
									as is shown by the notes of both Morse and Fox. The former (1904, 36) states that
									at the typical locality, Wytheville, Va., he "found it plentiful locally on a
									thinly grassed, gravelly hill-slope, accompanied by its congener, <hi rend="i"
										>bolli</hi>, and exactly matching in coloration the purplish-red iron-bearing
									fragments of rock and soil on which it made its home." <bibl>Fox (1917)</bibl>
									says that: "At Jarman Gap it occurred in considerable numbers in a closely grazed
									grassy pasture on the summit of a ridge, while at Monterey it was common on the
									higher and steeper slopes, on cleared but untilled rocky ground close to the
									margin of the woods, frequenting bare, thinly grassed (<hi rend="i"
									>Danthonia</hi>) or briery areas. In all places it was associated with <hi
										rend="i">S. bolli</hi>."</p>
								<p>If <hi rend="i">planum</hi> is a variety of anything it must be one of <hi
										rend="i">bolli</hi>, but the characters as above set forth in the key and
									description are deemed sufficient to raise it to specific rank. There is a
									possibility that it may have been originally a hybrid of <hi rend="i">bolli</hi>
									and <hi rend="i">saxatile</hi>, partaking somewhat of the characters of both.

								<p>This small, but handsome, locust is quite common in the sand covered areas of the
									northern third of Indiana. The earliest date for the adult is July 14th, in Fulton
									County, when it was found in numbers and had probably been mature for a week or
									longer. It occurs most abundantly along the thinly vegetated sandy tracts twenty
									rods or more back from the water margin of lakes, in old sandy cultivated fields
									and along railways and roadsides. In such localities it is often found in company
									with <hi rend="i">Psinidia fenestralis</hi> and less frequently with <hi rend="i"
										>S. bolli</hi>. It seldom leaps when disturbed, but uses the wings to propel
									itself in a flight of about 30 yards; the males making a faint crackling noise as
									they clear themselves from the earth, while the females are noiseless. In a corn
									field near Lake Maxinkuckee, I once found <hi rend="i">wyomingianum</hi> very
									common on August 17th, over about two acres of the most sandy portion. Resting on
									the soil between the rows, they were very difficult of detection, and eight times
									out of ten were not seen until flushed, unless they had previously been "marked
									down" as they alighted. A few were also taken from the sandy margin of the lake,
									but careful search over a wide extent of territory failed to reveal them
									elsewhere. It will probably be found in the vicinity of most of the lakes of the
									State.</p>
								<p>This locust, as above defined, I consider sufficiently distinct to retain as a
									valid species under the name given it by Thomas. It was so retained by
										<bibl>Scudder (1900)</bibl> though made a variety of <hi rend="i">collare</hi>
									by Saussure and Morse and a synonym of <hi rend="i">collare</hi> by Kirby. The two
									forms overlap in distribution and perhaps merge where so overlapping. The
									retaining of <hi rend="i">wyomingianum</hi> as distinct is therefore more or less
									arbitrary and a matter of individual opinion <pb id="VAB8231-284" n="283"/> The
									eastern form described by <bibl>Morse (1894b, 226)</bibl> as <hi rend="i">S.
										æquale scudderi</hi> and afterward (1895a, 297) changed to <hi rend="i">S.
										collare scudderi</hi> I regard, however, as an absolute synonym of <hi rend="i"
										>wyomingianum</hi>. In none of his papers has Morse given any fixed characters
									separating the two forms, and in his Key to New England Oedipodinæ (1897, 35) he
									does not recognize <hi rend="i">wyomingianumt</hi> as inhabiting New England,
									though <bibl>Walden (1911)</bibl> records it from a number of localities in
									Connecticut. The comparative distinctions given by Morse of greater size of <hi
										rend="i">scudderi</hi> and different fasciation of inner face of hind femora
									will not hold. Specimens of undoubted <hi rend="i">wyomingianum</hi> at hand from
									northern Indiana and Illinois and Gainesville, Fla., exceed in size any
									measurement given by Morse for <hi rend="i">scudderi</hi>, and <bibl>R. &amp; H.
										(1916, 187)</bibl> show that the same is true of specimens from Virginia and
									Georgia. The black bars on inside of hind femora of <hi rend="i"
										>wyomringianum</hi> vary from two to four, being sometimes connected and often
									not, so that their value as a distinctive character is <hi rend="i">nil</hi>.</p>
								<p>The known distribution of <hi rend="i">wyomingianum</hi>, as here recognized, is
									a wide one, extending from Maine and southern Ontario west to Minnesota, Wyoming,
									Utah and Colorado, and south and southwest to North Carolina, Georgia and northern
									Florida, where it has been recorded only from Fernandina, Gainesville and Live
									Oak. In Oklahoma and Texas it appears to be replaced by <hi rend="i">S.
										cristatum</hi> Scudd., distinguished mainly by its higher median carina, which
									will probably prove to be only a race or variety of <hi rend="i"
									>wyomingianum</hi>. The latter is said by Bruner to inhabit the high prairies of
									Nebraska.</p>
								<p>Of the occurrence of <hi rend="i">wyomningianum</hi> in Minnesota <bibl>Somes
										(1914, 57)</bibl> says: "We have, as yet, found this species only in the
									southeastern part of the State, usually on the sandy margins of the Mississippi
									and its tributaries. Upon the almost clear sand which it frequents, its pale color
									and faintly marked pattern blend beautifully with the lights and shadows,
									rendering it almost invisible until it moves. Its flight is swift and strong,
									though not usually prolonged, and it rises with almost the swiftness of a <hi
										rend="i">Cicindela</hi>."</p>
								<p>The <hi rend="i">S. oculatum</hi>
									<bibl>Morse (1894b, 232)</bibl> is a synonym and the New England records of <hi
										rend="i">S. æquale</hi> Say by Harris and Scudder are also to be referred to <hi

								<p>This is a common sand-frequenting species in Florida, and has been taken by me at

								<p><bibl>Morse (1904, 37)</bibl> first suggested the possibility of <hi rend="i"
										>picta</hi> being a southern race of <hi rend="i">marmorata</hi>, an opinion
									accepted by <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1912, 254)</bibl> after the comparison of numerous
									specimens from North Carolina showing intergrading characters. The known range of
										<hi rend="i">S. m. picta</hi> extends from Southern Pines, N. Car., west to
									Augusta, Ga., and south and southwest throughout peninsular Florida and to
									Gulfport, Miss. Throughout this range it is found usually in small colonies, in
									sandy spots of open woods, often in company with <hi rend="i">Psinidia
										fenestralis</hi> (Serv.), being more abundant immediately along the seacoast
									than farther inland. Fresh specimens easily rank among the most handsome of our
									southern locusts. I first became acquainted with <hi rend="i">picta</hi> at
									Ormond, Fla., in March, 1899, and a field note regarding its habits (1902, 84) is
									as follows: "In an old orange orchard I found the male of the parti-colored sand
									locust, <hi rend="i">Scirtetica picta</hi> (Scudd.), more abundant than at any
									time before. He has the most prolonged stridulation of any locust known to me. He
									zig-zags in his flight almost at right angles, sometimes staying in the air for
									half a minute, flying all about an acre or more, and finally alighting on the sand
									within a yard of where he arose. All the time he is up he sounds his musical organ
									with every stroke of his wings, making a loud <hi rend="i">z-rr-zrr-zrr</hi>, like
									the subdued note of the harvest fly, <hi rend="i">Cicada pruinosa</hi> L., or the
									prolonged and angry buzz of a big bumble-bee. This locust has so far been recorded
									only from Georgia and Florida, though it will doubtless be found farther north in

									company with <hi rend="i">Trimerotropis maritima</hi> (Harris) and <hi rend="i"
										>Spharagemon wyomingianum</hi> (Thos.), though a few specimens were taken on
									sandy ridges five miles from the lake shore. It has a quick, short flight, and
									always chooses a bare, sandy spot on which to alight. Unless it is carefully
									marked down it is then very difficult to distinguish, since its colors harmonize
									so perfectly with its surroundings. By keeping an eye on it and stealthily
									approaching it can readily be taken by throwing the net quickly over it just as it
									is in the act of rising. The male makes a slight rattling sound as it flies, but
									the movement of the female is noiseless. The majority of the specimens taken had
									the inner wings a bright red at base, though variations in color, from light
									yellow to deep red, were noted. It probably occurs in sandy areas throughout the
									State.</p>
								<p>In Florida <hi rend="i">P. fenestralis</hi> has been taken by me at Ormond,
									Sanford, Little River, Ft. Myers, Sarasota and Dunedin and is recorded from
									numerous localities by other collectors. About Dunedin it occurs in small numbers
									in both nymph and adult stages throughout the winter, frequenting sandy roadsides,
									old fields and orange orchards, often in company with <hi rend="i">S. m. picta, C.
										v. australior</hi> and other ammophilous species.</p>
								<p>The known range of <hi rend="i">P. fenestralis</hi> extends from Maine to
									Minnesota and northwestern Nebraska, south and southwest to southern Florida,
									Mississippi and northern Texas. It is not known from the southern keys of Florida,
									but <bibl>Rehn (1909, 204)</bibl> records it from Guanabacoa and Havana, Cuba.
									Though <bibl>Saussure (1884, 164)</bibl> says it occurs "in Canada extensa," and
										<bibl>Scudder (1900)</bibl> gives its range as "U. S. and Canada east of
									Mississippi River," it is not recorded from that country in any of Walker's papers
									nor is it definitely recorded from Ohio or Michigan, though it should occur in
									both states.</p>
								<p>Of its occurrence in New England <bibl>Morse (1897, 112)</bibl> says: "This is a
									common and widely distributed species, found nearly everywhere on sandy spots in
									southern New England, and probably throughout the entire district. On the seashore
									it is sometimes associated with <hi rend="i">T. maritima</hi>, (Harr.). It is
									usually plentiful where it occurs, though often very local in consequence of its
									habitat. When disturbed it flies but a short distance, often only a few feet, the
									male producing a very slight, scarcely noticeable, crepitation." <bibl>Vestal
										(1913)</bibl> states that in "the bunch grass of the sand prairies of Illinois
									no species of the Oedipodinæ but <hi rend="i">Spharagemon</hi> outnumbers it," but
									in Minnesota <bibl>Somes (1914)</bibl>
									<pb id="VAB8231-291" n="290"/> has taken it only along the Mississippi in the
									southeastern part. He adds: "The flight of <hi rend="i">fenestralis</hi> differs
									from that of <hi rend="i">Trimerotropis</hi> in being low and direct, but is not
									as swift as in <hi rend="i">Mestobregma.</hi> The male has a faint aerial
									stridulation. The coloration of this insect is such that when on its normal
									habitat of almost clear sand with scattered vegetation and a background of broken
									lights and shadows, its detection is almost impossible. We have often been unable
									to see them, even when within a few inches, except by the movements or by the
									shadows they cast."</p>

								<p>This locust, the <hi rend="i">Mestobregma cinctum</hi> (Thos.) of my former work
									(1903, 279) inhabits, as far as known, only the southern third of Indiana, where
									it frequents old abandoned fields, roadsides and bare rocky slopes, especially
									those on high wooded hills near streams. On the hills about Wyandotte Cave, and
									the Knobs back of New Albany, it is especially common. The earliest date on which
									it has been taken was July 7, when it was found in numbers, and had doubtless been
									mature for some time. On September 24, 1918, it was found to be quite common on a
									slope leading up to a hemlock covered bluff in Owen County. This slope was nearly
									bare and thickly covered with small weathered fragments of grayish-brown
									sandstone. Among these the locust was resting, and visible only when it moved.
									When first flushed they flew only a few feet, the males making a low whirring
									noise as they rose from the ground. When frightened by attempts at capture with
									the net they would often make a long flight into the branches of nearby trees.
									This was the most northern point at which it has been noted in Indiana.</p>

								<p>This species has been taken in Indiana only along the south shore of Lake
									Michigan, where it is common, and about lakes in Steuben Co., in the northeastern
									corner of the State. It flies rapidly and noiselessly for long distances and,
									unless carefully marked down, is very difficult to detect. The darker specimens
									are always found at some distance from the lake, where there is a scattering
									vegetation; the light colored ones on the pure sand of the immediate shore. It has
									been seen nowhere more than a half mile back from the water margin, and then only
									on the bare crests of the highest sand ridges and dunes. The earliest date on
									which mature specimens have been taken was July 25th, and the latest October 15th,
									though they are doubtless to be found both before and after those dates. It
									probably occurs about the margins of the larger lakes in the northern third of the
									State.</p>
								<p><bibl>Walker (1898, 262)</bibl> has separated the form found inland along the
									Great Lakes under the racial name <hi rend="i">interior</hi>, stating that they
									differ in the broader fuscous band of wings, more distinct fuscous markings and
									smaller size. All of these differences are comparative only, the series at hand
									from both sea and lake shores containing examples which could be easily and
									properly referred to either form. I, therefore, regard his name as wholly
									unnecessary.</p>
								<p>The range of <hi rend="i">maritima</hi> is given by McNeill as "Atlantic States
									from Virginia northward and along the shores of the Great Lakes west to Illinois."
									In Michigan it is reported by Hubbell from Huron and Chippewa counties. In
									southern Ontario it is, says <bibl>Walker (loc. cit.)</bibl>, found plentifully
									along the beaches of the Great Lakes and their islands, "where it flies about the
									coarse grasses which grow at a short distance from the water's edge." Westward it
									extends to Minnesota where, says <bibl>Somes (1914, 60)</bibl>, it "occurs in some
									abundance on the sandy flats of the Mississippi and other streams in the
									southeastern part of the State. There it delights in the open sunshine, often
									walking aimlessly about upon the sand for long periods without any attempt at
									feeding, and apparently merely enjoying the warmth. When approached too closely it
									crouches close to the sand prepared for flight, but seemingly aware of its
									protecting hues and not arising until some unusual or rapid movement alarms it.
									The flight is very strong and it can, and does at times, cover unusual distances
									for an Oedipod."</p>

									form. <bibl>Davis (1914, 195)</bibl> records a Fire Island, N. Y., specimen with

								<p>This species has been taken in Indiana only on a long sand and gravel bar along
									the north shore of the Ohio River, a half mile below Vevay, Switzerland County,
									where it was common on September 23. Its flight along this gravelly bank was much
									less prolonged than that of <hi rend="i">maritima</hi> on the more extensive sand
									beach of Lake Michigan. When approached it would rise straight upward a few feet,
									and then move lazily and without noise eight to 15 feet, and alight again, always
									on the bare sand or gravel. The gravel bar was at the foot of a terrace 30 feet or
									more in height and a quarter of a mile wide, the surface of which was cultivated.
									No trace of <hi rend="i">citrina</hi> was found on this area, though other locusts
									were abundant. It is a somewhat larger and more bulky insect than Indiana examples
									of <hi rend="i">T. maritima</hi>, the male being nearly as large as the female of
									the latter. In general appearance the two closely resemble one another and are apt
									to be confounded when they occur together.</p>
								<p>In Florida <hi rend="i">citrina</hi> has been taken by me only at Ormond and
									Dunedin, where a few specimens were found in December and March along sandy
									roadsides and in old fields. It has, however, been recorded from numerous
									localities between Jacksonville, Pensacola and Key West by other collectors, and
									doubtless occurs throughout the State, though scarce in the southern portion. The
									general range of the species is southern, extending from eastern Pennsylvania and
									Maryland, west and north to Manitoba and Vernon, B. C., Minnesota and Colorado,
									and south and southwest to Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas and New Mexico. <bibl>Morse
										(1907, 39)</bibl> calls it: " A very widely distributed species, of common
									occurrence throughout the Southern States from the seashore to a considerable
									elevation, frequenting, in company with <hi rend="i">Dissosteira carolina</hi>,
									roadsides and other spots bare of vegetation. Its coloring varies greatly
									according to the tint of the soil of its habitat, from dull white, through shades
									of yellowish- and reddish-brown to a dull gray." In Virginia <bibl>Fox
										(1917)</bibl> found it "on the sandy <pb id="VAB8231-298" n="297"/> beaches of
									broad tidal estuaries, usually associated with <hi rend="i">Psinidia</hi> in areas
									characterized by the presence of the sand-bur, <hi rend="i">Cenchrus
										tribuloides</hi> L. Inland it appeared to be of frequent though somewhat local
									occurrence, inhabiting open sandy fields and foot-paths and appearing to avoid
									locations where there was any considerable cover of vegetation."</p>

								<p>Union County, Ill., July 21. (McNeill). As its specific name indicates this is a
									saxicolous or rock-frequenting species, ranging from southern Illinois west to
									Arkansas and Oklahoma, and southeast and south to the mountains of North Carolina
									and Georgia. Of its occurrence in Illinois <bibl>Hart (1906, 79)</bibl> says:
									"Restricted to the larger sandstone ledges of the Ozark hills in southern
									Illinois, the insects closely imitating the lichen-covered rock surfaces on which
									they rest."</p>
								<p>Morse, who has traced its range more closely than anyone else, says (1907, 40) :
										<q rend="blockquote">
										<p><hi rend="i">"T. saxatilis</hi> has been taken only on rock surfaces,
											sometimes lichen-crusted, sometimes bare and sun-scorched, either wholly
											unprotected from sun and storm or amid a considerable growth of forest which
											has sprung up since the station was colonized by the locust. In color and
											markings it so closely resembles the background of its habitat as to be
											indistinguishable therefrom when at rest. It is a sluggish, unsuspicious
											species, flying but a short distance when disturbed, often with a distinct but
											relatively faint crepitation, and is easily captured. On July 8 adults of both
											sexes were numerous, on Sand Mountain, Ga., the males actively searching for
											and <pb id="VAB8231-299" n="298"/> attentive to the females, excitedly
											approaching them and fiddling with rapid vertical movements of the closed hind
											legs. Usually no sound was audible to me during this act of stridulation, but
											occasionally I could catch a distinct and rather pleasant 'seep' resembling a
											bird note at a distance rather than the note of an insect. The female made
											similar motions, but less often and less energetically. Active in direct
											sunshine, they became sluggish when clouds obscured the sun and then were very
											easy to approach, allowing the hand to come within two or three inches if it
											were advanced with caution."</p>

									on the northern part of the east coast of Lake Huron. In the vicinity of
									Southampton there is a limited extent of wide, sandy beach, north of which the
									shore is continuously rocky. On this beach <hi rend="i">huroniana</hi> is to be
									found under very similar but more boreal conditions to those under which <hi

									and its stridulation is peculiar, being a very rapid but not loud crepitation,
									interrupted about thrice in a second, so that at a little distance it seems to be
									composed of separate notes. Usually three, sometimes four of these, are produced

								<p>A species of northern distribution ranging from Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and New

								<p>In New England <bibl>Morse (1897, 113)</bibl> says that: "Its favorite haunts are
									bare ledges on elevated land and low mountains. On these it delights to bask in
									the sunshine, crawling about over the lichen-covered and weather-beaten rocks with
									whose tints its coloring harmonizes, or to hover in the air above them, sharply
									stridulating. Its 'song' in flight is the loudest produced by any of our locusts,
									and consists of a series of separate notes, clicks or snaps, not a rattle, and is
									readily distinguished by this peculiar snapping quality. It is one of the wariest
									of our locusts, being especially shy and difficult to approach during the warmer
									part of the day, when it often flies away to a distance of several rods and
									circles about, returning to the place whence it started, or dances up and down in
									the air, snapping loudly. The female sometimes makes a soft flutter or shuffle of
									wings in flight, probably corresponding to the snapping of the male, and both
									sexes can fly silently at will. I have seen the male stridulate when at rest,
									also, by rubbing the hind thighs against the tegmina, producing a 'scritching'
									sound audible at a distance of three or four feet. The intercalary vein is
									toothed, in a low but continuous series, for its entire length in the male, and on
									the distal half or more in the female, in which the teeth are lower and barely
									perceptible."</p>


								<pb id="VAB8231-302" n="301"/>

								<p><bibl>Piers (1918, 284)</bibl> has written entertainingly of the habits of <hi
										rend="i">C. verruculatus</hi> as follows: <q rend="blockquote">
										<p>"When in flight it produces a loud, sharp snapping or cracking sound. <hi
												rend="i">klip, klip, klip,</hi> repeated usually about five or six times,
											which is familiar to every one on a hot summer day. From this sound it is
											usually called 'Cracker' or sometimes 'Snapper' by boys and others, it thus
											being the only species of locust which has been favored with a distinctive
											common-name in Nova Scotia. It also somtimes flies with a rustling or
											fluttering sound. When on the ground it is difficult to detect, as its color
											harmonizes well with that of its surroundings, but on the wing it at once
											proclaims itself by its note and the distribution of the yellow on its
											brightly colored wings. Its flight is often in a zig-zag course. It does not
											always wait to be flushed, but is in the habit of taking short flights over
											its location, cracking as it goes, in pure exuberance of spirits."</p>
										<p>"I must say I have not much fondness for such a dusty, dirty-looking
											frequenter of hot, dry highways and other parched and stony places in the full
											glare of the sun. He delights in such dusty and arid spots, as well as the
											oily-smelling ballast of breezeless railway cuttings; and the hotter and more
											sweltering the day, the better he is pleased, the more active he becomes, and
											the quicker, louder, sharper and more gleefully he cracks his wings, like a
											man snapping his fingers derisively at the world which disagrees with him.
											Only when he rises from earth, do we catch a glimpse of the hidden gold in his
											sombre make-up."</p>
									</q>
								</p>

								<p><bibl>Somes (1914, 62)</bibl> says of the species in Minnesota: <q
										rend="blockquote">
										<p>"It is primarily an insect of dry or even dusty places and is somewhat
											saxicolous, loving rocky exposures. On the granite hills about Lake Vermillion
											it occurs in countless numbers and on a bright day the stridulation of the
											males in flight fills the air. The flight of this species is the strongest and
											longest of all our Oedipods, possibly excepting <hi rend="i"
												>Trimerotropis</hi>, and is very indirect in its course, often completely
											circling about the observer and ending near the point from which it started.
											The arial stridulation of the males is a sharp crackling, very like that of
											the <hi rend="i">Arphias</hi> but much louder and more continuous. We once
											noted an interesting performance by three males. Out in the center of a
											railway switch yard, these three were grouped closely together, and so intent
											were they that we were able to approach within a few feet without alarming
											them. First one would raise both hind femora high up and with a quick jerky
											movement rub them vigorously against the sides of the tegmina; after a time he
											would pause and stand at attention while one of his mates took up the
											performance. To our ear no 'music' was audible save a faint grating noise, far
											from melodious. This peformance was repeated time after time and we do not
											know how long it might have been continued had they not been interrupted by a
											heavily loaded ore train. As to the object of such demonstration, we have no
											explanation to offer since there were no females within a rod or more.</p>
										<p>"In Tower and some of the other northern towns of Minnesota, this usually shy
											insect takes the place of <hi rend="i">Dissosteira</hi> in the streets and
											appears as thoroughly at home there as the 'Carolina loucst' in the southern
											cities. At Tower we have noted that while it is abundant on the streets during
											the warmer part of the day, it disappears by about five o'clock in the
											afternoon <pb id="VAB8231-303" n="302"/> and upon search we found it on weeds,
											posts, and other somewhat elevated places, apparently having retired for the
											night. It remained thus until rather late in the morning, not becoming active
											until nearly nine o'clock. While thus at rest, the insect is very sluggish and
											does not start readily, making it easy to take such as may be desired. In the
											habit of poising motionless in the air, this insect also resembles <hi
												rend="i">Dissosteira</hi> and may be seen at times suspending itself in the
											air, much more like a butterfly in appearance than a locust."</p>

								</lg>
							</q>

							<p>The species of this subfamily may be easily recognized by the presence of a
								distinct spine or tubercle on the prosternum between the front pair of legs. They
								vary much in size and general appearance, and among them are found our most
								injurious insects of the order Orthoptera. They have the head, in general, smaller
								and less swollen than in the two preceding subfamilies; face rarely (<hi rend="i"
									>Leptysmi</hi>) very oblique, usually nearly perpendicular; disk of vertex seldom
								sunken or concave, its sides low, rounded, often obsolete; foveolæ usually wanting
								or indistinct; pronotum with disk always free from tubercles and prominent wrinkles,
								its hind margin usually broadly rounded, never acute-angled; median carina always
								low and usually of nearly equal height throughout; lateral carinæ, with few
								exceptions, rounded or obsolete; tegmina usually well developed, but in a number of
								species very short, and in a few wholly wanting; inner wings (except in <hi rend="i"
									>Romalea</hi>) never brightly colored as in the Oedipodinæ, but usually
								transparent.</p>
							<p>The prevailing color of most species of the subfamily is dull olivaceous brown,
								though a number of them are so striped or mottled with yellow, green or fuscous as
								to be decidedly handsome. Among the members of the principal genus (<hi rend="i"
									>Melanoplus</hi>) there is considerable variation in color locally, according to
								the character of the station where found, and also seasonably, whether collected
								early or late in the fall. As a rule specimens collected after a number of hard
								frosts are duller, darker and more suffused than summer examples, the coloration of
								the individual being apparently considerably modified by such exposure.</p>


							<pb id="VAB8231-304" n="303"/>

							<p>With few exceptions, all of our northern species pass the winter in the egg stage,
								and begin to reach maturity about June 1st, though most of them are not common until
								July. The Kentucky blue-grass and the different kinds of meadow grasses are then a
								darker green and, when rank, turn brown early in the autumn. The different species
								of <hi rend="i">Melanoplus</hi> and other locusts whose hues are olive green or
								brown, find in the falled clumps of these grasses places of hiding well suiting
								their color, as well as an abundance of food well suiting their taste. In Florida
								and other southern states more species pass the winter as adults, though even there
								the majority are represented during the winter months by the eggs alone.</p>
							<p>The males of Locustinæ rarely stridulate, and then only when at rest, by rubbing
								the inner surface of the hind femora against the outer surface of the tegmina.
									<bibl>Scudder (1893, 75)</bibl> has mentioned the stridulation movements, without
								record of sound, in <hi rend="i">Melanoplus femur-rubrum</hi>. Morse (Ms.) is
								inclined to doubt the production of sound by the majority of our species, though all
								have the "ear" or tympanal membrane present, stating that: "It seems to me not
								unlikely that they might make the movement (as a family characteristic) even if no
								sound was produced."</p>
							<p>The literature, treating more or less especially of North American Locustinæ, is as
								follows: <bibl>Scudder, 1875b, 1878, 1896d, 1897, 1897a, 1897b, 1899b, 1899c</bibl>;

									taken at numerous localities in Florida as far south as Homestead and Chokoloskee.
									It occurs especially along the margins of cultivated grounds, roadsides and
									railways, though often found on the undergrowth in open pine woods. The young
									begin to appear in southern Florida in February, the first ones becoming mature
									about June 10. Davis found the adults in numbers at Punta Gorda as late as Nov.
									15, where "they were feeding on a papilionaceous plant along an old railroad
									embankment, and when disturbed would walk off in an amusingly stately, dignified
									manner. This lubber grasshopper can make a hissing sound, which is produced by the
									air being forced from the large stigmata near the base of the wings. This was more
									particularly noticed in recently matured individuals." <bibl>Morse (1907,
										42)</bibl> also notes this defensive action, stating that: "When disturbed, the
									tegmina are often elevated and the brilliant carmine wings rapidly vibrated,
									producing a buzzing noise. If taken in hand, a disagreeable dark-brown, frothy
									liquid is effused with a hissing sound from the mesothoracic spiracles, which
									probably is repugnatory in function."</p>
								<p>The young of this lubberly locust differ much in hue from the adults being
									usually greenish-black in color with a narrow median dorsal stripe, hind edge of
									thorax, and often the fore femora and sides of head, blood-red. Sometimes they are
									a nearly uniform reddish-brown instead of black and red, and as they grow in size
										<pb id="VAB8231-307" n="306"/> the red markings change to orange-yellow. During
									their early life they are more gregarious than the young of other species, 50 to
									75 of them often occurring on a single weed or bunch of grass, whose leaves they
									wholly devour. They are very slow and clumsy in movement, crawling feebly over the
									ground when knocked off the plant to which they are clinging. Their natural
									enemies are few, they being apparently so nauseating that even chickens reject
									them as food. <bibl>C. R. Dodge (1877)</bibl> says that: "At times the insect is
									injurious on truck farms in the Gulf States, as it destroys all kinds of
									vegetables, melons, etc., even crawling up into peach and fig trees to devour the
									fruit. As they cannot fly and leap but short distances, they can be easily
									destroyed by sweeping into nets or by simply crushing them on the ground by the
									foot, first jarring them down from the plants on which they are feeding."</p>
								<p>Of the stridulation of <hi rend="i">R. microptera</hi>
									<bibl>Scudder (1893, 75; 1897d, 102)</bibl> says: "I received two females of this
									species alive, and kept one of them for some time. She was excessively deliberate
									in her movements, cleaning her antennæ by treading upon one at a time and drawing
									it from under her feet. In the sunshine she stridulated by raising her tegmina
									directly upward against the half-opened wings, making a rough, scratching sound,
									which was repeated rather rapidly but variably from two to ten times." He adds
									that Dr. Shufeldt has recorded the males preceding mating as "keeping up a very
									audible buzzing racket with their fore wings which they elevated and lowered at a
									few seconds intervals, showing the lower carmine pair each time they did so, with
									telling effect."</p>
								<p>The known range of <hi rend="i">R. microptera</hi> is principally confined to the
									Lower Austral zone, extending from Cabarrus Co., N. Car., west to Lookout
									Mountain, Tenn., and south and southwest throughout the mainland of Florida,
									Georgia and probably Alabama and Mississippi, to New Orleans, La. Adults of the
									black form <hi rend="i">marci</hi> are known only from the region north of
									Florida. As already noted, it has been mentioned or recorded under many synonymous
									names, chief among which are <hi rend="i">Dictyophorus reticulatus</hi> Thunb.,
										<hi rend="i">D. guttatus</hi> Stoll and <hi rend="i">D. marci</hi> Serv., the
									latter being the melanistic form above described. The <hi rend="i">Rhomalea

									<bibl>Kirby (1910, 370)</bibl> and the <hi rend="i">R. centurio</hi> of
										<bibl>Thos. (1873, 179)</bibl> nec Drury, are also to be referred to <hi

									locusts from the southern United States east of the Mississippi are to be referred

								<p>Vigo Co., Ind., May 21--Oct. 11; Gainesville, Little River, Moore Haven, Palm
									Beach Canal, Cape Sable and Dunedin, Fla., Nov. 4--April (<hi rend="i">W. S.
										B.</hi>). In Indiana this slender-bodied, graceful species has as yet been taken
									only in Vigo County, where it was first found in October, 1892. It was then quite
									common on the tall sedges and rushes which grew near the margin of a large pond in
									the Wabash River bottoms, nine miles below Terre Haute. Its range before that time
									had been supposed to be a strictly southern one, it having been recorded only from
									Florida and North Carolina. Its occurrence in numbers as far north as central
									Indiana was, therefore, of especial interest, and can only be accounted for by the
									presence of the broad and sheltering valley of the Wabash, within the confines of
									which it finds a climate and a vegetation congenial to its taste.</p>
								<p>In 1893 and 1894 the insect was still present, though in rapidly decreasing
									numbers, as the pond was partially drained. I was much surprised to find, on May
									21, 1893, a fully developed male with soft flabby wings, as though just moulted,
									though no others of any age were seen on that date. In October, 1917, I again
									visited the former site of the pond, but found only a vast cornfield, with no
									signs of this or the other rare Orthoptera, which formerly dwelt in numbers, in
									that locality. If still a member of the Indiana fauna, <hi rend="i"
										>marginicollis</hi> will probably be found only about the margins of the larger
									ponds in the lower Wabash Valley.</p>
								<p>At the Indiana locality mentioned, as well as in Florida, <hi rend="i"
										>marginicollis</hi> has never been seen on the ground, and has never been noted
									to leap when disturbed, but always moves with a quick and noiseless flight for 20
									or more feet to a stem of grass, sedge or rush, on which it alights. The instant
									it grasps the stem it dodges quickly around to the side opposite the intruder.
									Then, holding <pb id="VAB8231-310" n="309"/> the stem firmly with its short front
									and middle legs, it draws its slender hind femora close up against the body, and
									folding the tibiæ into position, hugs its support as closely as possible, and
									remains perfectly motionless. Its body is almost cylindrical, and being of the
									same general color of the plant on which it rests, it is almost impossible to
									detect it, unless one notes exactly where it alights. Eight times out of ten a
									person, by approaching quietly, can reach his hand about the plant stem and grasp
									the insect. Its habits thus excellently illustrate the so-called "protective
									mimicry" of form and coloring, as it always seems to choose a cylindrical object,
									and one similar to its own color before alighting.</p>
								<p>Aside from the localities above mentioned, <hi rend="i">L. marginicollis</hi> has
									been recorded from numerous other stations in Florida and doubtless occurs in
									suitable environments throughout the mainland of that State. About Dunedin both
									adults and nymphs occur throughout the winter on and among the brown stems of tall
									sedges and grasses along the borders of ponds and marshes. A half dozen or more
									specimens of the pink individuals are taken each winter around the borders of a
									certain wet-weather pond. According to Dr. Hancock, these are the first pink
									Acridians which have been noted in the United States. The species ranges from
									Maryland and Virginia, west to southern Indiana and Nebraska, and south and
									southwest to Florida, Texas and Southern California.<ref id="ref_047" rend="super"

									numerous localities between Appalachicola and Jacksonville in the north, and Miami
									and Ft. Myers in the south. At Dunedin, on March 22, 1913, it was found in
									abundance on the foliage of the pickerel weed, <hi rend="i">Pontederia
										cordata</hi> L., then in full blossom along the margin of a pond. It has since
									been noted in small numbers each season, but only in the adult stage, along the
									pathways of low, open pine woods near the margins of wet hammocks. Much more wary
									than <hi rend="i">Leptysma</hi>, which it resembles closely in form and habits, it
									often flies long distances when flushed, and invariably alights on the leaves of
									cabbage palmetto or green grass or sedge where, slipping quickly behind a leaf or

										has replaced the long used specific name of this well known locust with that of

										placing of the locust under <hi rend="i">Libellula</hi> was an error by Drury

										to the correction made by Drury in a footnote on page XVIII, Volume III, of the

									<pb id="VAB8231-314" n="313"/> moulted, one of the most handsome. It probably
									occurs in all the counties, but is much less common in the northern ones. Freshly
									moulted, mature specimens, from eggs hatched in spring, have been taken in Vigo
									County on June 18th, and on three different occasions numerous specimens have been
									seen as late as November 22d. On this date, in Marion County, when the government
									thermometer rgistered 17° in the morning, several were flushed in the afternoon,
									though a cold, raw wind was blowing. In the central and southern parts of the
									State it is more abundant in mid-autumn than in summer. There occasionally may be
									two broods in one season, as I have found the nymphs common in Vigo Co. on October
									15 and 21.</p>
								<figure>
									<p>Fig. 113. Male. Natural size. (After Lugger.)</p>

								<p>This species is noted for its extended migrations and when a second brood
									appears, they are doubtless from eggs laid by mature specimens which have entered
									the State in early spring. About 3 o'clock in the morning of April 11, 1893, the
									city of Terre Haute, Ind., was visited with a severe storm of rain and wind from
									the southwest. A number of buildings were unroofed and many shade and forest trees
									twisted and broken off. While on my way to the high school building several
									persons informed me that they had, that morning, seen specimens of "gigantic
									grasshoppers" on the street, but were unable to capture them. About 10 o'clock one
									of my former pupils brought me two living specimens of <hi rend="i">S.
										americana</hi>, which she had picked up from the sidewalk near her home. They
									had come sailing in on the wings of the wind from some distant point in the
									southwest, where they had passed the winter in the mature state or as an advanced
									form of the young.<ref id="ref_049" rend="super" target="note_049">48</ref> Mature
									individuals which had doubtless migrated have also been taken in Lake County on
									May 13, and one is recorded by <bibl>Fox (1916)</bibl> as taken at Lafayette in
									late March.</p>
								<p>In the southern portion of Indiana, <hi rend="i">americana</hi> is always found
									in dry, upland localities, such as the borders of roads, old meadows, weed and
									stubble fields, prairies, and especially in old abandoned fields which have grown
									up to oak and other shrubs. In the northern portion it occurs in damper
									localities, being found in the tall grasses and sedges along the borders of
									sloughs and marshes and in the meadows bordering lakes and tamarack <note

									<pb id="VAB8231-315" n="314"/> marshes. When flushed it rises quickly and with a
									fluttering noise, makes a long, wavering, jerky flight, and alights upon the bole
									or branch of tree or shrub, a fence, or some other object some distance above the
									earth; seldom, if ever, settling on the ground. If then approached, it dodges
									around the object upon which it rests, much as does a squirrel under the same
									circumstances.</p>
								<p>In Florida <hi rend="i">S. americana</hi> has been taken by me at all points
									where collecting has been done. About Dunedin, it is frequent throughout the
									winter, especially so in old fields, and on Hog Island it occurs among the coarse
									grasses, within 50 feet of the strand. When flushed in the pine woods it often
									alights on the boles of the trees eight to 20 feet above the ground. It has been
									recorded many times from all parts of the State, including the southern keys.
									Adults are to be found any month in the year, but nymphs are scarce in winter. It
									is often called the "clickety bug" by the southern negroes, a name given it on
									account of the rustling noise made by the wings in flight, which, however, is not
									a true stridulation.</p>
								<p>Of the distribution of the American locust <bibl>Scudder (1899c, 474)</bibl> has
									written: "Excepting <hi rend="i">S. peregrina</hi>, which has crossed the ocean
									and colonized another world, <hi rend="i">S. americana</hi> is the most widely
									distributed member of the genus, and merits its name, ranging as it does from
									North America east of the Great Plains and south of about latitude 40°; through
									the West Indies, Mexico and Central America to South America, where it occurs as
									far as Colombia in the west and Argentina in the east, though the records of its
									occurrence in South America are few. North of north latitude 40° or thereabouts,
									sporadic cases of its appearance are recorded, notably in Massachusetts and
									southern Ontario; these are doubtless accidental visitants, flying from their
									proper home farther south." Since Scudder's writing, it has been recorded from
									Connecticut by <bibl>Walden (1911, 108)</bibl>, and extreme northern Iowa by
										<bibl>Somes (1914, 68)</bibl>, so that taking its northern Indiana, Michigan and
									other records into consideration, it is liable to be found anywhere in our
									territory south of north latitude 45°.</p>

								<p>This species has been taken only in the western half of Indiana, from Knox Co.
									northward, though it doubtless occurs in suitable environments throughout the
									State. It is abundant about the marshy meadows and sloughs in Fulton, Lake and
									Starke counties, where it has been taken on August 15th in numbers. There it makes
									its home in the rank grasses, weeds and rushes which grow in such places. The
									males are everywhere much more abundant and more active than the females, though
									they usually fly a shorter distance. In Vigo County it is frequent in patches of
									raw, damp prairie and along the edges of thickets bordering them; also in many
									places along the railways, especially where they pass through prairie regions.
									Both sexes, when flushed, arise with a whirring noise which, however, is not a
									true stridulation. The males usually fly about 50 feet and settle down on the
									grass or on a low shrub.</p>

								<p>This seems to be a scarce locust in Indiana, having been taken only in Marshall,
									Cass, Porter and Crawford counties; July 20-Oct. 12. It prefers dry upland
									pastures and woodland, especially those with a soil of sand, where scrub oak
									abounds. Its habits of flight are the same as those of <hi rend="i">alutacea</hi>.
									Numerous specimens are at hand from New England, in addition to those from
									Indiana, and in all the fuscous spots of tegmina are plainly visible in both
									sexes, whereas they are wholly absent in all males of <hi rend="i">alutacea</hi>,
									and present but very faint on but two or three of the numerous females of that
									species.</p>
								<p>In Florida <hi rend="i">rubiginosa</hi> has been recorded from a number of places
									between Jacksonville and Key West, being the common form on the southern keys.
										<bibl>R. &amp; H. (1916, 197)</bibl> regard it as only a color phase of <hi
										rend="i">alutacea</hi>, stating that intermediate forms occur in New Jersey,
									South Carolina and Georgia. <bibl>Morse (1904, 39)</bibl> says of the two: "There
									is considerable variation in this species in color and markings in the direction
									of <hi rend="i">alutacea</hi>. Possibly hybrids occur, but typically these two
									species differ in color, structure and haunts." Later (1907, 44) he says: "It is
									very probable that some so-called species of <hi rend="i">Schistocerca</hi> are
									but forms of one which varies greatly in color and structure. In New England the
									two forms known as <hi rend="i">alutacea</hi> and <hi rend="i">rubiginosa</hi>
									seem to be constantly different structurally. Southward and westward the
									structural gap between the two seems to be bridged and both vary much in size,
									color, form and proportion of parts." I prefer to retain <note id="note_050"><ref

								<p>Ormond, Gainesville, Miakka and Dunedin, Fla., Oct. 11--Apr. 4 (<hi rend="i">W.
										S. B.</hi>). This large and handsome species is not known from Indiana and is
									apparently scarce in Florida in winter and spring, having been noted only on three
									or four occasions. About Dunedin it was first seen on Hog Island, where three or
									four individuals were noted on the foliage of the Florida button-bush, <hi
										rend="i">Conocarpus erecta</hi> L., just inside the fringe of black mangrove. On
									two other occasions a few individuals were flushed from high weeds and willows
									along the margins of a moist hammock. The flight of the male is prolonged and both
									sexes, when flushed, always alight on shrubs or trees some distance above the
									ground. A single female from Ormond is of the unstriped variety with the tegmina
									vaguely flecked with fuscous, thus resembling <hi rend="i">S. a. rubiginosa</hi>
									but much larger. <hi rend="i">S. obscure</hi> has been recorded from numerous

								<p>This, our smallest eastern species of <hi rend="i">Schistocerca</hi>, has been
									taken in Indiana only in Crawford and Harrison counties. A single female was
									secured May 10, 1899. This was probably a migrant, as that is a very early date
									for eggs hatched in spring to mature, and it is not known that the species winters
									so far north in either the adult or nymph stage. Other specimens were taken in
									June and July, 1902, and September, 1918. It frequents old fields and roadsides on
									the crests of the higher hills near Wyandotte, and is probably to be found in
									similar localities throughout the southern third of the State. When flushed the
									males fly long distances and usually alight on the limbs of trees or fence posts,
										<pb id="VAB8231-320" n="319"/> around which they dodge, and from which they may

									states that "it is especially common in the cotton fields of northern Georgia,
									where it prefers to rest upon the bare earth rather than upon vegetation, the
									almost uniformly reddish-brown color making it quite indistinguishable from the

								<p>Hastings, Fla., Aug. 27--Sept. 5. Scudder's types were from Jacksonville, and it
									has been recorded by R. &amp; H. and Morse from Pablo Beach, Gainesville, Cedar
									Keys, Live Oak, DeFuniak Springs, Lakeland and Pine Island, so that it probably
									occurs throughout the State. The Pine Island specimens were nymphs taken by
									Hebard, May 18--20; the other records of adults, Aug.--November.</p>
								<p><hi rend="i">G. pusillus</hi> is so far known only from Georgia and Florida, its
									northern stations being Jesup and Brunswick, Ga. <bibl>Morse (1904, 39)</bibl>
									recorded it as "locally abundant at Waycross, Ga., in the open, lower marshy
									portions of the pine barrens, inhabiting a matted growth made up of pipe-wort,
									sedge and juncus stems." <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1916, 207)</bibl> state that in
									southeastern Georgia and northeastern Florida it is "frequently exceedingly
									plentiful locally in the heavier undergrowth of the long-leaf pine forests,
									especially where the ground is low." Hebard says that "they are masters of the art
									of jumping. They can leap so quickly that the eye cannot follow them and can jump
									in any direction with such rapidity that it is impossible to see where they have
									gone. They jump from one tuft of wire grass to the top of another tuft, and there
									cling tightly to the highest straw, ready to make another leap." The species is
									one of the smallest and without doubt the most slender-bodied of all our eastern
									Acridians.</p>

								<p>This olive-green locust is not known from either Indiana or Florida, but is

									west to Nebraska and southeastern Colorado, and southwest through Kansas and
									Oklahoma to Fort Worth, Texas. In Illinois Hart found it moderately common in

									it is "abundant on the lance-leaved ragweed, <hi rend="i">Ambrosia
										bidentata</hi> Michx., on the dry soils of the Illinoisan glaciation across
									southern Illinois." He also records <hi rend="i">C. acutipennis</hi> Scudd. from

								<p><bibl>R. &amp; H. (1916, 207)</bibl> record the finding of one adult and numerous
									nymphs near Macon, Ga., on July 31. There they occurred in thick grasses and weeds
									along the edges of woods. They state that the young could be readily distinguished
									from other Locustid nymphs by their striking whitish antennæ annulate with dark
									brown, these colors greatly fading in the dried specimens.</p>

									locust is not known from either Indiana or Florida, but occurs in the coastwise
									states from Massachusetts southwest to Alabama. In New England it has so far been
									recorded only from Wellesley, Dover and Walpole, Mass. Of its occurrence there
										<bibl>Morse (1898, 272)</bibl> says: "This is one of our rarer locusts, and with
									its delicately contrasted tints of green and purple, is one of our daintiest and
									most attractively colored species. It is usually captured by sweeping vigorously
									the short tufted growth of beard-grass, <hi rend="i">Andropogon scoparius</hi>
									Michx., which, with other wild grasses and running blackberry vines, sparsely
									clothe the thin soil of the gravel plain formations on which it is found."</p>
								<p>In New Jersey it was first recorded as inhabiting cranberry bogs, but <bibl>Rehn
										(1909a)</bibl> considers its occurrence in these bogs as accidental, stating
									that individuals taken near Stafford's Forge, Aug. 12--Sept. 5, were found "only
									in a small area of huckleberry and sweet fern barrens on the edge of pine
									forests." <bibl>Fox (1914, 509)</bibl> mentions a number of stations where it has
									been taken in New Jersey, stating that it is almost entirely restricted to the
									Pine Barrens where it frequents low scrub and undergrowth. In Virginia, Georgia
									and Alabama it occurs very sparingly in mountainous or hilly regions. <bibl>R.
										&amp; H. (1916, 210)</bibl> state that their speimens "were taken in bunch grass
										<hi rend="i">Cyperus</hi>, particularly where this was plentiful on open slopes,
									and in the luxuriant mountain undergrowth of grasses, vines and oak sprouts, under
									a low forest predominant in black-jack oak."</p>

								<p>In Indiana this dainty and prettily colored species has been noted only in Lake
									County, where it has been taken in two localities. On September 19, 1898, a single
									pair were secured from the long grasses bordering the margin of a swale north of
									Millers. Though careful search was made there and elsewhere in the northern
									counties, no others were secured until July 24, 1902, when they were found to be
									rather common in a long, low, marshy tract, a mile southeast of Hammond. Here the
									males were especially active, leaping from one grass stem to another several times
									in succession, and dodging around the stem the instant they clasped it with their
									legs. The females were oftentimes easily picked up by the fingers. No attempt was
									made by either sex to use the wings in escaping.</p>

								<p>In Florida <hi rend="i">H. pratensis</hi> has been recorded only from Carrabelle,
									Fort Barrancas, Warrington and Live Oak in the northern third of the State.
										<bibl>Morse (1904, 16)</bibl> says that in this region it is not uncommon in
									August along the Gulf shore among the xerophytic strand vegetation; while at Live
									Oak it was found by R. &amp; H. among wire grass and other low plants in small
									clumps of dwarf oaks on the border of a sink.</p>
								<p>After a careful comparison of numerous examples of <hi rend="i">H. pratensis</hi>
									from Indiana, Iowa and Nebraska with those of typical <hi rend="i"
										>brevipennis</hi> from New England, I cannot agree with Morse and R. &amp; H.
									that it is only a long-winged form of the latter species. Aside from the
									difference in wing length, which may be, and probably is a variable character, the
									other structural and color differences pointed out in the key and description are
									constant in the <pb id="VAB8231-334" n="333"/> series at hand, and are undoubtedly
									of sufficient importance to retain it as a valid species, especially if characters
									of less importance are held sufficient to separate other species of the genus.</p>
								<p>The range of <hi rend="i">H. pratensis</hi> is a wide one, extending from Indiana
									and Florida, east of the Mississippi River, north and west to Minnesota,
									Washington and California, and southwest to Texas and Orizaba, Mexico. Hart
									records it from several localities in Illinois, principally from swales among the
									sand ridges of the northwestern portion. It is not recorded from Canada and
									appears to be scarce in Minnesota where, as in northwestern Indiana, it is found
									associated with <hi rend="i">Melanoplus angustipennis</hi> (Dodge.)</p>

								<p>Big Bayou, near Pensacola and Carrabelle, Fla., Aug. 28--Sept. 2 (<hi rend="i"
										>Hebard</hi>). The above are the salient points of the original description. The
									dried specimens at Philadelphia show only a faint trace of the dark bands on
									dorsal face of hind femora. The hind margin of metazona is obtusely angled as in
										<hi rend="i">pratensis</hi>, and the length of tegmina much as there. The size
									and color, are, however, more nearly those of <hi rend="i">brevipennis</hi>, the
									maximum length of <hi rend="i">gemmicula</hi> male, being the same as the minimum
									of male <hi rend="i">brevipennis</hi>, while the length of the females of the two
									species are approximately equal.</p>
								<p>I regard <hi rend="i">gemmicula</hi>, therefore, as only a small color variety of
										<hi rend=" i">pratensis</hi>, differing slightly in form of cerci and prosternal
									spine. <pb id="VAB8231-335" n="334"/> This opinion is the more enhanced by the
									fact that <hi rend="i">pratensis</hi> has been taken in the same region by Morse,
									who states (1907, 12) that "the Florida examples of <hi rend="i">H. pratensis</hi>
									present a distinctly different type of coloration--one seen in some California
									series of the species. They are also of small size like them but differ in having
									much longer tegmina and wings. <hi rend="i">H. pratensis</hi> as it stands to-day
									should be regarded as a variable and complex species represented in different
									parts of the country by several more or less distinct varieties." It is possible
									that a large series of all three forms will show that <hi rend="i">gemmicula</hi>
									is the real connecting link between <hi rend="i">brevipennis</hi> and <hi rend="i"
										>pratensis</hi>, and that all three are only variable extremes of one widely
									distributed species which will bear the name <hi rend="i">brevipennis</hi>.</p>
								<p>Hebard states that "the species is peculiar to very sandy areas; at Big Bayou it
									was found occasionally in a bushy low sand-loving plant, at Pensacola very scarce
									among the undergrowth of scant grasses and sand-loving plants in forest of
									long-leaf and small sand-pines. At Carrabelle very few were taken through the low
									bushes of the sand dune areas, which are covered heavily with arenicolous shrubs
									and bushes and some scrubby pine and oaks. Only with particular effort was it
									possible to secure the series. Heavy beating was found to be the most productive
									method."</p>

								<p>Ridgeway and New Lisbon, N. J., July 17--Aug. 10 (<hi rend="i">Davis</hi>);
									Manor, Texas, July 15 (<hi rend="i">Caudell</hi>). East of the Mississippi this
									oak-inhabiting locust has been recorded only from Illinois, New Jersey and New
									York. The Illinois record by <bibl>Bruner (1893, 15)</bibl> is substantiated by
									specimens in the Urbana collection from Crete and Dubois. <bibl>Davis
										(1912)</bibl> has given an account of its occurrence about Ridgeway and
									Lakehurst, N. J., in 1910 and 1911, when they defoliated the oaks over large
									areas. He states that "the gayly colored grasshoppers were more common on the
									white oaks, though they ate the foliage of scarlet oaks and other members of the
									red oak group; as many as 40 of the insects were counted on the trunks of some
									trees, usually slowly making their way up to what remained of the foliage while
									the excrement of the grasshoppers already on the limbs fell with a rain-like
									patter onto the dry leaves beneath. Some of the grasshoppers were fully winged and
									others were apterous. In addition to the oaks we noted where they had devoured
									parts of the leaves of a sumach, <hi rend="i">Rhus copallina</hi> L." In 1912 not
									a trace of the locusts could be found about Lakehurst, but in 1914 a single pair
									were taken, and the same year a new outbreak was recorded by <bibl>Caudell
										(1915a)</bibl> as occurring near New Lisbon, N. J., about 17 miles from
									Lakehurst. Here the locust infested an area of approximately two square miles,
									some of the tallest oaks being nearly defoliated. No later record of their
									presence in New Jersey can be found. In 1912 a single male was taken at Yaphank,
									Long Island, N. Y., this being the only record from that State <bibl>(<hi rend="i"
											>Davis</hi>, 1915b)</bibl>. The locust was first probably accidentally
									introduced near Ridgeway, N. J., and for a year or two only found conditions
									favorable for a rapid increase, then was kept in check by natural causes until
									1914, when the second outbreak occurred at New Lisbon. The name <hi rend="i">D.
										longipennis</hi>
									<bibl>Riley (1893, 255)</bibl> is a synonym of <hi rend="i">D. quercus</hi>,
									having been given to the long-winged form.</p>

								<p>West of the Mississippi <hi rend="i">D. quercus</hi> ranges from Missouri,
									southern Iowa and southeastern Nebraska southwest to Washington and Travis
									counties, Texas. It was from these Texas localities that <bibl>Bruner (1887,
										17)</bibl> secured his specimens, all nymphs, and therefore not given a
									scientific name by him, he designating them only as the "Post Oak Locust of
									Washington Co., Texas." As noted above, Packard copied Bruner's article verbatim
									under the name "<hi rend="i">Dendrotettix quercus</hi> Riley Ms.," that name
									having been given the nymphs by Riley but unaccompanied by a description. Of the
									habits of the locust in Texas Bruner wrote: <q rend="blockquote">
										<p>"The egg pods are deposited in the ground about the bases of trees or
											indifferently scattered about the surface among the decaying leaves, etc.,
											like those of all other ground-laying species. The young commence hatching
											about the middle of March, and continue to appear until into April. After
											moulting the first time and becoming a little hardened, they immediately climb
											up the trunks of the trees and bushes of all kinds and commence feeding upon
											the new and tender foliage. The imago or mature stage is reached by the last
											of May or during the first part of June.</p>

								<p>The above, the first description of the male, is drawn from an unique taken by
									Davis, July 2, 1919, along the Catamount Trail, at an elevation of about 2,500
									feet, near White Sulphur Springs, W. Va. The female described is in the U. S.
									National Museum collection and was taken by Fox, at a height of 4,000 feet on
									Sounding Knob, near Monterey, Va. It was found "on stony ground in the shrubby
									undergrowth of low open woods on the mountain side." Morse's unique type was a
									female taken on Cheawha Mountain, Ala., July 13, at a height of 2,300 feet, while
									sweeping grass and shrubbery in the vicinity of Pulpit Rock, near the extreme
									summit of the mountain. The three specimens mentioned and two males in the
									Philadelphia collections, taken by R. &amp; H. near Bald Knob, Bath Co., Va., are
									all the individuals known of this handsome tree locust. It appears to be a
									subalpine, forest-loving species, ranging from Virginia to Alabama. Morse first
									described it (loc. cit.) as <hi rend="i">Podisma scudderi</hi>, then
										<bibl>(Psyche, 1907, 57)</bibl> changed the name to <hi rend="i">P.

									"More than 35 years ago, as I used to climb the footpath to Mt. Washington from
									the Peabody Valley, one of the first creatures to meet my eye as I emerged above

									on or among the various species of <hi rend="i">Vaccinium</hi> characteristic of
									the mountain tops and on Mt. Ascutney among dwarf cornel. It is a somewhat

								<p>DeGrassi Point and Guilford, Ont., Sept. 9--Oct. 21 (<hi rend="i">Walker</hi>).
									Scudder's types were from Ithaca and Enfield Falls, N. Y., and the known range of
									the species extends from the Ontario stations mentioned south to the mountains of
									North Carolina, near Balsam and Pineola, where specimens were taken by Morse who
									says (1904, 41): "This locust seems to be rather widely distributed in the higher
									parts of the North Carolina mountains, inhabiting shrubby undergrowth and thickets
									of weeds and bushes throughout the mountains. It is a sluggish and secretive
									species, and but few examples were observed at any one point." At DeGrassi Point
									Walker found them in swampy ground, where the vegetation was of a boreal
									character. In such places they were found on bushes and the branches and trunks of
									the Arbor-vitae, sometimes eight or ten feet above the ground. <bibl>Rehn (1900,
										631)</bibl> says that in Pennsylvania they usually occur on the branches of
									hemlock, and wherever taken have been in the vicinity of that tree. <bibl>Vestal
										(1914, 107)</bibl> has recorded it from near Douglas Lake, Mich., from specimens
									identified by Caudell.</p>
								<p>Scudder in his key to the species of <hi rend="i">Podisma</hi> (1897, 97) used
									the form of the cerci and the color of hind femora as the principal characters in
									separating this species from <hi rend="i">glacialis</hi>. <bibl>Walker (1903,
										298)</bibl> has endeavored to show that his race <hi rend="i">canadensis</hi> is
									a connecting link between <hi rend="i">glacialis</hi> and <hi rend="i"
										>variegata</hi>, and has used the slight variation in form of cerci and color of
									hind femora in <hi rend="i">canadensis</hi>as his principal evidence. Admitting
									that in <hi rend="i">canadensis</hi> the cerci are more slender, the upper face of
									hind femora faintly barred and the antennæ slightly longer than in typical <hi
										rend="i">glacialis</hi>; the much greater length of antennæ, different general
									hue, strongly fasciate hind femora, squarely truncate front and hind margins of
									pronotum, longer hind femora of male and distinctly more slender cerci in both
									sexes of <hi rend="i">variegata</hi> present a combination of characters which,
									taken in connection with its range and habitat, lead me to regard it as more than
									an "incipient species" or race of <hi rend="i">glacialis</hi>, and I have
									therefore retained it as Scudder placed it--as a distinct and valid species.</p>

								<p>Ormond, Sanford, Hastings, Lakeland and Dunedin, Fla., August--March (<hi

									identified species were taken at Ormond, March 7, 1899, and were noted (1902, 34)
									as follows: "On a patch of green weeds in an old orange orchard I found a pair of
									wingless, bright green locusts, the tegmina being represented only by narrow,
									oblong, whitish-yellow scales. They leap clumsily when disturbed. On a dead clump
									of grass in a neighboring field I took a brown female of the same species, so that
									it, like many other Acridians, seeks a place of hiding with which it agrees in
									color. There, as long as motionless, it is quite secure from the eyes of those
									birds and reptiles which are ever on the search for a juicy locust." About Dunedin
										<hi rend="i">A. sphenarioides</hi> is frequent in both nymph and adult stages
									throughout the fall and winter months, occurring especially on wire-grass, dwarf
									huckleberry bushes and other low vegetation along the pathways, roadways, ditches
									and streams of open pine woods. It occurs on Hog Island, where the males are
									intermediate between the typical form and the race <hi rend="i">clara</hi>. When
									flushed the males are much the more active, often leaping several feet and
									alighting on some supporting stem or shrub, a foot or more above the ground, where
									they can watch to better advantage the approaching intruder, while the heavier
									bodied females usually attempt to burrow after a short leap or two. Scudder's
									types were from Ft. Reed and Jacksonville, and it has been recorded many times

								<p>In Indiana this graceful-bodied species was first found in small numbers on July
									27, about the grassy margins of a pond in the sand dune region north of Millers,
									Lake County, and within one-half a mile of the shore of Lake Michigan. On the
									following day a single pair were taken from a similar locality near Tolleston, in
									the same county, and about four miles from the lake, <pb id="VAB8231-353" n="352"
									/> but still within the sand covered area. It was usually found clinging to the
									stems of the tall rushes and grasses common in such locations, and when disturbed
									the males used the wings in a noiseless flight, while the females depended upon
									their leaping powers to escape. When closely followed, they would attempt to hide
									by burrowing in the fallen grass. A single male was afterward taken from low
									ground along a railway southeast of Hammond, and on August 20th it was found in
									numbers in the tall grasses along a lobe of Bass Lake, Starke County.</p>
								<p>Some of the first specimens taken were sent to Scudder who, basing his opinion
									largely on the form of the furcula, stated that they represented an undescribed
									species allied to <hi rend="i">atlantica</hi>, but of smaller size and with longer
									cerci. Not having specimens of <hi rend="i">atlantica</hi> at hand for comparison,
									I described them (1898, 59) as <hi rend="i">Paroxya scudderi</hi>. <bibl>R. &amp;
										H. (1916, 249)</bibl> have shown that the Indiana specimens represent only a
									smaller incipient northern race of <hi rend="i">atlantica</hi>. With a large
									series of Florida <hi rend="i">atlantica</hi> for comparison, I agree with their
									opinion, though a number of characters other than the shape of furcula separate
									the northern and southern forms; the hind margin of metazona being less produced
									and more broadly angulate and the valves of ovipositor having longer, more slender
									points in the Indiana than in Florida specimens.</p>
								<p>In Florida I have found <hi rend="i">P. atlantica</hi> to be a common locust
									between Nov.1 and April 15, it having been collected by me at all stations except
									Cape Sable and Key West. It occurs for the most part among grasses and sedges
									along the borders of inland lakes, ponds and streams and the bays and lagoons of
									the coast. On Hog Island, opposite Dunedin, several females have been taken having
									the face, disk and lower sides of pronotum and upper and lower faces of hind
									femora a bright purplish-red. Elsewhere in Florida it has been recorded from many
									places by other collectors, and doubtless occurs in numbers in both adult and
									nymph stages in all parts of the State throughout the year.</p>
								<p>The known range of <hi rend="i">P. atlantica</hi> is mainly confined to the
									Atlantic coastwise states, extending from Jamesburg and Lakehurst, N. J., south
									and west at least as far as the southern extremity of Florida, Mobile, Ala., and
									Biloxi and Gulfport, Miss. Inland it is known only from Northern Indiana and
									Illinois. <bibl>Morse (1907, 53)</bibl> says it is "common in the piney woods of
									the Gulf Strip of the Coastal Plain, especially in grassy places among the
									inkberry shrubbery, <hi rend="i">Ilex glabra</hi> L., and also in swampy spots and
									sometimes in the salt marshes." In New Jersey <bibl>Fox (1914)</bibl> says it is
									"a characteristic species of the sphagnum bogs, <pb id="VAB8231-354" n="353"/>
									frequenting especially the areas of chain-fern, <hi rend="i">Woodwardia

										>Spartina</hi>) growing in the tide-water ditches of salt meadows and in the
									long sedge of bushy inland meadows and swamps. While active and alert it is

									out of sight behind the stouter stems of grass and weeds rather than by flight, to
									which it resorts only when alarmed. It leaps well and quickly but its flight is
									comparatively short." He has described (1893a) a melanistic form from near

								<p>This handsome locust was first noted in Indiana about the margins of the "Goose
									Pond," Vigo Co., on October 11, 1891. It at once attracted attention on account of
									the length of the male antennæ, and the black stripes on the sides of the abdomen
									of the female. The pond was then almost dry, and the dense growth of sedges and
									rushes which had filled its shallow margins, were, in some places, burned away.
									Over the burned spots had sprung up a dense green vegetation, and here this <hi
										rend="i">Paroxya</hi> flourished in company with <hi rend="i">Truxalis
										brevicornis</hi> and <hi rend="i">Dichromorpha viridis</hi>, while a few feet
									away <hi rend="i">Leptysma marginicollis</hi> found a suitable home among the
									rushes and sedges still standing. Both sexes of <hi rend="i">P. hoosieri</hi> were
									very active, leaping vigorously when approached, and difficult to capture except
									by throwing the net over them as they rested on the ground. On October 27th, the
									spot was again visited, and, although several heavy frosts had occurred, the
									species was still fairly common. At this time, however, they were all found in the
									small patches of grass which grew among the fallen leaves a few yards from the
									edges of the pond proper.</p>
								<p>Since then the locust has been found to be rather common in the western and
									northern portions of the State, where it occurs about the borders of marshes,
									especially those bordering lakes and tamarack bogs. In Gibson Co. it was found
									mature on July <pb id="VAB8231-357" n="356"/> 10. Outside of Indiana <hi rend="i"
										>P. hoosieri</hi> has been recorded only from near Oberlin, Ohio, where Dr.
									Lynds Jones found it "in abundance in the rank vegetation which sprang up in a dry
									swamp surrounded by woods," and from Milneburg, La., where <bibl>Morse (1907,
										54)</bibl> captured a male at the edge of a swamp, which measured 26 mm. in
									length of body, its antennæ being 17 and tegmina 12 mm. in length.</p>
								<p>On one occasion I found a female of this species and also one of <hi rend="i"
										>Chlacaltis conspersa</hi> Harr., a few inches apart on, the stump of a downy
									poplar, <hi rend="i">Populus heterophylla</hi> L., each with the abdomen buried to
									the full length in the soft wood, but no eggs could be discovered. Nothing has
									been recorded concerning the habits of oviposition of the members of the genus <hi
										rend="i">Paroxya</hi>, and it would be surprising if they, like the <hi rend="i"
										>Chlœaltis</hi> mentioned, should seek wood rather than earth as the receptive
									matrix for the eggs.</p>
								<p><hi rend="i">P. hoosieri</hi> is closely related to <hi rend="i">P.
										clavuliger</hi> (Serv.), so close indeed, that after describing it I recorded it
									(1894, 244) as a short-winged form of <hi rend="i">P. atlantica</hi>, specimens of
										<hi rend="i">clavuliger</hi> having been sent me under the name of <hi rend="i"
										>atlantica</hi> by Morse and Scudder. The differences in the abdominal
									appendages of male as set forth in key and description appear, however, to be
									constant, and it is therefore here retained as a northern or inland race of <hi

								<p>Only the short-winged form of this dull colored locust has been taken in Indiana,
									and those only in Lake and Porter counties on October 11 and 12. Just east of
									Hammond, they were found in a long, low, marshy tract among the leaves of blue
									flag. The next day they were more abundant about some marshes northwest of Dune
									Park. The males were strong and active leapers, oftentimes giving several great
									jumps to a tuft of bunch grass or weeds and gliding down it to the ground, where
									they squatted close until picked up with the fingers. The females were more
									sluggish and several were taken from between the stems of grass where they were
									standing on their heads, after endeavoring to escape by diving downward.</p>
								<p>With the exception of a single Massachusetts record, Porter Co., Ind., is the
									most eastern point from which the species has been recorded, its range extending
									thence west and north to Ft. McLeod, B. C., Montana and Wyoming, and south and
									southwest through Texas and Arizona to Cordoba, Mexico.</p>

									being the only ones outside of <pb id="VAB8231-359" n="358"/> Indiana east of the

									The young are often largely dull ivory white in color and present a very singular
									appearance with their absurdly large heads." <bibl>Somes (1914, 96)</bibl> records

										<p>"It appears at first glance very much like some of the brachypterous forms of
												<hi rend="i">Melanoplus</hi>, but the compressed body and large head seem to
											separate it, even in the field. We first took it in Iowa by sweeping tall
											grasses in an upland meadow; a more careful examination resulted in the
											discovery of numerous specimens crouching among the stems and dead leaves at
											the bases of the plants. In Minnesota we have taken it in low marshes, along

								<p>This genus comprises more species than does any other of the North American
									Orthoptera, no less than 146 having been listed by <bibl>Scudder (1900)</bibl>
									from the United States and Canada, and treated by him in his "Revision of the
									Melanopli" and its supplement. Of the distribution of the species he says (1897,
									123) : "The genus Melanoplus, so richly endowed with species, is naturally very
									widely distributed, though so far as known it is completely confined to the
									continent of North America and does not occur, so far as reported, south of
									Mexico. Within this region it is as wide spread as all the other genera of
									Melanopli combined, extending from the Arctic Circle in Alaska and on the
									Mackenzie River, and from northern Labrador and perhaps southern Greenland on the
									north to the extremity of Florida and southern Mexico on the south, and from the
									Atlantic to the Pacific. It is, however, far richer in species in the west than in
									the east." Since 1900 numerous species have been described, and <bibl>Kirby (1910,
										509)</bibl> listed 202 species of the genus from North America, including
									Mexico. From the territory covered by the present work 51 species and 10 varieties
									are recognized. Some of these, to the casual observer, may seem very similar in
									size, color and general appearance, but a close examination of the abdominal
									appendages of the male will at once prove their distinctness. The tyro will
									probably have much difficulty in separating the females of the different species;
									in fact, he can only do so by taking the two sexes in the field, where they are
									usually to be found associated together.</p>
								<p>While dull colored and uninteresting to most people, the members of this genus
									form the most characteristic group of our Acrididæ. To it belong our most common
									locusts and the ones which do the most injury. From mid-May until late November in
									the latitude of Indiana they leap from our pathway in numbers, whether we stroll
									through open woodland, sunny meadow, or along the roadside; while in the back
									yards and on the lawns of our city homes they swarm in great profusion.</p>
								<p>The Kansas or Rocky Mountain locust, <hi rend="i">Melanoplus spretis</hi> (Thos.)
									belongs to this genus but does not occur east of the <pb id="VAB8231-361" n="360"
									/> Mississippi (Fig. 124). Contrary to the general belief, it is not a large,
									robust species, being but little larger than our common eastern <hi rend="i">M.
										atlanis</hi> (Riley), and bearing to the latter a close general resemblance; so
									close, in fact, that only specialists can readily tell them apart. Millions of
									dollars of damage was done in the Western States by these small insects in the
									summers of 1873 and 1875. Migrating in vast clouds from one part of the country to
									another they would fall upon a cornfield and convert, in a few hours, the green
									and promising acres into a desolate stretch of bare, spindling stalks and stubs.
									In the words of the prophet Joel: "The land was as the garden of Eden before them,
									and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing did escape them."</p>

								<p>On account of the great number of eastern species they are, for convenience of
									treatment, first separated into two Divisions, and each of these is then farther
									divided into smaller groups or Series. The name given to each series in this work
									is that of the first described eastern species of the series, and in general,
									especially in Division I, the series bear but little if any relation to those of
									Scudder in his "Revision." The keys to series are based largely on the males, the
									females being so similar in color and structure that satisfactory characters for
									their inclusion could not be found.</p>

									<p>The short-winged forms of <hi rend="i">Melanoplus</hi> inhabit more commonly
										thickets, woodlands and sides of wooded ravines, gulches and mountain slopes
										rather than open fields and prairies. They seldom wander far from their original
										hatching place and are therefore more local in distribution and more secretive
										in habits than their long-winged congeners. The latter are considered the more
										primitive, the short-winged ones having gradually evolved from them by becoming
										adapted to a life where sustained flight is difficult or impossible. Hence along
										the wooded mountain slopes of <pb id="VAB8231-362" n="361"/> New England and the
										southern States the short-winged forms are much the more numerous. Where a
										species is dimorphic in wing-length, the long-winged individuals appear to be
										more numerous toward the northern part of its range and the brachypterous toward
										the southern. This is probably due, in part at least, to the length of the
										season and the consequent food supply, the short northern summers necessitating
										a mobility not possessed by the brachypterous forms.</p>
									<p>As already noted, the form of supra-anal and subgenital plates and that of the
										cerci and furcula in <hi rend="i">Melanoplus</hi> are exceedingly variable, even
										in the same species, and the number of described nominal species and races,
										based mainly upon the variations of these abdominal organs, is entirely too
										great. The eastern species of this Division are grouped into seven Series as

										<p>In Indiana this is one of the more common of the short-winged members of <hi
												rend="i">Melanoplus</hi>. It probably occurs throughout the State, but has
											not been noted in the counties south of Monroe and Knox. It frequents rather
											low, wooded bluegrass pastures and is especially fond of resting and mating
											upon the foliage of the iron weeds (<hi rend="i">Vernonia</hi>) which grow
											abundantly in such places. Spots along the roads and pathways through such
											woods, where the ground ivy carpets the earth and the great ragweed and
											jewel-weed grow luxuriantly, are also very attractive to this graceful bodied
											locust. It is also partial to the tall grasses growing in ravines and along
											the borders of sloughs and marshes. In central Indiana the males begin to
											reach maturity by June 15th, the females about a week later. By July 5th they
											are mating in numbers. They have also been noted mating as late as November
											10th, and it may be possible that in favorable seasons, a second brood
											matures. Like most other wingless species, they are active leapers, the males,
											especially, being noted for their somersaults while endeavoring to escape
											capture.</p>

										<p>The furcula of the males of <hi rend="i">gracilis</hi> vary much in size and

										<p>The known range of this easily distinguished little locust extends from
											central Ohio (<hi rend="i">Mead</hi>), Jackson Co., Mich. (<hi rend="i"

											in the central part of the State; Allen as "abundant in grassy groves in
											Iowa," and <bibl>Somes (1914, 79)</bibl> as uncommon in Minnesota, stating
											that there: "It prefers thickets of elder undergrown with blackberry. From one
											such spot I took twelve of these pretty little insects in less than half an
											hour." At Magazine Mountain, Ark., <bibl>Morse (1907, 48)</bibl> found it in

										<p>In Indiana this handsome short-winged form is the first locust to reach
											maturity from eggs hatched in spring, a mature male having been taken in Vigo
											County on May 11th, and a number of both sexes in Posey County on May 12th. By
											June 1st it is common locally, and by August 1st has mostly disappeared. It
											frequents rather low, flat woods and clearings, being found about the margins
											of burned or bare places.</p>
										<p>On June 3, 1900, I happened upon a large colony of <hi rend="i"
												>viridipes</hi> in an upland woods in Marion Co. They were in an open,
											rather bare tract near the center of the woods, which was surrounded by beech
											and black maple trees. I took with the fingers, 40 of them in 20 minutes, and
											could have secured as many more. The males, when first disturbed, would leap
											two or three feet, almost perpendicularly, for several times in rapid
											succession, then give one or two sidewise leaps, and if still pursued,
											endeavor to hide the head beneath a dead leaf. The females were more clumsy
											and after giving one or two short leaps would squat close to the ground, when
											they were readily taken. One pair were mating and a number were yet in the
											nymph stage. On June 1, 1902, I found the species abundant in the same place,
											and again on June 5, 1904. In Lake Co. it was taken in a similar woods on the
											west side of Cedar Lake. It probably occurs in suitable localities over the
											greater portion of the State.</p>
										<figure>
											<p>Fig. 126. Male. X 1.3. (Original.)</p>
										</figure>
										<p>East of Indiana typical <hi rend="i">viridipes</hi> has been recorded
											definitely only from Vermont, Massachusetts and Ohio. In western New England
											it is very scarce, occurring among low shrubby dry upland thickets. In Ohio
											Mead reported it as fairly common in Franklin and Highland counties, and
											Hubbell (Ms.) reports it from Washtenaw Co., Mich. Farther west the species is
											known only from central and northwestern Illinois, where McNeill says that "it
											shows a decided preference for open grassy ravines," and from Nebraska, where
											Bruner reports it as "found only occasionally in woods along the Missouri
											River." It is probably a much more abundant species than the records show, its
											early appearance and sylvan habitat preventing it from being better known.</p>
										<p>As noted in the description, the cerci of the male <hi rend="i"
												>viridipes</hi> vary greatly in shape, not only in breadth but also in the
											degree of the concavity of the dorsal margin, and therefore in the apparent
											width of the apical expansion. Specimens are often taken in which they are
											much stouter than there described, being less than twice as long as wide at
											base, with both margins almost parallel <pb id="VAB8231-368" n="367"/> from
											basal third to near apex, the apical third being more than half the width of
											base. Between this form and the typical one, there is one with the dorsal
											margin strongly concave at middle, the apical third therefore apparently
											broadened with apex obliquely excised. This was described by <bibl>Morse
												(1904a, 9)</bibl> as <hi rend="i">M. deceptus</hi> (Fig. 127, <hi rend="i"
												>f</hi>). Another form with cerci very similar to the typical one but with
											dorsal margin more concave and tip transversely excised or subtruncate, he
											described <bibl>(loc. cit.)</bibl> as <hi rend="i">M. similis</hi> (Fig. 127,
												<hi rend="i">g</hi>). I regard both these nominal species as, at the most,
											only names for forms of male <hi rend="i">viridipes</hi> having the cerci
											extremely modified as described, the females being absolutely inseparable from
											those of <hi rend="i">viridipes</hi>. His <hi rend="i">deceptus</hi> was based
											upon specimens from Balsam, N. Car., Jasper Ga., and Vigo Co., Ind., the Vigo
											Co. male cotypes being collected by myself, with a colony of typical <hi
												rend="i">viridipes</hi>, one of them having been used by Scudder as a cotype
											of that species. Aside from the localities above given the form <hi rend="i"
												>deceptus</hi> has been recorded by R. &amp; H. from Black Mountain, N.
											Car., Clayton, Ga.,. and Tennessee. Morse's southern speciimens were taken at
											heights of 2,600 to 6,100 feet, and he mentions it as inhabiting "deciduous
											forests at high elevations."</p>
										<p><hi rend="i">M. similis</hi> was described by Morse from three male specimens
											taken July 25 at Murphy, Cherokee Co., N. Car., in dry upland forests of pine
											and oak. It has since been recorded by R. &amp; H. from near Bluemont, Va.,
											and several points in Rabun Co., Ga., and by Kostir from Vinton, Ohio,</p>
										<p>Including as synonyms <hi rend="i">deceptus</hi> and <hi rend="i"
												>similis</hi>, the known range of <hi rend="i">viridipes</hi> is thus
											extended from New England southwest to Rabun Co., Ga. A pair of the Georgia
											specimens labelled <hi rend="i">similis</hi>, kindly loaned me by Davis, were
											found to be typical <hi rend="i">viridipes</hi>, the cerci having the tips
											rounded on dorsal side, not transversely excised. In the opinion of <bibl>R.
												&amp; H. (1916, 212)</bibl> the <hi rend="i">M. juvencus</hi>
											<bibl>Scudd. (1897b, 14)</bibl> was based upon a specimen of <hi rend="i"
												>viridipes</hi> placed by accident with his series of <hi rend="i">M.
												puer</hi>, the locality, Ft. Reed, Fla., being derived from one of the

										<p>Known only from South Carolina and Georgia. Morse's unique male type was
											taken August 14 near Savannah, Ga., from a "tangled growth of grass, sedge,
											weeds, etc., on swampy ground." R. &amp; H. found it in numbers at Yemassee,
											S. Car., and Sandfly, Ga., Sept. 3 and 4. They state (1916, 216) that it is
											the most brilliantly colored species of the group, ranging from lemon chrome
											suffused with greenish or orange, to army-brown showing a yellowish suffusion.
											The brighter colored individuals were "taken on green plants, the duller ones
											among the yellowish and brown fronds of the brackens. The males were active
											but not alert, and were easy to capture, the females much less active and
											usually met with in the heavier undergrowth where much greater concealment was
											afforded." The species was found at Yemassee among low swamp-loving plants in
											wet ground through the short-leaf pine woods; while at Sandfly and Isle of
											Hope, Ga., it occurred in tall rank succulent undergrowth such as patches of
											yellow and brown bracken ferns in swampy gray-bark pine woods.</p>

										<p>This olive-brown, short-winged locust probably occurs throughout the southern
											two-thirds of Indiana, but has not been taken <pb id="VAB8231-376" n="375"/>
											north of Tippecanoe Co. In central Indiana it reaches maturity about September
											1, and frequents, for the most part, high, dry, open woods, especially those
											in which beech and oak trees predominate. On the tops of the hills, in the
											coal district of Vigo Co., and on the wooded slopes of the Knobs of southern
											Indiana, where the soil is a clay, and the herbaceous vegetation somewhat
											limited, it is, in mid-autumn, the prevailing, and often only, representative
											of the family. While mostly xerophytic in habitat, in late October, if the
											season is dry, it is often found in company with <hi rend="i">Dichromorpha
												viridis</hi> and <hi rend="i">Truxalis brevicornis</hi> among the reeds and
											tall rank grasses near the border of marshes, and as late as November 22, has
											been noted enjoying the afternoon sunshine from a perch on the bottom plank or
											rail of a fence. About Lafayette <bibl>Fox (1915, 26)</bibl> found it only in
											the herbaceous thickets surrounding marshes or damp spots. The females are
											always much more numerous than the males, the ratio being about five to one.
											Their larger, robust form renders them more clumsy and hence more easily
											caught by the hand, the males being active leapers and requiring quick
											movement on the part of the collector to effect their capture. Like the other
											short-winged sylvan species, <hi rend="i">obovatipennis</hi> often appears in
											colonies, a score or more being sometimes noted within an area of a few square
											rods and then no others seen for a long distance.</p>

												(1897, 265)</bibl> records it from High Bridge and Mammoth Cave, Ky., St.
											Louis, Mo., and Dallas, Texas. Fox (Ms.) reports it as occurring near
											Clarksville, Tenn. <bibl>McNeill (1899a, 369)</bibl> states that it is a

												mancus</hi> Smith from Running Lake, Ill. <bibl>Hart (1906, 81)</bibl>
											states that it occurs on "'high wooded hillsides throughout Illinois."
												<bibl>Morse (1907, 50)</bibl> mentions it as "a very common species in
											xerophytic upland forests in Arkansas and probably much of the territory of
											the adjoining States," and records it from numerous stations in Arkansas and
											from Howe and South McAlester, Okla. These are the only definite records which
											have been found of its occurrence.</p>

										<p>This small brown locust was originally described from numerous specimens
											taken in Crawford and Lawrence counties, Ind., between June 24 and July 15,
											and has not since been noted in the State. Near Wyandotte, Crawford Co., it
											occurred only along roadsides and in bare limestone glades on the crests and
											upper slopes of the high wooded hills. In Lawrence County it was found to be
											rather common in mid-July among the underbrush of high wooded slopes on the
											State University farm, three miles southeast of Mitchell. Here the soil was
											very sparsely vegetated, sedges and wild asters being the prevailing herbs.
											The ground was covered with the dead leaves of the last season, with whose
											colors the hues of the locusts so blended that they were invisible while
											motionless. The males leap briskly when approached, but only for a short
											distance. The heavier bodied females are more clumsy, and are easily caught
											with the hand.</p>

										<p>In color and general appearance this locust bears a close resemblance to <hi

												>morsei</hi> is easily distinguished by its less prominent head, larger
											eyes, narrower interocular space, more feebly sulcate frontal costa, longer
											antennæ of male, more coarsely punctate metazona, broader tegmina of female
											and especially by the form of the male cerci and furcula. It reaches maturity
											some time in June, while adults of <hi rend="i">obovatipennis</hi> have not
											been noted till the last days of August.</p>
										<p>The general range of <hi rend="i">morsei</hi> is probably southern, the only
											records outside of Indiana being from Hocking Co., Ohio (<hi rend="i"
												>Kostir</hi>), and Hattiesburg, Miss. At the latter place Morse mentions
											(1907, 50) the finding of a pair in woodland on sandy river-bottom land in
											company with <hi rend="i">M. viola</hi>. These he states were very large, the
											male measuring 22, the female 28 mm. in length of body. The locust should be

											place. The species varies much in size and color, some males at hand from
											Sarasota being but 10 mm. in length, while R. &amp; H. record a series from
											Miami (1912) ranging from 13.5--17 and females 19--22.5 mm. in length. About
											Dunedin <hi rend="i">puer</hi> is the only short-winged <hi rend="i"
												>Melanoplus</hi> so far taken and occurs sparingly in both nymph and adult
											stages throughout the winter, mating from mid-January to April. It is found
											for the most part in small colonies in the wire-grass about moist places and
											along pathways in open pine woods, while in early spring it is often taken by
											sweeping huckleberry and other low shrubs. The males are rather slow to flush
											but very active after being once frightened. The living females are often a
											handsome purplish-gray in general hue and are much more sluggish in their
											movements. Several of the Dunedin males have the black postocular stripe very
											shining, extending back the full length of pronotum and half or more the

												>Vaccinium</hi> on the bare upper portions of the mountain. It is quite
											alert and agile, when approached springing suddenly and to a considerable

											late July or early August as it has been taken on the mountains from August 14
											to September 6." The Running Lake, Illinois, record of <bibl>McNeill

										<p>LaSalle Island, Mich.; Steuben Co., Ind., August 11--19 (<hi rend="i">W. S.

											this species were taken by me on LaSalle Island, Aug. 17, 1897. They were
											found about the borders of a small clearing and along a narrow pathway through
											the dense spruce, birch and hemlock woods. When approached they would leap
											from the pathway into the mosses and liverworts bordering its sides, and there
											remain quiet while the intruder passed by. None were found at a distance of
											more than ten feet from this pathway, though especial search was made for
											them. On several subsequent visits to this and adjacent islands they were
											found fairly plentiful in similar habitats. Other locusts taken with them were
												<hi rend="i">Circotettix verruculatus</hi> (Kirby), <hi rend="i">Melanoplus
												dodgei huroni</hi> Bl., and <hi rend="i">Camnula pellucida</hi> Scudd. A

											locusts, frequenting the borders of open woods, fence rows and roadsides,
											especially in dry situations where blue-grass abounds. On warm sunny
											afternoons in November, it may often be seen resting quietly on the sides of
											logs, or the lower part of rail or board fences, and apparently enjoying the
											sunshine. In the center of the city of Indianapolis I have often noted it
											along the edges of walks, though it is less common on the lawns than its

										<p>This locust was taken by R. &amp; H. in some numbers Sept. 5, 6, at

											the male cerci and furcula were both variable in form and development, the
											slender apical portion of cerci in some individuals being much shorter than in
											others, while the furcula occasionally had very short projections from the
											swollen bases, thus approaching those of <hi rend="i">carnegiei</hi>. I

										<p>The above includes all the essential parts of the original description. The
											locust was taken by R. &amp; H. at Woodville, Carrabelle and Ocala, Fla.,
											Sept. 1--19. Of its habits <bibl>Hebard (1918, 158)</bibl> says: "The species
											was found common in sandy long-leaf pine, <hi rend="i">Pinus palustris</hi>
											Mill, flatwoods among dwarf oak and oak shoots at Woodville; very few in scrub
											oak and oak shoots on flat <pb id="VAB8231-399" n="398"/> sandy soil at
											Carrabelle, and few in oak clumps at from two to five feet from the ground at
											Ocala, in an environment very similar to that at Woodville. The species, like
												<hi rend="i">davisi</hi>, is thamnophilus, not rapid in movement, but
											extremely powerful in leaping and unusually able in hiding in the oak
											undergrowth to which it is peculiar."</p>
										<p>An examination of the type series of both <hi rend="i">davisi</hi> and <hi
												rend="i">quercicola</hi> showed that the entire general facies of the two is
											the same; the color varying only in the slightly greater width of the dark
											pronotal stripe in the female of <hi rend="i">davisi</hi>. The definition
											between the dorsal and lateral fields of tegmina in that species is very
											slight and evident only in the females. The only difference of any note
											between the two is, therefore, that of the form of the male cerci as described
											in key, and this also is not greater than that shown among races of other
											species of short-winged <hi rend="i">Melanoplus</hi>. I therefore regard <hi
												rend="i">quercicola</hi> as only an incipient race or variety of <hi
												rend="i">davisi</hi>, it bearing the same relation to <hi rend="i"
												>davisi</hi> that <hi rend="i">acidocercus</hi> does to <hi rend="i"
												>carnegiei</hi>. In fact all four forms are so closely related that the tyro
											will have much difficulty in separating them. The cerci of <hi rend="i"
												>davisi</hi> are of the same form as those of <hi rend="i">carnegiei</hi>,

										<p>Winchendon and Sherborn, Mass. (<hi rend="i">Morse</hi>) ; Lake and Marshall

											has been taken in Indiana only in Marshall, Tippecanoe and Lake counties. In

											Lake, and just west of the station of Arlington at Lake Maxinkuckee. Here
											among low huckleberry and other bushes it is common from July 15th on, the
											females, however, far outnumbering the males. Both sexes leap vigorously when
											disturbed, but often squat close to the ground after being flushed once or
											twice. In Lake County a few specimens have been taken <pb id="VAB8231-402"
												n="401"/> in the sand dune region near Millers, while a single male was
											taken June 28 by Fox near Lafayette.</p>
										<p>The range of <hi rend="i">M. fasciatus</hi> is northern, extending from
											Labrador, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and New England, north and west nearly or
											quite across the continent and south and west to New Jersey, northern Indiana,
											Missouri and Colorado, its southern limits being approximately that of
											latitude 40°, though a single male is recorded by <bibl>Morse (1907,
												47)</bibl> from Cheahaw Mt., Ala. In New England <bibl>Morse (1898,
												281)</bibl> says: "It is a somewhat local but common and widely distributed
											species, found most frequently among huckleberry bushes growing in and along
											the edges of open pitch-pine woods, where it is frequently associated with <hi
												rend="i">Chœaltis conspersa</hi> Harr. When startled it leaps well, but may
											usually be taken without a net. The species is very variable in color, the
											upper parts, while usually of a dark reddish-brown, are sometimes dark
											olivaceous-gray and occasionally are strikingly varied with white. Adults
											appear in late June and may be found as late as October."</p>
										<p>In Ontario <bibl>Walker (1899, 32)</bibl> found it "tolerably common in dry
											open woods, preferably on sandy or rocky soil, often in company with <hi

											sparingly." It is not recorded from Ohio, but in Michigan appears to be common

										<p>Hudson, Mich.; Cloverdale, Ohio; various points in Indiana, June--November
												(<hi rend="i">W. S. B</hi>.). This clumsy bodied insect, the <hi rend="i">M.
												blatchleyi</hi> of my former work, is among the least common of our Indiana
											Melanopli, having been taken only in Crawford, Knox, Monroe, Vigo, Putnam and
											Marion counties. Seldom more than a dozen or two are seen each season. It
											frequents, for the most part, upland woods and thickets, though it is
											sometimes found along the borders of marshes and swamps, but never close to
											the water. It is more arboreal than many of our locusts, having been taken in
											autumn on prickly ash and buttonbush shrubs, several feet above the ground,
											also from the boles of hackberry and oak trees, where it was probably sunning.
											In central Indiana it begins to reach maturity by June 14th, and ragged,
											forlorn looking specimens have been seen as late as November 3rd.</p>
										<p><hi rend="i">M. walshii</hi> has had a varied and somewhat strange career in
											Orthopterological nomenclature. It was first described by <bibl>Bruner (1876,
												124)</bibl> under the name of <hi rend="i">Pezotettix occidentalis</hi>.
											This specific name, having been preoccupied by <bibl>Thomas (1872,
											453)</bibl>, was changed by <bibl>Scudder (1897, 322)</bibl> to <hi rend="i"
												>blatchleyi</hi>. He, however, had described the insect as <hi rend="i">M.
												walshii</hi> on page 235, and as <hi rend="i">M. amplectens</hi> on page 260
											of the same work. <hi rend="i">M. walshii</hi>, therefore, stands, <hi
												rend="i">occidentalis</hi> Bruner, nec Thos., and <hi rend="i"
												>amplectens</hi> and <hi rend="i">blatchleyi</hi> Scudder being
											synonyms.</p>
										<p>The known range of <hi rend="i">walshii</hi>, based largely on the records of
											the above synonyms, is a wide one, extending from Ohio and Michiigan,
											southeast to Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia, and west and north to
											Nebraska and Minnesota. <bibl>Morse (1904, 50)</bibl> notes it as an
											inhabitant of the "Transition zone of the Central and Appalachian regions,
											being a characteristic and dominant species among the mountains of western
											North Carolina. There <pb id="VAB8231-406" n="405"/> it inhabits thickets of
											shrubbery, and herbage in and near deciduous woodlands at high elevations
											(3,000 to 6,000 feet) and sometimes extends its habitat into adjoining fields.
											Adults begin to appear about the middle of July, but the great majority do not
											reach maturity until August, and young are still plentiful in September at
											high elevations."</p>
										<p><bibl>Lugger (1898, 188)</bibl> states that in Minnesota "it is very common,
											preferring the edges of forests or places overgrown with bushes and vines. The
											grapevine, especially, is preferred by these locusts, and they soon destroy
											its foliage by eating big holes in the leaves."</p>
										<p><bibl>Somes (1914, 78)</bibl> records the finding of a female drilling in a
											piece of dead wood in very much the same way as does <hi rend="i">Chlœaltis
												conspersa</hi>. Two fresh holes, one 8 mm., the other 15 mm. deep, were
											found in the stick within a space of 3 inches. <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1916,
												235)</bibl> state that the size and color of the locust, and numerous
											structural features of the cerci, furcula, etc., are variable in the large
											series in their possession, and conclude that: "It is quite possible that the
											acquisition of more material from the Mississippi and Missouri valleys will
											show the desirability of recognizing two races of this species, one a western
											one to which the name <hi rend="i">blatchleyi</hi> should be limited, and the
											other (from the southeastern states) to which typical <hi rend="i"
												>walshii</hi> with <hi rend="i">amplectens</hi> as a synonym would be
											applied."</p>

										<p>This large bulky species varies greatly in wing-length, but only the
											short-winged form, the <hi rend="i">Pezotettix viola</hi> of <bibl>Thomas
												(1876, 68)</bibl> is known from east of the Mississippi, having been
											recorded from Illinois, Kentucky and Hattiesburg, Miss. The types of Thomas
											were from central and southern Illinois, while those of the long-winged form,
											typical <hi rend="i">ponderosus</hi>, were from Dallas, Texas. Scudder, in his
											key (1897, 138) separates the two forms only by the comparative length of
											tegmina and color of hind tibiæ. Cotypes (labelled "types") of <hi rend="i"
												>ponderosus ("robustus")</hi> from Dallas, received from him are at hand, as
											well as undoubted specimens of <hi rend="i">viola</hi> from Fayetteville and
											Cane Hill, Ark., and are almost exactly alike except in length of tegmina and
											color of hind tibiæ, the apical two-thirds of the latter in ponderosus being
											"yellow tinged with red," instead of distinctly red as in the Arkansas
											short-winged form. The male cerci and other abdominal organs are the same,
											with the exception of the median sulcus of supra-anal plate which in <hi
												rend="i">robustus</hi> is interrupted or closed for a short distance at
											apical third. <bibl>Morse (1907, 51)</bibl> records <hi rend="i">robustus</hi>
											from numerous points in Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas, stating that it "is a
											characteristic inhabitant of woodlands, usually xerophytic, where it hops
											about among the underbrush with vigorous leaps." He states that "it is very
											variable in wing-length but not dimorphic, the tegmina of the male ranging
											from 12 to 24 and female from 13 to 24 mm.; and also in the color of the hind
											tibiæ, the distal two-fifths of which range from pale yellow to bright coral
											red." He doubtless had both forms before him but did not recognize the shorter
											winged ones as the <hi rend="i">viola</hi> of Thomas, though he had previously
											(1907, 50) taken <hi rend="i">M. viola</hi> at Hattiesburg, Miss.</p>
										<p><bibl>Garman (1894)</bibl> has recorded the short-winged form from several
											points in central and western Kentucky, stating that it is "moderately common
											on low land along streams and increases in <pb id="VAB8231-408" n="407"/>
											abundance toward the Mississippi River." West of that stream it has been
											recorded only from Arkansas, Missouri and Nebraska. McNeill has recorded <hi
												rend="i">viola</hi> from Running Lake, Ill., and states (1899a, 345) that it
											is abundant in northern Arkansas and probably throughout the State, occurring
											on wooded hillsides between June 30 and October 26, and that it is sometimes
											known to lay its eggs in small holes in rocks in stone fences. Bruner mentions
											it as "occasionally met with in, the southeastern part of Nebraska," and
												<bibl>Riley (1878, 220)</bibl> as reaching maturity about St. Louis, Mo., on
											August 18. These are the only definite records of the form <hi rend="i"
												>viola</hi> which can be found, and <bibl>Scudder (1897, 357)</bibl> not
											recognizing that it was only a form of his <hi rend="i">robustus</hi>, says:
											"It appears to have a rather narrow range in the central Mississippi Valley
											between latitude 37°--40°, and longitude 86°--96°." This form bears a close
											general resemblance to <hi rend="i">M. walshii</hi>, but is larger, much more
											robust, with widely different male cerci, wider frontal costa and relatively
											shorter prozona.</p>
										<p>The typical form <hi rend="i">robustus</hi> has been definitely recorded
											outside of Texas only by Morse as above mentioned. In Texas it seems to be
											widely distributed. <hi rend="i">Bruner (1893, 17)</hi> mentions it as
											occasionally doing much damage in central Texas, and states that it "is also
											quite closely related to <hi rend="i">Pezotettix viola</hi> Thomas, which
											occurs in Illinois, Indiana and Missouri." <bibl>Hart (1906a, 159)</bibl>
											records <hi rend="i">robustus</hi> as common at Houston and College Station,
											Texas, "in margins of heavy forests and on low flat bottom land associated
											with <hi rend="i">M. plebejus</hi> Stål."</p>

										<p>This dull colored robust locust was originally described from a score or more
											of specimens taken by me at LaSalle Island, Mich., Aug. 17, 1897. They were
											found for the most part in a small clearing an acre or more in extent, where a
											cabin had formerly stood. Along its margins and over part of its area grew
											clumps of the wild red raspberry, <hi rend="i">Rubus strigosus</hi> Michx.,
											and among the numerous remains of stumps were small bunches of wire-grass and
											the trailing vines of the dewberry. Here <hi rend="i">M. huroni</hi> had its
											home, and the females, leaping lubberly from one bunch of grass to another,
											were readily secured, but the more sprightly males would often have to be
											chased quite a distance before their capture was effected. Specimens were sent
											Scudder for examination, and he reported them as unknown to him. The species
											was then described as <hi rend="i">Melanoplus huroni</hi> and under that name
											was recorded by <bibl>Rehn (1904d)</bibl> and <bibl>Hebard (1909)</bibl> from
											Pequaming, Mich., and by <bibl>Morse (1909)</bibl> from Isle Royale.
												<bibl>Caudell (1903, 798)</bibl> placed it as a synonym of <hi rend="i">M.
												altitudinum</hi> Scudd., a species ranging from South Dakota and Wyoming to
											New Mexico. It was recorded under that name by <bibl>E. M. Walker (1909,
												207)</bibl> as occurring at Ft. William and Nipigon, Ontario, both
											brachypterous and macropterous specimens having been found in open scrubby
											woods on the top of Mt. McKay. Hebard (who has been making an exhaustive study
											of the Melanopli) informs me that both <hi rend="i">huroni</hi> and <hi
												rend="i">altitudinum</hi> are distinct and valid geographic races of <hi
												rend="i">Melanoplus (Podisma) dodgei</hi> (Thos.), a common and widely
											distributed alpine species of the Rocky Mountain region and as such, on
											Hebard's authority, it is listed above. The records noted above are all that
											can be found of its occurrence in the territory covered by this work.</p>

									<p>The long-winged forms of <hi rend="i">Melanoplus</hi> inhabit cultivated

											id="VAB8231-410" n="409"/> waste places generally, and are seldom found in any

										Being possessed of ample powers of flight they travel long distances from their

											rend="i">atlanis</hi>, and rarely <hi rend="i">femur-rubrum</hi> and <hi
											rend="i">differentialis</hi>, become possessed of the migratory instinct and
										congregating in vast numbers, as do blackbirds in autumn, fly for scores or even
										hundreds of miles, stopping wherever food appears plentiful, and then moving
										again onward, leaving behind them a waste more desolate than did the Huns in
										northern France.</p>
									<p>The number of species of long-winged forms of the genus known from the eastern
										States is 18 as against 33 of the short-winged ones, but what the former lack in
										number of species is more than made up in individuals, for they comprise the

										species have in the past been described, based upon the color of the hind tibiæ,
										slight variations in the form of the male cerci and furcula, length of tegmina
										and other minor and variable characters. Five of these have been placed as
										varieties and a number as synonyms in the pages which follow and time will
										doubtless show that several of those retained as valid species should be so
										reduced. For convenience of treatment the eastern species of Division II are

										<p>This is a very common locust throughout Indiana, having been <pb
												id="VAB8231-416" n="415"/> taken in every county in which collections have
											been made. It begins to reach maturity the latter part of May, and from then
											until late November may be noted almost anywhere in open bluegrass pastures
											and woods, borders of roadsides and cultivated fields, meadows and lawns.
											Numerous examples have been found pairing as late as November 22d, and it may
											be that there are two broods each season. In late spring and early summer they
											are often seen resting on iron-weeds and thistles in company with <hi rend="i"
												>M. gracilis, M. luridus</hi> and other species. The cast off skin of their
											final moult is often noted on such weeds, showing that the nymph climbs
											thereon to change its garment of youth for one of maturity.</p>

										<p><hi rend="i">Atlanis</hi> is very often found associated with the more common
												<hi rend="i">M. femur-rubrum</hi> and is considered that species by most
											persons who deign to notice such a thing as a locust. The male, however, may
											be readily distinguished from that of <hi rend="i">femur-rubrum</hi> by the
											notched apex of subgenital plate, the shorter and less tapering cerci, and by
											the greater relative length of the tegmina, which extend one-fourth or more
											their length beyond the tip of abdomen. The dark spots on tegmina are also
											larger and more distinct in atlanis. The female of <hi rend="i">atlanis</hi>
											may be known by the yellow color of the under side of abdomen which in <hi
												rend="i">femur-rubrum</hi> is reddish-brown; and also by the more distinctly
											banded hind femora and more tapering and sharper pointed prosternal spine. The
											earlier specimens of <hi rend="i">atlanis</hi> are in general lighter colored
											and have relatively longer tegmina than those of late autumn, which are very
											dark gray in hue. The hind tibiæ are normally pale red, but in about 8 per
											cent. of the specimens they are either red at tip and otherwise colored, or
											dull yellow, or glaucous, the males having them more variable in hue than the
											females.</p>
										<p>The range of <hi rend="i">atlanis</hi> is a very wide one, extending from New
											England and Nova Scotia north to latitude 50° and the Yukon River, west to the
											Pacific and south to northern Florida, Texas and middle California. In Florida
											it has been recorded only from Marianna, where Morse took specimens on August
											6. He states (1904, 42) hat it "is probably the most widely and generally
											distributed of all the locusts inhabiting the Southeastern States, breeding
											from sea-level to the summit of Roan Mountain." <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1916,
												237)</bibl> state that <hi rend="i">atlanis</hi> is "relatively infrequent
											in the Coastal Plain south of North Carolina and the lower Gulf drainage of
											Southern Georgia," the only known South Georgia locality being
											Thomasville.</p>




										<pb id="VAB8231-417" n="416"/>

										<p><bibl>Scudder (1897, 182)</bibl> says of <hi rend="i">atlanis</hi>: "Next to
												<hi rend="i">M. spretus</hi> this is our most destructive locust, and east
											of the Mississippi probably the only one ever doing much damage. Its injuries,
											however, are not for a moment to be compared with those inflicted by <hi
												rend="i">M. spretus</hi>, for, though possessing good powers of flight and
											on rare occasions known to migrate in swarms, its injuries can only be classed
											as local, and they are never so serious as those inflicted by <hi rend="i">M.
												spretus</hi>; nevertheless they are by no means slight, and immense
											destruction of grain is to be laid at its door. While it occurs over an
											extended territory, it appears to be partial to hilly or mountainous regions;
											it seems also to prefer a wooded or mixed country to the open prairies or
											plains."</p>
										<p>In Old Mexico <hi rend="i">atlanis</hi> is replaced by <hi rend="i">M.
												mexicanus</hi>
											<bibl>Sauss. (1861, 160)</bibl>, of which <bibl>Hebard (1917b, 271)</bibl>

										<p>This trim graceful-bodied locust is a xerophytic species occurring mainly in
											dry sandy places. Scudder's types were from Colorado. <bibl>McNeill (1891,
												75)</bibl> first recorded and described it from Illinois under the name <hi
												rend="i">M. cenchri</hi>, a synonym, stating that it occurred only on "high
											sandy ground where the sand-bur, <hi rend="i">Cenchrus tribuloides</hi> L. was
											the only vegetation. They were colored so nearly like the yellow sand that
											they were difficult to see when only two or three feet away." <bibl>Hart
												(1907, 233)</bibl> states that it is "common everywhere in blowouts and on
											very sandy ground" in northwestern Illinois, and also records it from Lone
											Rock, Wis. <bibl>Vestal (1913, 23)</bibl> states that from July 19 to October
											10 it is the "most characteristic locust of the bare sand, blow sand and bare
											basins of blowouts" in northern Illinois. It is not recorded from Iowa or
											Minnesota, though it probably occurs in both states. Bruner reports it as rare
											in southwestern Nebraska. <bibl>Gillette (1904, 50)</bibl> states that in
											Colorado it is "a plains species, occurring sparingly in the southern portion
											of the State. It is abundant in grass pastures along the foothills, near Fort
											Collins, and has been taken feeding upon alfalfa, cabbages, leaves of plum and
											cherry trees and upon <hi rend="i">Artenmisia trifolia</hi>, so that wherever
											a food supply of native plants becomes scarce this species is likely to become
											seriously injurious to cultivated crops."</p>

											County, about ten miles southeast of Mt. Carmel, Ill., and at a point where
											the terrace on the Indiana side of the Wabash River meets the sandy uplands.
											Here, among the scant grass and weeds the insect had found a suitable abiding

										<p>The known range of <hi rend="i">impudicus</hi> is mainly southern, its most

											Illinois." Its main distribution east of the Mississippi is from New Jersey
											southwest to Meridian and Monticello, Miss. West of that stream it is recorded
											only from northwestern Arkansas and Oklahoma. <bibl>Morse (1907, 49)</bibl>
											calls it "a widely distributed but somewhat local species frequenting the

										<p>This is the most common and one of the most injurious of our Indiana locusts.
											It occurs everywhere in blue-grass pastures and meadows, along roadsides and
											borders of cultivated fields, on city lawns and in open woodlands. In central
											Indiana it begins to reach maturity about June 5th, and has been seen in
											numbers and mating as late as November 25th. Those which occur in low, damp
											places are usually darker than those in dry upland localities. The second crop
											of clover is, in a dry season, often almost wholly destroyed by this species
											and <hi rend="i">M. differentialis</hi>. When disturbed they either hop
											vigorously to one side, or fly swiftly and noiselessly straight ahead for 30
											or more feet and then suddenly drop to the ground.</p>

										<p>The range of <hi rend="i">M. femur-rubrum</hi> is practically that of America
											north of central Mexico. In the southeastern states and Florida the typical
											form is replaced by that of the doubtful race <hi rend="i">propinquus</hi>
											Scudd. It is not known from Alaska, and some of its most northern records
											perhaps properly belong to <hi rend="i">M. borealis</hi> (Fieb.). Wherever
											found it is very common and the aggregate amount of damage it annually does
											throughout North America is an enormous one. The northern form, in spite of
											its wide distribution, varies but little in color and structure; the hind
											tibiæ being very rarely dull yellow, green or greenish. The tegmina vary
											somewhat in length, reaching from the tips of hind femora to 5 mm. beyond in
											both sexes, being rarely 1 mm. shorter than the tips in female.</p>
										<p>Of the habits of the red-legged locust much has been written. Scudder, in his
											Revision (1897, 278) and in his Index to North American Orthoptera (1901c) has
											given full references to all its literature. I quote, therefore, only the
											concluding paragraphs of his notes on this species in the former work, as
											follows: <pb id="VAB8231-422" n="421"/>
											<q rend="blockquote">
												<p>"The immediate distribution of this insect appears to be controlled
													altogether by climatic conditions, the chief of which is the presence of a
													certain amount of humidity. It is a frequenter of low grounds, cultivated
													fields, shady margins of woods, etc., where vegetation is rank and tender.
													It is rarely found upon dry hillsides when meadows close at hand may swarm
													with them, while the opposite is true of other species, <hi rend="i">M.
														luridus</hi> for instance; yet such specimens as do so occur will be
													found to differ from those inhabiting more favored localities, in being
													lighter colored and more uniformly grayish in tone, with slighter
													contrasts; those from dryer stations appear also to have on the average
													rather shorter wings. There is but a single annual brood which begins to
													appear full fledged in New England late in July. According to Riley, the
													eggs are not laid in a single mass, but at intervals in several; he has
													twice obtained four successive pods from a single female, covering a
													period of nearly two months and containing eggs amounting in all to from
													ninety-six to one-hundred and ten.</p>
												<p>"At Andover, Massachusetts, on October 5 many years ago, I observed a
													pair of this species, male and female, near together alternately signaling
													to each other with a slight quick movement, of the hind legs upon the
													tegmina, as if stridulating. I made no note of whether any sound was
													actually produced and do not now recall any."</p>

										<p>This, the southern form of <hi rend="i">femur-rubrum</hi>, has been taken by

											The males were abundant, the females just emerging from the final moult. It is
											a slender-bodied, long-winged species, dull in color but graceful in movement.
											They are active leapers, and when flushed usually fly noiselessly for several

										<p>After carefully studying typical specimens of <hi rend="i">M. borealis</hi>
											from Ft. Rae, MacKenzie, Can. (<hi rend="i">Pribble</hi>), in my collection
											and from Rama, Nain and Hopedale, Labrador, in the E. M. Walker and Scudder
											collections, and comparing them with what has hitherto been called <hi
												rend="i">M. extremus</hi> (F. Walker) from New England and Northern Indiana,
											I have no hesitancy in combining the two forms under Fieber's name. The
											southern individuals (<hi rend="i">extremus</hi>) average a little smaller in
											size, are mostly of a paler general hue, have the tegmina usually shorter, the
											median carina of pronotum often subobsolete on a portion of the prozona and
											the prosternal spine somewhat shorter and stouter, but in the genital
											characters of the male and otherwise they agree with <hi rend="i"
												>borealis</hi> in all particulars.</p>
										<p>This, the <hi rend="i">M. extremus</hi> of my former work (1903, 319) first
											came to my notice in Indiana on August 6, 1897, when it was found near DeLong,
											Fulton County, in an open peat bog which was surrounded on all sides by a
											heavy growth of tamarack, <hi rend="i">Larix americana</hi> Michx. But about a
											dozen specimens were secured, all of which were of the short-winged form. When
											disturbed they gave several short, quick leaps, and then burrowed as far as
											they could into the dense mass of sphagnum moss which everywhere covered the
											bog. It has since been taken several times in the same place; also in a marsh
											near the south end of Lake Maxinkuckee; and probably occurs about the most of
											the peat bogs and marshes of the northern third of the State.</p>
										<p>As its specific name indicates, the known range of typical <hi rend="i">M.
												borealis</hi> is northern; extending from Labrador, Nova Scotia, Hudson Bay
											and Greenland, north and west to Alaska and south and west to northern
											Massachusetts, northern Indiana and Illinois, Nebraska and Wyoming. Fieber's
											types of <hi rend="i">borealis</hi> were from Greenland, while those of
											Walker's <hi rend="i">extremus</hi> were from "Arctic America." Scudder's
											Labrador specimens were taken in August from the banks of a mountain brook.
											They were most abundant where the low shrubby vegetation was most luxuriant
											between 200 <pb id="VAB8231-425" n="424"/> and 1,500 feet above tide.
												<bibl>Caudell (1900, 511)</bibl> records the taking of five adults by Prof.
											Kincaid at Kukak Bay, Alaska, on July 3. "They were taken within a few feet of
											a small pool in a sphagnum swamp. This pool, only about ten feet in diameter,
											was surrounded by vegetation in which the locusts lived. They were captured by
											causing them to leap into the water where they were easily secured."</p>
										<p>In northern New England <hi rend="i">borealis</hi> is said by Morse to be
											common in suitable habitats, making its appearance early and reaching maturity
											in late June or early July, and in the White Mountain region is not uncommon
											in early September. There, as elsewhere, it is partial to damp surroundings,
											frequenting the dense grass of moist meadows, bogs, sedgy swamps and mountain
											tops.</p>
										<p><bibl>Scudder. (1897, 289)</bibl> gave the varietal name <hi rend="i"
												>scandens</hi> to the long-winged form of <hi rend="i">extremus</hi> and
											states that "it appears to affect high latitudes and altitudes, being found in
											all the localities in the far north, on the Big Horn Mountains in Wyoming, and
											on the summits of the mountains in New England, where it is the prevailing or
											exclusive form." E. M. Walker found it common about Ft. William and Nipigon,
											Ontario, the brachypterous form greatly outnumbering the macropterous. As <hi
												rend="i">extremus</hi> he also records it (1910, 334) from a number of
											stations in western Canada between Winnipeg, Man., and Field, B. C.
												<bibl>Hebard (1909, 157)</bibl> mentions <hi rend="i">extremus</hi> as
											scarce about Pequaming, Mich., always in damp meadows, where the grass was
											luxuriant and deep. <bibl>Somes (1914, 86)</bibl> states that in western
											Minnesota its numbers are possibly equal to those of <hi rend="i">M.
												femur-rubrum</hi>, and that it is "found in habitats varying from flat open
											prairie to dry gravelly hills, and at times even in the tamarack growths of
											the north. It is one of our earliest species and closely follows <hi rend="i"
												>M. minor</hi>, specimens having been taken June 14, and mating in the field
											on June 24."</p>

										<p>This locust is known in Indiana only from the northwestern counties, where it
											is one of the most common species about the south shore of Lake Michigan,
											occurring in company with <hi rend="i">M. atlanis</hi> (Riley), <hi rend="i"
												>Spharagemon wyomingianum</hi> (Thos.) and others over a large part of the
											sandy area within five miles of the lake. It seems to prefer such barren
											localities to those more promising in plant food, since Bruner mentions its
											partiality for "old breakings and well-fed pastures of many years' use." It
											probably begins to reach maturity some time in June, as numerous pairs have
											been found mating in late July. Specimens were also taken from along railway
											embankments near Kewanna, Fulton Co., July 14. The hind tibiæ of at least a
											third of the specimens of <hi rend="i">angustipennis</hi> taken in Indiana are
											red instead of blue. Since Scudder based his separation of his nominal species
												<hi rend="i">coccineipes</hi> on the color of the tibiæ and degree of
											maculation of the tegmina, I (1903, 322) definitely placed <hi rend="i"
												>coccineipes</hi> as a synonym of Dodge's species. A year later
												<bibl>Gillette (1904, 46)</bibl> recorded <hi rend="i">coccineipes</hi> as
											occurring in moderate numbers over the entire plains region of Colorado and
											extending for some distance into the foothills, and added: "It seems quite
											probable that this species is nothing more than a form of <hi rend="i"
												>angustipennis</hi> having red hind tibiæ." <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1906,
												412)</bibl> record two Colorado specimens of <hi rend="i">coccineipes</hi>
											as having glaucous tibiæ, and state that "they are much inclined toward the
											opinion recently expressed by Gillette to the effect that <hi rend="i">M. <pb
													id="VAB8231-428" n="427"/> coccineipes</hi> is but a red-legged form of
												<hi rend="i">M. angustipennis</hi>." <bibl>Walker (1910, 338)</bibl>
											mentions <hi rend="i">angustipennis</hi> from Aweme, Man., with both blue and
											red hind tibiæ, and says: "The red-legged individuals, commonly known as <hi
												rend="i">M. coccineipes</hi>, are certainly not distinct from the typical
											blue-legged form." The two forms are therefore again placed as a single
											species.</p>
										<p>The general range of <hi rend="i">angustipennis</hi> (including its synonym,
												<hi rend="i">coccineipes</hi>) is mainly to the west and northwest of its
											Indiana station, extending from Sudbury, Ont., and Douglas Lake, Mich., to
											Aweme, Man., and Yellowstone, Montana, south to southern Colorado, Kansas and
											Texas. At Douglas Lake <bibl>Vestal (1914, 108)</bibl> found it rather common,
											July 1--August 14, in open aspen thickets among plants of bracken and
											blueberry near the borders of the lake. <bibl>Hart (1907, 234)</bibl> recorded
											it as very abundant everywhere on waste sandy land in northwestern Illinois;
											also at Waukegan on sandy ridges near Lake Michigan. <bibl>Vestal
												(1913)</bibl> also says that "it is the most abundant and most
											characteristic locust in the bunch-grass, being the chief plant-eater in the
											Illinois sand-prairie from July until frost." From the records it appears to
											be scarce in both Iowa and Minnesota, but in Nebraska <bibl>Bruner (1897,
												136)</bibl> mentions it as "quite common on low grounds in the eastern half
											of the State, preferring <hi rend="i">Artemisia ludoviciana</hi> as a food
											plant." He also states that it is increasing rapidly in numbers, and is likely
											in places to become a serious pest. The vegetation of the area which it is
											known to inhabit in Indiana is not sufficient in quantity and value to enable
											it to do much damage. Several successive favorable seasons might, however,
											enable it to so increase in numbers as to cause it to migrate into the richer
											agricultural regions to the south and east.</p>

											3. Specimens (identified for him by Morse as <hi rend="i">M. fondus</hi>
											Scudd.) were taken "on bare or somewhat grassy beaches or in sandy woods,
											always in dry places and found on sand or soil, not on vegetation." Three of
											the males from the University of Michigan collection are at hand and agree
											exactly in everything but size with red-legged individuals of <hi rend="i">M.

											<bibl>Scudder (1879, 69)</bibl> extends from the Michigan station mentioned,
											north and west to Nicola Valley, B. C., and the Pacific Coast of the U. S. and
											south and west to Iowa, Texas and New Mexico. Specimens at hand collected by

											"This insect is closely related to <hi rend="i">M. packardii</hi>, but by its
											dingy coloring presents a very different appearance." In his notes on the same
											form (1897, 312) he says that the original types from Pueblo, Colo., are all
											that he has seen and that it "differs but slightly from <hi rend="i">M.
												packardii</hi> and may prove to be merely a varietal form of it, dependent
											upon station, which in this species (fœdus) is in the dank vegetation of river

										<p><bibl>Morse (1907, 50)</bibl> records <hi rend="i">packardii</hi> from
											various stations in Oklahoma and Texas and states that he found it "common
											among weeds and tall grass, varying greatly in amount of fuscous markings on
											pronotum and hind femora, as well as in color of hind tibiæ, apparently
											running into fœdus." <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1906, 413)</bibl> mention the great
											variation in color of Utah, Colorado and Montana specimens, and state that
											"most of them were taken from luxuriant weeds growing along ditches and
											drains, or about damp depressions in the prairies. The insects were active,
											but often clung tenaciously to the weeds in which they hid, and it was
											consequently easy to capture as many as desired." In Colorado, says <pb
												id="VAB8231-432" n="431"/>
											<bibl>Gillette (1904, 94)</bibl>, <hi rend="i">packardii</hi> is a common
											species everywhere, June 24--Oct. 8, in grassy glades and mountain parks up to
											8,000 feet or more. Of the 127 specimens in the college collection at Ft.
											Collins, the hind tibiæ of 54 were blue and of 73 red. Of <hi rend="i">M.
												fœdus</hi>, <bibl>Bruner (1893, 22)</bibl> wrote: "This locust is in reality
											a mountain form that occurs mainly at an elevation of about 5,000 feet, and
											that frequents the edges of valleys and sunny slopes within the semi-arid
											portion of the United States. In its general appearance and structure <hi
												rend="i">M. fœdus</hi> is very much like the insect which is known by the
											name of <hi rend="i">M. packardii</hi> Scudder. In fact there is but little
											difference save in color between the two species." It will be seen that
											Scudder, Bruner and Morse, three of the best Orthopterologists this country
											has produced, have found no fixed characters separating <hi rend="i"
												>fœdus</hi> from <hi rend="i">packardii</hi>, but for some reason have
											hesitated in combining the two names. I have no such hesitation and herewith

										<p>In Indiana this appears to be one of the least common of the Melanopli,
											having been noted only in Monroe, Vigo, Putnam and Marion counties. It has
											been found in numbers but once, on June <pb id="VAB8231-436" n="435"/> 30, on
											the bluegrass covered slope of an open woods pasture in Putnam Co. At the
											other localities only one or two specimens were secured, the earliest date
											being that of a single male in Marion Co., on June 1. It frequents blue-grass
											pastures, roadsides and borders of cultivated fields in upland or sandy
											regions, and when disturbed flies noiselessly for a short distance. In the
											field the red-legged form closely resembles <hi rend="i">M. femur-rubrum</hi>
											and <hi rend="i">atlanis</hi> in general appearance and is very likely to be
											confounded with them. It is probably, therefore, more numerous than my
											observations would denote and perhaps occurs throughout the State.</p>
										<p>This small, trim-bodied locust is the <hi rend="i">M. minor</hi> (Scudd.) of
											my former work (1903, 322) and of most authors. The name <hi rend="i"
												>minor</hi>, as first pointed out by Caudell (1915), was preoccupied by
												<bibl>F. Walker (1870, 699)</bibl> and the oldest synonym, <hi rend="i">M.
												confusus</hi> Scudder, therefore takes its place. The known range of <hi
												rend="i">M. confusus</hi> is a wide one, extending from Maine north and west
											to Toronto, Ont., Winnipeg, Man., Wyoming and Washington, and south and
											southwest to Havelock, N. Car., Missouri, New Mexico and Arizona. <bibl>Morse
												(1898, 293)</bibl> says that in New England it is the first member of the
											genus to reach maturity, adults having been taken on June 7. There it is found
											"most numerous among sweet vernal and blue-grasses in pastures and
											mowing-lands on gravelly or sandy upland soils. The hind tibiæ are very
											variable, ranging from cherry-red to greenish or blue. The red tibiæ are more
											common among the females (25--33 per cent., males 17--20 per cent.) ; among
											the males, however, they are frequently glaucous at base and pinkish at tip."
											In Ohio it has been recorded only from Newark, and in Michigan only from
											Douglas Lake and Saginaw Bay.</p>
										<p><bibl>Somes (1914, 90)</bibl> states that in Minnesota the males are nearly
											all of the red-legged type and that the young appear in August and pass the
											winter in an advanced stage of development, both these conditions being
											different from those reported by observers in other States. In Colorado
												<bibl>Gillette (1904, 52)</bibl> reports it as occurring only in moderate
											numbers on the plains and lower foothills up to 7,000 feet in the northeastern
											part of the State, where it matures as early as June 6. Bruner records it as
											found over the entire State of Nebraska, and common early in July. About
											Charlottesville, Va., <bibl>Fox (1917)</bibl> found it "the dominant
											grasshopper during late May and early June, although rather strictly limited
											to the higher, drier areas and not occurring in any considerable numbers on
											farm lands. Its choice appeared to be for old upland fields and pastures
											over-run with coarse grasses (<hi rend="i">Andropogon, Danthonia</hi>),
											etc."</p>

										<p>This compact, dull colored locust occurs in all parts of Indiana, frequenting
											open blue-grass pastures, the borders of gravelly and sandy terraces,
											prairies, and hillside slopes. Like <hi rend="i">M. gracilis</hi> and <hi
												rend="i">M. bivittatus</hi> it delights, in early autumn, to carry on its
											courtship among the leaves and branches of the iron weeds. The species begins
											to reach maturity about July 20, and may be taken until late November. While
											of about the same length, the females of <hi rend="i">luridus</hi> are much
											more robust than those of either <hi rend="i">M. femur-rubrum</hi> or <hi
												rend="i">M. atlanis</hi>, and the tegmina just reach the tip of or are a
											little shorter than the abdomen, instead of exceeding it as in those
											species.</p>
										<p>In my former work (1903, 325) the <hi rend="i">M. collinus</hi> Scudder,
											whose distribution as given by its author (1897, 348) was limited to the
											region east of the Mississippi, was first placed as a synonym of <hi rend="i"
												>M. luridus</hi> Dodge, recorded up to that time only from points west of
											that stream. This placement of <hi rend="i">collinus</hi> has been adopted by
												<pb id="VAB8231-439" n="438"/> most recent writers, and there is no doubt
											but that the two forms represent a single species, though <bibl>Kirby (1910,
												528)</bibl> lists them as distinct, and in the most recent local list of
											American Orthoptera, that of <bibl>McAtee &amp; Caudell (1918)</bibl>, the
											name <hi rend="i">collinus</hi> is retained. <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1916,
												242)</bibl> give their opinion regarding the eastern and western forms as
											follows: <q rend="blockquote">
												<p>"It would be difficult to imagine individuals, without even racial
													significance, differing more greatly in general appearance than do the
													long-winged slender examples of <hi rend="i">luridus</hi> from the
													northwestern portion of its range, from the heavy, short-winged type which
													is often found in Connecticut and New Jersey southward through the
													Appalachians. This is particularly true of the female sex; northwestern
													material bearing a strong superficial resemblance to <hi rend="i">M.
														atlanis</hi>, while the southeastern is vastly heavier with a different
													general appearance. Intergradation between these types is, however, almost
													everywhere to be found and no valid reason exists for separating the
													eastern and western material as geographic races."</p>
											</q>
										</p>
										<p>The known range of <hi rend="i">M. k. luridus</hi> is a very wide one,
											extending from Maine north and northwest to North Bay, Ont., Aweme, Man.,
											Minnesota and Montana, south to the crests of the higher mountains of North
											Carolina and Georgia and west to Kansas, Nebraska and Colorado. According to
												<bibl>Walker (1899, 33)</bibl> it is quite plentiful in Ontario in late
											summer, frequenting sandy or gravelly uplands and the more or less open or
											rocky unsettled country such as characterizes the Laurentian area in that
											region. Along the Severn River he found it in August, to be the most abundant
											locust, far outnumbering any other <hi rend="i">Melanoplus</hi>. <bibl>McNeill
												(1891, 74)</bibl> states that in northern Illinois it is "closely restricted
											to the tops of hills and sides of ravines too barren for pasturage." <bibl>Fox
												(1917)</bibl> calls it "a typical sylvan species, frequenting the grassy and
											shrubby undergrowth of dry woodlands, and abundant in the Appalachian region
											of Virginia along the margins of the woods and in clearings on the mountain
											slopes." <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1910a, 635)</bibl> record <hi rend="i"
												>luridus</hi> "as being the most plentiful species of <hi rend="i"
												>Melanoplus</hi> on all the mountains of North Carolina, at altitudes above
											4,000 feet." <bibl>Morse (1904, 44)</bibl> mentions it from numerous stations
											in Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee and calls it "an expert
											leaper, using its legs, as a means of escaping its enemies, quite as freely as
											its wings, though flying freely on occasion." West of the Mississippi <hi
												rend="i">M. k. luridus</hi> is stated by Bruner to be quite common,
											especially on the prairies over the most of Nebraska, while Gillette says it
											is an abundant species in northern Colorado, east of the mountains, the native
											food plant being the wormwood or sage brush, <hi rend="i">Artemisia
												dracunculoides</hi> Pursh."</p>

										<p>This is the largest and at the same time one of the most common and
											destructive of our Melanopli. It occurs throughout Indiana, reaching maturity
											in the central portion about July 25th, and may be found in favorable seasons
											until December 1st. In late autumn the females are always worn and bedraggled,
											while many of the males are bright colored and evidently freshly moulted. The
											species becomes darker with age and those which mature in autumn are darker
											than those of mid-summer, often in great <pb id="VAB8231-442" n="441"/> part
											melanistic. In autumn it is common on the lawns, vacant lots and sidewalks of
											Indianapolis, and in 1918, together with <hi rend="i">M. femur-rubrum</hi> and
												<hi rend="i">bivittatus</hi>, did a vast amount of damage throughout the
											State to clover and other forage crops.</p>
										<p>In Indiana, this lubberly locust delights in low, damp waste places, such as
											the margins of lakes and ponds, the borders of streams, fence rows and the
											margins of low-land cultivated fields. It is especially fond of the greater
											rag weed, <hi rend="i">Ambrosia trifida</hi> L., of the river bottoms, and is
											often seen by scores feeding upon its leaves, or mating among its foliage. The
											various species of smartweed, <hi rend="i">Polygonum</hi>, which grow in
											shallow water, are also much frequented by it in early autumn. Occasionally
											vast numbers are seen along the edge of a field of low-land corn, the leaves
											of the marginal rows of which they have almost wholly destroyed. When a stalk
											is approached they do not desert it but dodge quickly around to the opposite
											side, much as does a squirrel around the trunk of a tree when pursued. If,
											however, one takes alarm and jumps, all the others in the immediate vicinity
											do likewise.</p>
										<figure>
											<p>Fig. 149. Male. X 1.5. (After Lugger.)</p>
										</figure>
										<p>In late autumn, as night approaches, this locust, as well as <hi rend="i">M.
												femur-rubrum</hi> and other species, often climb or fly to the tops of high
											weeds where, sheltered by the leaves, they cling to the stems or branches
											until the sun warms them up the next day. If the night is cool or frosty one
											can pick them off these weeds by scores in early morning. I have often
											gathered them thus for bait, getting all I needed in a few minutes for an
											entire day's fishing.</p>
										<p>On one occasion a specimen of <hi rend="i">differentialis</hi> was found
											feeding upon a dead example of <hi rend="i">Dichromorpha viridis</hi>, half or
											more of the abdomen of the latter having been devoured. The Loggerhead shrike,
												<hi rend="i">Lanius ludoricianus</hi> L., catches many of these and other
											locusts and often impales them on the barbs of wire fences. On one October day
											I gathered fully a pint of such impaled insects from a fence row half a mile
											long, and found that they represented sixteen species; eight of grasshoppers,
											two of katydids, and <pb id="VAB8231-443" n="442"/> six of beetles, all
											injurious, so that this bird, although savage and blood-thirsty, is of great
											benefit to the farmer and fruit grower.</p>
										<p>East of the Mississippi the known range of <hi rend="i">M.
												differentialis</hi> extends from New Jersey and Pennsylvania north and west
											to Cheboygan Co., Michigan and Illinois, south and west through Tennessee to
											Agricultural College, Miss. It appears to be scarce and recently introduced
											east of the Appalachian Mountains, having been recorded only from near Camden
											and several other points in New Jersey and the vicinity of Philadelphia, Pa.
												<bibl>Rehn (1900a)</bibl> says that it was first seen about Philadelphia in
											1896. In 1898 they "appeared about August 1 on the weeds on lots and even in
											the iron manufacturing sections of the city, where there is absolutely no
											vegetation." <bibl>Fox (1914, 514)</bibl> states that it was then abundant in
											the low marshy lands adjoining the lower Delaware River and its tributaries.
											It is not mentioned by <bibl>Fox (1917)</bibl> nor by <bibl>McAtee and Caudell
												(1918)</bibl> and therefore apparently does not occur in the east as far
											south as Virginia and Washington, D. C. In Tennessee it is known from
											Clarksville, Danville and Chattanooga. The Mississippi specimens at hand were
											taken by H. E. Weed in September, 1892. It is not recorded from Canada, and
											but once from Michigan, <bibl>Vestal (1914, 108)</bibl> stating that at
											Douglas Lake it was "not abundant, being near the northern limit of its
											range."</p>
										<p>West of the Mississippi <hi rend="i">differentialis</hi> ranges from 45°
											north latitude over practically the entire country as far west as the Pacific
											and south to Southern Mexico. Scudder says that he does not think it occurs
											above 6,000 feet, and Gillette states that in Colorado, where it is abundant
											and destructive in the lower altitudes, it has not been taken above 5,500
											feet. In Minnesota <bibl>Somes (1914, 92)</bibl> states that it has been taken
											as yet only in the southern part of the State, it and <hi rend="i">M.
												bivittatus</hi> being "the only locusts found far in from the margins of
											thoroughly worked lands such as corn fields. The eggs are deposited in loose
											soil or even sand, often in cultivated fields. In September we have noted
											great numbers, literally thousands, of the females drilling and ovipositing in
											an abandoned melon patch where the soil was a soft and very sandy loam. They
											were not under the vines, for the most part, but every spot of bare soil was
											occupied by one or more of the females."</p>
										<p>Bruner, on the other hand (1893, 16), says that: <q rend="blockquote">
												<p>"The eggs are laid in cultivated grounds that are more or less compact,
													preferably old roads, deserted fields, the edges of weed patches and well
													grazed pastures adjoining weedy ravines. Egg laying begins about <pb
														id="VAB8231-444" n="443"/> the middle of August and continues into
													October, varying, of course, according to latitude and climatic
													conditions. Usually, but not always, only a single cluster of eggs is
													deposited by each female. Frequently there are two, and in extreme cases
													perhaps even three of these clusters deposited by a single female. One
													hundred and seventy-five eggs have been counted in a single mass."</p>
											</q>
										</p>

										<p><bibl>Riley (1878, 223)</bibl> states that around Dallas, Texas, Boll "found
											the eggs of <hi rend="i">differentialis</hi> very numerously placed under the
											bark of elm and hackberry logs that had been felled in low land."</p>
										<p>Finally, quoting in part from Scudder and Bruner, this giant <hi rend="i"
												>Melanoplus</hi> is certainly occasionally one of the most destructive pests
											of the Upper Mississippi Valley States, having been noted as injuring grass,
											alfalfa, Indian corn, beets, orchard trees, mulberry, poplar and catalpa
											trees, and even grape vines. Dahlias, hollyhocks and other garden flowers have
											also been specified as its food, not to mention the greater rag-weed, <hi
												rend="i">Ambrosia trifida</hi>. It is one of the few species of locusts that
											has thus far shown a tendency toward civilization. This it has done readily,
											since its habits are in unison with the cultivation of the soil. It is only
											since the settlement of the country where it originally occurred that it has
											multiplied so as to become sufficiently numerous as to become a serious
											pest.</p>
										<p>The variation in color and structure of <hi rend="i">differentialis</hi> is
											very slight for a locust of such wide range. Scudder says that in California
											occasional specimens are found having the hind tibiæ bright coral-red, and
											Gillette states that in Colorado individuals that are black, except for yellow
											bands upon the legs and light posterior lateral margins of pronotum, are
											sometimes taken. This lack of variation and large size leads to its easy
											identification, and it is one of the few older described Melanopli which has
											no synonyms.</p>

											<item>"Closely related to <hi rend="i">M. furcatus</hi>. Differs in the more

												branch exceeding the dorsal branch in length. General color varying from
												prout's brown dorsad and tawny olive laterad to a maximum intensive
												condition in which the head and pronotum are blackish chestnut brown with a
												comparatively broad blackish postocular bar, while the lateral fields of the
												tegmina are darker than the pronotum. Pale ventro-external bar of caudal

										</list>

										<p>This is a form of <hi rend="i">furcatus</hi>, bearing the same relation to it

												<hi rend="i">luridus</hi> bears to <hi rend="i">keeleri</hi>, the principal

												furcatus</hi> of <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1916, 244)</bibl>, nec. Scudder, the
											type series being from Billy's Island, Okefenokee Swamp, Ga. There it was
											found July 15--19, in "thick, rich bushy undergrowth surrounding wet
											depressions filled with swamp loving trees, these areas scattered through the
											long-leaf pine woods. The males frequently flew short distances in a direct

										<p>The four forms, <hi rend="i">clypeatus, symmetricus, furcatus</hi> and <hi

												<bibl>(Say), 1825, 308</bibl>. Yellow-striped Locust.</head>

											<item>Females very large for the genus, the males much the smaller. Dull
												olive-brown to brownish-fuscous above, pale yellow to dull greenish-yellow
												beneath. Face either yellow or olive-green, often flecked with fuscous;
												occiput and disk of pronotum dark olive-brown. A narrow yellowish stripe
												extends back from the upper inner angle of each eye along the sides of disk
												of pronotum nearly to tips of tegmina; this usually bordered below with
												blackish on head and lateral lobes of pronotum. Tegmina usually immaculate,
												often with a few fuscous dots along the median area. Hind femora dull
												yellow, usually with a fuscous stripe along the upper half of outer face;
												inner half of upper face with three more or less distinct fuscous bars;
												lower face yellow; knees in great part fuscous. Hind tibiæ usually bright
												coral red, with black spines, often purplish-brown or greenish-yellow.
												Interocular space wide, equalling the frontal costa and about three times
												the width of first antennal joint; fastigium feebly declivent, broadly and
												shallowly concave. Frontal costa broad, subequal, convex above the antennæ,
												slightly sulcate at and below the ocellus. Pronotum widening feebly on
												posterior half, more distinctly so in female, disk nearly flat, hind margin
												broadly obtuse-angulate or subrounded; median carina distinct on metazona,
												very low, sometimes in part subobsolete on prozona, the latter fully
												one-half, male, or about one-third, female, longer than the closely and very
												finely punctate metazona. Tegmina reaching or slightly surpassing the hind
												femora, sometimes a little shorter in female, tapering regularly and
												gradually from base to the rounded tips. Hind femora distinctly surpassing
												abdomen, male, reaching its tip or slightly beyond, female. Supra-anal plate
												broadly triangular, abruptly narrowed and sharply incised each side near the
												blunt apex; its margins upcurved to form a broad lengthwise concavity each
												side of the deep, rather narrow median sulcus. Furcula consisting of a pair
												of very short, much swollen, triangular widely separated lobes. Cerci as

										<p>In Indiana this is one of the most common of our early summer locusts,
											occurring everywhere throughout the State. It begins <pb id="VAB8231-448"
												n="447"/> to reach maturity about June 15th, perhaps earlier in the southern
											counties, and has mostly disappeared by mid-September. It frequents clover
											fields, open blue-grass pastures, prairies and roadsides, and is to be found
											in both moist and dry localities. When flushed, it usually leaps vigorously,
											seldom flying, and then noiselessly and for a short distance. It delights to
											rest on the branches and foliage of the iron-weeds and other Compositæ, and is
											often found after death, clinging to them and to tall grasses, where it has
											fallen a prey to the locust fungus. More than any other of our Melanopli it
											seems to be subject to the attacks of the red locust mite, <hi rend="i"
												>Trombidium locustarum</hi> Riley. In August I once noted a large male with
											a dozen or more of the mites in different stages, attached to the membrane of
											the inner wings. A female near by, with both tegmina and wings absent, had
											more than 20 of the mites clinging to the thin membrane beneath the
											metathorax. Old and worn examples of this locust usually have the wings badly
											damaged.</p>
										<p>After more than 15 years additional observation I see no reason to change my
											former (1903, 331) placement of Burmeister's red-legged <hi rend="i"
												>femoratus</hi> as an absolute synonym of Say's <hi rend="i"
											>bivittatus</hi>. Most of the recent writers have either retained <hi rend="i"
												>femoratus</hi> as distinct or made it a variety of <hi rend="i"
												>bivittatus</hi>, but none of them have as yet pointed out a single fixed
											structural character of specific or even varietal value on which to base their
											retention of the name <hi rend="i">femoratus</hi>. Scudder in his key (1897,
											138) separated them solely by the difference in color of the tibiæ, and in his
											subsequent description of <hi rend="i">bivittatus</hi> (p. 367) adds: "Besides
											the differences in the hind tibiæ, there are other slight ones which I have
											attempted to state, in the abdominal appendages and in the tegmina, besides
											some distinction in the color," but he nowhere points out definitely these
											minor distinctions except in the cerci as mentioned farther on. In Indiana one
											can find in almost every colony not only red-legged and greenish-legged
											individuals, but often those in which the tibiæ are brown at base, greenish or
											glaucous in the middle and red on the apical third.</p>
										<p>As far back as 1859 that astute observer, <bibl>Philip R. Uhler (1859, II,
												238)</bibl>, said of <hi rend="i">bivittatus</hi>: "Belongs to <hi rend="i"
												>Caloptenus</hi> and is identical with <hi rend="i">C. femoratus</hi> Burm.
											It is very common on the salt marshes near Baltimore and I have once or twice
											seen it in company with <hi rend="i">C. femur-rubrum</hi> (DeGeer) in
											considerable swarms in the air." Scudder himself (1862, 466) followed Uhler
											without comment, but (1878, 285) reversed his opinion without giving reasons
											other than distributional as follows: "<hi rend="i">M. femoratus</hi> is <pb
												id="VAB8231-449" n="448"/> the species generally called <hi rend="i"
												>Caloptenus bivittatus</hi>. The latter, however, is an interior species
											while <hi rend="i">femoratus</hi> extends across the continent."</p>
										<p><bibl>Rehn (1904d, 267)</bibl> mentions Pequaming, Michigan, specimens as
											"having the posterior tibiæ uniformly blood-red, varying slightly in
											intensity, thus placing them in <hi rend="i">femoratus</hi>. The form of the
											cerci is also that figured by Scudder as typical <hi rend="i">femoratus</hi>."
											He adds: "Personally, I believe <hi rend="i">femoratus</hi> and <hi rend="i"
												>bivittatus</hi> to be geographic forms of the same species very closely
											related but still typical of each other over large areas." Now Scudder's
											figures (1897, pl. XXIV, figs. 4 and 5) show very little difference in the
											form of the cerci, and in the description of the cerci of <hi rend="i"
												>bivittatus</hi> (1897, 365) he says that they are "shaped almost precisely
											as in <hi rend="i">M. femoratus</hi>, but more elongate and with the upper
											lobe of the expanded extremity bent at a lesser angle with the basal portion."
											It has already been shown that the form of the cerci in <hi rend="i">M.
												viridipes, M. keeleri</hi> and other species of <hi rend="i">Melanoplus</hi>
											varies exceedingly and <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1905, 40; 1907, 297)</bibl> reduced
												<hi rend="i">M. deletor</hi> to a synonym under <hi rend="i">keeleri</hi> on
											account of the variability in the form of that organ. One may pick at random
											20 males of <hi rend="i">bivittatus</hi> from any colony throughout its range,
											and no two of them will have the cerci exactly alike and the extremes in form
											will be as great or greater than described by Scudder.</p>
										<p>As to the two being geographic forms, that is controverted by the known
											distribution, both forms being found together from Ohio or farther east, to
											Oregon and Washington, and from Central Canada to at least as far south as
											latitude 40°. Scudder says that typical <hi rend="i">bivittatus</hi> does not
											occur along the Atlantic seaboard nor along the Pacific coast south of
											Washington. It is very probable that in these regions moisture and other
											conditions of habitat are such that all the tibiæ are red, just as in certain
											localities the inner wings of <hi rend="i">Arphia xanthoptera</hi> are yellow
											and in others orange-red. Numerous species of Melanopli and other locusts, as
												<hi rend="i">M. atlanis, confusus, angustipennis, packardii</hi>, etc., are
											known with tibiæ both red and otherwise colored, yet we do not give varietal
											names to each of these.</p>
										<p>The entomologists of the East who, for the most part, have seen only the
											red-legged form in the field, and have perhaps judged <hi rend="i"
												>bivittatus</hi> as distinct from a few specimens received in exchange,
											should observe the two forms as they appear together by thousands on a
											mid-summer day in the meadows and pastures of the central West. They will then
											probably arrive at the same conclusion as has Somes, who says (1914, 93) : <pb
												id="VAB8231-450" n="449"/>
											<q rend="blockquote">
												<p>"<hi rend="i">M. femoratus Burm</hi>, is identical with <hi rend="i">M.
														bivittatus</hi> in size, general appearance and form of cerci and
													furcula, but differs mainly in the fact that the posterior tibiæ are red.
													It can but be considered as a mere color form of this species by one
													observing the two in the field. It has no more basis for specific
													distinction than have two other color forms which I have occasionally
													taken--one in which the hind tibiæ are clear yellow throughout, and the
													other having the hind tibiæ entirely and almost uniformly dark rose
													purple. All of these color forms, including the one termed <hi rend="i"
														>femoratus</hi>, occur together through the northern part of Minnesota,
													with typical <hi rend="i">bivittatus</hi>, and I have on many occasions
													observed specimens <hi rend="i">in coitu</hi> in which the sexes had
													differently colored hind tibiæ."</p>
											</q>
										</p>

										<p>As noted above, the known range of <hi rend="i">M. bivittatus</hi> is a wide
											one, extending from Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Hudson Bay and Vernon, B. C.,
											south to North Carolina, the mountains of northern Georgia, Texas and Old
											Mexico, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific. While it is seldom if ever
											migratory like <hi rend="i">spretis</hi> and <hi rend="i">atlanis</hi>, it
											often occurs locally in sufficient numbers to be highly injurious to clover,
											blue-grass and other forage plants.</p>
										<p><bibl>Bruner (1893, 19)</bibl> has well summed up its habits as follows: <q
												rend="blockquote">
												<p>"Next to <hi rend="i">Dissosteira carolina</hi> (L.) the two-striped
													locust is perhaps the most familiar to the greatest number of people in
													the United States. It occurs in nearly every locality over the entire
													country from the Saskatchewan River in the north to the Gulf of Mexico at
													the south, and from ocean to ocean. It is found in the low valleys near
													the seashore and upon the mountain slopes of the Rocky range and the
													interior plateaus to an elevation of nearly 10,000 feet above tide water.
													In fact, this particular species appears to be able to withstand more
													climatic variations than any other of the North American species, without
													showing marked variations in color and form. No wonder, then, that it
													occasionally becomes sufficiently numerous over limited areas to do
													considerable injury to crops. Like <hi rend="i">M. femur-rubrum</hi> and
														<hi rend="i">differentialis, bivittatus</hi> is a lover of rank and
													succulent vegetation such as is found upon bottom lands, along the edges
													of cultivated fields, at the margins of woodlands, and on the shaded
													mountain slopes. When nature has specially favored the species, as it
													sometimes does, in the way of favorable climatic conditions, the absence
													of enemies, etc., and it develops in large numbers, then these haunts are
													forsaken to a greater or less extent and it spreads over cultivated
													fields, eating the choicest of everything.</p>
												<p>"The egg-laying habits of <hi rend="i">bivittatus</hi> differ
													considerably from those of the smaller migratory species, insomuch as but
													one or two clusters or pods are deposited by a single female.
													Nevertheless, just as many eggs are laid by each female insect. These eggs
													are deposited in prairie sod or any compact soil in the vicinity of the
													regular haunts or feeding places. Old roads and closely cropped pastures
													when located handily are favorite resorts for the heavily-laden females
													when attending to this mission of theirs. Conditions which favor the rapid
													multiplication of other locusts. such as the migratory kinds, also favor
													the increase of this and other of our native species. Hence when we hear
													of the increase and spread of the former, we may also look for the latter
													to become more numerous. <pb id="VAB8231-451" n="450"/> By keeping down
													weed patches and by plowing waste places about fence corners, along
													ravines, the edges of groves and old roads, this insect can usually be
													kept moderately scarce and harmless."</p>
											</q>
										</p>

										<p><bibl>Piers (1918, 306)</bibl> states that in Nova Scotia <hi rend="i">M.
												bivittatus</hi> ranks next to <hi rend="i">M. femur-rubrum, M. atlanis</hi>
											and the crickets among destructive Orthoptera. He also writes of its habits as
											follows: <q rend="blockquote">
												<p>"Near the mouth opening of insects are salivary glands which in the
													Acrididæ usually secrete a brown-colored fluid, which is also probably
													defensive in character as many species when captured very readily exude it
													from the mouth. This is particularly noticeable in <hi rend="i">M.
														bivittatus</hi>, and country children have everywhere given the
													dark-coloured secretion the name of 'grasshopper molasses,' and to the
													insect itself they occasionally apply the name 'molasses bug.' This
													species is often captured by Nova Scotian children for the sole purpose of
													seeing it exude the fluid, their invariable saying on such an occasion
													being, 'grasshopper, grasshopper, give me some molasses and I'll let you
													go.' It is also known to many children as a doughty fighter, boys often
													amusing themselves by bringing two large specimens together so that they
													wrestle vigorously with their front legs and endeavor to bite each other.
													These gay coloured locusts bring back childish memories of half forgotten
													summer days when we dallied waist-deep in the lush timothy, the air filled
													with what might be termed the 'green' scent of trampled grass; or of
													afternoons in early autumn when we loafed about the rank vegetation of
													fence-rows with its odour of dank decay."</p>

										<p>In Indiana this prettily mottled locust has been taken in numerous localities
											throughout the State, but is nowhere common, seldom more than half a dozen
											being seen each season. It is preeminently an autumn insect, the first mature
											specimen having been taken on August 20th, while most of those seen were in
											October and November after heavy frosts, several pairs having been found
											mating on September 24. In central Indiana it frequents for the most part low
											wooded tracts along streams, where it may often be noted resting on the trunks
											of trees, two or three feet above the ground. In the northern part of the
											State it has been found only in the depths of the tamarack swamps of Fulton
											and Marshall counties. While other Acrididæ are common up to the very border
											of the tamarack growth, this and two species of grouse locusts were the only
											ones found within this border. It is more arboreal in habits than any of our
											other northern Melanopli, in most places frequenting the vicinity of pine or
											coniferous trees, but in Indiana these are rare, and it has been taken mostly
											on those of oak, beech and maple. In action it is rather sluggish, after one
											or two short leaps usually squatting close to the earth, and seemingly
											depending upon the close similarity of its hues to the grayish lichens or
											debris about it to avoid detection.</p>
										<p>The general range of typical <hi rend="i">punctulatus</hi> is northern,
											extending from Maine and Ontario west to Minnesota and Nebraska, south to
											Virginia and Georgia and southwest to Dallas, Texas. It is noted as scarce
											wherever found except near Thompson's Mills in northern Georgia, where
												<bibl>Allard (1916, 278)</bibl> states it "was a very common species in all
											upland fields in company with <hi rend="i">M. femur-rubrum</hi>." From Ohio it
											has been recorded only from Cedar Point, while it is not mentioned in any of
											the Michigan lists. <pb id="VAB8231-453" n="452"/> Somes says, it is very rare
											in Minnesota, but that he has taken it in northern Iowa in low thickets of
											willow. Bruner states that in Nebraska it is "found in rather small numbers in
											oak groves in the extreme eastern part of the State."</p>
										<p>In Ontario the grizzly locust has been recorded only from Toronto and
											DeGrassi Point. Of its habits at the latter place <bibl>E. M. Walker (1901,
												22)</bibl> has given an interesting account as follows: <q rend="blockquote">
												<p>"I found them most numerous on dead stumps and logs, in a wood of second
													growth white pine. They were sometimes seen on the trunks and branches of
													living trees, but most often on the stumps and fallen trunks of the old
													forest, and on the pine rails of a snake fence enclosing the wood. They
													were found only on the borders and more open parts of the woods, where
													they were to be seen upon almost every stump. I have seen ten females on a
													single stump. It is in these dead stumps and logs that the females deposit
													their eggs, in which operation I have observed them repeatedly. The female
													chooses a crack in the wood or an old beetle boring of suitable size and
													lowers her abdomen down this, sometimes nearly as much as an inch.
													Sometimes when the hole is of a large size, only the head and legs of the
													insect can be seen above it. Unlike <hi rend="i">Chlœaltis conspersa</hi>,
													the female of <hi rend="i">M. punctulatus</hi> apparently never bores
													herself, unless merely to make her way through any loose rubbish that
													might be obstructing the hole. She generally chooses sound or only partly
													decayed wood.</p>
												<p>"I managed to obtain several fragments and one complete packet of eggs.
													The latter was fixed by the cement substance at its lower end to the wall
													of the beetle-boring three-eighths of an inch in diameter. It was attached
													at a distance of about three-quarters of an inch down the hole, and except
													at the lower end, which was imbedded in a depression in the wall, the
													packet was quite free. It was covered with a rather thick coating of a
													porous or vesicular cement substance, which also filled all the spaces
													between the closely packed eggs. The latter were twenty-three in number,
													and their arrangement was in general in a longitudinal direction, the
													anterior ends pointing toward the free end of the packet, but was
													otherwise irregular. The eggs are 4 to 4.8 mm. long, elongate-elliptical
													in form, finely and densely punctate and reddish-brown in hue."</p>

							short-horned locusts or Acrididæ. The principal distinguishing characters of the
							members of the family Tettigoniidæ, as given in the key, p. 149, are the long,
							slender, tapering, many-jointed antennæ which, when turned back, usually extend far
							beyond the tip of abdomen; almost universal absence of ocelli or simple eyes; the
								four-jointed<ref id="ref_065" rend="super" target="note_065">62</ref> tarsi or feet;
							and the sword-shaped or falcate ovipositor of the females, which is made of four
							flattened plates with the edges near its tip often horny and serrate. The head in many
							of the species is wedge-shaped and the mouth-parts are well developed, the maxillary
							palpi being very long and the mandibles especially long and sharp-pointed. This
							enables the insect , to dig into plant tissue or to eat the seeds of grasses, as many
							of them do. The tegmina, when present, are usually leaf-like and of a delicate
							structure, having no stiff chitinous anterior veins. When closed the left one usually
							overlaps the right, and, in the larger forms, they slope obliquely downwards instead
							of being bent abruptly, as in the Gryllidæ or true crickets, while in most cases, the
							wings are slightly longer than the tegmina. The meso- and metathorax are less closely
							united than in the Acrididæ, <note id="note_064"><ref target="ref_064" rend="super"

							<pb id="VAB8231-456" n="455"/> and in the winged forms the hind legs are usually
							longer and much more slender. The males have, in many instances, abdominal appendages
							corresponding to the parts of the ovipositor which are used as clasping organs.</p>
						<p>The stridulating or musical organ of the males is quite similar in structure to that
							of the male cricket, being found at the base of the overlapping dorsal area of the
							upper tegmen and usually consisting of a transparent membrane, of a more or less
							rounded form, which is crossed by a prominent curved vein, which, on the under side,
							bears a single row of minute file-like teeth. In stridulating, the tegmina are moved
							apart and then shuffled together again, when these teeth are rubbed over a vein on the
							upper surface of the other wing cover, producing the familiar, so-called "katydid"
							sound. Each of the different species makes a distinct call or note of its own, and
							many of them have two calls, one which they use by night and the other by day. Any one
							who will pay close attention to these different calls can soon learn to distinguish
							each species by its note as readily as the ornithologist can recognize different
							species of birds in the same manner.</p>
						<p>In the northern States the notes of the katydids and green grasshoppers are not heard
							till in July, as they do not attain their wings until then. C. V. Riley who, like our
							own beloved Indiana Riley, had within his soul a true love for the poetry of nature,
							has well set forth (1874, 153) his ideas of the why and wherefore of the songs of this
							family thus: "During spring, while our birds are making love, and the males rival each
							other in their attempts to please the females with happy, jubilant song, Dame Nature
							is rearing a troupe of insect musicians, which, in their turn, will string their lyres
							and play their courtship-tunes in the later seasons, when the song of the feathered
							performers is mostly hushed.</p>
						<p>"Leyden's lines--<q rend="blockquote">
								<lg>
									<l>'Oft have I listening mused the sultry day</l>
									<l rend="ti=2">And wondered what thy chirping song might say'--</l>
								</lg>
							</q> but express an inquiry often made as to the purpose and object of the grasshopper
							song. He who believes all things made for man and his enjoyment, and that nothing can
							have a purpose that does not include him in its scope, will not find an answer to the
							query; and should remember that ere man grew out of savagery the earth rang again with
							song and sound.</p>
						<p>"But to the mind of the naturalist, trained in deciphering Nature's hieroglyphs, the
							chattering songs is very plainly inspired by love. The male Katydid doubtless feels
							something of the same satisfaction in playing to his companions, and especially to
							Katy, <pb id="VAB8231-457" n="456"/> as a prima donna does in singing to an audience.
							There is a pleasure in the act which is the outcome of its being; and the fact that
							the males are principally the players, shows that the gift is not only a source of
							pleasure, but one of much importance to the species; for the rivalry among the males
							is as great as among higher animals, and a good instrument becomes, in this light,
							most important to the individual and to the species. The best player wins his coveted
							love, while the feeble and the cripples stand no chance to impair the vigor of the
							race."</p>
						<p>While only the males are musicians, both sexes of the winged forms are provided with
							supposed auditory organs or ears. These, when present, are similar in structure and
							position to those of the cricket, being oblong or oval cavities covered with a
							transparent or whitish membrane, known as the drum or tympanum, and situated one on
							each front leg, near the basal end of the tibiæ. The drum is a thin, tense membrane
							covering a network of nerves, ganglion cells and auditory rods. In all the wingless
							Tettigoniidæ the stridulating organs are necessarily absent and as the insect can make
							no sound, it has no use for ears and these are also absent. This is taken as strong
							evidence that the cavity on the fore leg is in reality an auditory organ, which is
							denied by <bibl>Forel (1887)</bibl> and some other writers, who believe that all
							insects are deaf with no special organs of hearing, but that sounds are heard or
							appreciated by their tactile organs.</p>
						<p>The color of each species of Tettigoniidæ is, as in most Orthoptera, admirably
							adapted to its usual surroundings. The winged forms, as the katydids and cone-headed
							grasshoppers, live amidst the foliage of trees or clumps of grass, and are therefore a
							nearly uniform bright green, while the wingless forms, which dwell in caves or hollow
							trees and beneath rocks and logs are, for the most part, gray or brown in hue. Our
							larger species, with wings fully developed, use them as their principal means of
							travel, their slender hind legs being used only to give themselves an upward impetus
							at the beginning of flight.</p>
						<p>In both the northern and southern states the members of this family winter chiefly in
							the egg stage, the eggs being laid in grasses, reeds, galls on willow, stems of
							plants, bark of trees and shrubs and even between the upper and lower layers of
							leaves, the ovipositor being especially adapted for this method of egg deposition. In
							southern Florida some of the species pass the winter, in part at least, as nymphs, or
							even as adults, but the number of both species and individuals then there found is far
							less numerous than of the Acrididæ. The young of the Tettigoniidæ, like <pb
								id="VAB8231-458" n="457"/> those of the other families of Orthoptera, when hatched
							from the egg resemble the adults in form but are wholly wingless. As they increase in
							size they moult or shed the skin five times, the wings each time becoming more
							apparent, until after the fifth moult, when they appear fully developed, and the
							insect is mature or full grown, never increasing in size thereafter. Throughout their
							entire lives they are active feeders, mostly herbivorous in habit, and when present in
							numbers necessarily do much harm to growing vegetation. Most of the species can be
							easily reared from the young nymphs, their successive moults being of much interest.
							They may be fed on lettuce and it is said that some of the larger species will eat
							flies and other soft-bodied insects. The males are very pugnacious, and often try to
							devour one another, so that they should be kept apart.</p>
						<p>The species of Tettigoniidæ occurring in the United States are distributed among
							eight subfamilies, seven of which are represented in the eastern states.</p>

							<p>The species of this subfamily are among the largest of our winged Tettigoniidæ,
								and, with those of the Pseudophyllinæ, are commonly known as "Katydids." The name
								Phaneropterinæ is based upon the typical old world genus, <hi rend="i"
									>Phaneroptera</hi> Serv., meaning, "visible wing," and refers to the exposed tips
								of the inner wings which extend beyond the tegmina in repose. They all agree in
								having the head short, face vertical, or nearly so; vertex varying greatly in width,
								the fastigium either ending in a blunt deflexed spine or broadly rounded, never
								projected in front of eyes as a cone or sharp spine; eyes small, variable in form,
								situated close to and at the side of basal joint of antennæ; pronotum short, its
								disk flat or concave, more or less narrowed in front, usually meeting at right
								angles the perpendicular lateral lobes, its posterior lobe prolonged distinctly
								behind them with usually a wide, deep humeral sinus or emargination at the junction;
								median carina wanting or very faint, lateral ones more or less distinct, hind margin
								broadly rounded, rarely (<hi rend="i">Arethæa</hi>) obtuse-angled; lateral lobes
								flat, their hind margin and lower posterior angle broadly rounded; lower margin
								rounded or sinuous, front margin variable; tegmina as described in key, usually a
								bright uniform green in color; wings long and strong, folded like a fan; meso- and
								metasterna broadly lobed along their median line; legs variable <pb id="VAB8231-460"
									n="459"/> in length as to genus, the front and middle ones always much shorter
								than the hind pair; ovipositor and male genitalia variable as to genus.</p>
							<p>These "round-headed" and "bush katydids" are mostly arboreal in habitat, the great
								majority of them passing their entire lives on shrubs and trees, where they feed
								upon the leaves and tender twigs, and, when present in numbers, often do much
								injury. The color and form of their wings serve admirably to protect them against
								their worst foes, the birds; and as they live a solitary life, i. e., do not flock
								together in numbers as do the green or meadow-grasshoppers, they are but seldom
								noticed by man. Their love calls, or songs, however, make the welkin ring at night
								from mid-July until after heavy frost, and though but one or two of the species make
								a note in any way resembling the syllables "katy did, she did," yet all are
								accredited with this sound by the casual observer, and hence the common name usually
								given to the members of this subfamily. Their call is seldom made by day for the
								obvious reason that it might attract the attention of the birds and so lead to the
								destruction of the songster. As twilight approaches, however, the male of each
								species begins his peculiar note, which is often kept up with little or no
								intermission until the approach of day warns him that his feathered enemies will
								soon be on the alert, and that silence will be, for a time, the best policy to
								pursue.</p>
							<p>From the other Locustidæ, these katydids differ widely in their habits of
								oviposition. The eggs are rarely deposited in the earth or in twigs, but are either
								glued fast in double rows to the outer surface of slender twigs, or are inserted in
								the edges of leaves. On account of this method of oviposition, the ovipositors of
								the katydids are broader, more curved, and more obtuse at the end than in the other
								subfamilies, whose members oviposit in the earth, in rotten wood or in sterns of
								grass.</p>
							<p>The subfamily is represented in the eastern states by eight genera, the principal
								literature treating especially of their species being as follows: <bibl>Riley,
									1874</bibl>; <bibl>Brunner, 1878</bibl>; <bibl>Scudder, 1893, 1898</bibl>;

								<p>Greenport, Long Island, N. Y., Aug. 3; taken at light (<hi rend="i">Davis</hi>).
									A very scarce species wherever found, its known range extending from Norway,
									Maine, to West Point, Nebraska, and south to Vineland, N. Jer. The male was
									figured by <bibl>Lugger (1898, 221)</bibl> as that of <hi rend="i">Scudderia
										pistillata</hi> Brunner, and therefore doubtless occurs in Minnesota, though not
									definetely recorded by him. The figure from Lugger's work was also carelessly used
									by me (1903, 347) as that of the male of <hi rend="i">pistillata</hi>. The species
									is not known from Indiana, though it probably occurs about peat bogs in the
									Transition Zone of the northern third of the State. It is not recorded from Canada
									or Michigan, though a specimen from Lone Rock, Wis., is in the U. S. Nat. Museum.
									The few specimens in collections throughout the eastern states have mostly been
									taken from undergrowth in woods. The <hi rend="i">S. truncata</hi>
									<bibl>Beutenmfiller (1894a, 252)</bibl> is a synonym.</p>

									<item>Size large for the genus. Tegmina, wings and legs bright grass green, body
										and face tinged with yellow, pale clay-yellow in dried specimens. Pronotum much
										longer than broad, narrower in front than behind, usually with a yellowish line
										along the lateral carinæ. Hind femora very slender, armed beneath on inner
										carina with three or four minute spines. Male genitalia as described in key.
										Length of body, ♂, 21--25, ♀, 24--28; of pronotum, ♂ and ♀, 5.5--6.5; of

										26--30, ♀, 27--32; of ovipositor, 7--8 mm. Width of tegmina, 6.3--8.5 mm. (Plate
										I.)</item>
								</list>

								<p>This large, narrow-winged species is, in Indiana, one of the most abundant of the
									bush-katydids, occurring everywhere throughout the State, but is much less common
									in the southern counties, where it probably reaches maturity about July 15. The
									earliest date on which adults have been taken was July 22, in Putnam County. This
									insect is probably less arboreal than any other species of katydid, as it is often
									found clinging to the tall, coarse grasses and sedges which grow near the borders
									of lakes and ponds and in damp ravines, and to the coarse weeds along the margins
									of prairies and meadows. When approached it flies rapidly in a zigzag, noiseless
									manner for a long distance to another clump of grass or weeds, or to the lower
									branches of an oak, a tree in which it delights to dwell.</p>
								<p>Aside from Indiana specimens others are at hand from North Madison, Conn., ,and
									Lake City, Gainesville, Dunedin and Ft. Myers, Fla. The two males from Lake City
									are very much smaller <pb id="VAB8231-467" n="466"/>. with distinctly narrower
									tegmina than those from the north, the length of body being but 18 and of tegmina
									but 28 mm., while the greatest width of tegmina is less than 1 mm. more than the
									length of pronotum. About Dunedin the nymphs are frequent from Jan. 15 to April
									10, but the only adults seen were taken on October 31 and December 18. There it
									occurs on grasses and sedges about the borders of low places in pine woods, along
									railway embankments and in old abandoned fields. It has been recorded from
									numerous localities throughout Florida, adults having been taken at Miami in
									January and at LaBelle and Marco in April.</p>
								<p>Until 1898 <hi rend="i">S. texensis</hi> was confused by most American collectors
									with <hi rend="i">S. curvicauda</hi>, and many of the older records of the latter
									species refer to the former. The specific name given the species by Saussure and
									Pictet was an ill-fitting one, as it ranges from New England and Ontario west to
									Montana and Wyoming and south to southern Florida and western Texas, being
									everywhere found in suitable habitats within the bounds of the area mentioned.
										<bibl>Walker (1904a, 325)</bibl> states that it is "quite common in southwestern
									Ontario, but seems to be confined to that part of the province." <bibl>R. &amp; H.
										(1914a, 295)</bibl> mention it as "one of the very few destructive
									Phaneropterids found in the United States, doing particular damage to cranberry
									crops. In New Jersey it has been frequently observed along the salt marshes where,
									after dark, it would be found locally abundant in areas of <hi rend="i"
										>Scirpus</hi>, resting head down and motionless near the tips of these rushes
									and frequently beaded with dew. On bright warm afternoons it was observed in the
									taller vegetation near the border of the salt marshes, where the males were moving
									actively about emitting their rather prolonged and harsh stridulation."</p>

								<p>Of the notes of <hi rend="i">S. texensis</hi>
									<bibl>Allard (1911, 30)</bibl> says: <q rend="blockquote">
										<p>"I have heard two distinct methods of stridulation produced at will by this
												<hi rend="i">Scudderia</hi>. The usual note heard from Massachusetts to
											Georgia is a soft <hi rend="i">sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh</hi>, occasionally repeated.
											This note is produced by a rapid shuffling of the wings very briefly. At other
											times and much more rarely the call consists of a succession of sharp, keen,
											distinct rasping notes slowly delivered, <hi rend="i"
											>zeet-zeet-zeet-zeet</hi>. These notes, which are so unlike the usual call,
											are usually at once answered in a similar manner by another individual
											elsewhere. One is at first tempted to assign them to some other insect. By
											creeping carefully toward the musician, the writer has watched this mode of
											stridulation close at hand. The tegmina are very slowly and deliberately
											opened and rasped upon each other slowly several times. These notes are really
											more in keeping with the incisive notes of other <hi rend="i">Scudderias</hi>
											and it is evident that they are not accidental. They probably convey some
											definite meaning to other individuals within earshot. <hi rend="i">S.
												texensis</hi>
											<pb id="VAB8231-468" n="467"/> becomes noisy as soon as the afternoon sun gets
											low, and continues to stridulate into the evening. These katydids sometimes
											congregate in small colonies of half a dozen or more in favorite spots. It is
											a persistent singer, though its notes are delivered at rather rare, irregular
											and infrequent intervals, a characteristic of most species of <hi rend="i"
												>Scudderia</hi>."</p>
									</q></p>

								<p>The eggs of <hi rend="i">texensis</hi> are laid in the edges of leaves between
									the upper and lower epidermis, and at first are so thin that they are not
									noticeable except when the leaf is held between one's self and the light. They are
									loosely inserted in these pockets made by the ovipositor of the mother, and as
									they swell in coming in contact with the ruptured tissues of the plant, they are
									held tightly in place. In the northern states the winter of this, as well as of
									the other species of the genus, is passed in the egg stage, the young appearing
									about the last of April.</p>

								<p>This is apparently a scarce insect in Indiana, having been taken in small numbers
									only about the peat bogs and borders of lakes in Steuben, Fulton and Kosciusko
									counties; Aug. 13--Oct. 7. Specimens are at hand from the White Mountains, N. H.,
									Sherborn, Mass., DeGrassi Point, Ont., and Tecumseh, Mich., July 25--Sept. 3. It
									is a species of northern range, its known distribution extending from Nova Scotia
									and New England north and west to Fort Williams, Ont., Regina, Sask., and Bozeman,
									Mont., and south and west to Monterey and Bolar, Va., southern Illinois and
									northeastern Nebraska.</p>
								<p><bibl>Piers (1896)</bibl> has given an interesting account of <hi rend="i"
										>pistillata</hi> as it occurs in Nova Scotia as follows: <q rend="blockquote">
										<p>"This handsome katydid is very common about Halifax. It is found upon the
											foliage of bushes, chiefly alders, in or near swampy places. Although
											plentiful, its protective similitude to a leaf, both in color and form, and
											its usual slow movements, make it very difficult to detect. Usually it can be
											readily captured with the fingers while it clings to a leaf. <pb
												id="VAB8231-469" n="468"/> Occasionally, on a near approach to the bush upon
											which it rests, it will drop suddenly a foot or two to a branch beneath.</p>
										<p>"Attention is chiefly directed to it by the loud stridulation of the males at
											nightfall. During the day they are usually silent, or at rare intervals
											produce a short sharp <hi rend="i">zip</hi>. After dark, however, they make
											the swamp resound with their loud calls, and we then become aware of their
											abundance. On close examination at such a time the males--usually only one on
											each bush-may be seen walking very slowly over the leaves and twigs.
											Occasionally they suddenly slightly lift and part the wing covers and close
											them again, thereby producing a sharp <hi rend="i">zip</hi> or <hi rend="i"
												>crick</hi>, this being their usual day note. After making this sound at
											irregular intervals for some time, the tegmina are opened to a greater extent,
											and are then again closed, producing a long-drawn, exceedingly loud <hi
												rend="i">cr-r-r-r-r-ick,</hi> which is repeated in couplets several times in
											succession. This challenging cry is immediately answered by one after another
											of its neighboring fellows, until numbers are rasping out their ear-piercing
											notes, as notable a rural chorus as that of the tree toads."</p>
									</q></p>

								<p><bibl>Walker (1904a, 327)</bibl> states that <hi rend="i">pistillata</hi> is much
									more abundant in northern than in southern Ontario, being "common on bushes, tall
									herbs and grass on the borders of low woods and along fence rows." Hebard says
									that at Pequaming, Mich.: "I heard the first katydid about August 12, and as <hi
										rend="i">pistillata</hi> is the only large Locustid found in this region, I knew
									what species was producing the sound. Before this date there was no insect which
									made a loud noise at night. Now in the evenings <hi rend="i"
										>'zikk-zikk-zikk-zikk'--'zikk-zikk, zikk, zikk'</hi> could often be heard. A
									week later they were plentiful and in the meadows and pastures their daytime note
									of <hi rend="i">'zikk'</hi> was to be heard on all sides. Having found that they
									preferred the tops of bushes where they could sun themselves, eat and stridulate,
									I found them easy to capture, for, approaching cautiously, one could usually get
									within a few feet of the musician before it took alarm and ceased its music."</p>
								<p><bibl>Fox (1917)</bibl> states that "at Monterey, Va., <hi rend="i"
										>pistillate</hi> was found in briers and low shrubbery on dry stony mountain
									slopes close to the woods covering the summit where it was associated with <hi
										rend="i">S. furcata</hi>. At Bolar it occurred in the tall herbage of an old
									meadow in the intermontane valley. This is, I believe, the most southern authentic
									record of this species." <bibl>Saussure &amp; Pictet (1897, 332)</bibl> record <hi
										rend="i">pistillata</hi> from Georgia. Scudder says this record is "surprising,"
									and <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1914a, 280)</bibl> say "this locality is certainly an
									error, as the insect is not known to occur in the Appalachians south of northern
									Pennsylvania." Since they wrote Fox has found it in Virginia and S. &amp; P. were
									probably correct in their record.</p>

								<p>This, the most robust of our northern species of <hi rend="i">Scudderia</hi>,
									probably occurs in all portions of Indiana, but is apparently less common than <hi
										rend="i">texensis</hi>, especially in the southern counties. It is abundant
									about the marshy meadows bordering some of the lakes and tamarack swamps of
									northern Indiana. The earliest date on which a mature specimen was taken was July
									10 in Knox Co. In autumn I have, for several years, found both it and <hi rend="i"
										>texensis</hi> present in numbers in company with <hi rend="i">Mecostethus
										lineatus</hi> and <hi rend="i">Chorthippus curtipennis</hi> in a muck meadow
									forming part of a long narrow swamp five miles northeast of Indianapolis. The two
									katydids are so similar in appearance and habits of flight that they cannot be
									told apart in the field, but when closely examined are easily separated by the
									characters given in the key. As already noted, the earlier records of this species
									were largely based on specimens of <hi rend="i">texensis</hi>, both Bruner and
									Scudder for many years confusing the two. The <hi rend="i">S. curvicauda</hi> of
									my first work on the family (1893, 99) should be referred to <hi rend="i"
										>texensis</hi> and the <hi rend="i">S. furculata</hi> (p. 100) to <hi rend="i"
										>curvicauda</hi>. The <hi rend="i">Phaneroptera angustipennis</hi>
									<bibl>Harris (1841, 129)</bibl> is also a synonym of <hi rend="i"
									>curvicauda</hi>.</p>
								<p>The known range of <hi rend="i">S. curvicauda</hi>, as here recognized, extends
									from Maine and Nova Scotia north and northwest to the Severn River, Ont., and
									Aweme, Man., and south and west to New Jersey, Virginia, Tennessee and Nebraska.
									The species varies much in size and appearance, <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1914a,
										281)</bibl> separating the smaller northern individuals under the name <hi
										rend="i">S. c. borealis</hi>. The characters which they give in their key are
									comparative only, being "size small, form compact; tegmina rather broad and
									short," and in their original description they give not a single fixed <pb
										id="VAB8231-471" n="470"/> character of differential value. No one can
									satisfactorily separate a species, or even a race based on such a diagnosis, and
									as specimens at hand taken by Gooderham in Nova Scotia and Quebec show that the
									structural characters of the genital organs are precisely the same, I regard their
									name no more necessary than would be one for the small narrow-winged individuals
									of <hi rend="i">texensis</hi> recorded above from Florida. In the southern and
									southwestern states <hi rend="i">S. curvicauda</hi> merges with a form, the <hi
										rend="i">S. laticauda</hi> Brunner, which has some definite structural
									characters which are evident and which probably represent a valid race.</p>
								<p>The more recent records of <hi rend="i">curvicauda</hi>, which can be relied upon
									as belonging to that species, show that in the east and north it is more arboreal
									than in Indiana. <bibl>Walker (1904a, 326)</bibl> states that his Toronto
									specimens all came from trees and bushes in more or less open, partly wooded
									country. In Pennsylvania <bibl>Fox (1914, 518)</bibl> found <hi rend="i">S.
										curvicauda</hi> to be "essentially a sylvan species frequenting the trees and
									underbrush of both dry and moist woodlands, less frequent in the border thickets
									of open meadowlands," while about Tappahannock, Va., the few examples taken were
									found in bushes and briery thickets in the vicinity of woodland. <bibl>R. &amp; H.
										(1914a, 284)</bibl> state that the species is "common and widely distributed
									through the undergrowth of the woods in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey; in this
									region <hi rend="i">S. texensis</hi> is also common, but is found only in marshes,
									swamps or bogs."</p>

								</figure>
								<p><bibl>Scudder (1893)</bibl> has set the day and night songs of <hi rend="i">S.
										curvicauda</hi> to scale, and has given a pleasing account of their notes as
									follows: <q type="blockquote">
										<p>"It is more noisy by night than by day; and the songs differ considerably at
											these two times. The day song is given only during sunshine, the other by
											night and in cloudy weather. I first noticed this while watching one of the
											little creatures close beside me; as a cloud passed over the sun he suddenly
											changed his note to one with which I was already familiar, <pb
												id="VAB8231-472" n="471"/> but without knowing to what insect it belonged.
											At the same time all the individuals around me, whose similar day song I had
											heard, began to respond with the night cry; the cloud passed away, and the
											original note was resumed on all sides. Judging that they preferred the night
											song to that of the day, from their increased stridulation during the former
											period, I imitated the night song during the sunshine, and obtained an
											immediate response in the same language. The experiment proved that the
											insects could hear as well as sing. * * * The note by day is <hi rend="i"
												>bzrwi</hi> and lasts for one-third of a second. The night song consists of
											a repetition, ordinarily eight times, of a note which sounds like <hi rend="i"
												>tchw</hi>. It is repeated at the rate of five times in three-quarters of a
											second, making each note half the length of the day note."</p>

								<p>This fork-tailed katydid occurs in all portions of Indiana, having been taken in
									every county where collections have been made. In the hilly regions of the
									southern counties it is very common and practically the only species of <hi
										rend="i">Scudderia</hi> noted, <hi rend="i">texensis</hi> and <hi rend="i"
										>curvicauda</hi> occurring about the marshes of the more level country. In
									central and southern Indiana the first mature specimens of <hi rend="i"
										>furata</hi> appear about July 15, but they do not become plentiful before the
									first of August, and I have seen the nymphs in Vigo Co. as late as September 18.
									It is most frequently seen on the low <pb id="VAB8231-474" n="473"/> bushes and
									trees about the margins of thickets and along fence rows, but in the prairie
									country north it frequents coarse grasses and weeds in company with the other
									species. Its flight is noiseless, seemingly without definite direction, and is not
									so prolonged as that of <hi rend="i">S. texensis</hi>.</p>
								<p>This is the most widely distributed and abundant species of the genus, ranging
									from Maine, Nova Scotia and Quebec north and west to North Bay, Ont., British
									Columbia and the Pacific coast, and south and west to central Florida, the Gulf
									coast of Texas, and central California. In a part of its southwestern range it
									intergrades with the race or variety <hi rend="i">S. f. furcifera</hi> Scudder,
									full details of the distribution of both forms being given by <bibl>R. &amp; H.
										(1914a)</bibl>. In Florida it has been recorded definitely only from
									Jacksonville, Monticello, Pensacola, Gainesville, LaGrange and Lakeland, the last
									being its most southerly known station in the State.</p>
								<p><bibl>Walker (1904a, 328)</bibl> says: "It seems to be quite generally
									distributed throughout Ontario as far north as Lake Nipissing, but is commoner in
									the southern part. It frequents trees and bushes about the edges of woods and
									thickets on both dry and marshy ground, but most often on the latter. I have also
									taken it at Agassiz, B. C., where it was common on September 9." In Michigan it
									appears to be scarce, having been definitely recorded only from Huron Co. by
									Shull. <bibl>Bruner (1893a)</bibl> mentions it as found in the middle and southern
									districts of Nebraska, but less common than <hi rend="i">curvicauda</hi>. The <hi

									<bibl>Beut. (1894a, 251)</bibl> is a synonym.</p>
								<p><bibl>C. V. Riley (1874, 169)</bibl>, under the name of <hi rend="i">S.
										curvicauda</hi>, gives the following account of the egg-laying habits and call
									note of <hi rend="i">furcata</hi>; his figure 51 showing beyond doubt that the
									latter species was the one to which he referred: <q type="blockquote">
										<p>"The female stations herself firmly by the middle and hind legs on twigs or
											leaves contiguous to the one selected to receive the eggs. This leaf is then
											grasped by the front feet and held in a vertical position, while the edge is
											slightly gnawed or pared off by the jaws to facilitate the entrance of the
											point of the ovipositor. When this is done the abdomen is curved under and
											brought foward, and the ovipositor is seized on its convex edge by the
											mandibles and maxillæ, which, with the aid of the palpi, guide the point to
											that portion of the leaf prepared to receive it. After gentle, but repeated
											efforts, the point of the instrument is finally inserted between the tissues
											of the leaf, and gradually pushed in to more than half its length. As soon as
											the cavity is formed, the egg is extruded, and passed slowly between the
											semi-transparent blades of the ovipositor. As the egg leaves the ovipositor
											the latter is gradually withdrawn, while the egg <pb id="VAB8231-475" n="474"
											/> remains in the leaf, retained in place, probably, by a viscid fluid that is
											exuded with it. As many as five of the eggs are sometimes deposited in one row
											in the same leaf, but more often they are single.</p>
										<p>"The shrill of the male is by no means so loud as that of the oblong-winged
											katydid, <hi rend="i">Amblycorypha oblongifolia</hi> (DeGeer), in which its
											sound is always drowned in the woods. It consists of a softer zeep, zeep,
											sometimes uttered singly, but generally thrice in succession. The call is
											occasionally responded to by a faint chirp from the females, produced by
											stretching out their wings as if for flight, and is as often heard in the day
											as at night."</p>

								<p>The oblong-winged katydid is a frequent insect throughout Indiana, becoming
									mature in the southern part about July 20, and in the northern counties probably a
									fortnight later. It occurs for the most part on shrubbery and flowers of
									golden-rod and other Composite along fence rows and edges of thickets and woods,
									especially in damp localities; and when flushed flies with a kind of whirring
									noise, alighting on fence or the lower branch of tree. I have often located the
									male by its note, which to me is a creaking squawk--like the noise made by drawing
									a fine-toothed comb over a taut string. It is usually but once repeated, though
									sometimes three times. On several occasions it has been made after the insect was
									in my fingers.</p>

								<p>A number of pink specimens have been taken from low meadows near Bass Lake,
									Starke County. The causes which produce this curious "sport," by which a
									grass-green is changed to a delicate pink, are, as yet, unknown. Scudder has said
									that "one thinks at once of autumn leaves and their change from green to red and
									notices that these pink katydids all occur in the autumn." In Indiana the pink
									specimens have been taken in early August, long before frost and before any
									noticeable change in the surrounding vegetation.</p>
								<p>Several of the species of <hi rend="i">Amblycorypha</hi> are known to occur
									occasionally in the pink form, which appear much more frequent in this genus than
									in any other of the Tettigoniidæ. <bibl>Wheeler (1907)</bibl>, <bibl>Knab
										(1907)</bibl>, <bibl>Hancock (1916)</bibl> and other authors have published
									interesting papers on the subject of pink katydids. Hancock succeeded in rearing a
									family of a cross between a pink female and a green male of <hi rend="i"
										>oblongifolia</hi>. He found that the eggs of this species are laid in the
									ground and require two to three years to hatch. Of the 13 young, nine were pink
									and four green, the color remaining practically the same throughout their lives.
									He concludes, as did Wheeler, that the pink color, as well as the green, is
									hereditary, the pinkness therefore being congenital or germinal in character and
									not the result of conditions of environment.</p>
								<p>The known range of typical <hi rend="i">oblongifolia</hi> is from New England and
									Montreal west to southwestern Ontario, Michigan, Minnesota <pb id="VAB8231-480"
										n="479"/> and Colorado, and south and southwest to Maryland, North Carolina,
									Alabama, Louisiana and Texas. In the southern coastwise states it is replaced by
									the nominal race or variety, <hi rend="i">A. o. floridana</hi> R. &amp; H. In
									Ontario <bibl>Walker (1904a, 329)</bibl> states that it is rare about Toronto, but
									common from Hamilton westward to the St. Clair River, occurring for the most part
									on shrubs and tall weeds. The note of the male, he says, "is very harsh and
									scraping in character and is usually of about three-fifths of a second's duration.
									At a little distance it sounds something like <hi rend="i">'kizizik.'</hi> I have
									heard it at night and in the afternoon while the sun was still shining."</p>
								<p><bibl>Lugger (1898, 223)</bibl> states that both <hi rend="i">A.
										oblongifolia</hi> and <hi rend="i">rotundifolia</hi> occur abundantly in
									Minnesota, frequenting bushes and tall weeds in low places. Both appear to be
									scarce in Michigan, Hubbell (Ms.) listing <hi rend="i">oblongifolia</hi> only from
									Wayne, Ingham and Jackson counties, and <hi rend="i">rotundifolia</hi> from
									Washtenaw Co. About Moline, Ill., <bibl>McNeill (1891)</bibl> found <hi rend="i"
										>oblongifolia</hi> more common in the vicinity of houses than the species of <hi
										rend="i">Scudderia</hi>, and states that its note is "a quick shuffling sound

									evening, but much more rarely than does <hi rend="i">S. curvicauda</hi>."</p>
								<p><bibl>Hancock (1916)</bibl> has given an account of the egg-laying habits of <hi
										rend="i">oblongifolia</hi> as follows: <q rend="blockquote">
										<p>"When ready to oviposit the female comes down to the ground from the
											vegetation which she frequents. She then searches about on the ground, often
											among the dead leaves, to find a suitable place to deposit her eggs. She does

											nibbling the surface 'as if testing a suitable place. At times she appears to
											be quite exacting in her choice of location, one of these requisites being a
											certain amount of dampness of soil, as well as certain surface conditions.
											When she finds a suitable spot, she curves her abdomen, which is now distended
											with eggs, forward underneath her body and at the same time seizes the end of
											the large ovipositor in her mandibles. In this way she directs its point to
											the desired place in the ground. Then she forces or drills a hole in the earth
											for the reception of each egg or cluster of eggs. Sometimes they are laid at
											such a shallow depth in the ground that the rains splash away the dirt
											covering, fully exposing them to the air."</p>

								<p>The original description of this form was prefaced thus: "Allied to <hi rend="i"
										>A. oblongifolia</hi> but differing in the straighter ovipositor and less
									angulate angles of disk of pronotum." Later (1907, 301) R. &amp; H. say: "The less
									curved form and rather smaller size of the ovipositor will serve to separate the
									female of <hi rend="i">floridana</hi> from that of <hi rend="i">oblongifolia</hi>,
									while in the male the tympanum is distinctly narrower, both actually and
									proportionally, than in <hi rend="i">oblongifolia</hi>. The lateral angles of the
									disk of the pronotum are as a rule by no means as sharply rectangulate as in <hi
										rend="i">oblongifolia</hi> and the disk is broader caudad in the latter species.
									From the evidence in hand it appears that <hi rend="i">floridana</hi> represents
									the southern extreme of <hi rend="i">oblongifolia</hi>, specimens from
									Thomasville, Ga., being as near <hi rend="i">floridana</hi> as <hi rend="i"
										>oblongifolia</hi>." Still later (1914b, 322) they state that the Thomasville
									specimens connect "true <hi rend="i">floridana</hi> with a northern sub-species
										(<hi rend="i">S. f. carinata</hi>) of the same stock, which in its turn is
									perfectly distinct from <hi rend="i">oblongifolia</hi>."</p>
								<p>All of the differences which they give, both in descriptions and keys, separating
									the three forms, are comparative only, and readily come within the limits of
									variation of a single species over a wide extent of territory. The lateral carinæ
									of northern and eastern <hi rend="i">oblongifolia</hi> are always rounded on the
									prozona, and vary greatly in continuity, in the majority of Indiana specimens
									being wanting on the apical third or fourth of pronotum, where the disk is rounded
									directly into the sides. The disk of pronotum is also variable in length and
									divergence and the ovipositor in length and degree of curvature. While extremes of
									the three forms are obviously different, I regard both <hi rend="i">floridana</hi>
									and <hi rend="i">carinata</hi> as varieties <pb id="VAB8231-482" n="481"/> of <hi
										rend="i">oblongifolia</hi>, as no permanent fixed characters separating them
									have as yet been pointed out.</p>
								<p>About Dunedin, Fla., nymphs of <hi rend="i">S. o. floridana</hi> are frequent
									from February 1 to April 15, but the adults have been taken only in October. It
									occurs in the tall grasses about the margins of brackish marshes and on weeds in
									low wet places in pine woods. During the summer and autumn months this appears to
									be a common katydid throughout Florida, having been recorded from numerous
									localities by other collectors. At Homestead it was found by <bibl>R. &amp; H.
										(1914c, 399)</bibl> "on the prairie-like everglades, where they were scarce in
									the day time, but plentiful at night, perched on the grasses, stridulating
									fearlessly. Their note is an indescribable buzz and click."</p>
								<p>The range of this southern form is given by <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1914b, 322)</bibl>
									as "extending from Big Pine Key and Detroit, south Florida, as far north typically
									as Jacksonville, Fernandina and Atlantic Beach, westward as far as eastern Texas,
									intergrading in the Atlantic Coast region, at least, into the northern subspecies

								<p>This is the <hi rend="i">M. laurifolium</hi> of my previous work (1903, 354) and

										rend="i">laurifolium</hi> rightfully belongs to a tropiical species of <hi
										rend="i">Stilpnochlora. M. rhombifolium</hi> is the largest of our northern
									katydids and is frequent throughout the southern half of Indiana, but has not been
									noted north of Lafayette, where <bibl>Fox (1915)</bibl> says it "appears to be
									common since its notes were heard continuously throughout late July and August."
									In the country it is most commonly called "the katydid," and the note of the
									broad-winged katydid, <hi rend="i">Pterophylla camellifolia</hi> (Fab.) is usually
									attributed to it, but its true note may be represented "by the syllable 'tic,'
									repeated from eight to 20 times at the rate of about four to the second." However,
										<hi rend="i">M. rhombifolium</hi> is probably less common in Indiana than the
									broad-winged katydid, with which it is confused. As it frequents low bushes and
									other shrubbery it is more often seen, the true katydid being commonly found in
									the taller trees. It is often attracted to light and in Indianapolis numerous
									examples have been found on porches and in the gutters beneath electric lights. In
									movement <hi rend="i">M. rhombifolium</hi> is very sluggish, seldom taking to
									flight when approached and readily picked up by the fingers. It probably occurs in
									small numbers in all parts of the State.</p>

								<p>About Dunedin, Fla., adults of <hi rend="i">rhombifolium</hi> have been taken
									from November to April, but are very scarce. The nymphs in all stages are,
									however, frequent during the winter and often taken by sweeping. It occurs
									throughout Florida and on the southern keys, adults being recorded from numerous
									localities and in nearly every month of the year. At Miami it was noted by
										<bibl>Hebard (1915b)</bibl> to be "not uncommon in early March about the town on
									trees and shrubbery, as could be determined on warm evenings by the frequently
									heard stridulations. On nights when the temperature fell at dusk below 65° all
									Orthopteron stridulations ceased."</p>
								<p>The known range of <hi rend="i">rhombifolium</hi> extends from Staten and Long

									southwestern Texas, Arizona and Claremont, California. From the west and northwest
									the published records are few for so widely a distributed species and are mostly
									under the name <hi rend="i">M. laurifolium</hi> (Linn.). <bibl>Scudder (1862,
										447)</bibl> gave Massachusetts as one of the localities of his <hi rend="i">M.
										affiliatum</hi>, a synonym of <hi rend="i">rhombifolium</hi>, and <bibl>S. I.
										Smith (1873, 357)</bibl> mentions it from Connecticut, but no definite
									localities were given and no other New England records can be found. It is not
									mentioned in either of the Iowa lists, nor is a definite locality recorded from
									Michigan. Garman says it is "common everywhere in Kentucky on black locust and
									other trees." Lugger records it only from Winona, Minn., and Bruner, as occurring
									only in eastern Nebraska south of the Platte River. From New Jersey south and
									southwest the records are more numerous, especially those from Georgia and
									Florida. <bibl>J. Smith (1910, 187)</bibl> states that it occurs throughout New
									Jersey, and <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1916, 256)</bibl> give numerous records between
									there and central Georgia, as do they and other authors from Georgia, southwest to
									California. At Claremont in the latter State <bibl>Baker (1905, 78)</bibl> found
									it common among the orange trees, and one of his specimens is at hand.</p>
								<p>The eggs of <hi rend="i">M. laurifolium</hi> are usually glued in double rows on
									the sides of slender twigs, which have been previously roughened with the jaws and
									otherwise prepared for a place of deposit. The two rows are contiguous and the
									eggs of one alternate with those of the other. Those of the same row overlap about
									one-fourth their length. They are of a grayish brown color, long oval in shape,
									very flat, and measure 5.5x3 mm. They are usually deposited in September, hatch
									the following May, and the young, in central Indiana, reach maturity during the
									first half of August. These eggs have, on a number of occasions, been brought to

									different songs, or varies the same song in time or extent of utterance, so that
									unless the same individual is listened to for some time, the notes might be
									attributed to different species."</p>
								<p><bibl>Riley (1874, 155)</bibl>, as his figures show, confused <hi rend="i">M.
										rhombifolium</hi> also with <hi rend="i">M. retinerve</hi> (Burm.) and under the
									latter name gave a full account of the habits of <hi rend="i">rhombifolium</hi>
									from which I quote as follows: <q rend="blockquote">
										<p>"The females commence to oviposit early in September, and continue to lay at
											intervals until the first severe frost. The eggs are occasionally deposited
											during the day, but the operation usually takes place at night. The number of
											eggs laid at one time varies from two to 30, the first batches containing more
											than those deposited later in the season. Each female produces from 150 to
											200, or perhaps more, and I have known them to lay on the edge of a leaf, or
											of a piano-cover, or along a piece of cord.</p>
										<p>"These eggs are rather flat when laid, but become more swollen, so that they
											have a narrower look as they approach the hatching period in spring. During
											the early part of May, the embryo larva--which lies straight in its egg,
											completely filling it, with the legs bent up as in a pupa, and the long
											antennæ curling around them--attains its full development, and after hours of
											tedious contracting and expanding movements, manages to burst the egg open at
											its top or exposed end, along the narrow edge, and generally about half way
											down. Through this opening young Katy slowly emerges, undergoing a moult
											during the process, and leaving its first skin, in a crumpled white mass,
											attached to the empty bivalvular egg shell. Including hind legs and antennæ it
											measures at this time, rather more than an inch in length, the body alone
											being one-eighth of an inch long; and in contemplating it, one can not but
											wonder how the long, stiff legs and great length of antennæ, together with the
											plump body, could so recently have been compressed into the comparatively
											small shell to which we see it clinging.</p>
										<p>"In from ten to twenty minutes after hatching, these little beings essay
											their first leaps, and soon begin to eat with avidity. They feed with almost
											equal relish upon a great variety of foliage, but I have found that when
											reared upon very succulent leaves, such as lettuce, cabbage, purslain and the
											like, they are less hardy, and do not attain so great an age as when nourished
											upon more ligneous food, as the leaves of oak, apple or cherry.</p>
										<p>"The first notes of this katydid are heard about the middle of July, and the
											species is in full song by the first of August. The wing covers are partially
											opened by a sudden jerk, and the notes produced by the gradual closing of the
											same. The song consists of a series of from 25 to 30 raspings, as of a stiff
											quill drawn across a coarse file. There are about five of these raspings or
											trills per second, all alike, and with equal intervals, except the last two or
											three, which, with the closing of the wing covers, run into each other. The
											whole strongly recalls the slow turning of a child's wooden rattle, ending
											with a sudden jerk of the same; and this prolonged rattling, which is peculiar
											to the male, is invariably and instantly answered by a single sharp 'chirp' or
											'tschick' from one or more <pb id="VAB8231-490" n="489"/> females, who produce
											the sound by a sudden upward jerk of the wings.</p>
										<p>"Both sexes are for the most part silent during the day, but during the
											period of their greatest activity their stridulations are never for an hour
											remitted, from the time the great setting sun hides behind the purple curtains
											of the west till he begins to shed his scarlet rays in the east--the species
											being so numerous that the sound as it comes from the woods is one continuous
											rattling, not unlike the croaking of frogs, but set to a higher key."</p>

								<p>This, the largest Tettigoniid known from the eastern United States, was first
									recorded and described from this country by <bibl>Scudder (1862, 447)</bibl> under
									the name of <hi rend="i">Micerocentrum thoracicum</hi>, his specimen being a
									female from the Tortugas Islands. Scudder's name was placed by <bibl>Brunner
										(1878, 359)</bibl> as a synonym of <hi rend="i">Stilpnochlora marginella</hi>
									(Serv.), and the species has been recorded as such a number of times from Florida
									and is listed under that name by Scudder and Kirby in their catalogues. <bibl>Rehn
										(1917, 111)</bibl> has separated our insect from <hi rend="i">S. marginella</hi>
									and placed it under Saussure's <hi rend="i">S. couloniana</hi>, a name considered
									by Brunner, Scudder and Kirby as a synonym of <hi rend="i">S. marginella</hi>.
									Rehn gives his reasons for his action thus: "The chief feature which distinguishes
									the species is the form of the stridulating field of the male tegmina. This is
									least extensive, with its free margin almost regularly arcuate and hardly
									angulate, and having a short stridulating vein in <hi rend="i">marginella</hi>; in
										<hi rend="i">couloniana</hi> the field is broader, with a rounded obtuse
									angulation at the extremity of the vein, which is somewhat heavier and
									longer."</p>
								<p>Two females in my collection from Mexico, one from Jalapa, the other from
									Orizaba, differ from the Florida specimens only <pb id="VAB8231-493" n="492"/> in
									their slightly larger size and more divergent lateral carinæ of pronotum. These
									are probably what Rehn considers <hi rend="i">S. quadrata</hi>
									<bibl>Scudder (1869c, 331)</bibl>, as that is the only species he mentions as
									inhabiting Mexico. This species he also separates from <hi rend="i"
										>marginella</hi> and <hi rend="i">couloniana</hi> only "by the greater breadth
									of the male tegminal field, with margin more obtuse-angled and the more elongate
									stridulating vein," and states that Florida females of <hi rend="i"
										>couloniana</hi> "are almost indistinguishable from Mexican individuals," i. e.,
									females of what he considers <hi rend="i">quadrata</hi>.</p>
								<p>An examination of a series of males of the three forms, <hi rend="i">marginella,
										couloniana</hi> and <hi rend="i">quadrata</hi>, in the Philadelphia collections,
									shows that the free margin of the left tegmen (<hi rend="i">m</hi>, Fig. 163, b,
									c) is slightly more obtusely rounded in <hi rend="i">quadrata</hi> than in <hi
										rend="i">couloniana</hi>, and slightly less so in <hi rend="i">marginella</hi>
									than in <hi rend="i">couloniana</hi>. A large series would probably show that <hi
										rend="i">quadrate</hi> is a synonym of <hi rend="i">couloniana</hi> and that the
									latter is at the most only a race or form of <hi rend="i">marginella</hi>.</p>

							<p>Our eastern species of this subfamily are insects of large size, having the head

								tapering spines; tegmina very broad, ovate, leaf-like, usually strongly concave
								within, wholly enclosing the abdomen, their anal field short, triangular,

							<p>This subfamily is richly represented in the tropical countries of the world, but
								very poorly so in the United States, where only three genera and half a dozen or so
								species occur. They are for the most part strictly arboreal, dwelling amidst the
								foliage of the tallest of trees, but where these are absent they live in the
								orchards and shrubbery about small towns and country houses. <bibl>Caudell (1906,
									32)</bibl> well describes their habits when he says: "The nights may resound with
								the song of the males and yet the listener never sees one of the songsters. This is
								accounted for by the habitat of the insect which is in the tallest trees available.
								The young feed on the leaves and very probably rarely or never leave the shelter of
								the tree upon which they were born. * * * Considerable doubt exists as to whether or
								not these tree katydids ever fly. I have repeatedly endeavored to persuade specimens
								to fly and have succeeded in getting them to spread their wings and sail to the
								ground, alighting with a thud, but no attempt was made by the insects toward actual
								flight. They probably soar from one tree to another after the manner of the flying
								squirrel."</p>

								<p>This broad-winged katydid occurs in considerable numbers throughout Indiana, but
									is much more commonly heard than seen, <pb id="VAB8231-498" n="497"/> as it dwells
									in small colonies in the densest foliage which it can find, such as the tops of
									shade and forest trees, the entwining vines of the grape arbor, the shrubbery of
									yards and orchards and the trees along fence rows. Its note is the loudest made by
									any member of the family, the male having the musical organ larger and better
									developed than in any other. The call is almost always begun soon after dusk with
									a single note uttered at intervals of about five seconds for a half dozen or more
									times. This preliminary note gives the listener the impression that the musician
									is tuning his instrument, preparatory to the well-known double call which is soon
									begun and kept up almost continuously from dark till dawn. Occasionally, in warm
									cloudy weather, this call is made by day, and if the musician is located he will
									sometimes be found resting on the topmost leaf of a shrub, swinging to and fro as
									the breezes blow, and sounding his cymbals in seeming unison with the movement.
									This katydid reaches maturity in southern Indiana by mid-July. The song has been
									heard in Crawford County as early as July 10, and as late as Oct. 27, and a single
									female was captured in LaPorte County, near Lake Michigan, on October 15.</p>

								<p>In a Putnam County farmyard I listened for hours, one August night, to the
									serenade of a band of katydids. They seemingly tried to outdo themselves for my
									benefit. But to them I was a nonentity--an unknown being. No thought of me or of
									my attentive ear lurked in or passed through their brains, as they clashed their
									cymbals in every shrub and tree around the old farm house. One idea alone
									possessed the minds of the male musicians. That idea was love--passion--"that
									greatest thing in the universe." Long and loud the cymbals sounded, each shuffle,
									each note, doubtless accompanied by the wish that the next would call from the
									skies, from the branches above or about them--from anywhere, it mattered not--one
									of their form and kind. One to whom they could "whisper sweet nothings"--one whom
									they could caress tenderly <pb id="VAB8231-499" n="498"/> with long antennæ--one
									whom, in time, they could clasp lovingly with their slender limbs and forget
									cymbals, calls, skies, food, earth, everything in that long embrace which is to
									them the acme, the one, the highest object of their mature existence.</p>
								<p>The serenade continued thus, almost unbroken, from dusk till dawn. A serenade it
									was in truth--a song of love--of passion, poured out to the listening ears of the
									other sex. At times a single player dropped out of the chorus. His work, his
									love-calls had not been in vain. From some leafy retreat, where she had been
									hidden by day, a lady katydid slowly emerged, and, entranced by the song--by, to
									her ears, the tender wooing notes--drew nearer and nearer unto the charmed circle
									whence the cymbals clanged and shuffled. Their notes became less vigorous. More
									softly they fell upon her ear, until finally, as she coyly advanced they ceased
									and the caress of the antennæ took their place. The other musicians noted the
									absence of one of their chorus, and sounded their drums the louder, but for most
									of them their labor was in vain. Many of them doubtless go through life unblessed
									by the presence of the gentler sex, clanging their nightly calls from mid-July to
									the coming of the hoar-frost, and to its biting nips finally succumbing, possessed
									by the thought--if a katydid can think--that this earth is a desolate and cruel
									abiding place for such as they. So have the most of bachelors--human and
									otherwise--doubtless thought, as in the past they yielded up the ghost.</p>
								<p>The known range of this true katydid extends from New England and London, Ont.,
									west to Michigan and northern Illinois, and south and west to North Carolina,
									northern Georgia and central Kansas. In New England it has been definitely
									recorded only from Massachusetts and Connecticut, <bibl>Scudder (1900a,
										103)</bibl> stating that it is found in isolated colonies in the former State
									and more generally but still locally in Connecticut. <bibl>Davis (1889)</bibl>
									mentions it as occurring on Staten Island, N. Y., in late July and August.
										<bibl>Walker (1904a, 330)</bibl> states that it is common at Niagara, and that
									he had often heard it at Yonkers, N. Y. <bibl>Caulfield (1888)</bibl> records the
									only Ontario specimen as taken at electric light in London. It is not mentioned in
									any of the local Michigan lists at hand, though stated by Pettit and McDaniel to
									have been recorded from the State. Lugger, though giving a description and an
									account of its habits (1898, 226), does not record it from Minnesota but says: "If
									found in this State it will very likely occur in small colonies." <bibl>Ball
										(1897)</bibl> mentions it as rare at Ames, Iowa, while Bruner <bibl>(1893a,
										29)</bibl> records it as not rare in the eastern or wooded part of Nebraska. The
									records south and <pb id="VAB8231-500" n="499"/> southwest of New England are more
									numerous, a number of them, as far as northern Georgia, being given by <bibl>R.
										&amp; H. (1916, 257)</bibl>. <bibl>Caudell (1906, 38)</bibl> states that it is
									found in Kansas.</p>
								<p>Most of the above records have been made under the names <hi rend="i"
										>Platyphyllum concavum</hi>
									<bibl>Harr. (1841, 128)</bibl>, <hi rend="i">Cyrtophyllus concavus</hi>
									<bibl>Scudder (1862, 444)</bibl> and <hi rend="i">Cyrtophyllus perspicillatus</hi>
									<bibl>Burm. (1838, 697)</bibl>, all of which are synonyms of <hi rend="i"
										>Pterophylla camellifolia</hi> (Fab.). The female was described by Fabricius as
										<hi rend="i">Locusta camellifolia</hi>, and in the next line he described the
									male as <hi rend="i">L. perspicillata</hi>, the former name therefore having
									priority. The <hi rend="i">Cyrtophyllus elongatus</hi>
									<bibl>Caudell (1906, 40)</bibl> is also a synonym of <hi rend="i">P.
										camellifolia</hi>.</p>
								<p>Of the call of this species <bibl>Scudder (1875e)</bibl> has written: <q
										rend="blockquote">
										<p>"The note, which sounds like <hi rend="i">xr</hi>, has a shocking lack of
											melody; the poets who have sung its praise must have heard it at the distance
											that lends enchantment. In close proximity the sound is excessively rasping
											and grating, louder and hoarser than I have heard from any other of the
											Locustarians in America or in Europe, and the Locustarians are the noisest of
											all Orthoptera. Since these creatures are abundant wherever they occur, the
											noise produced by them, on an evening specially favorable to their song, is
											most discordant. Usually the notes are two in number. rapidly repeated at
											short intervals. Perhaps nine out of ten will ordinarily give this number, but
											occasionally a stubborn insect persists in sounding the triple
											note--('Katy-she-did'); and as katydids appear desirous of defiantly answering
											their neighbors in the same measure, the proximity of a treble-voiced songster
											demoralizes a whole neighborhood, and a curious medley results; notes from
											some individuals may then be heard all the while, scarcely a moment's time
											intervening between their stridulations, some nearer, others at a greater
											distance; so that the air is filled by these noisy troubadours with an
											indescribably confused and grating clatter."</p>
									</q>
								</p>

								<p><bibl>Caudell (1906, 32)</bibl> says: "The female of this katydid is unique among
									Orthopterous insects, so far as known, in that they stridulate late in a manner
									similar to that of the males. The tegmina are partially opened and closed just as
									are those of the males during stridulation. The roughened surface of the
									triangular anal areas rub over each other, like the tympani of the males, the
									right tegmen sliding beneath the left one. The resulting sound is a sharp,
									scraping note, heard easily for several yards. This sound is made by the female
									when disturbed by handling, but whether or not it is ever made voluntarily in
									nature is not known, but it presumably is when the insect is disturbed by any
									cause."</p>
								<p>According to <bibl>Riley (1874, 167)</bibl> the eggs of the true katydid are
									thrust, by means of the sharp ovipositor, into crevices and soft substances, and
									probably, in a state of nature, into the crevices of loose bark, or into the soft
									stems of woody plants. They are of a <pb id="VAB8231-501" n="500"/> dark slate
									color, about 6.5x2 mm. in size, very flat, pointed at each end, and with the edges
									beveled off or emarginate. <bibl>Caudell (1906, 33)</bibl> mentions a female that
									was found on Plummer's Island, Md., with the ovipositor inserted into the bark of
									a small elm tree a few feet above the ground. Later (1918, 112) he records one as
									ovipositing in the bark of the black walnut.</p>

								<p>LaGrange, Fla., June; Pablo Beach, Fla., Aug. 13 (<hi rend="i">Davis</hi>). Known
									only from Florida, and so far found only in a narrow strip along the east coast
									from Pablo Beach to Miami. The type of Beutenmüller was from near Grant, and he
									says that it lives in the tops of live-oak trees, the note of the male, being a
									continuous "<hi rend="i">kerr-kerr-kerr-kerr</hi>," with about one second interval
									of rest. <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1907, 302)</bibl> record the taking in August of
									numerous specimens at Pablo Beach, where it was apparently abundant "in bushes
									about eight to ten feet high growing on the land face of the dunes. The note is
									much lower than in <hi rend="i">P. camellifolia</hi>, decidedly weaker, and
									consisting of single notes separated by regular intervals."</p>
								<p><bibl>Davis (1914, 198)</bibl> records <hi rend="i">L. floridensis</hi> from
									LaGrange, Sept. 10--12, and says: "We sometimes heard among the oaks and cabbage
									palms, but not in the pine woods, a low chluck, chluck, evidently the call of some
									large insect, though its carrying power was poor and one had to be quite near in
									order to hear it. There were several of the insects about, and one evening when
									the moon was shining brightly and with the aid of a lantern, one was discovered
									among the leaves of a cabbage palm. Enough was seen to identify it with <hi
										rend="i">Cyrtophyllus floridensis</hi> and the next day I knocked a female of
									the same species from a cabbage palm into my umbrella. A nymph was found at night
									hanging from moss on a low palmetto, drying itself, having just shed its skin.
									This nymph was brownish in color, but the adult male and female were all green.
									Near Miami, 180 miles to the south of LaGrange, one of these insects was heard
									stridulating every evening in the latter part of September. It lived among the
									Spanish moss in a large oak in a clearing, and as it always took alarm at the
									light of my lantern it could not be observed, much less collected."</p>

								<p>The species are usually dimorphic in color, either a nearly uniform pale green or

								<p>Miami and Parish, Fla., Sept. 22--Oct. 17 (<hi rend="i">Davis</hi>). Ft. Myers,
									Fla., Sept. 17, one green female, Gainesville collection. Described from Punta
									Gorda and recorded also by R. &amp; H. and Davis from Homestead, Marathon,
									Cocoanut Grove and Pineland, Fla., July--November. A subtropical species known
									only from the southern third of Florida. The females appear to be far less
									numerous than the males.</p>
								<p>Of its habits <bibl>Davis (1912a, 122)</bibl> says: "At Punta Gorda in November,
									the males would perch on the topmost leaf of a scrub palmetto and stridulate a
									song hardly to be distinguished from the rapid <hi rend="i">ik-ik-ik</hi> of the
										<hi rend="i">Conocephalus ensiger</hi> of the northeastern United States. They
									fed on the palmetto, their powerful jaws enabling them to gnaw the tough leaves."
									At Homestead <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1914c, 401)</bibl> found "the species very common
									on scrub palmetto, <hi rend="i">Serenoa serrulata</hi> (Michx.) in the pine woods,
									and only at night, when their stridulations permitted stalking with a flash-lamp.
									The song was faint, and ceased on an approach of even as much as twenty feet.
									However, they were easy to capture when located, as they almost invariably made no
									attempt to escape, but instead merely slipped down the palmetto leaf a few inches
									or around to the other side and there flattened themselves out with caudal limbs
									extended backward and cephalic limbs forward. When picked up they would violently
									attempt to bite their captor, and if successful could inflict a painful bite on a
									tender portion of <pb id="VAB8231-507" n="506"/> the hand. Their note is very low
									and consists of a succession of sounds like <hi rend="i"
										>zip-zip-zip-zip-zip-zip-zip-zip</hi>." Of a specimen kept in captivity
										<bibl>Hebard (1915b, 458)</bibl> says: "Its actions show how absolutely
									nocturnal the species is; this specimen resting rigid in some concealed position
									during the day, with cephalic limbs and antennæ directed straight forward and
									median and caudal, limbs straight backward, but at night moving actively about and
									extremely alert and rapid in its movements."</p>

										(1914c, 401)</bibl> the length of the hind femora is shown to vary from 15.9 to

									measurements of these parts given by Davis in his description of <hi rend="i"
										>sleighti</hi> and in the key fall well within the individual variations of <hi
										rend="i">sabalis</hi> shown by R. &amp; H. The slight difference in the form of

									other part of the body. I therefore regard <hi rend="i">sleighti</hi> as only an

									in structure being due to some feature of environment or inherited tendency, as

								<p>Gainesville, Miami, and Cape Sable, Fla., Sept. 24--Feb. 23. The Miami specimens
									from the Davis collection are labelled: "This and eight or ten others eating grass
									at night." It does not appear to be widely distributed in Florida, having been
									recorded only from Miami, Marco, Chokoloskee, Everglade and Charlotte Harbor, all
									in the southern third of the State. Davis states that their song resembles <hi
										rend="i">azik, azik, azik, azik</hi>, and that they are very shy when singing
									and difficult to capture. At Charlotte Harbor Hebard says (1916, 20) "They were
									heard on May 19 and 20 everywhere after dark on Useppa Island, singing in the tops
									of the cabbage palmettoes, where they were usually located in the berry clusters.
									A few were also heard in the undergrowth of the heavier tangles and in mangroves
									on the edge of the swamp. While singing the males were very wary when approached,
									usually ceasing their song at a distance of 15 or more feet. The insect is slow in
									movements, clinging tenaciously to its support and easily seized if approached
									cautiously." The Cape Sable specimen, taken on Feb. 23, was a nymph of the third
									instar.</p>
								<p>The wariness of <hi rend="i">P. uncinata</hi> mentioned by Davis and Hebard was
									not noted by Allard who captured a single male in stridulation at Thompson's
									Mills, Ga., in October. He says (1911b) "The insect was traced by its note to the
									low grass and weeds on a bank almost in the midst of the settlement. By the strong
									light of a bull's eye lantern the writer approached within a foot or two of the
									insect which continued to stridulate vigorously for some time, even though in the
									full glare of a strong light. After its notes had ceased, the insect at intervals
									jerked its body and wings spasmodically without producing any sound. This peculiar
									behavior is characteristic of a number of species of <hi rend="i"
										>Conocephalus</hi> when disturbed during stridulation. On the grass and weeds
									very near where this male was taken, the writer a night or two before heard
									several locusts in stridulation, presumably individuals of <hi rend="i">P.
										uncinata</hi>. As the notes of these insects were heard but one or two nights,
									it is possible that their stridulation period is very brief. The note is a loud,
									penetrating, prolonged <hi rend="i">z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z</hi> quite like

								<head>III. N<hi rend="sc">EOCONOCEPHALUS</hi>
									<bibl>Karney, 1907, 22</bibl>. (Gr., "near" + Conocephalus.)</head>

								<p>This generic name takes the place of <hi rend="i">Conocephalus</hi> of my
									Orthoptera of Indiana (1903, 363). The members of the genus are readily known by
									having the fastigium of vertex prolonged forward and more or less upward into a
									cone which much exceeds in length the first segment of the antennæ, and bears a
									pointed basal tooth beneath. This cone is never hooked downward at tip as in <hi
										rend="i">Pyrgocorypha</hi> and is much less rugose above than there. In addition
									they have the eyes small, subrotund, rather prominent; spines of prosternum long
									and slender; pronotum with disk usually nearly twice as long as wide, its sides
									feebly diverging from apex to base; front margin subtruncate, hind one broadly
									rounded, lateral carinæ distinct but obtuse, humeral sinus usually broad, shallow,
									rounded; lateral lobes as deep or slightly deeper than long, their front margin
									broadly obliquely rounded into the lower one which is short and also rounded into
									the hind one, the posterior angle usually obsolete; tegmina long, narrow, rounded
									at end, much surpassing the abdomen and slightly exceeding the wings; stridulating
									organ on left tegmen of male opaque and of a coarse texture, on right or lower
									one, transparent at the center; front and middle femora rather short, usually
									armed beneath with a few very short spines; hind femora long, slender, usually
									with both lower margins armed beneath with numerous fine spines. Male with
									supra-anal plate broadly emarginate at apex, the lobes each side of notch ending
									in a spine; cerci much as in <hi rend="i">Pyrgocorypha</hi>, the appendages at end
									not flattened, but incurved and spinose as there; subgenital plate emarginate, the
									styles very short and set in sockets on the extreme tips of the projections each
									side of notch. Ovipositor rather narrow, nearly straight, oftentimes of excessive
									length; the eggs of those species in which the oviposition has been noted, being
									deposited between the stems and root leaves of grasses, reeds and sedges.</p>
								<p>Although these larger cone-heads are said to be rather common by those writers
									who have prepard lists of Orthoptera from other states, they appear to be, in
									Indiana, the least abundant of all the winged Tettigoniidae, 20 years collecting
									having yielded fewer than 30 specimens. They appear to be more common in <pb
										id="VAB8231-514" n="513"/> the northern than in the southern half of the State.
									As in <hi rend="i">Belocephalus</hi> the color is dimorphic, green and brown forms
									of most of the species being known, the former largely predominating.</p>
								<p>Of the habits of the species as found in Illinois, <bibl>McNeill (1891)</bibl>
									has written: "All the species of <hi rend="i">Conocephalus</hi> seem to possess
									more intelligence than is usual among the Orthoptera, and they are about the most
									difficult of the order to approach. In escaping they usually slip or fall into the
									grass instead of jumping or flying; but they seem to fully understand that they
									are very well protected by their color and form. If approached very cautiously
									they often remain quite still upon the stem of grass upon which you have surprised
									them with the usually well founded expectation that you will not be able to
									distinguish them from the green herbage around. If they think it worth while to
									make some active movement to escape they will frequently slip around on the other
									side of the stem and walk down the stem to the ground or off upon another plant.
									Unlike most Orthoptera they do not use their front legs in holding to the mouth
									the thing upon which they feed. Instead of biting they seem to wrench or tear away
									pieces from the stems or leaves."</p>
								<p><bibl>Allard (1910c)</bibl> says: "The stridulations of the species of <hi
										rend="i">Neoconocephalus</hi>, like the notes of all the Locustidae, entirely
									lack any musical tone or trill so characteristic of the crickets. Their notes are
									always loud, buzzing and penetrating, and differ not so much in sound-quality as

								<p>New Harmony, Ind., September. Staten and Long Islands, N. Y., August, (<hi
										rend="i">Davis</hi>.) The only known Indiana specimen of this large, long-headed
									Tettigoniid is the female type of my <hi rend="i">Conocephalus bruneri</hi> (1903,
									367) taken at New Harmony, Posey Co., by the late Arthur Dransfield. Not being
									able to identify it by the literature available, it was sent to Prof. Lawrence
									Bruner, who wrote me that it was evidently an undescribed form. <bibl>Karney
										(1907, 30)</bibl> first placed it as a synonym of <hi rend="i"
										>exiliscanorus</hi> and comparison with State Island females of that species
									shows that he is probably correct, though the Indiana specimen is distinctly
									larger and with longer fastigium than any of those received from Davis.</p>
								<p>The types of Davis were found amongst the cat-tails that grew on the salt marshes
									of Staten Island, and it ranges along the Atlantic coast from New Haven, Conn., to
									Raleigh, N. Car., and Mississippi, and inland to Clarksville, Tenn., Thompson's
									Mills, Ga., and Dallas, Texas. Of its habits <bibl>Davis (1887)</bibl> says: "This
									insect keeps very close to the ground, hiding well in the vegetation, and is not
									easily discovered. The sound produced when stridulating is very faint, not louder
									than that made by <hi rend="i">Gryllus abbreviatus</hi> and I was much surprised
									to hear such a faint song from so large an insect. I have in consequence named it
									the 'slightly musical Conocephalus.'" Later (1889) he adds that "<hi rend="i"
										>exiliscanorus</hi> devours the heads of the meadow grass (<hi rend="i"
										>Spartina</hi>) and is such a slow singer that one can easily estimate the
									number of times one wing is drawn over the other, which is about 115 times a
									minute." Again (1911) he says that the song varies considerably in loudness
									according to the age of the singer, while its volume is also to some extent
									dependent upon the temperature.</p>



								<pb id="VAB8231-518" n="517"/>

								<p>About Tappahannock, Va., Fox found it "frequent between August 9 and September 10
									in tidal marshes occurring most commonly in tall reeds, <hi rend="i">Spartina
										cynosuroides</hi> (L.) but spreading in small numbers through the briery
									thickets and corn fields of the adjoining dry land."</p>
								<p><bibl>R. &amp; H. (1915, 374)</bibl> state that the song of <hi rend="i">N.
										exiliscanorus</hi>
									<q rend="blockquote">
										<p>"Is a <hi rend="i">ziit-ziit-ziit-ziit</hi>--a vibrant rattling note, rising
											and falling in intensity, often ceasing as if from exhaustion. The song is
											rapid, the sounds being emitted on warm evenings about three to the second.
											When near a colony of this species on favorable evenings after dark the air is
											vibrant with the sound; as several singers cease others take up the constantly
											rising and falling song, but at no very great distance the sound is inaudible.
											The insects were found not to begin to sing until nearly sunset and before
											dark often ceased their song upon any attempt to approach the spot After dark
											the singing was much more vigorous and the singers could then even be
											approached with a light, cautiously seized while singing and moving about in
											the bushy weeds and heavy grasses into which they climbed while stridulating.
											Toward midnight, after the air is chilled, the singers become audibly fewer
											and their stridulations less intense. The species is found very local but
											often in large numbers in the heavier tangles of weeds, low bushy plants or
											heavy reeds in both fresh and salt water marshes. The females were found often
											in grasses near the singers; one was taken ovipositing in a grass blade at
											dusk."</p>

								<p>After studying at Philadelphia the types of both forms and comparing with them
									Indiana specimens of what Bruner named for me as <hi rend="i">nebrascensis</hi>
									and New Jersey, Virginia and Florida specimens of what is known as <hi rend="i"
										>lyristes</hi>, I have placed the latter as the eastern and southern
									representative or race of <hi rend="i">nebrascensis</hi>. No fixed character of
									specific importance has been given separating the two. <bibl>Rehn (1906b)</bibl>
									says the males differ in that <hi rend="i">nebrascensis</hi> "is of a more robust
									build, with broader tegmina, wider and more arcuate tympanum, more expanded caudal
									section of pronotum and deeper lateral lobes of the same;" all of which characters
									are comparative only and fall within the limits of individual variation as shown
									by the specimens examined. R. &amp; H. in their key (1915, 369) separate the two
									only by the terms "form robust, vertex slender," <hi rend="i">nebrascensis</hi>
									and "form slender, vertex heavy," <hi rend="i">lyristes</hi>. In their later
									treatment they do not compare <hi rend="i">lyristes</hi> with <hi rend="i"
										>nebrascensis</hi>, but only with <hi rend="i">melanorhinus</hi>, a species with
									much shorter fastigium and ovipositor. Davis (Ms.) states that <pb
										id="VAB8231-520" n="519"/> he was unable to separate the males from Indiana and
									New Jersey except by the labels they bore, and Fox (Ms.) says that the only
									differences he could find in both sexes was the slight one afforded by the
									fastigium.</p>
								<p>The type of <hi rend="i">lyristes</hi> was a male labelled "Chokoloskee, Fla.," a
									locality which <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1915, 384)</bibl> seriously question, but which
									is borne out by a Palm Beach female at hand, which agrees in all particulars with
									the type and New Jersey specimens except in color, it being a nearly uniform
									purplish-brown instead of green and in its having a slightly longer and more
									slender fastigium.</p>
								<p>The known range of the race <hi rend="i">lyristes</hi> extends from Long Island,
									N. Y., and various points in New Jersey, southwest to Tappahannock, Va. It is also

									from Virginia southward. <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1915, 381)</bibl> state that <hi
										rend="i">lyristes</hi> is "locally common in New Jersey in bogs, fresh water
									marshes and in the coastal salt water-marshes in areas of <hi rend="i"

											(Ait.), growing near one foot in height, but it was also found there rather
											abundant in areas of the low marsh spike-grass, <hi rend="i">Distichlis
												spicata</hi> (L.). When first met with in the summer of 1914, the males of a
											large colony were stridulating vigorously early on a somewhat cloudy
											afternoon; the song was a weak, high-pitched continuous buzzing, giving much
											the same vibrating resonance as a bit of rubber stretched in the wind. The
											note was very much weaker, richer in quality and less harsh than that of <hi
												rend="i">N. robustus</hi>. During daylight the singers invariably seemed
											further away than was the case, and time and again specimens were passed over
											until this fact was realized. At night the song was somewhat louder and very
											similar to that of <hi rend="i">N. lyristes</hi>, almost inappreciably higher
											pitched and more strident. When an individual was alarmed while singing the
											note ceased abruptly, the singer dropping or leaping to the ground and there
											remaining motionless, perfectly concealed. * * * The abundant green
											color-phase of this insect blends perfectly with the broader green leaves of
												<hi rend="i">Spartina patens</hi>, while the brown individuals of pale to
											very dark shades blend as perfectly with the brown and yellowish bases of the
											same plant and the bare dark muck beneath. The insects were seen to fly but
											short distances while singing individuals were observed to be resting
											motionless on the grass or climbing nervously about."</p>

								<p>Scudder, who has set the note to music, says of the song (1874, 368): "This
									insect has but a single song and stridulates only by night, or during cloudy
									weather. It begins its song as soon as the sky is obscured or the sun is near the
									horizon. It commences with a note like <hi rend="i">brw</hi>, then pauses an
									instant and immediately emits a rapid succession of sounds like <hi rend="i"
										>chwi</hi> at the rate of about five per second, and continues them for an
									unlimited time. <bibl>Davis (1887)</bibl> likens its note to the syllable <hi
										rend="i">'ik-ik-ik,'</hi> as if sharpening a saw, enlivening the low bushes, and
									particularly the cornpatch, as it seems to especially delight in perching near the
									top of a cornstalk and there giving forth its rather impulsive song."</p>

								<p><bibl>Walker (1904a, 337)</bibl> mentions <hi rend="i">ensiger</hi> as "a very
									common <pb id="VAB8231-523" n="522"/> insect in Ontario, ranging northward about
									as far as Muskoka and the Bruce Peninsula. It frequents fields, vacant lots and
									roadsides, which resound at night with the incessant monotonous song. During the
									summer and autumn * * * I have occasionally heard it stridulating in bright
									sunshine in the afternoon. It is the most easily approached of all our
									locustarians while thus engaged and is in fact difficult to find in any other way,
									hence the females are but seldom seen. Although it usually perches upon tall
									weeds, I have occasionally traced its song to a tree or vine, the insect being
									sometimes stationed at a considerable height."</p>
								<p><bibl>Allard (1911)</bibl> says that in September near Oxford, Mass., <hi
										rend="i">ensiger</hi> is a very common species in all upland localities where it
									"prefers the fresh herbage of cultivated fields and is especially to be looked for
									in fields of corn. One oftentimes finds a noisy singer perched six or seven feet
									from the ground on a corn stalk or tassel. One also sometimes meets with it in
									large colonies among the luxuriant weeds and grasses of the lowlands. Its call
									notes are intermittent and follow each other rather briskly--<hi rend="i"

								<p><bibl>Scudder (1874, 376)</bibl> describes the note of <hi rend="i">robustus</hi>
									as heard in New England thus: "This insect is exceedingly noisy and sings equally,
									and I believe similarly, by day and night. The song resembles that of the harvest
									fly, <hi rend="i">Cicada canicularis</hi>. It often lasts for many minutes, and
									seems, at a distance, to be quite uniform. On a nearer approach one can hear it
									swelling and decreasing in volume * * * and it is accompanied by a buzzing sound,
									quite audible near at hand, which resembles the humming of a bee or the droning of
									a bag-pipe."</p>
								<p><bibl>Davis (1887, 57)</bibl> says that on Staten Island <hi rend="i">N.
										robustus</hi> "resides for the most part mid the grass on sandy ground near the
									sea shore, though an occasional individual finds its way inland. Along the sea
									beach they stridulate in early afternoon, especially if slightly cloudy, and when
									approached they have a curious fashion of dropping to the ground. I have often
									found them on such occasions actually standing on their heads in the soft sand,
									leaning against the grass stems which grow so close together <pb id="VAB8231-525"
										n="524"/> without in any way holding on to them. Whether this position is
									intentional or not, I cannot say, but certain it is that when looked for from

									many enemies."</p>
								<p><bibl>Hart (1907)</bibl> records <hi rend="i">robustus</hi> as occurring on waste

								<p>Jamesburg, Cold Spring and Erma, N. Jer., Aug. 16--Sept. 18 (<hi rend="i"
										>Davis</hi>.) The known range of this species extends from New Jersey to Atmore,
									Ala., but it appears to be nowhere very common. The three male types were found in
									a cranberry bog at Lakehurst, N Jer., and of them Davis says: "The song is a slow
										<hi rend="i">zip-zip-zip</hi>, repeated many times and much resembling that of
										<hi rend="i">Conocephalus exiliscanorus</hi> of the salt meadows." No females
									were found until 1910, when two were taken by <bibl>Davis (1911)</bibl> at Cold
									Spring, N. Jer. Of males taken near Tuckerton he wrote: "They were in a dry field
									and some of them, when disturbed, flew several hundred feet and lit in cedar
									trees. This was an unusual proceeding for they generally seek safety by dropping
									to the ground and hiding among the thick vegetation."</p>
								<p><bibl>R. &amp; H. (1915, 396)</bibl> say: "The present insect is very widely
									distributed not only along the coastal strip in truck gardens, waste fields, and
									marshy fresh water areas, but also in boggy portions of the adjacent pine barrens
									and in fields there located. Usually no more than three or four widely scattered
									individuals are to be heard at one time. The song is loud, resonant and
										constant--<hi rend="i">dzeeeet-dzeeeet-dzeeeet</hi>, always the same, not rising
									and falling, the notes given deliberately, counted as averaging twelve to ten
									seconds. The males would continue their loud song 'fearlessly <pb id="VAB8231-527"
										n="526"/> until approached to within about eight feet, then ceasing abruptly
									they would fly into the darkness with a swift powerful zigzagging flight. In alert
									swiftness this species and <hi rend="i">N. velox</hi> are distinctive."</p>
								<p>Aside from the black margined under surface of the fastigium this insect is an
									exact replica of a small <hi rend="i">N. robustus crepitans</hi>, the form of the
									cones being identical. That species is said to sometimes have the fastigium "very
									briefly and narrowly darkened ventrad." I would consider <hi rend="i"

										(1915, 400)</bibl> have written: "The males were found to be at night very alert
									and shy, much the most difficult of the species to take excepting <hi rend="i">N.

								<p>Ormond, Gainesville, West Palm Beach, Lake Istokpoga, Cape Sable and Dunedin,
									Fla. (<hi rend="i">W. S. B</hi>.); Mobile, Ala. (<hi rend="i">Loding</hi>);
									Agricultural College, Miss. (<hi rend="i">Weed</hi>) ; October-March. Recorded
									from numerous places in Florida, and occurs everywhere throughout the State and on
									the southern keys. These records have been made under different names, viz., <hi
										rend="i">Conocephalus triops</hi> (Linn.), <hi rend="i">C. fusco-striatus</hi>
									Redt., <hi rend="i">C. mexicanus</hi> Sauss. and <hi rend="i">C. nietoi</hi>
									Sauss., the second and third being synonyms of <hi rend="i">triops</hi> and the
									fourth belonging rightfully to an extralimital species of <hi rend="i"
										>Homorocoryphus</hi>.</p>
								<p>My first field acquaintance with <hi rend="i">C. triops</hi> was made at Ormond
									on March 16, 1899. These I determined as <hi rend="i">C. nietoi</hi> Sauss. by
									comparison with Mississippi specimens which I had received under that name from H.
									C. Weed and they were so recorded by me (1902, 70). About Dunedin <hi rend="i">N.
										triops</hi> occurs in small numbers throughout the winter, frequenting for the
									most part the dense masses of fallen grasses about the borders of marshes and
									ponds. but sometimes noted amidst the wire-grass of open pine woods. There as
									elsewhere the males are mostly brown and the females green, there being but one
									brown female and one green male among the 24 specimens at hand. I have never seen
									it fly when disturbed, but it is an adept at burrowing and also at remaining
									perfectly motionless by the side of or on some object with whose hue its own color
									blends. On the other hand, Hebard states <bibl>(R. &amp; H., 1904)</bibl> that at
									Thomasville, Ga., the brown <hi rend="i">fusco-striatus</hi> phase of this species
									"appeared early in March and was soon plentiful in the woods, especially in the
									broom sedge in damp locations. The speciimens, when pursued, always took to wing
									and made off with a strong but zigzag flight, never alighting until quite a
									distance had been traversed."</p>
								<p><hi rend="i">N. triops</hi> is found, say <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1915, 408)</bibl>
									"almost everywhere in the southern United States, inhabiting the forest
									undergrowth, fields and semi-marsh situations. Over most of its range it is one of
									the earliest Tettigoniids to appear, the adults being found in south Georgia in
									late March." Its known range extends from the vicinity of Washington, D. C., south
									and west to Stillwater, Oklahoma, Central Texas, Arizona and Los Angeles, Cal.
										<bibl>Redtenbacher (1891, 399)</bibl> gives also for his <hi rend="i"
										>fusco-striatus</hi>, Missouri, Cuba, Port Au Prince and Quita.</p>
								<p><bibl>Allard (1910a)</bibl> has given an excellent account of the habits and song
									of the brown color phase of <hi rend="i">N. triops</hi> which is, in part, as
									follows: <q rend="blockquote">
										<p>"The careful observer of insect stridulations who visits the upper <pb
												id="VAB8231-532" n="531"/> Piedmont region of Georgia in March or April,
											will hear, during warm evenings, a loud, continuous, noisy buzz, sometimes in
											the tallest pines and oaks, or again in the weeds and low herbage of fields.
											This is the stridulation of a cone-headed grasshopper known as <hi rend="i"
												>Conocephalus fusco-striatus</hi> Redt. In this region the notes of this
											interesting locust together with the familiar trillings of the ubiquitous
											field cricket, <hi rend="i">Gryllus pennsylvanicus</hi> Burm., are among the
											earliest insect stridulations to be heard in spring. Here it is the only <hi
												rend="i">Conocephalus</hi> to be heard in early spring, and, judging from
											the individuals in song during warm evenings, it is a fairly common
											species.</p>
										<p>"This cone-head is strictly a nocturnal insect and stridulates most freely
											during warm, moonlight evenings. The note is a loud, harsh, snappy <hi
												rend="i">z-z-z-z-z-z</hi> continued for many minutes at a time. Within a few
											feet of the stridulating insect a strong, penetrating buzzing hum is
											noticeable, attended by almost continuous harsh, snappy, unmusical
											creptitations which are audible for long distances, and constitute the notes
											usually heard by the distant observer. It is somewhat difficult, especially
											for those who have not studied insect-stridulations, to locate one of these
											insects in a big field. Its powerful, penetrating notes seem to permeate the
											herbage on every hand, frequently causing no little bewilderment in the mind
											of one who attempts to locate the musician too carelessly. It is a very shy
											insect and cannot readily be captured unless approached with considerable
											care. It takes to wing readily, and flies long distances in the fields or from
											tree to tree."</p>

								<p>Tappahannock, Va., July 14 (<hi rend="i">Fox</hi>); Citrus Center, Fla. (<hi
										rend="i">Davis</hi>). Scudder's type was a unique male taken at Cedar Keys,
									Fla., June 4 by E. A. Schwarz. This was the only specimen known until 1905, when
									R. &amp; H. described a single female from Chokoloskee, Fla., under the name of
										<hi rend="i">Conocephalus hoplomachus</hi>. A second male was taken by them July
									12, 1912 "from saw-grass growing in knee-high water on the edge of the everglades"
									at Detroit, Fla., and was properly placed (1914c, 405) under Scudder's name. The
									only other Florida locality recorded is Citrus Center, where Davis secured two
									males on May 2, but he has a male taken at Parish, August 25, in which the tegmina
									are 40 mm. in length.</p>
								<p>Outside of Florida the species is recorded only from Wilmington, <pb
										id="VAB8231-534" n="533"/> N. Car., Tappahannock, Va. and Victoria, Texas. At
									Tappahannock <bibl>Fox (1917)</bibl> took 29 males and 12 females, July 13-Aug.
									18, which he found mostly "in dense stands of the tall marshgrass, <hi rend="i"

							<p>Species of small or medium size, having the vertex projected upward and forward in
								the form of a blunt rounded tubercle, concave on each side to accommodate the basal
								joint of antennæ; eyes rather large, subglobose; antennæ very slender, tapering,
								often of excessive length; pronotum with not more than one transverse sulcus;
								prosternum toothed or with two slender spines, rarely unarmed; tegmina usually well
								developed but often dimorphic in the same species, sometimes reduced to mere pads,,
								or even wanting, their color usually green, rarely pale brown; wings usually present
								and fully developed, absent or very minute in <hi rend="i">Odontoxiphidium</hi> and
								much aborted in some species of <hi rend="i">Conocephalus</hi>. Other characters
								much as in the Copiphorinæ.</p>
							<p>To this sub-family belong those slender-bodied green grasshoppers, <pb
									id="VAB8231-535" n="534"/> with long, tapering antennæ which are so common in
								summer and early autumn in damp meadows and prairies and along the margins of
								streams, ditches and ponds. They are mostly terrestrial in their habits, and the
								color of their bodies corresponds closely with that of the stems and leaves of the
								sedges and grasses among which they dwell, thus protecting them from the sight of
								the few birds which frequent a like locality. Their songs, produced in the same
								manner as those of their larger cousins, the katydids, are as frequent by day as by
								night, but are usually soft and low in comparison with those of the former. Their
								day song differs from that of the night, and, says <bibl>Scudder (1868, 116)</bibl>
								: "It is curious to observe these little creatures suddenly changing from the day to
								the night song at the mere passing of a cloud and returning to the old note when the
								sky is clear. By imitating the two songs in the daytime the grasshoppers can be made
								to represent either at will; at night they have but one note."</p>
							<p>The eggs of the Conocephalinæ are deposited between the stems and root leaves of
								grass, in the pith of twigs, or sometimes in the turnip-shaped galls so common on
								certain species of willows. The ovipositor, being thus used as a piercer, has in
								time developed into a slender and sharp pointed instrument which is but little
								curved and is frequently of excessive length, in some species being over twice as
								long as the remainder of the body.</p>
							<p>The subfamily is represented in the eastern United States by three genera, the
								literature of especial interest regarding them being as follows: <bibl>Redtenbacher,
									1891</bibl>; <bibl>Blatchley, 1893, 1903</bibl>; <bibl>Scudder, 1898b</bibl>;

								<p>Tettigoniids below the medium in size and possessing the characters of the
									subfamily above noted. They also have the face short, moderately oblique, its
									dorsal portion prolonged upward at middle to meet the ventral spine of fastigium;
									pronotum short, usually smooth, more or less saddle-shaped, the metazona prolonged
									backward to form a posterior lobe, its hind margin usually broadly rounded;
									lateral lobes deeper than long, their front margin oblique, lower one usually
									straight and rounded into the hind one, the latter usually with the adjoining
									lower portion bulging to form what is called the "convex callosity;" humeral sinus
									usually present but varying much in width and depth; tegmina narrow, usually
									strongly tapering, the apical width much less than the basal, almost always
									slightly shorter than wings; stridulating organ of male well developed, its veins
									prominent, the speculum transparent on both tegmina; front and middle femora
									subequal in length, unarmed beneath; hind femora slender but stouter than in <hi
										rend="i">Conocephalus</hi>, their under surface either armed with a few short
									spines or wholly unarmed. Male with apex of supra-anal plate emarginate and
									usually deflexed; cerci stout, varying much in form, armed near middle with a
									single stout tooth; subgenital plate with apex U-or V-shaped, its styles short
									one-jointed, set in sockets at the upper outer margins of the concavity.
									Ovipositor stout, rather broad, its apical half usually distinctly upcurved; when
									straight or nearly so above, the apical third, except in <hi rend="i"
										>militare</hi>, tapering or curved on underside to a fine point.</p>
								<p>This genus is very close to <hi rend="i">Conocephalus (Xiphidium)</hi> and is, by
									some writers, united with it. <bibl>Redtenbacher (1891, 494)</bibl> placed it as a
									subgenus of <hi rend="i">Xiphidium</hi>, separating its members from those of <hi
										rend="i">Xiphidium</hi> proper by the same characters as did Serville. The
									species have a general facies or appearance which enables one after a little
									experience to separate them at a glance from those of <hi rend="i"
										>Conocephalus</hi>, but as <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1915b, 156)</bibl> have well said,
									"when the characters of the two are compared, the variation in each leaves us
									unable to state a single absolute difference." As noted in the key to genera, the
									larger, heavier body, longer prosternal spines, and shorter and broader falcate
									ovipositor are the chief distinguishing characters of <hi rend="i"
									>Orchelimum</hi>. The tegmina are <pb id="VAB8231-537" n="536"/> more uniform in
									length, and the color, while of slightly different shades of brown or green in the
									same species, according to season and habitat, does not run to the extremes of
									variation as in <hi rend="i">Conocephalus</hi>.</p>
								<p>The generic name, <hi rend="i">Orchelimum</hi>, the literal meaning of which is
									"I dance in the meadows," is a most appropriate one, for low, moist meadows
									everywhere swarm with these insects from July to November; and though waltzes and
									quadrilles are probably not indulged in, yet the music and song, the wooing and
									love-making which are the natural accompaniments of those amusements, are ever
									present, and make the short season of mature life of the participants a seemingly
									happy one.</p>
								<p><bibl>Allard (1910b)</bibl> says: "In attempting to capture the <hi rend="i"
										>Orchelimums</hi> it is amusing to observe their attempts to hide by moving
									around the stalk of grass they are resting on. As the hand moves toward the stalk
									to grasp one, the wary creature always moves to the opposite side so as to keep
									the stalk directly between it and the observer, just as a gray squirrel moves
									around a tree trunk to escape the hunter. In this protective movement it hugs the
									grass stem as close as possible, stretching out its long, slender hind legs behind
									it, until they are parallel with and almost flat against the grass stem."</p>
								<p>Redtenbacher recognized but eleven species of his subgenus <hi rend="i"
										>Orchelimum</hi>, ten of these from the United States. <bibl>Scudder (1900,
										73)</bibl> admitted 18 to his catalogue. <bibl>Kirby (1906, 371)</bibl>
									increased the number to 24. R. &amp; H. in their synopsis (1915a,) founded a new
									genus for one of these, restricted the genus <hi rend="i">Orchelimum</hi> to North
									America and Mexico, described five new species and relegated so many of those
									recognized by Redtenbacher, Scudder and Kirby to synonymy that, in the end, they
									had only 17 North American species treated as valid in their work.</p>
								<p>In my opinion the synonymy of the genus is even yet in a very unsettled state. R.
									&amp; H. made a laudable attempt to straighten it out but their conclusions
									regarding the older names of the European writers were based on the very brief
									descriptions of those writers and not on an examination and comparison with the
									types. For that reason I cannot agree with all their conclusions and synonymy.</p>
								<p>The species of <hi rend="i">Orchelimum</hi> are so numerous and so alike in
									general appearance that it is very difficult to prepare a key which is
									satisfactory and at the same time easily followed. R. &amp; H. have shown that one
									of the major characters used by both McNeill <pb id="VAB8231-538" n="537"/>
									(1900a) and myself (1903, 382) in our former treatment of the genus, viz., the
									presence or absence of spines on the under side of the hind femora, is unreliable
									as it is variable in the same species. They have used instead the form of the male
									cerci as their principal differential character and have supplemented this with
									other characters pertaining to the form of lateral lobes of pronotum, form and
									size of ovipositor of female, etc. Their keys are open to the objection, that they
									contain a number of merely comparative terms such as "form more robust" and
									"ovipositor with general form less arcuate," as against "form more slender" and
									"ovipositor with general form more arcuate." Such terms, as I long ago discovered
									by personal experience, are confusing and misleading to a student who has only a
									few specimens at hand. Aside from this, the keys in their synopsis are so much
									better than any previously known that I have used them as the basis for the one
									given below, modifying them here and there in sequence and by the addition of any
									fixed character which, in my opinion, would make them more simple and more easily
									understood by the beginner. On account of the great confusion in the synonymy of a
									number of the species, it is impossible in giving the distribution and notes on
									habits to always refer each record made by past collectors to the species to which
									it rightfully belongs. I have, however, where following the synonymy as given by
									R. &amp; H., assigned the notes and records of synonyms to the species under which
									they are placed by those authors.</p>
								<p>Fifteen species and two varieties of <hi rend="i">Orchelimum</hi> are herein

										McNeill's <hi rend="i">sylvaticum</hi> which R. &amp; H. have made a synonym of
											<hi rend="i">agile</hi>, except that McNeill specifically states that in the
										male of his species the wings do not exceed the tegmina, which is not true of

										examination of DeGeer's type, if it be still in existence, the fixation of any
										American form as that species may still be considered an open question.</p>
									<p>In Florida, <hi rend="i">O. agile</hi> has been taken by collectors at a dozen
										stations, but appears to be rather scarce and to be mostly confined to the
										northern portion, though recorded as far south as Detroit and Everglade. There
										it occurs in the undergrowth of pine woods and among weeds in waste places; also
										in the sawgrass along the edge of the everglades.</p>
									<p>The range of <hi rend="i">O. agile</hi>, including its synonyms, is given by R.
										&amp; H. as extending from S. E. Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey south and
										southwest to southern Florida and Louisiana and north and west to northern
										Illinois and Wichita, Kansas. Of <hi rend="i">silvaticum</hi> as occurring at
										Moline, Ill., <bibl>McNeill (1891, 26)</bibl> says: "I have found this <hi
											rend="i">Orchelimum</hi> first on corn, afterwards more commonly in open
										places in woods. Its stridulation is quite distinct from that of <hi rend="i"
											>vulgare</hi>. It consists of the same two elements but the <hi rend="i"

									<p>This meadow grasshopper, as described above, is the species which <bibl>R.
											&amp; H. (1915a, 34)</bibl> call <hi rend="i">O. glaberrimum</hi> (Burm.). The
										original description (1838, 707) of that species is very brief and not
										distinctive. It is as follows: "Verticis et pronoti medio fulvo,
										nigro-marginato; elytris ab alis dimidia linea superatis. Long. corp., 11"'."
										Burmeister knew but two species from the United States, and this short
										description was sufficient for him to distinguish these, but of the 18 or more
										species now known it is impossible to say just which one he had at hand. R.
										&amp; H. by "tracing the movements of Zimmerman, who collected the material on
										which Burmeister founded his <hi rend="i">glaberrimum</hi>," have concluded that
										his type came from Georgtown, S. Car., and have picked out the species found in
										that general region which, in their opinion, fits most closely the above brief
										description and have called it <hi rend="i">glaberrimum</hi>. In doing this they
										made the <hi rend="i">erythrocephalum</hi> of Davis a synonym. They have also
										placed as a synonym of their <hi rend="i">glaberrimum</hi> Burm. the <hi
											rend="i">O. cuticulare</hi>
										<bibl>Serv. (1839, 523)</bibl>, a species of which Serville said: "J'ignore sa
										patrie."</p>
									<p>As stated in the introduction to this work, p. 7, in cases of this kind, where
										the insect cannot be definitely fixed as the one so briefly described by a
										foreign author, it is better to disregard his name and to adopt a later one of
										undoubted status.<ref id="ref_070" rend="super" target="note_070">67</ref>
										<note id="note_070"><ref target="ref_070" rend="super">67</ref>See quotation
											from R. &amp; H. under <hi rend="i">O. concinnum</hi>, page 555.</note>
										<pb id="VAB8231-543" n="542"/> I have, therefore, restored the name <hi rend="i"
											>erythrocephalum</hi> given to this grasshopper by Davis.</p>
									<p>The known range of <hi rend="i">O. erythrocephalum</hi> extends from central
										New Jersey southwest along the coast to southern Florida, Mobile, Ala., and
										southern Mississippi, and inland to Raleigh, N. Car., Macon, Ga., and
										Agricultural College, Miss. As will be noted by the measurements it varies much
										in size, the northern specimens being the smaller. It has been taken at various
										points in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey and about Norfolk and Cape Henry, Va.
											<bibl>Davis (1905)</bibl> says that in life "its most noticeable feature is a
										very red face, often the whole head being of a blood red color. It appears as if
										the insect had eaten of ripe cranberries and gotten its head stained with the
										fruit, for the color is the same. About Lakehurst it is far more common than <hi
											rend="i">O. vulgare</hi>."</p>
									<p><bibl>Fox (1914, 527)</bibl> states that it is apparently restricted to
										sphagnum bogs, where it frequents the dense growth of chain fern, tall sedges,
										rushes and associated plants. Of its occurrence about Cape Henry, Va., he says
										(1917) : "In addition to being common in the rank vegetation of dune hollows and
										ditches, it was not infrequent in the tall bunch grasses on the surrounding dry
										sand dunes. Farther inland it appeared to prefer areas of stiff, but not always
										moist soil, occurring in the rank plant growth of ditches, woodland borders and
										scrub. It evidently has a strong predilection for sylvan surroundings."</p>
									<p>I have not taken <hi rend="i">erythrocephalum</hi> in Florida but it has been
										recorded from a number of localities as far south as Everglade, being apparently
										more common in the northern third of the State. There it occurs for the most
										part in wet grassy spots along the edges of hammocks and in palmetto
										barrens.</p>

									<p>This meadow grasshopper is probably the most abundant member of the family
										Tettigoniidæ found in Indiana. It begins to reach maturity in the central part
										of the State about July 10th, and more frequently than any other of our species
										of <hi rend="i">Orchelimum</hi> is found in upland localities, along fence rows,
										and in clover and timothy meadows. In early autumn it seems to be very fond of
										resting on the leaves and stems of the ironweed, <hi rend="i">Vernonia
											fasciculata</hi> Michx., so common in many blue-grass pastures.</p>
									<p>At times <hi rend="i">O. vulgare</hi> appears to be somewhat carnivorous in
										habit, as, on two occasions, I have discovered it feeding upon the bodies of
										small moths which in some way it had managed to capture; while on another date I
										surprised a female on the flowers of a golden-rod, feasting upon a soldier
										beetle, <hi rend="i">Chauliognathus pennsylvanicus</hi> DeG. According to
											<bibl>Hancock (1904)</bibl> it is not only carnivorous but also a cannibal, as
										a female kept in captivity captured her mate and "holding his body between her
										fore legs ate the larger portion of the soft parts, after first eating a hole in
										the back." He suggests that the "long spines of the fore and middle tibiæ are
										occasionally used and connected in this species with its carnivorous
										habits."</p>
									<p><hi rend="i">O. vulgare</hi> is not only the most common member of the genus
										locally but is more widely distributed than any other, its known range extending
										from southern Maine and southern Quebec, north and west through Ontario to
										northern Minnesota, Colorado and eastern Wyoming, and south and southwest to
										North Carolina, Macon, Ga. (Fox), northwestern Arkansas and northeastern Texas.
										The larger, longer winged individuals have by many writers, including myself
										(1903, 385) been wrongfully recorded as <hi rend="i">O. glaberrimum</hi>
										(Burm.), a species which R. &amp; H. aver replaces <hi rend="i">vulgare</hi> in
										the southern states and which I have included above as <hi rend="i">O.
											erythrocephalum</hi> Davis.</p>


									<pb id="VAB8231-545" n="544"/>

									<p>In Ontario <bibl>Walker (1905, 34)</bibl> found <hi rend="i">vulgare</hi> "the
										only species of <hi rend="i">Orchelimum</hi> distributed generally over a large
										part of the province. It becomes gradually scarcer to the north of Lake Simcoe,
										and, I believe, does not range much farther north than Muskoka. Where found it
										is usually common in upland fields as well as low meadows and is fond of
										perching in clumps of tall grass. It reaches maturity in this latitude towards
										the end of July and lasts until about the beginning of October."</p>
									<p>Scudder set the call note of the male of <hi rend="i">O. vulgare</hi> to scale
										and (1893, 73) wrote of it as follows: <q rend="blockquote">
											<p>"When about to sing on a hot, sunny day, the male mounts a stalk of grass
												to about a foot from the ground where it clings with its four front legs,
												allowing its hind legs to dangle on either side of the stalk that they may
												not interfere with the movements of the tegmina. Beginning with <hi rend="i"
													>ts</hi> it changes almost instantly to a trill of <hi rend="i">zr</hi>;
												at first there is a crescendo movement which reaches its volume in half a
												second; the trill is then sustained for a period varying from one to twenty
												seconds (generally from six to eight seconds), and closes abruptly with <hi
													rend="i">p</hi>. This strain is followed by a series of very short
												staccato notes sounding like <hi rend="i">jip, jip, jip,</hi> repeated at
												half second intervals; the staccato notes and the trill alternate <hi
													rend="i">ad libitum</hi>. The staccato notes may be continued almost
												indefinitely, but are very rarely heard more than ten times in direct
												succession; they ordinarily occur three or four times before the repetition
												of the phrase, but not more than two or three times when the phrase is not
												repeated. The night song differs from that of the day in the rarer
												occurrence of the intermediate notes and the less rapid trill of the phrase;
												the pitch of both is at B flat."</p>

									</p>

									<p><bibl>Hancock (1904)</bibl> has given an excellent description of the
										egg-laying habits of <hi rend="i">O. vulgare (glaberrimum)</hi> in captivity,
										from which I quote as follows: <q rend="blockquote">
											<p>"On the 6th of September a female was noticed exhibiting rather restless
												actions among the loosely spread stems of one of the boquets of flowers, and
												soon after I found her ovipositing in a stem of the bur marigold. Before
												selecting the marigold as the proper plant for her immediate needs, she
												tested a number of different kinds of plants by biting the stems. When at
												last the coveted stem was found, she started very vigorously biting, moving
												her head from side to side in an endeavor to get a stronger hold with her
												jaws. A gash into the outer layer of the stem was soon made, about an eighth
												of an inch in length, the insect finally going back over the course of the
												incision with the evident purpose of more deeply penetrating to the pith.
												During this first stage in the process the female stood with her head
												directed downwards, but as soon as the spot was prepared with the mouth she
												reversed her body preparatory to the act of oviposition. Firmly grasping the
												plant stem with her feet she curved the abdomen underneath, at the same time
												bringing the pointed extremity of the ovipositor into the breach made in the
												stem. Now she stood with her ovipositor under the abdomen with the blades
												slightly imbedded, but <pb id="VAB8231-546" n="545"/> gradually as it was
												worked within the stem she almost imperceptibly moved forward a little at a
												time Finally when the ovipositor was buried to its utmost length it was
												directed backwards. It was now appreciated how well adapted the beautiful
												curve and structure of the organ are for this purpose. A moment later the
												blades were spread apart, allowing the elongate egg to be lodged within the
												center of the pith, the latter having been pressed to either side for the
												accommodation of the egg. As soon as the first egg was deposited, she
												withdrew the ovipositor and immediately turning around she again bit the
												same spot, spending several minutes chewing the fibers and pinching the
												sides together with her powerful jaws. This was done in order to use the
												same opening to deposit the second egg. She next moved a little way down the
												stem, but this time her head was directed downwards so that she might insert
												the ovipositor in the same hole, but deposit the second egg in a reversed
												position to that of the first. When the third and fourth eggs were about to
												be deposited she moved down the stem to a new site about half an inch away,
												varying the distance, and the process with its several stages was repeated
												The interior of the stem was finally filled for a considerable distance with
												eggs, about ten minutes being consumed in the deposition of each one, nine
												incisions being made in the one stem and 18 eggs deposited. It may be of
												interest to note that <bibl>Riley (1884, 187)</bibl> mentions that this
												species oviposits in the stems of various pithy plants, and especially in
												the tassel stem of Indian corn."</p>

									<p>Notwithstanding its wide distribution and common occurrence <hi rend="i">O.
											vulgare</hi> has not a single synonym. <bibl>Redtenbacher (1891, 500)</bibl>
										placed <hi rend="i">vulgare</hi> as a synonym of DeGeer's <hi rend="i">Xiphidium
											agile</hi>, stating as his reason for so doing that Harris and Scudder had
										separated the two "on account of small differences in the color and size of the
										wing covers, as well as in the length of the ovipositor." I pointed out (1903,
										384) that his relative measurements of <hi rend="i">X. agile</hi> as given, did
										not agree with specimens of undoubted <hi rend="i">vulgare</hi> in my
										possession, and retained the latter species as distinct. In this I have been

									<p><bibl>R. &amp; H. (1915a, 53)</bibl> have made this a synonym of <hi rend="i"
											>O. laticauda</hi>
										<bibl>Redt. (1891, 504)</bibl> described from a single female taken at New
										Orleans, La. This was done without examination of the type of <hi rend="i"
											>laticauda</hi> and only by comparison with Redtenbacher's brief description.
										In this there are several notable discrepancies, when compared with undoubted
										specimens of <hi rend="i">O. pulchellum</hi>, viz.: "lobi lateralis pronoti
										margine postico sinuato." This is not true of <hi rend="i">pulchellum</hi> and
										R. &amp; H., in their key to females of <hi rend="i">Orchelimum</hi> separate
											<hi rend="i">laticauda</hi> from <hi rend="i">nigripes</hi> by the former
										having the "caudal margin of lateral lobes gently arcuate ventrad of humeral
										sinus," whereas in <hi rend="i">nigripes</hi> it is said to be "sinuate or
										subsinuate ventrad." Again, Redtenbacher says: "Elytra femora postica valde
										superantia, alis multo breviora," whereas in <hi rend="i">pulchellum</hi> the
										tegmina at most surpass the hind femora 3--4 mm., and are only 3--4 mm. shorter
										than the wings. Finally Redtenbacher in his key separates <hi rend="i"
											>laticauda</hi> from four other species by its having the "femora postica
										utrinque spinulosa," while in <hi rend="i">pulchellum</hi>, as R. &amp; H.
										admit, "the vast majority have the internal margin unarmed." What <hi rend="i"
											>laticauda</hi> was or is I know not nor do I believe any one else can tell
										without an examination of the type. I have therefore restored the name given by
										Davis to this grasshopper.</p>
									<p>Of the types of this species Davis wrote: "When seen in life the insect is
										particularly beautiful and is conspicuous for its bottle-green colored tegmina,
										with a bluish tinge, its lemon-yellow markings and its reddish legs. Its song
										was a zip, zip, zip-z, z, z,--zip, zip, zip-z, z, z,--quite a distinguishable
										song from that of <hi rend="i">O. vulgare</hi>."</p>
									<p>The range of <hi rend="i">laticauda</hi> so-called by R. &amp; H., including
											<hi rend="i">pulchellum</hi> Davis, is given by them (1915a, 54) as "Covering
										the Atlantic Coastal Plain region from north central New Jersey south to
										southern Florida, westward to New Orleans, La.; in the eastern states occurring
										at suitable valley localities in the Piedmont region above the fall line." In
										Florida it has been recorded from Atlantic Beach, Jacksonville, Ortega, Sanford,
										Palatka, Detroit, Lakeland and Chokoloskee, most of the records being made under
										the names <hi rend="i">nitidum</hi> and <hi rend="i">pulchellum</hi>.</p>
									<p>McAtee and Caudell record (1917) <hi rend="i">pulchellum</hi> (under the name
											<hi rend="i">laticauda</hi>) from numerous localities about Washington, D. C.,
										and <bibl>Fox (1917)</bibl> states that about Tappahannock, Va., it is
										"occasional in a variety of situations, occurring regularly in tidal and fresh
										water marshes and pond borders, but the males, at least, spreading in small
										numbers to upland districts where the <pb id="VAB8231-549" n="548"/> species was
										taken in a field of dense millet and in a thick growth of ragweed bordering the
										fence of a town lot. In the tidal marshes it was found in the tall marsh-grass,
											<hi rend="i">Spartina cynosuroides</hi> (L.) and in a marginal fringe of
										switch-grasses. In fresh water bogs it was taken on various grasses, cat-tails,
										sedges and bushes. Unlike most members of the genus it appears to have a strong
										preference for woodland habitats."</p>

									<p>Tippecanoe Co., Ind., three males, five females (<hi rend="i">Fox</hi>). This
										is the <hi rend="i">Orchelimum</hi> recorded by <bibl>Fox (1915, 318)</bibl> as
											"<hi rend="i">O. nigripes</hi> Scudd. (variety.") He states: "On October 13
										and 14 I found a form of this genus in a cat-tail marsh on the upland northwest
										of Lafayette which I was unable to determine, but which Mr. Rehn, to whom I
										submitted specimens, informs me is a race of <hi rend="i">O. nigripes</hi> from
										the typical form of which it differs in the absence of black from the tibiæ and,
										so far as my Lafayette material is concerned, in its somewhat greater size. On
										the dates mentioned it literally swarmed in the mixed cat-tail and rice
										cut-grass areas of the marsh, but was entirely lacking in the marginal
										thickets."</p>
									<p>That this is a very distinct species from both <hi rend="i">nigripes</hi> and
											<hi rend="i">pulchellum</hi> is shown by the differences I have pointed out in
										key and description. I was at first inclined to consider it an undescribed form,
										but Dr. Fox, who made for me a drawing of the male cercus, called my attention
										to its close similarity to that of <hi rend="i">bullatum</hi> as figured by R.
										&amp; H. A comparison with their description <pb id="VAB8231-550" n="549"/>
										shows that while the Indiana males are somewhat smaller than the measurements
										given, they agree otherwise so closely that there is little doubt but that they
										represent the northern form of that species, hitherto known only from Louisiana
										and eastern Texas. R. &amp; H. state that in Texas it was "found frequenting
										high grasses along streams or in depressions. The note was a long buzzing <hi
											rend="i">zeececee</hi> somewhat resembling that of some cicadas, with but few
										interspersed clicking sounds."</p>

									<p>Next to <hi rend="i">O. vulgare</hi> this handsome black-legged grasshopper is
										the most common Conocephalid in Indiana, occurring by hundreds about the margins
										of every lake, pond and marsh in the State. It is essentially a lowland or
										hygrophilous species and is seldom found about the drier uplands where <hi
											rend="i">vulgare</hi> has its favorite haunts. It reaches maturity about July
										20, and frequents the tall grasses and especially the stems and leaves of the
										different species of smartweed, <hi rend="i">Polygonum</hi>, growing in the
										shallow water of the larger ponds and lakes. Near Lafayette <hi rend="i">Fox
											(1915)</hi> found it "an abundant and characteristic species of open grassy
										bogs and damp situations generally, being especially common in the rice
										cutgrass, <hi rend="i">Homalocenchrus oryzoides</hi> (L.)." Examples of the
										parasitic hairworm, <hi rend="i">Gordius sp. ?</hi>, have been taken from the
										abdomens of a number of specimens.</p>

									<p>The type of Scudder was from Dallas, Texas, and the species has its main
										distribution west of the Mississippi, ranging from Ohio and southern Ontario
										south to Tennessee and Louisiana, and west to Colorado and central Texas. Of its
										habits in Ontario <bibl>Walker (1905, 36)</bibl> has written: "On August 7,
										1901, while collecting at Point Pelee in a low woods bordering a stream, I heard
										a sound very like the stridulation of <hi rend="i">O. vulgare</hi>, but more
										subdued, the "zips" coming at much shorter intervals, and more of them produced
										at a time. I succeeded in tracing the song to its source and found an <hi
											rend="i">Orchelimum</hi> quite new to me which proved to be <hi rend="i">O.
											nigripes</hi>. Another male was taken in the same way, and I heard others but
										was unable to find them. In several cases the sound proceeded from trees at a
										height of some ten or fifteen feet, but as a rule it came from tall weeds and
										vines which grow in great luxuriance upon the rich black soil."</p>
									<p>At Moline, Ill., <bibl>McNeill (1891, 25)</bibl> found it "about as common as
											<hi rend="i">vulgare</hi>. It is not at all shy but even shows a preference, I
										have thought, for human society. I have known a male to keep a place over the
										wooden finish of a doorway for more than a week. If he ate during that time he
										must have been obliged to leave his post to satisfy his hunger and he probably
										returned many times to the place. The song is difficult to distinguish with
										certainty from that of <hi rend="i">vulgare</hi> but usually the <hi rend="i"

										/> feet, and the vicinity of Washington, D. C. Bruner's type was from the
										District of Columbia and was very briefly described. It appears to be a
										pine-loving arboreal species and <bibl>Davis (1904)</bibl> has given an
										interesting account of its habits from which I quote as follows: <q
											rend="blockquote">
											<p>"Those who visit the pine-barrens of New Jersey know what a pleasure it is
												to ramble along the narrow wooded-paths among the pine trees; old paths that
												after once being made continue for many years, and may seldom entertain a
												pedestrian. Along these paths and by the side of the sandy roads, any time
												during late summer and until frost, one may hear a faint, lisping little
												song from a grasshopper coming from the pines, often from their topmost
												branches. It is an easy matter to climb the pitchpine, which is usually
												arranged admirably for the purpose, and the grasshopper is also friendly to
												investigation, and commonly continues to stridulate.</p>
											<p>"Two stout insect-nets clapped together suddenly about the center of the
												music will often disclose the grasshopper in one of them, but not always. He
												is a tree-loving insect, and being subject to the tossings of the wind,
												holds on tighter than most grasshoppers that I have had dealings with. It
												is, in fact, the only arboreal <hi rend="i">Orchelimum</hi> that I have
												found in New Jersey.</p>
											<p>"Sometimes <hi rend="i">Orchelimum minor</hi> can be observed on the low
												branches of a pine especially if the tree stands in the open, and the insect
												may occasionally be beaten into an umbrella. When the trunks of the pines
												are 'sugared' for moths the little <hi rend="i">minor</hi> also attends,
												and, like many other members of the genus, it is active and musical both by
												day and night."</p>
										</q>
									</p>

									<p>Of its habits in Georgia <bibl>Allard (1910b, 35)</bibl> wrote: "Its notes are
										a succession of brief, feeble, silken lisps followed by a pause about as long,
										then repeated <hi rend="i">s-s-s-s-s-s--s-s-s-s-s-s--s-s-s-s-s-s</hi>. I hear it
										during the warm, sunny hours of the day, even in the high-crowned pines around
										my house. So faint and fugacious are its notes that it is probably never
										identified by ordinary ears. If a good breeze is blowing, the feeble lisps are
										lost amidst the sighing and rustle of the pines upon which they dwell. In no
										manner do the notes to me recall those of any other <hi rend="i"
										>Orchelimum</hi>. The short staccato lisps so characteristic of the songs of
										most <hi rend="i">Orchelimums</hi> are entirely wanting and the tone quality
										more nearly resembles the leg and wing stridulations of some of the Stenobothri
										than the Orchelimums."</p>

									<p><bibl>R. &amp; H. (1915a, 60)</bibl> have restored the <hi rend="i">O.

										probably correct as regards <hi rend="i">indianense</hi>, although Scudder gave

										later writings Scudder regarded his <hi rend="i">concinnum</hi> as a synonym of
											<hi rend="i">herbaceum</hi>
										<bibl>Serv. (1839, 524)</bibl>, a name which R. &amp; H. have placed with a

											>fidicinium</hi> and, until we have some positive information of this sort we
										do not care to replace a well understood name by another of doubtful status." It
										would have been better if the same course had been followed with <hi rend="i">O.
											agile, glaberrimum, nitidum</hi> and <hi rend="i">laticauda</hi>.</p>
									<p>Scudder's types of <hi rend="i">concinnum</hi> were from Cape Cod, Mass., and

										Mississippi, central Texas and New Mexico.</p>
									<p>In Florida it has been taken by me at Dunedin in December and January from tall

									<p>Under the name of <hi rend="i">O. indianense</hi>

												which lived on these prairies, and in making the trip to the Chase Prairies
												in September, 1913, I found these grasshoppers in great abundance in the
												grass-like plants growing out of the water or along the banks of the old
												canal. As the boat approached them they jumped from the grass into the

									<bibl>Thunberg, 1815, 271</bibl>. (Gr., "conical" + "head")<lb/> THE SMALLER
									MEADOW GRASSHOPPERS.</head>

								<p>This genus, the <hi rend="i">Xiphidion</hi> or <hi rend="i">Xiphidium</hi> of
									most recent writers and of my former work (1903, 371), comprises the smallest of
									our winged Tettigoniidæ. The genus is very close to <hi rend="i">Orchelimum</hi>,
									the characters given in the generic key, p. 534 being the principal ones used for
									their separation. In addition, as stated by <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1915b, 156)</bibl>,
									in <hi rend="i">Conocephalus</hi> "the stridulating field of the male tegmen is
									normally smaller, narrower and less extensive than in <hi rend="i"
									>Orchelimum</hi>, the vicinity of the arcuate vein not strongly produced or
									overhanging and, when looking from the dorsum, the humeral trunk is never hidden.
									The male cerci, though variable, do not in any of our species, exhibit the type
									found in the majority of the species of <hi rend="i">Orchelimum</hi> in which the
									tooth is placed in a more or less decided socket-like depression. All of the
									American species have the cerci unispinose and the subgenital plate is truncate
									distad in the great majority of them." The ovipositor is for the most part
									straight and often of great length, though distinctly curved in <hi rend="i">C.
										nemoralis</hi> and evidently though faintly so in a few other forms. As already
									noted under <hi rend="i">Orchelimum</hi>, all these minor differences are
									comparative only, there being not a single fixed differential character to
									distinguish the two genera. Their separation in literature is therefore really
									more a matter of convenience for treatment of an otherwise very bulky aggregation
									of forms than a natural grouping of allied insects.</p>
								<p>The tegmina and wings of most of the species of <hi rend="i">Conocephalus</hi>
									are dimorphic in length. A smaller number are dimorphic in color, while a few
									possess ovipositors differing greatly in length. The variations in wing length and
									color in the same species seem to be abrupt, with no intervening forms. There are
									long-winged and short-winged forms of the same species, but none with the wings of
									medium length; and when a brown form is tinged with green, or vice versa, the
									amount of the different color varies but little. Ten of the 13 eastern species are
									thus dimorphic as regards the length of the wings, the short-winged individuals,
									as far as my observation goes, far outnumbering those with the wings fully
									developed All the macropterous forms have the wings <pb id="VAB8231-564" n="563"/>
									passing the tegmina 2 to 4 mm., while in the brachypterous forms the tegmina are
									as long as or longer than the wings. Of the variations in the length of the
									tegmina <bibl>Bruner (1891, 59)</bibl> has well said: "In the genera <hi rend="i"
										>Xiphidium</hi> and <hi rend="i">Orchelimum</hi> wing length is a character not
									to be relied upon as a specific or even varietal difference"; yet Redtenbacher, in
									his "Monographie der Conocephaliden," separated a number of his species by this
									character alone, and I can find no mention in his work of the fact that such a
									variation exists.</p>
								<p>The majority of the inland species of <hi rend="i">Conocephalus</hi> are more
									xerophytic in habitat than those of <hi rend="i">Orchelimum</hi>, occurring for
									the most part in dry upland localities rather than in marshes or about the margins
									of lakes and streams. The borders of cultivated fields, orchards and gardens,
									edges of thickets and clumps of vines or briers in open woodland are their
									favorite abiding places. The call notes of the males are in general lower, softer
									and more lisping than those of the same sex of <hi rend="i">Orchelimum</hi>.
										<bibl>Allard, (1914)</bibl> writes of these notes as follows: <q
										rend="blockquote">
										<p>"Very noticeable differences in the manner of stridulation characterize many
											of the species of <hi rend="i">Xiphidion</hi>. According to the character of
											the notes these insects may be grouped into three classes. Those of the first
											class always produce a few, brief staccato lisps followed by a more or less
											prolonged, lisping, monotone, or in the case of <hi rend="i">X. nemorale</hi>
											the staccato lisps precede from two to thirty-two brief phrases rapidly
											repeated, A number of Xiphidions in this class stridulate in quite the same
											manner as the more common species of <hi rend="i">Orchelimum</hi>. Although
											barely audible, the stridulations of <hi rend="i">X. fasciatum</hi> in
											delivery and duration are an almost perfect reproduction of the staccato lisps
											and succeeding monotone characteristic of <hi rend="i">Orchelimum vulgare</hi>
											or <hi rend="i">O. molossum</hi>.</p>
										<p>"The notes of Xiphidions in the second class consist of weak, lisping phrases
											alone, as staccato lisps are quite wanting. The stridulations of <hi rend="i"
												>X. allardi</hi> are of this character. Among the <hi rend="i"
												>Orchelimums</hi> this is also the habit of stridulation of <hi rend="i">O.
												minor</hi>. In the stridulations of Xiphidions of the third class, staccato
											lisps are also wanting, but the note is a long-continued, lisping monotone,
											similar to that of some of the cone-headed grasshoppers, although not nearly
											as loud and penetrating. <hi rend="i">X. strictum</hi> stridulates in this
											manner."</p>

								</p>

								<p>The reasons for the replacement of the well known generic name <hi rend="i"
										>Xiphidium</hi> by <hi rend="i">Conocephalus</hi>, a name formerly used for the
									large cone-heads now placed under <hi rend="i">Neoconocephalus</hi>, are set forth
									by <bibl>Caudell (1910a)</bibl> and by <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1915b, 156)</bibl>, as
									follows: "In 1815 Thunberg erected the genus <hi rend="i">Conocephalus</hi>
									including in it 24 species; under one of these <hi rend="i">C. hemipterus</hi> (p.
									272) he placed as a synonym <hi rend="i">Locusta conocephalus</hi> of Fabricius,
									which citation <pb id="VAB8231-565" n="564"/> forms, under the International
									nomenclature rules, type designation by tautonomy and in consequence the species
									becomes the type of the genus <hi rend="i">Conocephalus</hi>."<ref id="ref_072"
										rend="super" target="note_072">69</ref></p>
								<p><bibl>Kirby (1906, 274)</bibl> did not adopt this ruling but included the species
									formerly known as <hi rend="i">Xiphidion</hi>
									<bibl>Serv. (1831)</bibl> and <hi rend="i">Xiphidium</hi>
									<bibl>Burmeister (1838)</bibl> under the name <hi rend="i">Anisoptera</hi>
									<bibl>Latreille (1829)</bibl> which has priority over both. While I personally
									believe that the International ruling in this case is technical, arbitrary and
									nonsensical, I have followed it for two reasons. <hi rend="i">(a)</hi> It has been
									adopted by R. &amp; H. in their synopsis of the genus and by other recent American
									writers, and not to adopt it would cause more confusion than even now exists. <hi
										rend="i">(b)</hi> If not adopted the name <hi rend="i">Anisoptera</hi> would
									have priority over <hi rend="i">Xiphidion</hi> and <hi rend="i">Xiphidium</hi> and
									a change of name would anyhow be necessary.</p>
								<p>The genus <hi rend="i">Conocephalus</hi> as here recognized comprises a large
									number of species and is represented in all parts of the world. Kirby included 91
									species under <hi rend="i">Anisoptera</hi>, 14 of which were from the United
									States, but of these several are known synonyms. Since his catalogue appeared
									seven additional species have been described by Caudell, R. &amp; H. and Fox. In
									their synopsis of the North American forms R. &amp; H. recognized 16 species and
									one variety. Of these 13 occur in the territory covered by this work. The portions
									of the following key pertaining to the male cerci and other characters of that sex
									are based largely on the key of R. &amp; H. in their synopsis which was for the
									males only.</p>

								<p>This handsome little meadow grasshopper is abundant throughout Indiana in timothy
									and clover meadows and especially so about small streams in low-ground, blue-grass
									pastures. It is one of the first of the Tettigoniidæ to reach maturity, specimens
									having been taken in Vigo County as early as July 5, and it may be found until
									mid-October. In Florida it is also a common species having been taken by me at
									Gainesville, Lakeland and Dunedin, Oct. 24--Jan. 26, and recorded by other
									collectors from numerous stations, as far south as Miami and Detroit, but not from
									the southern keys. About Dunedin it occurs in old fields, along railway
									embankments and among the undergrowth in open pine woods. If no frosts occur
									adults are found until midwinter, and nymphs are very frequent in March and
									April.</p>
								<p>The known range of <hi rend="i">C. fasciatus</hi> is probably the widest of any
									American Tettigoniid, extending from New England and Nova Scotia north and west to
									Aweme, Manitoba, Wyoming and New Mexico, and south at least to Bermuda, southern
									Florida and northern Mexico. <bibl>Piers (1918, 324)</bibl> records it as very
									common throughout Nova Scotia, where it is the only true meadow grasshopper known.
									He says: "It frequents damp situations such as wet meadows and marshes and is
									found among moist thick patches of succulent and rank-growing grasses. Adults are
									met with from the middle of July until after hoar-frosts. The stridulation of the
									male is rather weak and to me sounds like the syllables, <hi rend="i"
										>plee-e-e-e-e-e, tzit, tzit, tzit, tzit</hi>, the first part of the call being a
									rapid, vibrating note." <bibl>Walker (1904, 338)</bibl> says it is much the most
									abundant locustid found in Ontario, being as abundant at North Bay as along the
									southern boundary, adults appearing about mid-July and remaining until
									October.</p>
								<p><bibl>Allard (1911)</bibl> notes its habits in New England as follows: "The tiny
										<hi rend="i">Xiphidium fasciatum</hi> DeGeer prefers the tangles of weeds and
									grasses bordering the grass fields, and may oftentimes <pb id="VAB8231-570"
										n="569"/> be found in large colonies. Its notes are extremely faint and in
									manner of delivery are the exact counterpart of an <hi rend="i">Orchelimum's</hi>
									notes. The staccato lisps nearly always precede the phrase <hi rend="i"
										>tseeeeeeeeeeeeeee</hi>. The entire song may be written thus: <hi rend="i"
										>Tip-tip-tip-tseeeeeeeeeeeeee</hi>. The entire stridulation is so faint as to
									almost escape the hearing. The staccato lisps <hi rend="i">tip-tip-tip</hi> were

								<p>An abundant species throughout Indiana, frequenting the same localities as <hi

										rend="i">X. ensifer</hi>
									<bibl>Scudder (1862, 451)</bibl>, described from Illinois has, as suggested by me
									(1903, 375), been shown to be only a large form of <pb id="VAB8231-572" n="571"/>
									<hi rend="i">C. brevipennis</hi> and has been placed by R. &amp; H. as a synonym
									of that species.</p>
								<p>This larger form differs from other meadow grasshoppers in the manner of
									oviposition, as, instead of always depositing its eggs in the stems of grasses, it
									sometimes seeks the turnip-shaped gall so common on certain species of <hi
										rend="i">Salix</hi> (willow), and oviposits between their scales. The gall is
									not formed by the grasshopper, but by a dipterous insect belonging to the family
										<hi rend="i">Cecidomyidæ</hi>. Although I have never seen the eggs deposited I
									have on a number of occasions found them within the galls, but did not know to
									what insect they belonged until <bibl>Wheeler (1890)</bibl> published his
									excellent account of the oviposition of this species as noted in Wisconsin. From
									that I quote as follows: <q rend="blockquote">
										<p>"On September 8th I observed a female in the act of oviposition. She was
											perched with her head turned toward the apex of the gall. Slowly and sedately
											she thrust her sword-like ovipositor down between the leaves, and, after
											depositing an egg, as slowly withdrew the organ in order to recommence the
											same operation, after taking a few steps to one side of where she had been at
											work. She soon observed me and slipped away without completing her task. The
											number of eggs found in a gall varies considerably. Sometimes but two or three
											will be found, more frequently from 50 to 100. In one small gall I counted
											170. The egg is cream-colored, very thin, elongate oval in outline, and
											measures 4x1 mm."<ref id="ref_073" rend="super" target="note_073">70</ref>

								<p>In Indiana the young of <hi rend="i">C. brevipennis</hi> emerge about the middle
									of May and reach maturity about August 10. One which was still in the nymph stage
									on October 21st, was found to have a white hairworm, <hi rend="i">Gordius sp?</hi>
									eight and a half inches long in its abdomen. The development of the nymph had
									probably been retarded by the presence of the parasite. Long-winged forms of this
									species are occasionally met with, but I have taken only one, and R. &amp; H.
									state that only 3.2 per cent of the 555 specimens examined by them were
									macropterous. Two macropterous females sent in by Hubbell from Jackson Co., Mich.,
									vary but slightly in size, yet the ovipositors measure respectively 9.3 and 12 mm.
									in length.</p>
								<p>The known range of <hi rend="i">C. brevipennis</hi> is a wide one, extending from
									Maine and Montreal north and west to Algonquin Park, Ontario, northern Minnesota
									and Nebraska, and south and southwest to northern Florida and Dallas, Texas. In

									"nearly as common as <hi rend="i">fasciatus</hi> in southern Ontario, but becomes
									scarcer to the north of Muskoka. It reaches maturity about the first of August and

								<p>Of the song of <hi rend="i">C. brevipennis</hi>
									<bibl>Allard (1911)</bibl> has written: <q rend="blockquote">
										<p>"I could not determine its stridulations in the field, so a number of males
											and females were placed in a pasteboard box together with some grass. In a few
											minutes a number were in continuous song throughout the afternoon and night.
											The stridulations of this <hi rend="i">Xiphidium</hi> are the least audible of
											any locust the writer has ever observed. Although a persistent singer, the
											notes become inaudible only a few feet away. In the fields they are quite lost
											amidst the sounds of rustling foliage, the chirpings of crickets, etc. The
											notes of <hi rend="i">brevipenne</hi> are very brief and much more hurried in
											their delivery than those of <hi rend="i">X. fasciatum</hi>. In this respect
											they approach more nearly the dainty stridulations of <hi rend="i">X.
												nemorale</hi> Scudd. In the song of <hi rend="i">brevipenne</hi> usually
											only one or two almost inaudible staccato lisps precede one, two or even three
											of the brief, faint phrases, <hi rend="i">tseeeeeee-tseeeeeee</hi>. These are

								<p>This handsome brown species is a common insect in central <pb id="VAB8231-574"
										n="573"/> and southern Indiana, but has not yet been taken north of Lafayette.
									It reaches maturity about August 1st, and from then until after heavy frosts may
									be found in numbers along the borders of dry, upland woods, fence rows, and
									roadsides, where it delights to rest on the low shrubs, blackberry bushes, or
									coarse weeds usually growing in such localities. On sunny afternoons of mid-autumn
									it is especially abundant on the lower parts of the rail and board fences, the
									male uttering his faint and monotonous love call--a sort of <hi rend="i"
										>ch-e-e-e-e--ch-e-e-e-e</hi>, continuously repeated--the female but a short
									distance away, a motionless, patient, and apparently attentive listener. When in
										<hi rend="i">coitu</hi> the male does not mount the back of the female, but,
									with his body reversed, is dragged about by her, this being the common practice of
									all the species of <hi rend="i">Conocephalus</hi> and <hi rend="i"
									>Orchelimum</hi>. The females at times evidently oviposit in decaying wood, as on
									several occasions I have found them on old fence posts and rails with their
									ovipositors inserted the full length in the wood.</p>
								<p>The types of Scudder were from Dallas Co., Iowa, and the known range of <hi
										rend="i">nemoralis</hi> extends from eastern New York and Pennsylvania north and
									west to Minnesota and Lincoln, Nebr., and south and southwest to Asheville, N.
									Car., Clarksville, Tenn., and Wichita, Kansas. It is not known from Michigan but
									Bruner says it is common in the wooded portions of Nebraska, and McAtee and
									Caudell mention it as the most common species of the genus about Washington, D. C.
									At Moline, Ill., <bibl>McNeill (1891)</bibl> found it "most commonly on sparsely
									wooded and rather barren hillsides. The song is louder than that of <hi rend="i"
										>fasciatum</hi>. It consists of two parts, the first a short, abrupt <hi
										rend="i">zip</hi>, and the second the familiar <hi rend="i">z-e-e</hi>, which

								<p>This is a common species in the western a n d northern parts of Indiana, where it
									frequents, for the most part, dry upland meadows, open pastures and prairies, and
									reaches maturity about August 1st. The mature females are usually much more
									abundant than the males and vary much in size. It is an active leaper and tumbler
									and like several of its allies, often strives to escape detection by burrowing
									beneath fallen weeds and grasses. About Lafayette <bibl>Fox (1915)</bibl> found it
									"abundant in dry open grass land and a common associate of <hi rend="i">Syrbula
										admirabilis</hi> (Uhler). Adults were taken July 31, were common until Sept. 5,
									but by October 3 had become very scarce." The long-winged form is everywhere very
									scarce, only one female from Vigo County having been noted in Indiana, while R.
									&amp; H. report only eleven in more than 500 adults examined. The species is the
									largest of the genus occurring in the United States and the range in the length of
									the ovipositor is greater than in any other, being over 14 mm.</p>
								<p>The types of Scudder were from Dallas, Texas, but it is known from Staten Island,
									N. Y., north and west to western South Dakota and Nebraska and south and southwest
									to North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas and Arizona. <bibl>Mead (1904)</bibl> reported
									it as common in central and northern Ohio, but in Michigan it is known only from
									Washtenaw County. In Virginia <bibl>Fox (1917)</bibl> found it <pb

									grasslands, especially partial to <hi rend="i">Andropogon</hi>, but taken also on
										<hi rend="i">Danthonia</hi>." In the dune region of northwestern Illinois Hart
									found it "common in damp grassy bottoms of old blow-outs," and in Nebraska
										<bibl>Bruner (1893a)</bibl> says it "is found over the entire State but is more
									common southward than elsewhere." Regarding the song of the male, <bibl>Allard
										(1914)</bibl> says: <q rend="blockquote">
										<p>"The notes of this species are much louder than those of any <hi rend="i"
												>Xiphidion</hi> known to me. No staccato lisps precede the long lisping
											monotone <hi rend="i">s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s</hi>, which may continue several

								<p>This, one of,the most handsome of North American Orthoptera, occurs in suitable
									localities throughout Indiana, but is nowhere very common. It is a hygrophilous
									species, inhabiting only the margins of streams, ditches, large ponds and lakes,
									where it abides in the tall, rank grasses and sedges growing in the shade. It
									reaches the perfect stage about July 1st in southern Indiana, and in Fulton County
									has been taken as late as October 24th. The males leap actively when approached.
									The females are more clumsy and usually dive headlong into a bunch of fallen
									grass. They can then be most readily captured by clasping the hand about a bunch
									of grass stems or branches of shrubs, on the under side of which the insects have
									taken refuge. The long-winged form is very rare but a single female from Wells
									County being in the collection at hand. About Lafayette, <bibl>Fox (1915,
										33)</bibl> found <hi rend="i">nigropleurus</hi> frequent in herbaceous thickets,
									especially those forming the margins of bogs dominated by the rice cut-grass, <hi
										rend="i">Homalocenchrus oryzoides</hi> (L.), in both open and woodland
									situations and usually associated with <hi rend="i">Orchelimum nigripes</hi>
									Scudd."</p>
								<p>The known range of <hi rend="i">nigropleurus</hi> is somewhat limited, extending
									from Ithaca, N. Y., and southwestern Ontario west to Wisconsin and Nebraska, and
									south, so far as recorded, only to the Ohio River in Indiana. Bruner's types were
									from eastern Nebraska, and of its habits in that State he wrote: "This beautiful
									insect, which is our most active species of the genus, is quite plentiful among
									the rank vegetation on low moist ground, and is especially common in wet places
									where the 'cut grass' (<hi rend="i">Leersia oryzoides</hi> Swartz) grows. The
									supposition is that this grass offers a better place than usual for the deposition
									of its eggs, which are deposited between the leaves and stems of grass. Grapevines
									and other creeping plants which form matted clusters that afford shelter from the
									noonday sun and the bright light of day are favorite haunts of this and other
									species of our nocturnal grasshoppers and a few of the arboreal crickets. It
									occurs throughout <pb id="VAB8231-579" n="578"/> the eastern half of Nebraska
									along all the streams the banks of which are lined with shrubs and trees."</p>

								<p>The short-winged form of this species is much more abundant locally in Indiana
									than the long-winged one. In Vigo County it was, at one time very plentiful about
									the borders of two large ponds in the Wabash River bottoms. In Knox County a few
									specimens were secured from the margin of a similar pond bordering a large cypress
									swamp, while in Kosciusko County it was found to be quite common in some marshes
									near Tippecanoe and Turkey lakes. In all these places the insects dwelt among the
									tall rank grasses and rushes growing in shallow water. The males are, as far as my
									experience goes, the most active leapers among the winged Tettigoniidæ, jumping a
									half dozen or more times without pause when flushed, and in the net leaping so
									rapidly from side to side as to prevent capture with the fingers. The females are
									evidently handicapped in their leaping powers by the excessive <pb
										id="VAB8231-580" n="579"/> length of the ovipositor, and so more often endeavor
									to escape by burrowing beneath the dense masses of fallen grass and reed stems
									which are always found in their accustomed haunts. The long winged form was first
									taken in some extensive low ground meadows in Kosciusko County. Here the long and
									short winged forms were about equally abundant. The former flew readily when
									approached, but to no great distance. A few of the long winged ones were also
									taken near Bass Lake, Starke County. The specimens from these northern counties
									are more slender bodied than those from the south, where only the short winged
									form has been found.</p>
								<p>Scudder's types were from Illinois and the known range of the species extends
									from eastern Pennsylvania and southwestern Ontario west to Minnesota, eastern
									Nebraska and Kansas, while Knox County, Ind., is the most southern station
									recorded east of the Mississippi. Walker states (1904, 341) that in southern
									Ontario it is plentiful but limited in distribution. "It frequents open marshy
									borders of creeks and ponds, where it leaps about with wonderful agility among the
									tall grasses and sedges." <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1915b, 209)</bibl> state that at
									Cornwells, Pa., they found <hi rend="i">attenuatus</hi> "very scarce in high
									grasses and plants along the shore of the Delaware River, and in moderate numbers
									in a small marshy area adjoining. The males were usually found in the grass or
									perched on nearby plant leaves, whence they sprang away with alacrity. The females
									were never as conspicuous and sprang away with great swift leaps, then, hiding on
									the opposite sides of grass stems and leaves in the deepest tangles of vegetation,
									they proved very difficult to locate. Over its wide distribution it is doubtless
									restricted to damp spots and marsh areas."</p>
								<p>My <hi rend="i">Xiphidium scudderi</hi> (1892b, 26) was based on the short-winged
									form of <hi rend="i">C. attenuatus</hi> while the <hi rend="i">X. lanceolatum</hi>
									mentioned by <bibl>Bruner (1891, 59)</bibl> also refers to <hi rend="i"
										>attenuatus</hi>. I find that the length of the ovipositor among the different
									species of <hi rend="i">Conocephalus</hi> is not at all dependent upon the age of
									the insect. In <hi rend="i">attenuatus</hi> it is almost as long after the third,
									and fully as long after the fourth moult as it is in the adult; while a female of
										<hi rend="i">strictus</hi> has been taken, with no vestige of tegmina, in which
									the ovipositor measured 18 mm. The eggs of <hi rend="i">attenuatus</hi>, as the
									length of the ovipositor indicates, are laid between the stems and leaves of the
									tall rank grasses among which the insect lives.</p>

									Massachusetts, to Caple Sable, Fla., and on the Gulf coast from Everglade, Fla.,
									to southeastern Texas. As its specific name indicates, it occurs mostly among the
									salt marsh grasses of the genus <hi rend="i">Spartina</hi>. Only two males, one a
									nymph, were taken at <pb id="VAB8231-582" n="581"/> Cape Sable and they by
									sweeping these grasses on the tidal flats. Elsewhere in Florida it has been
									recorded definitely only from Miami and Everglade.</p>
								<p><bibl>R. &amp; H. (1915b, 215)</bibl> state that on the coast of New Jersey <hi
										rend="i">spartinæ</hi> is frequently to be found in great numbers on the salt
									marshes both in <hi rend="i">Spartina patens</hi> (Ait.) and <hi rend="i"
										>Panicularia fluitans</hi> (L.) and can there be taken with ease. At Virginia
									Point, Texas. the series taken was chiefly macropterous and found in high and
									heavy grasses. "It was there difficult to capture as individuals were very
									restless and immediately sought shelter by jumping down low in the bunches of
									grass where they were very hard to follow."</p>
								<p><bibl>Morse, (1919)</bibl> states that it is locally abundant on salt marshes
									along the New England coast from Old Orchard, Me., to Stamford, Conn., thus
									agreeing closely in extent of distribution with the seaside locust, <hi rend="i"
										>Trimerotropis maritima</hi> (Harr.)</p>
								<p>The true status of the submaritime species, <hi rend="i">C. spartinæ,
										stictomerus, aigialus</hi> and <hi rend="i">nigropleuroides</hi>, is, in my
									opinion, as yet an unsolved problem. The first two named are very 'close to <hi
										rend="i">brevipennis</hi> and the last one to both <hi rend="i">attenuatus</hi>
									and <hi rend="i">nigropleurus</hi>. They differ mainly from these older named
									species in the form of the male cerci, length and form of ovipositor and details
									of coloration, all exceedingly plastic and variable characters. They are also
									closely related among themselves. For example, Fox states that the males of <hi
										rend="i">spartinæ</hi> and <hi rend="i">nigropleuroides</hi> are so close "that
									it was only after a long and arduous analysis and comparison that I was enabled to
									determine some apparently constant structural differences." Again, <bibl>R. &amp;
										H. (1915b, 210)</bibl> state that <hi rend="i">nigropleuroides,</hi> though
									decidedly smaller and more slender than <hi rend="i">spartinæ</hi> in New Jersey,
									increases southward in size and robustness so that in Florida it is distinctly the
									larger and more robust of the two. They also say: "The variation in shape of the
									ovipositor is far greater in <hi rend="i">nigropleuroides</hi> than in any other
									American species of the genus," ranging from rather broad and approximately
									straight in New Jersey specimens to a distinctly though not strongly upward curve
									in part of the series from Cedar Keys, Fla. Before the descriptions of any of the
									four species as new forms were made, R. &amp; H., one or both of them, had
									recorded <hi rend="i">spartinæ</hi> as <hi rend="i">X. nemorale</hi> and <hi
										rend="i">brevipenne; stictomerus</hi> as <hi rend="i">C. ensiferus;

										brevipennis</hi>, and <hi rend="i">nigropleuroides</hi> as <hi rend="i">X.
										nigropleurum</hi>. This fact is mentioned to show which of the older species
									each of the new forms superficially most closely resembles.</p>



								<pb id="VAB8231-583" n="582"/>


								<p>From these statements and from the study of the individuals at hand I believe
									that it will eventually be found that some of the four forms mentioned are only
									southern races or offshoots of one or more of the better known northern species,
									and that the modifications of color and secondary sexual organs have been brought
									about by the environment of the salt marsh areas which they inhabit. The series of
									specimens of each at present available is not sufficient for me to express a more
									exact opinion of their relationship, and I have therefore left them as placed by
									their authors.</p>

									ovipositor. They have been heretofore described as being totally apterous, but
									they have rudimentary tegmina concealed by the pronotum. In a specimen from
									Orlando these are large enough to protrude slightly beyond the pronotum. The males

							<p>Tettigoniids of large size and peculiar appearance in that they are nearly wingless
								and have the pronotum more or less prolonged backward over one or more of the basal
								segments of abdomen, thus forming a buckler or shield, whence the common name. Our
								eastern forms agree in having the face broad, perpendicular or nearly so; eyes
								small, subglobose, separated by at least three times their own diameters; antennæ
								very slender, arising from between the inner lower margins of eyes, but little
								longer than the body; vertex short, one-third or more the width of interocular
								space, strongly declivent between the antennæ; pronotum with front margin truncate,
								hind one rounded or subtruncate; lateral lobes longer than deep; prosternum usually
								armed beneath with two erect spines; tegmina very short, rarely as long as pronotum,
								developed only as shrilling organs in male, often scarcely visible, female; wings
								absent or rudimentary; tarsi more or less depressed, their first two segments
								sulcate lengthwise on the sides: front tibiæ with a slit-like foramen (hearing
								organ) each side near base and an apical spine on their upper outer side; front coxæ
								spined; hind tibiæ armed below with four apical spines; hind tarsi with a free lobe
								(plantula) at base of first joint; cerci of male variable as to genera and species;
								ovipositor stout, nearly straight.</p>
							<p>According to Caudell only about 225 species of Decticinæ distributed among 47
								genera, were known in 1908. They are confined mostly to the temperate zones, 20 or
								more of the genera occurring in the United States. The main distribuation of these
								is west of the Mississippi, where some of the species are very abundant and do much
								damage to vegetation. East of that stream but two genera are represented, one of
								them by a single species. But little is known of the life history of our eastern
								forms. They <pb id="VAB8231-588" n="587"/> appear to be omnivorous in their choice
								of food, and, when kept in captivity, even cannibalistic. They are found for the
								most part in dry, upland open wooded districts or mountainous regions, where they
								are active during the day. On account of their comparatively wingless condition they
								probably do not wander far from their hatching place. In color they are usually a
								dull grayish- or yellowish-brown, their hues thus corresponding closely with the
								dead leaves and other herbage of their abiding places. As the males stridulate only
								at night, and the adults of both sexes move slowly and only when closely approached,
								they are seldom seen and are probably more plentiful than they appear to be. The
								principal literature pertaining to the subfamily which will be of interest to the
								American student is as follows: <bibl>Herman, 1874</bibl>; <bibl>Scudder,

								<p>The synonymy of the species of the genus <hi rend="i">Atlanticus</hi> is very
									much confused. Until 1894 only three species, now included under that name, were
									known from the United States, two described from South Carolina by
										<bibl>Burmeister (1838)</bibl> under the names <hi rend="i">Decticus
										pachymerus</hi> and <hi rend="i">dorsalis</hi>, and one from Tennessee by
										<bibl>Saussure (1859)</bibl> as <hi rend="i">Orchesticus americanus</hi>.
									Burmeister's names were placed by <bibl>Scudder (1862)</bibl> under the Old World
									genus <hi rend="i">Thyreonotus</hi> (Serv.) and by him applied to two well known
									northern forms (one of them the <hi rend="i">americanus</hi> of Saussure) which
										<bibl>R. &amp; H. (1916a)</bibl> aver are not the same as those described by
									Burmeister, though they have not seen the latter's types and base their
									conclusions mainly on the fact that the species to which Scudder applied the names
									do not, as far as known, occur in South Carolina. <bibl>Scudder (1894a)</bibl>
									founded <hi rend="i">Atlanticus</hi> and referred to it the northern forms which
									he had previously placed under <hi rend="i">Thyreonotus</hi>, and a third species,
										<hi rend="i">gibbosus</hi>, from Florida. Later (1900) he described a fourth
									species, <hi rend="i">testaceus</hi>, from Missouri?, <bibl>R. &amp; H.
										(1912)</bibl> described <hi rend="i">A. glaber</hi> from Florida and <bibl>Davis
										(1915a)</bibl>
									<hi rend="i">A. monticola</hi> from North Carolina. Finally R. &amp; H. in their
									Revision (1916a) applied Burmeister's names to two southern forms, placed
									Saussure's <hi rend="i">americanus (dorsalis</hi> of most authors) under <hi
										rend="i">Atlanticus</hi>, referred the northern form previously known as <hi
										rend="i">"pachymerus</hi> Burm." to <hi rend="i">testaceus</hi> Scudd., and
									described two forms as new, thus recognizing nine species of <hi rend="i"
										>Atlanticus</hi>, all occurring east of the Mississippi, and all but two
									confined to that area.<ref id="ref_075" rend="super" target="note_075">72</ref>
									Since no one knows, or probably ever will know, to what forms Burmeister's names
									should in reality be rightfully applied, I judge that the conclusions of R. &amp;
									H. are as good as any that can be made, and to avoid stirring the hodge-podge
									still farther I have, in the main, adopted them.</p>
								<p>But two species of <hi rend="i">Atlanticus</hi> occur in Indiana and in their
									various stages are quite frequent from April 1st to September, 15th in dry upland
									woods and on sloping hillsides with a southern exposure, but are seldom, if ever,
									found in damp localities. On the first warm days of early spring the young begin
									to emerge and in suitable places for a month or more are among the most common
										<note id="note_075"><ref target="ref_075" rend="super">72</ref><bibl>Scudder
											(I894a)</bibl> and <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1916a)</bibl> stated that <hi rend="i"
											>Atlanticus</hi> was confined to the Atlantic slope of North America, but Rehn
										has recently described a species from China.</note>
									<pb id="VAB8231-590" n="589"/> Orthopterans seen. They are much more active during
									early life than in the mature state when they crawl rather than leap. In captivity
									they feed as readily upon animal as upon vegetable food, and in the natural state
									probably feed upon the dead bodies of such small animals as they can find. The
									earliest hatched reach maturity in central Indiana about the first of June, and
									may then often be found resting on the leaves and stems of low shrubs and weeds,
									but seldom climb over two or three feet from the ground. The adults are far less
									numerous than the young, the vast majority of the latter probably falling a prey
									to the many ground-frequenting sparrows and other birds, as they do not hide by
									day as do the members of the genus <hi rend="i">Ceuthophilus</hi>.</p>

								<p>This bulky brown Orthopteron occurs throughout Indiana but is more common in the
									northern counties. It frequents for the most part dry open woodlands, thinly
									wooded rocky slopes and borders of thickets, where it crawls slowly over the
									fallen leaves being very clumsy in its movements. The earliest date on which a
									mature specimen has been noted was June 6th, in Vigo County, numerous specimens
									being taken between that date and June 20, while they may be found until after
									heavy frosts.</p>
								<p>The general range of <hi rend="i">A. testaceus</hi> is northern, it being the

										id="VAB8231-593" n="592"/> Mississippi, its known distribution extending from
									Vermont, Massachusetts and southern Ontario, west to Minnesota and central
									Illinois and south to Virginia and central Kentucky. It is the species heretofore
									recorded by most writers, myself included (1903, 393), as <hi rend="i">A.
										pachymerus</hi> (Burm.) and there is no direct evidence to prove that it is not
									that species.</p>
								<p><bibl>Davis (1893)</bibl> has given a pleasing account of the song and habits of
										<hi rend="i">testaceus</hi> as noted on Staten Island, in part as follows: <q
										rend="blockquote">
										<p>"On June 26 I heard in a moist pasture a stridulation that was unknown to me.
											It much resembled that of <hi rend="i">Orchelimum vulgare</hi>, with the
											preliminary <hi rend="i">zip, zip</hi> omitted. It was a continuous <hi
												rend="i">z-e-e-e</hi>, with an occasional short <hi rend="i">ik</hi>, caused
											by the insect getting its wing covers ready for action after a period of
											silence. In due time I discovered, in a tussock of rank swampgrass, the brown
											songster, <hi rend="i">Thyreonotus pachymerus</hi>, perched on a dead leaf. He
											was transferred from the tussock to a tin can and at home I made a home for
											him in a larger can in which was a branch of post oak whose leaves soon dried,
											furnished innumerable nooks and crannies in which to hide. Usually, however,
											the insect did not hide at all but perched himself on one of the topmost
											leaves and there waved his antennæ after the manner of all long-horned
											Orthoptera. Starting with raspberries, he had the rest of the fruits in their
											season, including watermelon, of which he showed a marked appreciation. If I
											offered him a raspberry and then gradually drew it away, he would follow in
											the direction of the departing fruit, and would finally eat it from my hand.
											At night he stridulated with unabated zeal to the first of August when he
											began to be less sprightly. Finally his song, instead of filling the room, was
											but a faint sound and the end came on the tenth or eleventh of September."</p>
									</q>
								</p>

								<p><bibl>Allard (1911b, 118)</bibl> says of the song of <hi rend="i">A.
										testaceus</hi> on Plummer's Island, Md.: "One was singing after dark very close
									to the ground on a dry rocky thinly-wooded hillside. Its notes have the same
									lisping character as an Orchelimum. The phrases are brief, but rapidly repeated,
									with irregular intervals of silence intervening; <hi rend="i"
										>sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh</hi>. Several times while watching
									the insect stridulate by candle-light the writer lisped an approach to its notes
									and got an immediate response."</p>
								<p>At Moline, Ill., <bibl>McNeill (1891)</bibl> found the first adults on Aug. 9 and
									states that those kept in captivity showed a decided taste for animal food so that
									in the wild state it may be at least partly carnivorous.</p>
								<p>Osborn records a specimen from Camp Douglas, Wis., and Lugger figures and
									describes the species from Minnesota, stating that only a few were found but
									giving no definite locality. In Michigan it is known only from the Porcupine Mts.
									and Gun Lake. <bibl>Walker (1905, 113)</bibl> states that the only Ontario
									specimens he <pb id="VAB8231-594" n="593"/> had seen were taken at Arner, Aug. 9.
									"They were found in the more open parts of a dry upland wood consisting chiefly of

										<hi rend="i">pachymerus</hi> were from Germar's collection and labelled "South
									Carolina," without name of collector or region of the State. His brief description
									was as follows: <q rend="blockquote">
										<p>"Fusco-griseus, pronoti lateribus infuscatis, macula ad sinum marginis
											postica flava; vertice abdomineque toto unicoloribus. Male, elytris liberis
											fornicatis. Female, elytris nullis; vagina recta, abdomine longior. Long.
											corp. 9" (18.7 mm); femor. post. 8" (16.6 mm)."</p>
									</q>
								</p>

								<p>Of this description and their placement of the species <bibl>R. &amp; H. (<hi
											rend="i">loc. cit.</hi>)</bibl> say: "We are able to place Burmeister's name
									on this species by a process of elimination, * * * the three words describing the
									male, 'elytris liberis fornicatis,' clearly referring to this species, <hi
										rend="i">testaceus</hi> or <hi rend="i">davisi</hi>; of these only the present
									form occurs near the coastal region of South Carolina from which the original
									material of <hi rend="i">pachymerus</hi> probably came. The characters given for
									the female are only sufficient to separate that sex from <hi rend="i"
										>monticola</hi>. The length of the body and of caudal femora as given by
									Burmeister, while less than any found in the material before us, do not at all
									invalidate the claim of this species to his name. <pb id="VAB8231-595" n="594"/>
									The body length given could easily be accounted for by the abdomen being shrunken,
									while geographic or individual size variation could easily cause the discrepancy
									seen in the femoral length." Later on they admit that they have no exact record of
									the occurrence of <hi rend="i">pachymerus</hi> in South Carolina and give its
									known distribution as extending from Greensboro and Raleigh, N. Car., to the Ozark
									Mountain region of Arkansas. At Goldsboro, N. Car., the species was found "among
									fallen leaves of deciduous trees in a rather open forest composed chiefly of
									short-leaf pine."</p>
								<p>As already noted none of the evidence thus submitted by R. &amp; H. is, in my
									opinion, conclusive that the species thus fixed by them is the one described by
									Burmeister, and the latter must continue to remain a matter of question unless his
									types can be found and compared with our different forms.</p>

									undergrowth in pine and deciduous forests, occasionally being more numerous along
									the edges of the timber than in the depths of the woods. Its presence will often

									L., the "cricket" being so clumsy in motion that it easily falls a prey to the
									wasp. He also states (1915a) that this and other species of <hi rend="i"
										>Atlanticus</hi> "are often attracted to the trees sugared for moths and they
									may be likewise collected in traps consisting of jars or old tin cans sunk in the
									ground and baited with molasses. More females than males seem to be attracted by

								<p>Dunedin, Fla., July 15-Oct. 29 (<hi rend="i">W. S. B.</hi>) ; Lake City, Fla.,

									the young are quite common in dry open pine and scrub-oak woods during March and
									April and probably reach maturity in June. At Pablo Beach R. &amp; H. found it in
									palmetto scrub and salt marsh. They state (1907) that the adults "possess greater

								<p>The original description of Burmeister was of a single male from South Carolina
									in the Germar collection. <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1916a, 87)</bibl> assigned the name
									to one adult pair and some nymphs taken at Billy's Island and Thomasville, Ga.,
									stating that they have arrived at their conclusion "by a process of elimination,"
									since they feel certain that it must occur in eastern South Carolina and that it
									is the only species found anywhere near that agrees with the particular character
									given by Burmeister of having the tegmina of male hidden under the pronotum,
									etc.</p>
								<p>Known definitely only by an adult male from Billy's Island and a female from

								<p>The present status of the <hi rend="i">dorsalis</hi> of Burmeister is, in my

								<p>Marion, Parke, Vigo, Lawrence and Crawford counties, Ind.; adults Sept. 9--Oct.
									11; nymphs, July 15--22. Probably occurs sparingly on oak shrubs and trees
									throughout southern Indiana. Only four adults and the same number of nymphs have
									been seen by me. The nymphs were beaten from oak shrubs. While eating lunch
									beneath a sycamore tree in Vigo County, Sept. 25, 1917, a male fell from the tree
									onto my neck; the others were found on the ground beneath oak trees.</p>
								<p>Uhler in 1864 redescribed the species as <hi rend="i">Camptonotus scudderi</hi>,
									his types being from near Baltimore, where, he says, it appears in the larval
									state as early as the first of August and reaches maturity the latter part of
									September. It is there found upon oak trees, where it is said to spend the daytime
									curled up in the leaves.</p>
								<p><bibl>Caudell (1904e)</bibl> and <bibl>McAtee (1908)</bibl> have each given a
									most interesting account of the leaf rolling habits of this <hi rend="i"
										>Camptonotus</hi>. The former first found the nymphs in rolled papaw leaves near
									Washington in July. Later he placed one in a glass tube with some willow leaves
									covered with plant lice. On the next day he found that it had constructed for
									itself a pocket in one of the leaves. This was made: <q rend="blockquote">
										<p>"By cutting the leaf through on each side to the midrib and at right angles
											to it and again one-third of an inch farther along the midrib, this time the
											incision being formed at an angle with it. The flaps thus formed on either
											side were then folded together and their edges fastened together with
											silk-like strands, and I have subsequently seen cases with one end completely
											closed by a solid mat of this silk. The manner of constructing the pockets or
											rolls is not uniform. In some cases the incisions are made near the apex of
											the leaf and then only the two basal cuts are made, the tip of the <pb
												id="VAB8231-605" n="604"/> leaf being folded back, thus making the terminal
											cuts unnecessary. Sometimes the pocket is formed altogether on one side of the
											midrib.</p>
										<p>"When supplied with fresh leaves the insect at once commenced making a new
											house, cutting with its mandibles incisions from the edge of the leaf; then
											grasping the thus movable edges each with the three legs on each side and
											forcing them together, it spun what was apparently silk thread from the mouth,
											fastening the edges together. The whole performance did not take five minutes
											after it was begun. The insect accurately measured the proper places for the
											cuts by placing itself on the leaf and realizing how much was needed. This
											being determined, the work went on rapidly. Within these pockets the nymphs
											live, coming out mostly at night to feed on plant lice, which seem to form
											their entire food supply during their early life."</p>

								<p>McAtee found <hi rend="i">C. carolinensis</hi> in numbers in August on Plummer's
									Island, Md., inhabiting the fruit pods of the bladder-nut, <hi rend="i">Staphylea
										trifoliata</hi> L. Of its habits he says: <q rend="blockquote">
										<p>"Carefully examining the first pod in which a <hi rend="i">Camptonotus</hi>
											was found, it was seen that as usual, a large irregular opening had been made
											in one of the cells, but it had been closed by a loosely constructed door,
											composed of bits of the pod and a network of fine spun silk-like threads. The
											locustid was snugly curled within, the long antennæ, to my surprise, being
											completely withdrawn. It scuttled about when the pod was handled, but did not
											attempt to bolt out. Several other pods were found to be similarly
											inhabited.</p>
										<p>"Some of the insects and twigs of <hi rend="i">Staphylea</hi> were brought
											home and in a large jar two females and one male were confined with a twig
											bearing several entirely uninjured pods and many leaves. They were watched for
											some time by a light but did nothing with the plant. They sometimes moved
											nervously about, sometimes sat motionless, but they also spent much time
											cleaning all accessible parts of the body (even including the ovipositor in
											the case of the females), with the mouth. During this process <pb
												id="VAB8231-606" n="605"/> they showed wonderful control of the long
											antennæ, which after being pulled down one at a time by the fore legs, by
											great muscular power at the base were slowly drawn between the mandibles for
											their whole length. The dexterity with which they manipulate these seemingly
											unwieldy appendages (which are about five times the length of the body),
											leaves the observer in no doubt as to how they stow them away in the cramped
											confines of their improvised retreats. Leaving the locustids in darkness for a
											while, no change was noticed upon returning except that the male had ensconced
											himself in his old cell in a pod that had been left lying on the floor of the
											receptacle. From it he was reluctantly dislodged. They were then left for the
											night. In the morning it was found that both females had made cells for
											themselves, not however in the pods, but in leaves. Although the three
											specimens were afterwards confined for two days with uninjured pods and no
											leaves, not a pod was disturbed. Hence it is not proven that the locustids
											enter them through openings of their own making. Nevertheless, it is very
											probable that they do so; certainly they have mandibles equal to the
											task."</p>

							<p>The subfamily is represented in all parts of the earth, but its species are more
								numerous in the United States than in any other country. Its members are mainly
								nocturnal or crepuscular in habits, living in caves, quarries, walls of old wells,
								cellars, crevices of stone walls, beneath or in decaying logs and stumps, hollow
								trees and burrows of mammals or reptiles. Without wings, stridulating organs or
								ears, they comprise a group of queer forms among our Orthoptera. Living in total or
								semi-darkness during the day, they move silently and stealthily about at night,
								guided principally by their long antennæ. Their food habits and life histories are
								as yet practically unknown and offer an interesting and virgin field of research to
								aspiring students, <pb id="VAB8231-608" n="607"/> especially those living in the

								<p>Mammoth Cave, Ky., (<hi rend="i">Call</hi>). This is a true cave inhabiting
									species, occurring in numbers in many of the caves, both large and small in
									Kentucky and adjoining southern states but not as yet taken in any of those of
									southern Indiana. Scudder's types were from Mammoth Cave, where it appears to be
									the only cave cricket found, and of them he wrote (1861, 9): "They were found
									throughout the cave to the remotest parts (seven miles or there-abouts), though
									not near the entrance, especially in damp, moist situations, where they abound.
									They were usually jumping about with the greatest alacrity upon the walls, where
									only they are found, and even when disturbed, clinging to the ceiling, upon which
									they walked easily; they would leap away from approaching footsteps, but stop at a
									cessation of the noise, turning about and swaying their long antennæ in a most
									ludicrous manner, in the direction whence the disturbance had proceeded. The least
									noise would increase their tremulousness while they were unconcerned at distant
									motions unaccompanied by sound, even though producing a sensible current of air;
									neither did the light of the lamp appear to disturb them. Their eyes are perfectly
									formed throughout, and they could apparently see with ease, for they jump away
									from the slowly approaching hand, so as to necessitate rapidity of motion in
									seizing them. Late in October, females were obtained enormously distended with
									eggs."</p>
								<p><bibl>Garman (1894, 5)</bibl> says that <hi rend="i">H. subterraneus</hi> is the
									species of cave Orthoptera "most completely adapted to life in the caves. It is a
									large brown creature so fragile that it is almost impossible to get perfect
									specimens. Those taken alive from the caves in summer invariably soon died,
									probably because of the sudden change of temperature. It is usually most abundant
									a short distance within the entrance but is encountered in the remotest depths of
									the largest caverns."</p>
								<p><bibl>Packard (1888, 69)</bibl> recorded <hi rend="i">H. subterraneus</hi> from
									24 small caves in the vicinity of Mammoth and also from Nickajack Cave, <pb
										id="VAB8231-611" n="610"/> Tenn. Many of these were found close to the entrances
									and he remarks that "This species does not vary perceptibly either in its eyes or
									appendages, whether occurring in large or small caves or living in total darkness
									or in partial daylight."</p>
								<p>Of specimens taken in White's Cave, Ky., he (1889, 199) wrote: <q
										rend="blockquote">
										<p>"The 'taste cups' are highly developed in this 'cave cricket,' being rounded
											papillæ with the nucleus at the top or end. There are more than 100 in all
											where in <hi rend="i">Ceuthophilus</hi> there are only nine or ten. These
											gustatory cups, being so much longer, better developed and much more numerous
											in the cave <hi rend="i">Hadenœcus</hi> than in <hi rend="i"
											>Ceuthophilus</hi>, which lives under stones, etc. out of doors, it would seem
											as if the sense of taste were much more acute in the cave dweller than in the

									</q></p>
								<p><bibl>Garman (1891)</bibl> mentions a pair of peculiar gland-like white fleshy

									may be scent glands, "the sense of smell being best calculated to bring the sexes

								<p>This is the species hitherto known in literature as <hi rend="i">Diestrammena
										marmorata</hi>
									<bibl>DeHaan (1843, 217)</bibl>. It was described by him as <hi rend="i">Locusta
										marmorata</hi> and is therefore a primary homonym of <hi rend="i">Locusta
										(Scirtetica) marmorata</hi>
									<bibl>Harris (1841, 145)</bibl>. A new specific name is therefore necessary for
									DeHaan's insect.</p>
								<p>While this species is not known to have been taken in Indiana, it doubtless
									occurs in some of the greenhouses of the State, as Hart (Ms.) stated that it was
									common in those of Illinois and a specimen is at hand from Ann Arbor, Mich. It is
									a Japanese <pb id="VAB8231-613" n="612"/> species and is known to occur from New
									England west to Minnesota and Colorado. <bibl>Morse (1919a, 28)</bibl> says that
									it has been introduced "into greenhouses and cellars in several parts of New
									England. It multiplies rapidly and quickly becomes abundant, the adults and young
									occurring throughout the year." His specimens were from Kennebunk, Me., and
									Danvers and Springfield, Mass. It has been taken in New Jersey (<hi rend="i"
										>Weiss</hi>) and at Clintonville and Springfield, Ohio (<hi rend="i"
									>Kostir</hi>). <bibl>Lugger (1898, 254)</bibl> said that at that time it had
									succeeded in finding a new home in the Conservatory of the State University at
									Minneapolis, and, according to Oestlund, that they "had been there three years and
									multiply freely. They were at first noticed in connection with a shipment of
									Japanese umbrella plants from Florida." While not as yet recorded from Florida,
									the above would indicate that they occur in greenhouses in that State.</p>
								<p>A single specimen of <hi rend="i">Diestrammena unicolor</hi>
									<bibl>Brunner (1888, 299)</bibl>, the Chinese greenhouse camel cricket, was
									received by Morse from a greenhouse at Chicago and recorded by him (Psyche, XI,
									1904, 80). It differs from <hi rend="i">D. japanica</hi> in its nearly uniform
									piceous hue and in having the front femora less than one-half longer than
									pronotum. It is liable to be found in any greenhouse that imports plants from
									China, its native country.</p>

								<p>This, our most robust camel cricket, varies greatly in color and size and has
									therefore been described under nine different names. It ranges from eastern
									Illinois north and west to Saskatchewan, Idaho and Utah and south and west to
									Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and Pasadena, Cal. The more eastern individuals are
									mostly of the black variety, <hi rend="i">U. nigra</hi>
									<bibl>Scudd. (1862a, 284)</bibl>. Specimens of this form are in the Urbana
									collection from numerous points in Illinois (<hi rend="i">Hart &amp; Malloch</hi>
									Ms.) while the brown form, typical <hi rend="i">robusta</hi>, was also taken at
									Havana, Ill., by Hart from beneath logs. <bibl>Bruner (1886)</bibl> says of its
									habits: "This 'cricket' is generally to be seen running rather sluggishly over
									plowed fields and along old roads on cloudy days or during early morning or in the
									evening just before sunset. It is nocturnal in habit and lives singly in burrows
									which it digs in the loose soil.</p>
								<p><bibl>Caudell (1916)</bibl> first placed the different forms of <hi rend="i"

								<p>Wingless Tettigoniidæ of medium or large size with a thick body and arched back;
									head large, oval, bent downward and backward between the front legs; antennæ long,
									slender, cylindrical, tapering to a fine point; eyes subpyriform, the narrow end
									downward, <pb id="VAB8231-615" n="614"/> placed a little above and close to the
									basal joint of antennæ; maxillary palpi long, slender, the apical joint longest,
									somewhat curved, split on the under side three-fourths of its length, which is
									nearly equal to that of the two preceding taken together; lateral lobes of
									pronotum covering the corresponding epimera; meso- and metanotum of the same form
									but shorter than pronotum; prosternum unarmed; fore and middle femora slender,
									relatively short, the former armed beneath on lower inner carinæ with one to four
									short spines, the latter on both lower carinæ with two to four similar spines;
									hind femora thick, heavy, turned inward at base, channeled beneath, with the
									margins of channel either serrate or spined in males, very feebly armed in
									females. Male with subgenital plate broad, usually emarginate or deeply cleft,
									rarely entire; sometimes with a pair of infracercal or podigal plates, incurved
									between the bases of the cerci. Ovipositor nearly straight, usually stout at base,
									and strongly tapering to middle, beyond which it is subequal, the outer valves
									obliquely excised and slightly upturned at tip; inner valves with three to seven
									teeth on under side of apical fourth, the tips of the valves ending in a curved
									tooth or "terminal hook." Cerci of both sexes long, slender, usually very
									hairy.</p>
								<p>These insects are seldom seen except by the professional collector. They are
									nocturnal in their habits, and during the day hide beneath stones along the
									margins of small woodland streams, or beneath logs and chunks in damp woods, in
									which places seldom less than two, nor more than three or four, are found
									associated together. Being wingless they make no noise, and, like most other
									silent creatures are supposed to be deaf, as no trace of an ear-drum is
									visible.</p>
								<p>That they are well-nigh omnivorous in their choice of food, I have determined by
									keeping them in confinement, when they fed upon meat as well as upon pieces of
									fruit and vegetables, seemingly preferring the latter. The majority of the species
									evidently reach maturity and deposit their eggs in late summer or early autumn, as
									the full grown insects are more common then, but have been taken as late as
									December 1st. The eggs, which are supposed to be laid in the earth, usually hatch
									in April, but some are hatched in autumn and the young live over winter, an
									anomaly among the Tettigoniidæ, as I have taken them on a number of occasions
									throughout the winter. Several of the species inhabit caves and are usually of
									larger size, with longer antennæ and smaller compound eyes than those found above
									ground.</p>


								<pb id="VAB8231-616" n="615"/>

								<p>The genus <hi rend="i">Ceuthophilus</hi> is one of the largest among the
									Tettigoniidæ, and is confined to North America, and mostly to the United States.
										<bibl>Scudder (1894)</bibl> revised it, reducing to synonyms a number of those
									previously described, but describing so many new forms that, in the end, he had 57
									species, 24 of which were ascribed to the eastern states. His key and descriptions
									were based mainly on slight differences in the relative length of the fore and
									middle femora and hind tibiæ; the spination of the hind femora and other variable
									characters, so that the key is practically worthless. A number of his nominal
									species were based upon nymphs, in some of which the structural characters differ
									much from those of the adult.</p>
								<p>On account of the great number of forms, the absence of tegmina and wings, the
									similarity of hue and general facies, the study of this genus has been by far the
									most difficult part of this work, and the results in the end are not on the whole
									satisfactory. Scudder in his key did not take into consideration the characters
									pertaining to the secondary genital organs, which I have mainly used and which I
									have found far more stable than in most other groups of Orthoptera. My studies
									have shown that the adult males are quite readily separated by the variation in
									the form of the subgenital and supra-anal plates and the last dorsal segment of
									abdomen, while the females can usually be distinguished by the form and
									arrangement of the teeth on the inner valves of the ovipositor. As the two sexes
									are colored alike and are usually found in close proximity, the student who
									collects his own specimens will find little difficulty in placing the females by
									the key given below, which pertains mainly to the male sex. The color characters
									vary so greatly according to age and environment that except in <hi rend="i"
										>latens, brevipes, uhleri</hi> and one or two others, they cannot be used in a
									key, while the armature of the lower carinæ of hind femora is constant only in <hi
										rend="i">nigricans, brevipes</hi> and <hi rend="i">terrestris</hi>. Many of the
									records in the local lists hitherto published are based on wrong identifications

								<p>This camel cricket occurs in small numbers throughout Indiana. In color and in
									the armature of hind femora of the males, it varies exceedingly, the younger and
									more northern specimens being often much darker than adults from the South, some
									of the larger northern adults having a pattern very similar to that of <hi
										rend="i">C. latens</hi>. In Indiana it occurs for the most part in rather moist
									woods, but often beneath logs and other debris near the borders of ponds and
									lakes.</p>
								<p>An examination of the types at Cambridge shows that <bibl>Caudell (1916,
										666)</bibl> and <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1916, 270)</bibl> were right in placing <hi
										rend="i">C. grandis</hi>
									<bibl>Scudder (1894, 38)</bibl> as a synonym of <hi rend="i">gracilipes</hi>; also
									that the <pb id="VAB8231-633" n="632"/> form which Scudder described in his last
									work on <hi rend="i">Ceuthophilus</hi> (1894, 50) as <hi rend="i">C.
										lapidicola</hi>
									<bibl>Burm. (1838, 723)</bibl> cannot be distinguished by any good structural
									character from what I recognize above as <hi rend="i">C. gracilipes</hi>. He
									separates them in his key only by the hind tibiæ of male being "at least a tenth
									longer than hind femora" (<hi rend="i">gracilipes</hi>) or "distinctly less than a
									tenth longer," (<hi rend="i">lapidicola</hi>). The specimens which he set aside in
									the Cambridge collection as <hi rend="i">lapidicola</hi> differ from those of <hi
										rend="i">gracilipes</hi> only in their general darker hue, the secondary genital
									characters of both sexes being very nearly the same as those of <hi rend="i"
										>gracilipes</hi>, the only appreciable difference being that in <hi rend="i"
										>lapidicola</hi> the lobes of the subgenital plate of male are a little more
									rounded at apex. The original description of both <hi rend="i">lapidicola</hi> and
										<hi rend="i">gracilipes</hi> are very brief, being as follows: <q
										rend="blockquote">
										<p>"<hi rend="i">Ph. lapidicola</hi> Germ.: Testacea nitida, dorso vitta utrique
											longitudinali fusco-nebulosa s. marmorata. . Long. corp. 10"', ped. post 1
											1/2". Aus Virginien und Sud- Carolina, 2 weibliche examplare in Germar's
											Sammlung."</p>
										<p>"<hi rend="i">Ph. gracilipes</hi> Hald. Shining yellowish-brown, mottled;
											colors arranged transversely; limbs longer than in any other American species,
											the posteriar femora of male being 12 and the tibiæ 13 lines, in a specimen
											ten lines long. This species is from central Pennsylvania and is nearest
											allied to <hi rend="i">Ph. lapidicola</hi> Burm., which extends from eastern
											Pennsylvania to Georgia. <hi rend="i">Ph. maculata</hi> Harris is allied to
											the latter, but it has the posterior tibiæ in the male waved at base."</p>
									</q>
								</p>

								<p>Haldeman's description is scarcely more distinctive than Burmeister's, but it has
									the advantage of having a certain form applied to it from the time it was made
									until the present, while no one can tell to what species the two females in the
									Germar collection, described by Burmeister, belong. Scudder and other writers for
									many years applied Burmeister's name to the form herein recognized as <hi rend="i"
										>C. terrestris</hi> Scudd. It is better, therefore, to drop the name <hi
										rend="i">lapidicola</hi> from our lists until the species to which it was
									originally applied can be correctly identified by an examination of the types, if
									they still exist.</p>
								<p>The <hi rend="i">C. pallidipes</hi>
									<bibl>Walker (1905, 115)</bibl> is, as <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1916, 272)</bibl> have
									shown, only a small dark form of what they recognize (following Scudder) as <hi
										rend="i">C. lapidicola</hi> Burm. Specimens of this form are at hand from
									various points in Michigan, some of them received from Hubbell as <hi rend="i">C.
										meridionalis</hi>
									<bibl>Scudd. (1894, 66)</bibl>, described from Chihuahua, Mex. An examination of
									the type of that form at Cambridge shows that it is at the most only a
									southwestern race of <hi rend="i">gracilipes</hi>.</p>


								<pb id="VAB8231-634" n="633"/>


								<p>The known range of <hi rend="i">C. gracilipes</hi>, as above recognized,
									therefore extends from central Ontario and southern New England west to Manitoba,
									Minnesota, Nebraska and Colorado, and south and southwest to Georgia, Mississippi
									and Chihuahua, Mex. While the size, color and armature of the hind femora vary
									greatly over this large range, the prolonged truncate last dorsal and form of
									subgenital of male, and the form and arrangement of teeth of ovipositor remain
									almost constant and furnish characters of easy recognition.</p>
								<p>Walker states that in central Ontario his <hi rend="i">C. pallidipes</hi> is the
									most common species of the genus, usually occuring under chunks and small logs in
									woods, or in rotten sodden logs, from two to seven being usually found together. A
									few pass the winter in the nymph stage though most of them reach maturity in July
									from eggs hatched in spring.</p>
								<p>In Connecticut <hi rend="i">gracilipes</hi> has been taken by Walden in cellars
									and under bark of trees. <bibl>Smith (1910, 190)</bibl> records it from two points
									in New Jersey where it was taken in dark cellars and barns, under stones and in
									hollow trees. In Maryland and Virginia Davis has trapped numerous specimens in
									molasses jars.</p>

								<p>In Indiana this "cave cricket" occurs abundantly in crevices in the walls and
									roof near the mouths of Wyandotte, Little Wyandotte, Sibert's Well Cave and
									Saltpetre Cave, Crawford County, and a few immature specimens have been taken in
									Porter's Cave, Owen County and Truett's and Strong's caves, Monroe County, 80
									miles farther north. In the Crawford County caves no specimens were found further
									back than 250 feet from the mouth, except in Wyandotte, where a few were taken on
									"Monument Mountain," one-half mile from the mouth. In the other caves they were
									found back beyond the reach of any rays of light. The adults of this species are
									the largest stone or camel crickets occurring in the State and seem to be more or
									less gregarious. In one instance, in Sibert's Well Cave, more than 20 were found
									in a small cranny in the wall. They were grouped in a circle, in a space about six
									inches square, with their antennæ pointing toward the center of the circle, and
									appeared to be holding a conference or cricket convention.</p>
								<p>In regard to the life history of this insect, but little is known. <pb
										id="VAB8231-636" n="635"/> I found a number of specimens of half grown young in
									Sibert's Cave on May 16. The adults were common in July, and in November the
									young, about one-third the size of mature specimens, were frequent in Saltpetre
									Cave, but could not be found elsewhere. The species may be represented in winter
									by the eggs as well as by the young, as is the case among some other members of
									the genus.</p>
								<p>In Saltpetre Cave, where in July <hi rend="i">stygius</hi> was very plentiful,
									all were found within 100 feet of the entrance. They were never seen on the floor,
									unless they leaped there when disturbed, but were found resting on the sides of
									small projections and in small cavities of the walls or roof, with their antennæ
									spread out before them. If a lighted candle was held close to them they paid no
									attention to it, but were very sensitive to its heat and to touch. When disturbed
									they leap with agility, sometimes to a distance of six feet, but with a little
									care can usually be readily picked up with the fingers before they become
									frightened.</p>
								<p>The immature specimens from caves in Monroe and Owen counties were darker than
									typical <hi rend="i">stygius</hi>, and were found on the floors of the caves--in
									one or two instances beneath loose rocks. From their habits I was at first
									inclined to doubt their being <hi rend="i">stygius</hi>, since it is quite
									difficult to name correctly the young of any species of <hi rend="i"
										>Ceuthophilus</hi>. However, <bibl>Packard (1888, 70)</bibl> states that in
									Kentucky those living in the smaller caves are darker and less bleached than those
									in the larger ones.</p>
								<p>Outside of Indiana <hi rend="i">C. stygius</hi> is recorded by Packard and
									Scudder from a half dozen or more caves in Kentucky. <bibl>Brunner (1888,
										309)</bibl> records it from a cave at Dallas, Texas, and <bibl>Morse
										(1919a)</bibl> from Beverly, Mass. It doubtless occurs in most of the smaller
									caves of the northern states between New England and the Mississippi.</p>
								<p><bibl>Caudell (1916, 666)</bibl> placed <hi rend="i">stygius</hi> as a variety of
										<hi rend="i">gracilipes</hi>, stating that the "only separating characters seem
									to be the proportional length of the legs and the armature of the hind femora,
									characters useless in this instance through variation." However the teeth of
									ovipositor are so different in shape that, taking them in connection with the
									other differences given in key and description, I retain it as distinct. It is
									found only in the immediate vicinity of or within caves while <hi rend="i"
										>gracilipes</hi> has a wide distribution in regions where no caves exist. The
										<hi rend="i">C. sloanii</hi>
									<bibl>Packard (1888, 63)</bibl> is stated by Scudder to be based upon immature
									specimens of <hi rend="i">stygius</hi>.</p>

						<p>The fourth family of Orthoptera belonging to the suborder Saltatoria comprises the
							Gryllidæ or crickets. From the other leaping Orthoptera they are distinguished mainly
							by the characters given in the key, page 149. They have the form usually
							subcylindrical, robust; head broad, usually perpendicular or nearly <pb
								id="VAB8231-640" n="639"/> so, the vertex closely merged with front of face; eyes
							rather small, usually oval or elliptical, widely separated; ocelli variable in size,
							form and position, sometimes wanting; antennæ usually long and filiform; pronotum
							short, broad, usually depressed above; tegmina flat above, bent abruptly downward at
							sides, usually fully developed, though (Gryllotalpinæ, Myrmecophilinæ and <hi rend="i"
								>Nemobius</hi>) often abbreviated or even wanting; wings folded like a fan, usually
							shorter than tegmina, often very rudimentary or wholly absent; fore tibiæ variable in
							structure and usually with a hearing organ on both sides; hind femora usually much
							enlarged, though in the tree crickets (Oecanthinæ) very slender; hind tibiæ armed
							above either with numerous spines or fine teeth or both on each margin, except in the
							Gryllotalpinæ and Tridactylinæ, where only the inner margin is so armed; also armed
							near apex with two or more pairs of subapical spurs; tarsi usually three-jointed (in
							Tridactylinæ one- or two-jointed or wanting) the first joint often very long; pulvilli
							wanting; cerci very long, hairy, tapering; ovipositor as described below.</p>
						<p>The name Gryllidae is derived from that of the principal genus <hi rend="i"
								>Gryllus</hi>, a Latin name for cricket. By Kirby and some of the European authors
							the family name Achetidæ is used for these insects. The family is widely distributed
							over the earth, but in this country the species are less numerous than those of either
							the Acrididæ or Tettigoniidæe.</p>
						<p>The tympanum or calling organ of the males of Gryllidæ, when present, is, as in the
							Tettigoniidæ, located near the base of the dorsal surface of the tegmina, but is wider
							and broader, extending across both anal and median areas of the tegmina. In the males
							of <hi rend="i">Gryllus</hi>, as <bibl>Lutz (1906)</bibl> has shown, the right tegmen
							almost always overlaps the left and the "file" or stridulating ridge on the under side
							of the left is therefore rarely used, yet it appears as fully developed as the other.
							Lutz changed the position of the tegmina in a freshly moulted male, placing the left
							one above, and after they had hardened the cricket "could chirp just as well as one
							whose tegmina had not been tampered with, although he was using the sound-producing
							organ which would naturally not have been used at all." More than one-third of the 742
							females of <hi rend="i">Gryllus</hi> examined by Lutz carried the left tegmen
							uppermost, and in that sex the position of the tegmina were during life frequently
							changed by the insects themselves, but were never so changed in the males.</p>
						<p>The chirps or love calls of the different species of crickets make <pb
								id="VAB8231-641" n="640"/> up the greater part of that ceaseless thrill which, in
							the northern states, fills the air, usually at night, from mid-July until after frost.
							These sounds are made only by the males, and are not vocal, as most persons suppose;
							but are produced by the tympanum, the insect rubbing the veins in the middle of one
							wing cover over those of the other. It is often difficult to locate one of these
							chirpers by its song. The distance and even the direction are usually most deceiving;
							the crickets being exceedingly shy, much more so than katydids and grasshoppers. Those
							which live in the ground generally chirp near the entrance to their burrows, and
							retreat thereto at every approaching footstep. Those which live upon trees or shrubs
							resemble closely the hues of bark or foliage, and are therefore difficult to find even
							when close at hand; while the majority, dwelling as they do, among grasses and beneath
							logs and chips, find also a safe protection in their color, which is usually closely
							like that of the objects beneath which they rest while sounding their cymbals.</p>

								stridulating ridge; <hi rend="i">st</hi>, stridulating teeth. (After Landois.)</p>
						</figure>
						<p>The inner wings of the crickets are, for the most part, short, weak, and
							comparatively useless as flying organs, though sometimes they are nearly twice as long
							as the outer pair. Like their nearest relatives, the grasshoppers and katydids, these
							insects, therefore, travel mostly by leaps and, in the course of time, their hind
							femora have thus become greatly enlarged.</p>
						<p>The ovipositor of the females of most Gryllidæ, when exposed, is usually a long,
							cylindrical spear-shaped organ, consisting apparently of two pieces. Each of these
							halves, however, when closely examined, is seen to be made up of two pieces so united
							as to form a groove on the inner side, so that when the two halves are fitted
							together, a tube is produced, down which the eggs pass to the repository in the earth
							or twig, fitted to receive them.</p>
						<p>The eggs of most crickets are laid singly in the ground. A few of the burrowing
							species deposit them in irregular masses in underground cavities. Some tree crickets
							place them uniformly in a single row in the pith of twigs. In Indiana and other
							northern states most species are represented in winter by the eggs alone. A few,
							however, pass the cold season as nymphs, or as adults. The mole crickets are said to
							live for several years.</p>


						<pb id="VAB8231-642" n="641"/>


						<p>Among the families of Orthoptera the Gryllidæ and Tettigoniidæ take a rank superior
							to all others. As <bibl>Scudder (1869b, 233)</bibl> bas pointed out, the high
							specialization of the ovipositor of the female and the perfection of structure of the
							stridulating organ of the male place these two families above all others in the scale
							of Orthopteron life. That the two are very closely related can be readily seen by any
							one who will carefully compare them, organ with organ. The Gryllidæ are placed first,
							however, by most entomologists, as the great variety of form of almost any given organ
							among them, when compared with its relative uniformity of structure among the
							Tettigoniidæ, seems to indicate the higher rank of the former. Scudder adds: "I do not
							think it is without meaning that the crickets often live in company, that they sing
							both in concert and during day and night and are the closer attendants upon man. Their
							stridulating organ too is more complicated and more extensive and the pitch of their
							song is higher."</p>
						<p>The North American species of Gryllidæ are herein divided among eight subfamilies,
							all of which are represented in the territory covered by this work. The following key
							is largely based upon that of <bibl>Saussure (1877, 185)</bibl> which was used by
								<bibl>Scudder (1897c, 62)</bibl>. The Tridactylii have been separated from the
							Gryllotalpinæ, of which they heretofore formed a group or tribe, and made a separate
							subfamily. The form of the antennæ and the one- or two-jointed tarsi are sufficient of
							themselves to justify this proceeding, without taking into account the other important
							differences. The Mogoplistii have also been raised to subfamily rank as they are very
							different both in structure and habits from the Myrmecophilinæ with which they have
							previously been placed as a tribe.</p>

								<p>The principal characters of this genus have been given above under the subfamily
									heading and generic key. Among all our Gryllidæ these mole crickets rank first in
									size and singularity of structure. When full grown they measure from an inch and a
									fourth to an inch and a half in length, are pale brown in color and have the body
									covered with very short hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The females
									have no visible ovipositor, and, externally, may be separated from the males only
									by the difference in the veining of the uppermost of the tegmina. By their habit
									of burrowing beneath the soil in search of such food as the tender roots of
									plants, earthworms and the larvæ of various insects, the anterior tibiæ of these
									crickets have, in the course of ages, become so modified in structure as to
									closely resemble the front feet of the common mole, whence the generic name. The
									dactyls or claws of these tibiæ are four in number, the upper two, the larger,
									being movable; the others immovable. The compound eyes have, on account of the
									underground life, become much aborted, being not more than one-fourth the size of
									those of the common field crickets of the genus <hi rend="i">Gryllus</hi>. As the
									mole crickets crawl rather than leap, the hind femora are but little enlarged, and
									are always shorter than the pronotum. The hind tarsi are short, seldom exceeding
									half the width of the pronotum. The genus is widely distributed over the earth,
									three species occurring in the eastern United States.</p>

								<p>This, the <hi rend="i">G. borealis</hi> of my former work (1903, 411) and of most
									American authors, is a common insect in suitable localities throughout Indiana,
									though unknown to most of the inhabitants of the State. About one-third of those
									taken have the wings elongate, extending beyond the abdomen as shown in Fig. 212.
									On one occasion a log deeply buried in the sand on the southern shore of Lake
									Maxinkuckee was overturned and nine specimens were secured. Of these six were
									long-winged and three short-winged.</p>

									<p>Fig. 212. Long-winged male.</p>

								<p>In the moist mud and sand along the margins of the smaller streams and ponds the
									runs or burrows of this cricket, exactly like those of a mole though much smaller,
									can in late summer and early autumn be seen by those interested enough to search
									for them. The burrows are, in the main, very superficial, lying just beneath the
									surface and running in very irregular directions. They frequently fork, and often
									end beneath a stone or small stick. The insects themselves are seldom seen, as
									they are nocturnal, forming their burrows by night, and scarcely ever emerging
									from beneath the ground. Moreover, like a mole, they move backward as readily as
									forward, and so easily escape their enemies. Apparently one insect, or a single
									pair occupy these burrows; the males, though several are often heard at the same
									time, being usually at quite a distance apart.</p>
								<p>The burrows occasionally enlarge into side cavities large enough for the insect
									to turn around, and in such lateral chambers <pb id="VAB8231-646" n="645"/> the
									eggs are sometimes found in masses of 60 to 100, adhering to the rootlets of
									various plants. These eggs are spherical, white or almost colorless, and have a
									diameter of 0.7 mm. The young are active leapers, and are said to be about three
									years in reaching maturity. On July 19, 1894, a hundred or more of the half-grown
									young were captured in a small meshed seine while collecting fishes in a small
									stream in Montgomery County. They were evidently burrowing in the soft mud close
									to shore or perhaps in the mud beneath the shallow water. Just a year later a
									number of young were also taken in a seine from the waters of the outlet of Lake
									Wawasee, Kosciusko County. Since they feed, during their lives, mainly upon the
									tender roots of various plants, they are necessarily very injurious and it is
									fortunate that with us they are not more common than they are.</p>
								<p>The known range of this mole cricket is a very wide one extending from British
									America to the southern part of South America, Perty's types having been from
									Minas Gerzes, Brazil. <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1916, 277)</bibl> first placed the <hi
										rend="i">G. borealis</hi> of Burmeister as a synonym of <hi rend="i"
										>hexadactyla</hi> and as Scudder and Saussure in their keys separated the two
									only by the length of the inner wings and the form of the projection at the base
									of the second lateral dactyl of the fore tibiæ, the two names are doubtless
									synonymous. The long-winged form, <hi rend="i">columbia</hi>
									<bibl>Scudder (1869a, 26)</bibl> was first placed as a synonym of <hi rend="i"
										>borealis</hi> by me in 1903. Other synonyms of <hi rend="i">hexadactyla</hi>
									are <hi rend="i">brevipennis</hi>
									<bibl>Serv. (1839, 368)</bibl> and <hi rend="i">longipennis</hi>
									<bibl>Scudder (1862, 426)</bibl>.</p>
								<p>In Florida <hi rend="i">G. hexadactyla</hi> has been taken by me only at St.
									Augustine (at light), Ormond, Lake Okeechobee and Dunedin, though its runways have
									been noted at almost all collecting stations. Elsewhere in the State it has been
									recorded only from Leon County, where Hebard found one in a cherry tree,
									Enterprise and Lake City. About Dunedin its runways occur in numbers around the
									numerous small lakes and ponds, and on March 11, 1918, I took nine males and three
									females by digging in the muck on the margin of one of these. The specimens thus
									taken were all brachypterous and were much more sluggish in their actions than
									when uncovered in a runway. They were smaller and darker than those from Indiana
									and the terminal joints of the palpi were also distinctly paler. When first
									uncovered the smooth silken-like luster of their surface was notable. To it not a
									particle of mud, muck or water adhered. There is little doubt but that this mole
									cricket occurs in numbers in all parts of the mainland of Florida <pb
										id="VAB8231-647" n="646"/> but has to be especially sought for in its mucky
									abiding places and the records for the State are therefore few.</p>
								<p><bibl>Morse (1919a, 31)</bibl> says that <hi rend="i">hexadactyla</hi> "probably
									occurs throughout New England but is very local and difficult to capture." I can
									find but one record from Ontario, that of <bibl>Fletcher (1892)</bibl> who had
									received it from Leamington and wrote an excellent account of its habits. There is
									no definite locality recorded from Michigan, though Hubbell has it from Washtenaw
									County. Bruner mentions it as not rare in the eastern half of Nebraska and McNeill
									as found about Moline, Ill. in August. The latter states (1891, 4) that it "can be
									made to eject from its cerci a grayish viscid substance which can be thrown
									several inches. The ejected mass does not have any noticeably bad odor, and if
									used to repel the attacks of enemies it is probably efficient by entangling the
									feet and covering the eyes of attacking insects." Of this habit <bibl>Baumgartner
										(1910 316)</bibl> says: "If one seizes a mole cricket of either sex it squirts
									from its anus a brown liquid of nauseating fetidity. This liquid is formed in part
									by excrement from the rectum and is in part the secretion of a special gland. It
									is protective in function, operating both as a repellent by its fetidity and as a
									restardant by its great viscidity or stickiness."</p>
								<p>The note of the male mole cricket is a sharp di-syllabic chirp, continuously
									repeated and loud enough to be heard several rods away. It is usually attributed,
									by those who have given little attention to insect sounds, to the field cricket or
									to some of the smaller frogs. The cricket is very difficult to locate by this
									note, and I have on several occasions approached cautiously, on hands and knees, a
									certain spot, and remained silent for several minutes while the chirping went on
									apparently beneath my very eyes; yet, when the supposed exact position of the
									chirper was determined and a quick movement was made to unearth him, he could not
									be found. Indeed, it is only by chance, as by the sudden turning over of a log in
									a soft mucky place, that a person can happen upon one of them unawares. Even then
									quick motion is usually necessary to capture him before he scrambles into the open
									mouth of one of the burrows which he has ever in readiness. I have heard their
									note in the forenoon of cloudy days, but it is much more common in the afternoon.
									Scudder who has set the note to scale says of it (1893 63): <q rend="blockquote">
										<p>"Our common mole cricket usually begins its daily chirp at about four o'clock
											in the afternoon, but stridulates most actively at about dusk. On a cloudy
											day, however, it may be heard as early as two or three o'clock; <pb
												id="VAB8231-648" n="647"/> this recognition of the weather is rather
											remarkable in a burrowing insect, and the more so as it does not appear to
											come to the surface to stridulate, but remains in its burrow, usually an inch
											below the surface of the ground. Its chirp is a gutteral sort of sound, like
												<hi rend="i">grii</hi> or <hi rend="i">greeu</hi>, repeated in a trill
											indefinitely, but seldom for more than two or three minutes, and often for
											less time. It is pitched at two octaves above middle C, and the notes are
											usually repeated at the rate of about 130 or 135 per minute; sometimes, when
											many are singing, as rapidly as 150 per minute. Often, when it first begins to
											chirp, it gives a single prolonged trill of more slowly repeated notes, when
											the composite character of the chirp is much more readily detected, and
											afterward is quiet for a long time. When most actively chirping, however, the
											beginning of a strain is less vigorous than its full swell, and the notes are
											then repeated at the rate of about 120 per minute; it steadily gains its
											normal velocity. It sounds not unlike a feeble distant croaking of toads at
											spawning season."</p>
									</q>
								</p>

								<p>McNeill (loc. cit.) says he has "been struck with the resemblance of the note to
									that of the tree cricket, <hi rend="i">Oecanthus niveus</hi>. To my ear the only
									discernible difference is that of pitch. The song is a simple chirp, very low in
									pitch for an Orthopteron, repeated at intervals of about a second."</p>
								<p><bibl>Baumgartner (loc. cit.)</bibl> says that the female mole cricket has a
									partly developed chirping organ on its tegmina. With this it produces a single
									note used as a means of recognition in the dark tunnels which it inhabits; both
									this organ of sound and the protective secretion above mentioned being adaptations
									to an underground life.</p>

								<p>This large mole cricket has been introduced and become established at a few
									points in the eastern States. Single adventive specimens have been mentioned by
									several authors, <bibl>Scudder (1869, 19)</bibl> recording one as received in a
									collection from Vermont, but doubted its having been obtained there. <bibl>Weiss
										(1915)</bibl> first recorded its establishment in this country in a nursery at
									Rutherford, N. Jer., stating that the firm on whose premises they were found
									claimed to have destroyed at least 20,000, including eggs. Later he and
										<bibl>Dickerson (1918)</bibl> gave an extended account of its occurrence at
									Rutherford, stating that: "This infestation, which is undoubtedly of several
									years' duration, extends over several acres planted to herbaceous and ornamenal
									stock, a large number of plants being yearly imported from Europe. The soil is
									rather light and porous and contains a variety of shrubs, shadetrees, etc., such
									as one would naturally find in a nursery. No <pb id="VAB8231-650" n="649"/>
									preference is shown by the cricket for any particular plant, its zig-zag burrows
									being found in different parts of the area irrespective of the kinds of plants
									growing there. The insects have been numerous enough for the nursery to detail
									several men at certain periods to hunt them out and destroy as many as possible
									every few days."</p>
								<p><bibl>Morse (1919, 18)</bibl> records three specimens as found in a local
									collection at Nantucket, Mass., where it was doubtless introduced by importations
									of European plants. <bibl>Burr (1897, 67)</bibl> states that in England: "It lives
									in holes in damp places, potato fields, and also in sandy places. The burrow is a
									long winding passage at the end of which is a chamber in which the female lays
									about one hundred dirty yellow eggs. It feeds on roots, etc., and animal food if
									it can get it. The stridulation of this mole cricket has been likened (by Gilbert
									White) to the churr of the nightjar, but 'more inward' as the insect churrs in its
									burrow. It is to be heard about dusk on warm spring evenings. In France they are
									very numerous, and do damage by eating the roots of grass, etc., but may be killed
									by pouring boiling water mixed with a little oil into their holes; they then come
									up to die. They may be kept in cages and fed on potatoes, turnips, meat, etc., but
									individuals should be kept separately or they will fight and mutilate each other.
									It takes about two years for this mole cricket to pass through its
									transformations; the larvæ, and perhaps the adult insects, hibernate."</p>
								<p>Gilbert White says of this mole cricket: "When it flies it moves <hi rend="i"
										>curso undoso</hi>, rising and falling in waves or curves like woodpeckers. In
									different parts of England people call them fern-crickets, churr-worms and
									eve-churrs, all very apposite names. Anatomists who have examined the intestines
									of these insects, astonish me with their accounts for they say, that from the
									structure, position and number of their stomachs or maws, there seems to be good
									reason to suppose that they ruminate or chew the cud like many quadrupeds."</p>
								<p>The majority of the European records of this insect have been made under the name
									of <hi rend="i">Gryllotalpa vulgaris</hi> Latr., a synonym; <bibl>Burr (1897,
										67)</bibl> first restoring the older name of Linnaeus.</p>

								<p>Medium sized burrowing crickets resembling closely the species of <hi rend="i"
										>Gyllotalpa</hi> in general appearance but easily distinguished by having only
									two dactyls on each of the expanded fore tibiæ. <pb id="VAB8231-651" n="650"/>

									as the "Changa." It is said by <bibl>Barrett (1902)</bibl> to be "by far the most
									serious insect pest" of that island. He states that: <pb id="VAB8231-653" n="652"/>
									<q rend="blockquote">
										<p>"The young changa very seldom leaves the ground unless driven out by water,
											but the adults are frequently to be seen hurrying over the surface even in the
											daytime. The adult males frequently fly at night and are attracted to light.
											Though their flight is laborious, like that of a large beetle, and not long
											sustained, they sometimes rise to a light 20 feet or more above the ground.
											They seem to prefer dark, cloudy nights in which to make their ærial
											excursions. Whenever the soil is moist and not too hot, be it night or day,
											its work of destruction is carried on, though, of course much the greater
											amount of damage is done at night. Its habit of burrowing just beneath the
											surface in a great measure saves it from the attacks of lizards, but not
											entirely from fowls and blackbirds, that are quick to notice the slightest
											movement of the earth on top of the burrow and to recognize the cause thereof.
											These burrows, ramifying through the soil in the vicinity of food plants, are
											kept open and utilized for a considerable length of time by all the mole
											crickets frequenting that soil area. Thus it will be seen a changa can readily
											pass from the roots of one food plant to those several feet, or perhaps even
											yards, distant without emerging from the ground or making any new gallery.</p>
										<p>"When removed from the ground, or sometimes when surprised on the surface,
											the adult changa has the habit of feigning death. This 'possum' act may be
											prolonged several minutes. After a few minutes of intense activity directly
											after coming to a light, the changa usually strikes an attitude of meditation,
											as it were, and remains absolutely motionless for a considerable length of
											time.</p>
										<p>"The changa's food consists almost wholly of living plants; the stomach,
											however, is always found to contain more or less mud and sand, which is
											probably unavoidably eaten along with the roots. Portions of decaying plants
											and leaves and stems of living plants are sometimes eaten. In captivity, even
											with plenty of its normal food, the changa will eat the dead and dying
											individuals of its own kind; and we suspect that it varies its normal diet
											with an occasional earthworm, as we have kept specimens in cages on an unmixed
											diet of earthworms for a week or more."</p>

								<p>This species is known only from Jesup, Hebardville and White Oak, Ga. At

									condition was investigated, and beneath the wilted leaves, resting on <pb

									specimens were found. The roots of the lettuce, tomatoes and beets were found to

								<p>These little sand crickets are among the smallest of the Gryllidæ. The principal
									characters of the genus are given above under the subfamily heading. In addition
									they have the head subconical; ocelli rounded, arranged in a transverse row, the
									lateral ones very close to the lower inner margin of the eyes; labial palpi short,
									robust, the terminal joint club-shaped; pronotum short, somewhat shield-shaped,
									convex above, sides sloping, front margin truncate, hind one broadly rounded and
									meeting in a sharp angle the oblique lateral or lower one; tegmina corneous,
									usually abbreviate, reaching middle of hind femora; wings translucent, fully
									developed, slightly surpassing the abdomen; legs strongly compressed, front pair
									very short, their tibiæ usually broad, thin, four-fingered, concave within to
									receive the very slender two-jointed tarsi; middle legs very slender, their tarsi
									two-jointed and, like the fore ones, ending in a pair of long curved claws; hind
									tibiæ with apical half bearing four pairs of long, slender "natatory lamellæ,"
									preceded by slight serrations, also armed at tip on each side with two very
									unequal spurs. Abdomen slender, last dorsal segment large, deeply cleft; cerci
									slender, tapering, bristly, two-jointed; beneath them a pair of slightly shorter,
									equally slender bristly one-jointed appendages.</p>
								<p>Ten species of <hi rend="i">Tridactylus</hi> have been described from North
									America. <bibl>Scudder (1902)</bibl> reduced these to three and founded for one of
									them the genus <hi rend="i">Ellipes</hi>. <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1916, 283)</bibl>
									combined the two left by Scudder so that we have remaining only the one species
									described by Say. Those reductions and combinations were largely due to the paper
									of <bibl>Morse (1901a)</bibl> who showed that the fore tibiæ of the males vary
									exceedingly in form, being usually more "or less irregularly ovate in outline and
									terminating apically in four prominent equidistant teeth, with the convex outer
									face thickly set with hairs, * * * the tarsus being inserted <pb id="VAB8231-657"
										n="656"/> between the first and second teeth and lying on the anterior face."
									From this normal form it varies in progressive degree to a remarkably bifurcate
									organ in which the inner limb is elongated and devoid of hairs, the innermost
									tooth nearly disappears, the second is greatly prolonged into a claw-like organ,
									while the femur acquires tooth-like projections on its upper, inner ventral angle
									and becomes greatly enlarged.</p>
								<p>"These sand crickets," says Scudder, "are in general appearance, miniature
									Gryllotalpas, though, not being heavy bodied, they can leap vigorously, bounding
									high in the air. Nothing is more curious than these lively and pygmy
									mole-crickets; they live in similar places, and make burrows like the
									mole-crickets, but their forelegs, though constructed for burrowing, are very
									different in detail. They are not, however; found in quite such wet spots as the
									mole-cricket haunts, preferring the sandy margins of ponds rather than muddy ones.
									Their burrows are at first vertical, but immediately turn, running not more than
									an inch below the surface of the ground, and are very narrow, as would be expected
									of such little creatures; one measured was hardly a twentieth of an inch in
									diameter. The males are not provided with any tambourine upon the wings, and
									therefore can not sing."</p>

								<p>This sand cricket appears to be common locally in southern Indiana, but has been
									noted only in Lake County in the north. It occurs mainly along the sand bars of
									the larger streams. In Owen County it has been seen by hundreds in August and
									September on the damp bars along White River, often in company with <hi rend="i"
										>Ellipes minuta</hi>, while in Putnam and Vigo counties adults have been taken
									in early June. It occupies small pits or burrows in the sand, and may sometimes be
									seen resting with the head, and half the body, outside the opening of the pit,
									into which it backs as one draws near. When out at a distance from any convenient
									pit, it leaps vigorously when approached, often to <note id="note_080"><ref
											target="ref_080" rend="super">77</ref>Say's first spelling of this name was

									<pb id="VAB8231-658" n="657"/> a height of five feet and a distance twice as

								<p>The known range of <hi rend="i">T. apicalis</hi> is a very wide one, extending
									from southern New England, Ithaca, N. Y. and near Toronto, Ontario west to
									Minnesota and south and southwest, according to <bibl>Scudder (1902)</bibl>, to
									Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Southern California, Mexico, Ecuador and South America.
									The only Florida record which can be found is that of the type locality of Say
									(loc. cit.), who states that it is "numerous on St. John's River in East Florida,

								<p><bibl>Saussure (1874, 352)</bibl> was the first to suggest that the <hi rend="i"
										>T. terminalis</hi>
									<bibl>Scudder (1862, 425)</bibl> "is probably only a northern variety of <hi
										rend="i">T. apicalis</hi> in which the organs of flight have not arrived at
									their full development." Later he evidently considered <hi rend="i"
										>terminalis</hi> as only a synonym as he does not mention it in his revision
									(1897a).</p>
								<p>In Ontario <bibl>Walker (1904, 144)</bibl> first found two specimens of <hi
										rend="i">apicalis</hi> near the Humber River and later in numbers along a small
									stream near York Mills. This is its most northern record. <bibl>Lugger (1898,
										259)</bibl> mentions a single specimen as having been taken near Ft. Snelling,
									Minn.</p>
								<p><bibl>Thomas (1865, 442)</bibl> says that in Illinois his <hi rend="i">T.
										illinoiensis</hi>, a synonym of <hi rend="i">apicalis</hi>, is abundant
									throughout the State, "living in the soft sandy banks of branches close to the
									water. Here their little holes may often be seen in great numbers, from which
									individuals of all ages will emerge if the earth is forcibly pressed. While
									walking along the banks of the river I have seen them by hundreds leap on to the
									water along which they float for an instant and then spring back on the bank. They
									have a singular enemy in the bug, <hi rend="i">Galgulus oculatus</hi> Fab., which,
									being of a mud color and lying flat close to the ground, moves slowly along and,
									when close to its victim, with a sudden upward and forward leap it grasps the
									unsuspecting cricket with its fore legs and plunges its beak into it."</p>
								<p>On Staten Island, N. Y. <bibl>Davis (1891)</bibl> found <hi rend="i"
										>apicalis</hi> "not uncommon at Watchouge in damp places. Their small size and
									marvelous agility made them most entertaining insects to capture. The power of
									leaping is so great that they seem to disappear quite <pb id="VAB8231-659" n="658"

								<p>This small sand cricket occurs throughout Indiana, frequenting damp sandy places
									which are sparsely covered with grass or other vegetation, where it is often found
									in company with the grouse locusts or with the larger sand cricket, <hi rend="i"
										>Tridactylus apicalis</hi> Say. While more active in its movements it does not
									leap as high nor as far as that species. The best way to capture them, after
									discovering a colony, is to use a sweep net rapidly just above the ground. The
									pair of minute subapical swimming plates of hind tibiæ are sometimes wanting, and
									rarely there are two on the outer margin. The long apical so-called "calcaria" are
									finely fringed above. They are not, therefore, spurs in the true sense and are
									doubtless used as swimming organs.</p>
								<p>In Florida this is also a common insect and has been taken by me at all
									collecting stations except Cape Sable and Key West. There, as elsewhere, it is
									more abundant about ponds and lakes than along the flowing streams, and has been
									recorded by other collectors from numerous localities on the mainland, but not as
									yet from the southern keys.</p>

									and Mexico. It is not known from New England nor from Canada. For an insect of so

									mentions it as occurring at Columbus, Cedar Point and Sugar Grove, Ohio. No
									locality has been recorded for Michigan, though it doubtless occurs in the State.
									Lugger does not record it from Minnesota though Scudder says he does. Bruner

								<p>The species of <hi rend="i">Myrmecophila</hi> are among the smallest of

									occur. The principal literature treating of our American forms is as follows:
										<bibl>Bruner, 1884</bibl>; <bibl>Scudder, 1899d</bibl>; <bibl>Wheeler,
										1900</bibl>; <bibl>Blatchley, 1903</bibl>; <bibl>Schimmer, 1909</bibl>.</p>
								<p><bibl>Wheeler (1900)</bibl> has given an interesting account of the habits of one
									of these little crickets from which I quote at length as follows : <q
										rend="blockquote">
										<p>"In the present paper I wish to call attention to the peculiar habits of <hi
												rend="i">Myrmecophila nebrascensis</hi> Bruner which is very common in the
											vicinity of Austin, Texas, where it may be found in the nests of no less than
											five very different species of ants. My observations on the habits of this <hi
												rend="">Myrmecophila</hi> began early in March. The little crickets were
											taken from the Formica or red ants' nests and placed in artificial nests of
											the agricultural ant, an insect of much larger size, slower movements and in
											many other respects more satisfactory for purposes of observation than the
											Formica.</p>
										<figure>
											<p>Fig. 217. <hi rend="i">Myrmecophila nebrascensis</hi> Brun. (After
												Lugger.)</p>
										</figure>
										<p>"On April 3d I placed in the artificial nest twenty Myrmecophilas, eight or
											ten of which had been squeezed or had lost one or both saltatory legs during
											capture. All the disabled individuals were at once seized and dispatched in so
											vindictive a manner, that I could not doubt that the ants were irritated by
											the pungent red ant nest-odor still clinging to the crickets. In an instant
											all the ants in the compartment of the nest had gathered in little groups,
											each devouring a Myrmecophila. The uninjured crickets made not the slightest
											attempt to escape, but felt themselves perfectly at home as soon as they set
											foot on the floor of the nest. Their adaptation to a new nest and to an ant of
											a larger size and belonging to an entirely different sub-family from their
											former host, was immediate and complete. With constantly vibrating antennæ
											they began dodging in and out among the little groups of assembled ants. From
											time to time one of them would be seen cautiously approaching an ant, that was
											busy with its dinner of Myrmecophila, and fall to nibbling at its legs or the
											tip of its abdomen. There could be no doubt that the cricket derived some
											benefit from the oily secretion covering the surface of the ant's body. At
											first the ant disregarded this nibbling, which probably resembles the
											attentions of the toilet habitually received from sister ants, but the
											cricket's scraping mandibles and maxillæ soon grew annoying and the ant would
											either move away or turn its head, open its mandibles and make a lunge at the
											Myrmecophila like a large dog annoyed by a puppy But before the huge mandibles
												<pb id="VAB8231-662" n="661"/> had closed, the cricket was far away, already
											nibbling at the abdomen of some other ant. The cricket can get at only the
											legs and abdomen of its host, since the spreading legs prevent it from
											reaching the thorax. It often stands on its hind legs, and places its forelegs
											on the ant's leg, in order to reach the femur or tibia. For very obvious
											reasons, it avoids nibbling at or even approaching the ant's head. It is
											always alert, as if perpetually aware of danger and ready to dodge at the
											slightest movement made by the ant.</p>
										<p>"Occasionally in the narrow confines of an artificial nest the ants do
											succeed in capturing and devouring one of their vigilant little guests, but
											the fact that of the eleven sound crickets left after the above observation
											was made, eight were still alive June 22d, when I had to discontinue my
											observations for the summer, shows that the crickets are extremely expert in
											keeping out of danger. The attitude of the ants during all this time underwent
											no change as far as I could observe, for they would still occasionally make
											lunges at the crickets.</p>
										<p>"The crickets do not derive all their substance from cleansing their hosts.
											In earthen nests they are often seen haunting even the galleries that have
											been abandoned by the ants, scrutinizing the walls and nibbling at them from
											time to time. There can be no doubt that they find here the same substance
											which covers the ants, for the walls of the galleries of a populous nest soon
											become greasy from the attrition of the constantly passing ants. Sometimes the
											crickets may be seen nibbling at dead ants that have been temporarily
											abandoned in the galleries or placed on the kitchen-midden of the nest. The
											intestine of a Myrmecophila which I dissected was found to contain
											oil-globules and a granular whitish substance."</p>

								<p>Southern half of Indiana, April 26--Sept. 6; Dunedin, Fla., Dec. 3--March 24 (<hi
										rend="i">W. S. B.</hi>)</p>
								<p>This small ant-loving cricket was first taken in Indiana near New Harmony, Posey
									County, on April 26, 1901. It was afterward <pb id="VAB8231-663" n="662"/> found
									to be rather common in the region thereabouts as well as in Knox, Perry, Dubois,
									Crawford, Orange and Lawrence counties; the northernmost point at which it has
									been observed being near Mitchell, Lawrence County. Since its known general range
									is southern it probably does not occur in the northern half of the State. With us
									it is found in company with a half dozen species of ants, the most common of which
									is a rather large yellowish-red form, <hi rend="i">Camponotus melleus</hi> Say.
									The cricket seems to be always on the move, and when disturbed leaps with great
									agility. Those taken in Crawford County in September were almost double the size
									of those noted in the spring and probably more accurately represent the mature
									insect.</p>
								<p>At Dunedin four specimens have been taken, each singly beneath half buried logs,
									two of them without an ant beneath the logs where they were found. One of them had
									only one hind leg, yet leaped a foot in height and a distance of 18 inches several
									times when first uncovered. Dunedin is the most southern station known for <hi
										rend="i">M. pergandei</hi> and it is elsewhere known in Florida only from
									Crescent City, a single nymph from there being in the Philadelphia collection.</p>
								<p>This was the first of these little crickets described from North America,
									Bruner's types being from the "Atlantic States from Maryland southward." Its known
									range now extends from Washington, D. C. west to southern Indiana and south and
									west to Clayton, Ga. and Dunedin, Fla. In Ohio it has been taken by Dury near
									Cincinnati. The other four species of United States Myrmecophila are separated by
										<bibl>Scudder (1899d, 425)</bibl> only by minor characters of size and color,
									and it is very probable that two or three of them will prove to be but synonyms or
									varieties. Bruner in his original description of <hi rend="i">pergandei</hi>
									stated that the characteristic feature of that species is "the two light colored
									elliptical markings upon the disk of the pronotum," but these are not found in any
									of the Indiana or Florida specimens at hand.</p>

							<p>This subfamily has been previously placed as a group or tribe of the

								habits so different that I here raise it to subfamily rank. The species are mostly
								tropical or sub-tropical in distribution and occur for the most part on bushes or
								beneath debris in sandy localities near water. The principal literature treating of
								the American species of the subfamily is that of <bibl>Scudder, 1868b, 1897f</bibl>;

							<p>R. &amp; H. in their revision (1912a) recognized 11 genera of their group
								Mogoplistii, five of which they state to be represented in the United States or
								Mexico and three in the territory covered by this work. Anyone who compares their
								characterizations given on pages 193 and 208 of the two genera <hi rend="i"
									>Cryptoptilum</hi> and <hi rend="i">Cycloptilum</hi>, will find them word for word

									>Cryptoptilum</hi> the tegmina are said to be "concealed by pronotum in male,"
								whereas in <hi rend="i">Cycloptilum</hi> they are mentioned as "projecting beyond
								pronotum in male." This and "size small" and "very small" are also the sole
								characters used in the separation of the two genera in their key, p. 188. As the
								representatives of the two nominal genera at hand show no other structural
								differences of generic value whatever, and as wing length in Orthoptera is no longer
								regarded as of even specific value,<ref id="ref_081" rend="super" target="note_081"
									>78</ref> I have placed all the species under the older name <hi rend="i"
									>Cycloptilum</hi> Scudd. If the projecting tegmina is a character of generic

								and <hi rend="i">A. gibbosus</hi> and <hi rend="i">dorsalis</hi> be separated from
								the other species under a new generic name. <bibl>Banks (1906)</bibl> has well said:
								"If the characters which distinguish genera are of less value or are less constant
								than the characters that separate the species, such genera are worthless. They mean
								nothing. They are of no value to science. Why then accept them?"</p>
							<note id="note_081"><ref target="ref_081" rend="super">78</ref>As proof of this I need
								only quote <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1915c, 294)</bibl> as follows: "The work of Lutz has
								already demonstrated the error of using length of tegmina, wings and ovipositor as
								characters of specific importance in the genus <hi rend="i">Gryllus</hi>. The mass
								of evidence upon these features in Lutz's paper is absolutely convincing; from

								<p>The unique male type of Scudder was from Texas and the known range of <hi

									Cal., and in the middle west north to northern Colorado, central Nebraska and
									southern Illinois, three specimens being in the Urbana, Ill. collection taken by
									Hart and Shiga at Metropolis on the Ohio River in that State. It occurs in both
									moist and dry situations and ranges from sea level to 3,600 feet in elevation. At
									Cottonwood, Cal. <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1912a, 212)</bibl> found it "common under
									creosote bushes (<hi rend="i">Covillea</hi>), where among the collected refuse the

										>Hebard</hi>.) The differences between this form and typical <hi rend="i"
										>squamosum</hi> are so slight that they cannot be set forth in a key. I regard
									it as only a depauperate southern race of Scudder's species. Its known
									distribution is confined to southern Florida, where it has been taken from Lake
									Worth southward to Key West. <bibl>R. &amp; H. (loc. cit.)</bibl> state that "the
									entire territory over which this species is known has much of its surface composed
									of rough coquina rock which is very white. The species is wholly terrestrial and
									its coloration (as given above) so imitates the surface of the coquina that the
									little insects are practically invisible when at rest. * * * Nearly all the
									specimens taken have been found hiding under the coquina boulders on or near the
									strand. When first exposed they usually remain motionless and closely pressed to
									the surface of the rock; when disturbed, however, they spring about wildly and are
									hard to follow with the eye." They state (1914c) that "the song is a faint <hi
										rend="i">krik--krik--krik--krik</hi>, suggesting that of a species of <hi
										rend="i">Nemobius</hi> but much fainter." <bibl>Davis (1914)</bibl> mentions the

									March 4--15 by peeling off loose bark on two typical trees of the hammock jungle,
									the inkwood, <hi rend="i">Exothea paniculata</hi> Juss. and the pigeon plum, <hi
										rend="i">Coccolobis laurifolia</hi> Jacq. and on live oaks, <hi rend="i">Quercus
										virginiana</hi> Mill. Often several trees would be thoroughly examined without
									success, but usually two or three specimens would be found and rarely six or
									seven, on the same tree. When revealed, the tiny insects either fell with the bark
									or <pb id="VAB8231-671" n="670"/> remained usually motionless when they could
									easily be made to jump into the beating net, which was held below the spot under
									investigation to catch the bark and any specimens which might fall with it.
									Without such use of a net the species would prove very difficult to capture. The
									insect is apparently wholly nocturnal and individuals probably seldom leave the
									tree trunks. This latter is indicated by the peculiar silvery general coloration
									of the insects, mottled and speckled with dark brown, which blends perfectly with
									the bark of the trees upon which they are found, but which would cause them to be
									conspicuous under many other environmental conditions."</p>

									until laid low by the hoar frost of autumn, renders them particularly injurious.
									The aggregate damage which they cause to grass and kindred plants in the course of
									a single season must be great, and there is little doubt but that all species of
									the genus should be classed among those insects highly destructive to forage
									plants.</p>
								<p>The small size, nearly uniform color and variability in length of tegmina, wings
									and ovipositor have led to many synonyms among the species of <hi rend="i"
										>Nemobins</hi>. Up to 1900 but four species were known from the Eastern States.
									In that year I described three additional ones from Indiana, and a fourth in 1903.
									Hart, Walker, Caudell and Hebard have since described other forms. Hebard in his
									Revision (1913) placed several of the previously known forms as synonyms or
									varieties, and recognized 12 species and seven races or varieties from America
									north of Mexico. In the present work most of his conclusions have been adopted and
									the following key is based largely upon the one prepared by him.</p>

								<p>The long-winged or typical form of this ground cricket is much less common in
									Indiana than the short-winged one. I have taken it in the field on but two or
									three occasions, and then in small numbers on the stems of tall grasses about the
									margins of marshes. However, many have been taken from the walks and streets of
									Indianapolis, Fort Wayne and other cities and towns in the northern part of the
									State, but none, as yet, in the southern half, not even in Terre Haute, where I
									resided for seven years. Where the long-winged form breeds, and feeds by day is to
									me unknown. It appears to reach maturity about July 15th as, at times, in the
									first week in August, swarms composed of myriads have appeared about the lights of
									some of the cities. The newspapers the next day had a column or more devoted to
									the insects but nothing, except wild guesses, as to whence they came.</p>



								<pb id="VAB8231-676" n="675"/>


								<p>The short winged form (<hi rend="i">vittatus</hi>) begins to reach maturity in
									central Indiana about July 15th. Living specimens have been seen as late as
									December 1st. Although present in vast numbers, but little is known of its life
									habits. When disturbed they are very difficult to capture, making enormous leaps
									with their stout hind legs, no sooner striking the ground than they are up again,
									even if not pursued, until they find a leaf or other shelter beneath which to take
									refuge.</p>
								<p>The known range of <hi rend="i">N. fasciatus</hi> is a very wide one, extending
									from Nova Scotia and New England, west to Manitoba, Wyoming and Utah, and south
									and southwest to Tennessee, central Georgia, Arkansas and New Mexico. West of
									Manitoba typical <hi rend="i">fasciatus</hi> is replaced by its northern race <hi
										rend="i">abortivus</hi> Caudell, and south of North Carolina and central Georgia
									by the southern race <hi rend="i">socius</hi> Scudder. It is recorded as common
									wherever found and in number of individuals is perhaps the most abundant of all
									our eastern Orthoptera.</p>
								<p><bibl>Piers (1918, 331)</bibl> says it is one of the most numerous species of
									Orthoptera in Nova Scotia, all the specimens noted, however, being the
									short-winged form.</p>

								<q rend="blockquote">
									<p>"Around Halifax they begin to reach maturity about July 20, but the males do
										not commence stridulating till a fortnight later. At first a few are heard and
										only at night and so very faintly as to be all but inaudible except to a trained
										ear. In a few days they may be heard in daytime as well as at night and the
										notes become more noticeable. They are last heard at Halifax about Nov. 10, * *
										* some of them surviving as many as four ice-forming frosts, frozen ground and
										even evanescent snow falls.</p>
									<p>"The stridulation or shrilling note of the male is produced by the insect
										lifting the wing-covers about 45° above the body, and then shuffling them very
										rapidly together so as to vibrate the resonant organ at their base; thus
										producing a trilling sound or tremolo, of a prolonged character, resembling the
										syllable <hi rend="i">ple-e-e-e, ple-e-e-e, ple-e-e-e</hi>, repeated at rather
										short intervals or sometimes continued for several seconds or even much longer.
										The sound has a peculiar silvery timbre, and when myriads are shrilling all over
										the fields at night, or on fine days in late autumn, when other sounds are
										hushed and the air filled with the mystic charm of the hour or season, it
										produces a peculiarly drowsy, ceaseless tremor, pulsation or 'shimmer' of sound
										which is very familiar and loved by all dwellers in the country. It is, however,
										ineffably associated with a sad feeling that summer is on the wane or past, for
										it is our most characteristic autumnal sound in grassy places, and is linked
										with the sight of golden-rods and purple asters and the odour of falling
										leaves."</p>
								</q>

								<p><bibl>Scudder (1868a)</bibl> has set the note of the male to scale and says: "The
									chirping of the striped cricket is very similar to that of the <pb
										id="VAB8231-677" n="676"/> black field cricket; and may be expressed by <hi
										rend="i">r-r-r-u</hi>, pronounced as though it were a French word. The note is
									trilled forcibly, and lasts a variable length of time. One of these insects was
									once observed while singing to its mate. At first the song was mild and frequently
									broken; afterwards it grew impetuous, forcible and more prolonged; then it
									decreased in volume and extent until it became quite soft and feeble. At this
									point the male began to approach the female, uttering a series of twittering
									chirps; the female ran away, and the male, after a short chase, returned to his
									old haunt, singing with the same vigor but with more frequent pauses. At length,
									finding all persuasions unavailing, he brought his serenade to a close."</p>
								<p><bibl>Allard (1910)</bibl> states that throughout October and early November "<hi
										rend="i">N. f. vittatus</hi> fairly swarms in the grass fields and patures of
									much of New England," but he had never taken there the long-winged one. Around
									Washington, D. C. he found the two forms intermingling in some localities, and in
									others the long-winged one wholly absent. He adds: <q rend="blockquote">
										<p>"About Oxford, Mass., two singing forms of <hi rend="i">N. f. vittatus</hi>
											are very common. The stridulation of one of these is a very high pitched,
											prolonged trill, <hi rend="i">ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti</hi>; that of the
											other form is a very brief, shrill, intermittent <hi rend="i"
												>tiiii-tiiii-tiiii</hi>. A considerably lower pitch quite sharply
											distinguishes the brief intermittent notes, <hi rend="i">tiiii-tiiii</hi>,
											from the prolonged trill. These two trilling forms of <hi rend="i"
												>vittatus</hi> are quite definitely confined in separate colonies, and in
											different localities. The prolonged trilling form occupies almost exclusively
											the dry, grassy upland fields and pastures. In the damp and marshy low grounds
											in fields and pastures this form is replaced almost entirely by pure colonies
											of the intermittent trilling form. Only where the wet and dry conditions
											overlap is there a noticeable intermingling of the two forms. At Oxford this
											is the most abundant insect of late autumn, and continues to trill in the
											fields until overcome by the keen, freezing nights of November."</p>

										rend="i">abortivus</hi> from Aweme, "show great variation in color and length of
									tegmina and ovipositor. Some individuals approach <hi rend="i">N. maculatus</hi>

								<p>This handsome mottled species occurs sparingly throughout Indiana, frequenting
									for the most part low, dry open woods and borders of thickets. In Marion County I
									once found it quite frequent on October 6 amongst dead leaves and beneath logs
									where the ground ivy, <hi rend="i">Nepeta glechoma</hi> L., covered most of the
									earth. A week later, a heavy hoar-frost meanwhile intervening, not a specimen
									could be found.</p>
								<p>From the short-winged form of <hi rend="i">N. fasciatus</hi> this species is
									readily distinguished by its average smaller size, shorter tegmina of female,
									shorter and straighter ovipositor, fewer hairs on head and pronotum and finer
									cross-veinlets of female tegmina. The serrulations of the ovipositor are sharper
									than in <hi rend="i">fasciatus</hi>. The two also differ in color, the ground of
										<hi rend="i">maculatus</hi> being paler and the piceous more generally sprinkled
									where in <hi rend="i">fasciatus</hi> it is in lengthwise bars.</p>

									records only a single female from Tappahannock in his Virginia paper. No

									and song in northern Georgia as follows: "This pretty <hi rend="i">Nemobius</hi>
									is the first species to appear at Thompson's Mills and dwells among leaves in
									deciduous woods. It is especially common on a warm, heavily wooded slope bordering
									a small brook just east of the settlement. The trill is very brief, high-pitched
									and shrill, <hi rend="i">tiiiiiiii-tiiiiii-tiiiiiiii-tiiiiiiii</hi>. It is one of
									the commonest species of <hi rend="i">Nemobius</hi> in this vicinity and begins to
									stridulate as soon as spring opens in March and April. In April, 1910, very cold
									periods of weather with considerable sleet and snow completely silenced these
									hardy crickets. Notwithstanding this inclement weather these crickets were always
									in active stridulation as soon as the days became warmer."</p>

								<p>Marion, Vigo, Putnam and Knox counties, Ind., Oct. 1--27. In Indiana this
									prettily marked little species has been found to be rather common on the

								<p>This is the <hi rend="i">N. carolinus</hi> Scudd. of my former works (1900,

									(1913, 452) the present species as <hi rend="i">N. bruneri</hi>, claiming (p. 455)
									that Bruner's name "was unidentifiable from the literature." In a previous letter
									(Jan. 16, 1913) he wrote: "This species must be called <hi rend="i">Nemobius
										variegatus</hi> (Bruner) as this is the earliest description and the type
									specimen is in my collection. Bruner called it a <hi rend="i">Cyrtoxyphus</hi>

								<p>In Indiana this handsome little pitch brown cricket has been found only among the

									congenial home in the midst of the dense, damp sphagnum mosses. Sometimes they are
									so plentiful that a half dozen or more are seen in an area a foot square. Like the
									other members of the genus they are very active, when disturbed leaping
									vigorously, a few inches at a time, and finally seeking safety by burrowing in the
									masses of mosses. It has been taken in Marshall, Fulton and Starke counties and
									probably occurs wherever peat bogs and sphagnum mosses are present.</p>

										B.</hi>) ; Cabin John Run, Md. (<hi rend="i">Davis</hi>) This sombre-hued little
									cricket was first found in Kosciusko Co. Aug. 26, 1902, in some low, damp woods
									bordering Tippecanoe Lake. Here it had its home among the fallen leaves and
									beneath small chunks and chips. From Posey County a single specimen was procured
									also from a tract of low woods and on Oct. 5, 1917, about twenty were taken from
									beneath dead leaves on the side of a thickly wooded little slope leading down to
									the margin of a cypress swamp in Knox County. It appears that I had no males in
									the type series of <hi rend="i">confusus</hi> taken at Tippecanoe Lake and
									unfortunately got hold of a male of <hi rend="i">N. maculatus</hi> in drawing up
									the original description, so that the characters therein pertaining to that sex
									are misleading.</p>
								<p>Outside of Indiana N. <hi rend="i">confusus</hi> has been recorded from a number
									of stations in Maryland and Virginia, from Raleigh, N. Car. and from Rabun County
									and Buckhead, Ga. At Raleigh <bibl>Brimley (1908, 21)</bibl> found it "in damp
									places not far from water from mid-August to late November," while at Buckhead a
									nymph was taken by R. &amp; H. from the undergrowth of mixed oak and pine forest.
									No macropterous specimens are known.</p>
								<p>It seems that each of the different species of this genus taken in Indiana has
									its special abiding place, <hi rend="i">fasciatus</hi> and <hi rend="i"
										>carolinus</hi> being the only ones which may be looked for anywhere in open
									fields and along roadways; <hi rend="i">maculatus</hi> occurs in open woods
									usually in dry situations; <hi rend="i">griseus</hi> in sandy districts; <hi
										rend="i">variegatus</hi> along the banks of streams and on gravelly hillsides;
										<hi rend="i">palustris</hi> nowhere except among the sphagnum mosses of dense
									swamps and bogs, while <hi rend="i">confusus</hi> likes best the shadows of dense
									woods which are low and moist. Each form has, therefore, its special habitat where
									the food on which it thrives is most abundant, and where, during the ages past, it
									has become so modified in organ and hue as to receive from man a distinctive
									specific name.</p>

								<p>Miami, Fla. (<hi rend="i">Hebard</hi>). This little cricket is a submaritime
									species known from the United States only from a series taken at Miami, Fla. by
									Hebard who says (1915, 195) : "They were found March 15 on the black soil and
									among drift in a mangrove swamp which at high tide was under more than a foot of
									water. The series was taken when the tide was out. At the time the weather was
									cool and the individuals were not rapid in their movements <pb id="VAB8231-691"
										n="690"/> but were difficult to capture owing to the environment, their sombre
									coloration and their habit of hiding under the drift or the sodden mangrove
									leaves."</p>
								<p>Morse's types were taken July 13 at Moraine Cay, Bahama Islands by Dr. G. M.
									Allen who furnished Morse the following notes regarding its habits: <q
										rend="blockquote">
										<p>"This interesting little cricket was found abundantly along the edge of a
											mangrove swamp that extended for some distance out from the shore. On
											approaching this swamp from the landward side my attention was attracted by a
											faint but continuous cricket-like note which seemed to come from all about me.
											After a careful search among the black roots of the mangroves and the
											water-soaked leaves at their bases, I found numbers of the little insects.
											They were extremely quick and agile, and although it was easy enough to see
											them as they leaped aside at my approach, they immediately became invisible on
											alighting, so closely did they harmonize in color with the dark sticks and
											leaves. In this thick undergrowth the use of a net was practically out of the
											question, even if I could have been quick enough to sweep up the active little
											creatures. I found, however, that I could easily drive two or three at a time
											onto a sheet of newspaper that I spread on the sodden surface of the swamp,
											and with a slow but steady motion a wide-mouthed bottle could be brought above
											a resting insect and clapped over him before he could escape."</p>

								<p>Tappahannock, Va., June 9 (<hi rend="i">Fox</hi>). A tropical or subtropical form
									occurring in the United States mainly along the Atlantic coast from New Jersey
									south and southwest to southern Florida, Louisiana and Victoria, Texas, and also
									in the West Indies, Mexiico, Columbia and Guiana. In Florida it has been recorded
									from Jacksonville, Lawtey, Gulf Hammock, DeLand and Miami. At the latter place
									Hebard trapped a single male in a molasses jar.</p>
								<p><bibl>Caudell (1904g)</bibl> records that as early as 1887 they were reported as
									doing much damage about Jena, La., to cotton, sweet and Irish potatoes, peas,
									strawberries and tobacco, his correspondent writing that "their holes in the
									ground are scattered promiscously from a few inches to several feet apart, the
									burrows being seldom over a foot deep in the uplands but much deeper in the swamps
									where the subsoil was softer. The insects are seldom visible in day and do their
									cutting at night, taking all they want down in the ground, where they eat as they
									please or feed their young ones. They appear to go in colonies and we find that
									rapid cultivation, large flocks of poultry and numerous birds are necessary to
									keep them in check." In 1903 specimens were sent in to Washington from Beech
									Island, S. Car. which had been taken in cotton fields where they burrow to a depth
									of 18 inches, lining the holes with shreds of cotton leaves and in so doing
									destroying the young cotton for several feet in the row. The young were found in
									these burrows in June.</p>
								<p><bibl>Manee (1908, 461)</bibl> states that at Southern Pines, N. Car. the
									"mounds" of this cricket are very common and are "built near some small weed,
									whose leaves furnish the wide but shallow horizontal chamber," the latter
									connecting with one or more perpendicular or oblique tunnels which serve as
									'retreat shafts' when the insect is disturbed." This is probably the species
									mentioned by <bibl>Scudder (1894c)</bibl> under the name <hi rend="i"
										>Gryllodes</hi> sp. as taken by Maynard near Jacksonville, Fla. in similar
									burrows.</p>
								<p>At Clarendon, Va. <bibl>Allard (1916a)</bibl> found <hi rend="i">A. muticus</hi>
									in numbers in early June in a pine grove where they occurred upon the trunks of
									the pines from one to eight feet above the ground. The males stridulated only on
									warm evenings, beginning about sundown and continuing in the early part of the
									night. "The trill is loud, continuous, high-pitched, much resembling that of an
										<pb id="VAB8231-693" n="692"/>
									<hi rend="i">Oecanthus</hi>." <bibl>Fox (1917)</bibl> reports that about
									Tappahannock, Va. they are "frequent in fields and pastures and along fence rows,
									nocturnal in habits, singing at or close to the mouth of the burrow."</p>

										(1905)</bibl> from Miami, where Hebard found them in numbers in February beneath

									West in July it was everywhere common about the town and that, with the aid of a
									flash-light, individuals were easily taken when carefully approached and suddenly
									seized; this was apparently due to the insects being blinded by the light for they
									are certainly the most active gryllid found within the United States."</p>
								<p><bibl>Davis (1914)</bibl> records them as occurring in a house on Big Pine Key

									sing their cheerful and very energetic song."</p>
								<p>The species is tropical and practically cosmopolitan, Walker's type coming from

										(Psyche, 1908, 96)</bibl> has recorded it as appearing in countless numbers in

									appearance a large Nemobius, has been taken in Franklin, Clark, Posey, Knox,
									Gibson and Crawford counties, where it occurs on dry wooded hillsides beneath flat
									stones and logs. It seems to like best places devoid of grass and other

								<p>The Florida specimens above mentioned were nymphs and were taken beneath boards
									along the margins of ponds and lakes. Elsewhere in that State it has been recorded
									from a number of stations between Jacksonville and Homestead and also from Key
									West.</p>
								<p>This species is the <hi rend="i">Miogryllus saussurei</hi>
									<bibl>Scudd. (1877, 35)</bibl> of most American authors, myself included (1903,
									442). <bibl>Hebard (1915c)</bibl> has placed <hi rend="i">saussurei</hi> as a
									synonym of <hi rend="i">Gryllus verticalis</hi>, which was based on a long-winged
									female from Cayenne, French Guiana. This was done without seeing Serville's type
									and the placement is therefore open to question, though, judging from <pb
										id="VAB8231-696" n="695"/> Serville's description, probably correct. Other
									synonyms of <hi rend="i">verticalis</hi> as given by Hebard are <hi rend="i"

									<bibl>Sauss. (1874, 408)</bibl> from Buenos Aires, <hi rend="i">Gryllodes

										oklahomœ</hi>
									<bibl>Caudell (1902, 90)</bibl> from Perkins, Okla., the last named synonym being
									based upon an almost uniform black color variety.</p>
								<p>If these synonyms of <hi rend="i">M. verticalis</hi> are correct the range of the
									species embraces most of the American continent. In the United States its known
									range extends from Staten Island, N. Y. west to Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma and
									south and southwest to Key West, Fla. and southern Texas. But one macropterous
									individual, a female taken by Brimley at Raleigh, N. Car., is recorded from this
									country and but three others besides the type have been noted elsewhere.</p>
								<p><bibl>Davis (1909b)</bibl> notes the habits of <hi rend="i">M. verticalis</hi> as
									follows : "At Lakehurst, N. Jer. it is found under dead leaves and other objects
									lying on the ground. My attention was first called to the insect by hearing the
									males stridulating at night. Their song is a slow, <hi rend="i">zee</hi>, repeated
									at intervals of several seconds. Later the females were also found. At Lakehurst
									and on Staten Island, several individuals were taken on sandy ground. It reaches
									maturity in June. Individuals of this species of cricket differ markedly in the
									development of the hearing organ on the inner side of the fore tibiæ. In two of
									the examples collected this organ is totally absent, in four it is slightly
									developed, and in one it is slightly developed on the inner surface of the right
									tibiæ, but absent on the same surface of the left leg."</p>
								<p><bibl>Allard (1911a)</bibl> describes its habits at Thompson's Mills, Ga., in
									part as follows: "It is a ground-dwelling species and keeps itself well concealed
									beneath the matted leaves and grass of gardens and orchards. Its notes are very
									brief, high-pitched musical trills, <hi rend="i">tzeee-tzeee-tzeee</hi>, with
									brief intermissions. One individual delivered from 38 to 39 trills in a minute.
									This cricket may be heard in stridulation very early in the morning and more or
									less throughout the day and at night. It is rather difficult to locate and capture
									one by its notes, for these are quickly silenced by one's approach. This cricket
									is very lively, and if uncovered leaps about vigorously. Its light brown
									coloration makes it very inconspicuous among the similarly colored leaves and
									soil."</p>
								<p><bibl>Isely (1905, 248)</bibl> says that the black form, <hi rend="i">M.
										oklahomœ</hi> Caud. is the first cricket to reach maturity at Wichita, Kansas,
									adults being taken on May 22. "In a few days they became very <pb id="VAB8231-697"
										n="696"/> numerous and the males' stridulation could be heard on all sides in
									the afternoon and evening. They were especially abundant in thick short dead grass
									on a hillside." He found some in small perpendicular burrows from one to two
									inches deep, and others beneath stones. No specimens were taken after June 23,
									though specimens of the pale form <hi rend="i">M. saussurei</hi> were found on
									August 8.</p>

								<p>This, the typical genus of the family Gryllidæ, comprises crickets of medium or
									large size and robust form, having the head large, subglobose, usually slightly
									broader than pronotum; eyes rounded, prominent; antennæ very slender, setaceous,
									longer than the body; pronotum broader than long, its disk rounded into the

									curved, the front and hind angles rounded; tegmina and wings variable in length,
									the former with large shrilling organ in male; hind femora very much enlarged,
									shorter than tibiæ and tarsi united; hind tibiæ armed above on each side with five
									to eight large stout movable spines and at apex with three pairs of unequal spurs;
									basal segment of hind tarsi stout, armed above with a row of short spines on each
									margin, its apex terminating in two stout spurs, the inner one the longer; second

									These <pb id="VAB8231-698" n="697"/> burrows are generally forsaken about
									mid-summer for some sort of above-ground shelter. From this time on, until fall,
									they appear to be more social and live in colonies under various sorts of rubbish.
									Grain shocks are a favorite haunt for them and since twine has been used for
									binding, the crickets have been quite troublesome by cutting the bands. During
									late summer and fall the females commence preparations for the continuance of
									their kind, by thrusting their long, slender ovipositors into the loose soil and
									dropping their eggs. These sometimes hatch the same year, but, as a rule, lie over
									until the following spring. The young generally live above ground, where they hide
									among fallen leaves, grasses and other debris, though sometimes they also creep
									into chinks and crevices in the earth."</p>
								<p>The remarks of Bruner apply in Indiana mostly to the form <hi rend="i"
										>luctuosus</hi>, one of our largest and only social field cricket. Here the
									young of <hi rend="i">G. pennsylvanicus</hi> and <hi rend="i">vernalis</hi> are,
									for the most part, hatched in autumn and survive the winter in the nymph stages,
									while <hi rend="i">G. domesticus</hi>, the house cricket, passes the winter either
									as adult or nymph.</p>
								<p>The synonymy of the American forms of this genus is greatly confused, due largely
									to the fact that foreign writers have attempted to monograph the genus with but a
									limited number of specimens at hand; and again to the fact that the different
									forms, especially the males, are very difficult to separate.</p>
								<p><bibl>Lutz (1908)</bibl> after studying carefully the variations in length of
									tegmina, wings and ovipositor of a large number of forms of <hi rend="i"
										>Gryllus</hi> from all parts of the world concluded that "species in an any way
									natural sense do not exist in the genus." <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1915c)</bibl> came to
									about the same conclusion regarding the native American forms, placing them all
									under the one name, <hi rend="i">Gryllus assimilis</hi>
									<bibl>Fab. (1775, 280)</bibl> described from Jamaica, qualifying this placement,
									however, by stating (p. 299): "We have found that in general certain types do
									predominate over certain regions. These constitute the bases of many of the
									supposed species but in our opinion should be characterized by symbols rather than
									varietal names, owing to their complexity and the evident fact that none of these
									are distinct, either specifically or as geographic races, and really show only the
									various phases resultant from varied environmental conditions."</p>
								<p>There is no doubt but that the different forms of native <hi rend="i"
										>Gryllus</hi> intergrade and merge, just as do those of <hi rend="i">Nomotettix
										cristatus, Nemobius fasciatus</hi> and numerous other forms of Orthoptera for
										<pb id="VAB8231-699" n="698"/> which varietal or racial names have been retained
									by recent American authors. Since the characters of all such races, varieties, or
									even species, for that matter, are resultant in great part from "variable
									environment," and since the grouping or placing of any series of closely related
									forms is largely a matter of personal opinion or viewpoint of the worker, and as
									names are more readily grasped and remembered than symbols, I have retained the
									older names of the more distinct forms of <hi rend="i">Gryllus</hi> as trinomials.
									The student may either use them as such and call them variants, varieties or forms
									of <hi rend="i">assimilis</hi>, or discard them altogether and lump his native
									field crickets under the one name <hi rend="i">Gryllus assimilis</hi> as R. &amp;
									H. and Morse have done, a procedure which <bibl>Piers (1918, 338)</bibl> terms a
									"simple solution of the Gordian knot."</p>

								<p>In late summer and early autumn this is the most common field cricket in Indiana.
									Here it is represented during winter by the eggs alone. In southern Indiana these
									hatch in late May or early June and the mature males appear about July 1st, but in
									the central and northern parts of the State the first males appear about a month
									later. This large field cricket is, in habits, nocturnal, omnivorous, and a
									cannibal. Avoiding the light of day, it ventures forth, as soon as darkness has
									fallen, in search of food, and all appears to be fish which comes to its net. Of
									fruit, vegetables, grass and carrion, it seems equally fond and does not hesitate
									to prey upon a weaker brother when opportunity offers. I have often surprised them
									feasting on the bodies of their companions, and of about 40 imprisoned together in
									a box, at the end of a week but six were living. The heads, wings and legs of
									their dead companions were all that remained to show that the weaker had succumbed
									to the stronger--that the fittest, and in this case the fattest, had survived in
									the deadly struggle for existence.</p>
								<p>This is the <hi rend="i">G. abbreviatus</hi> Serv. of most authors, including
									myself (1903, 435). Serville described two forms, <hi rend="i">luctuosus</hi> on
									page 335 and <hi rend="i">abbreviatus</hi> on page 336. The latter is now
									considered only the short-winged form of <hi rend="i">luctuosus</hi>, though
										<bibl>McNeill (1891, 5)</bibl> says it is his opinion that <hi rend="i"
										>abbreviatus</hi> is distinct and that <hi rend="i">luctuosus</hi> is probably
									the long-winged form of <hi rend="i">pennsylvanicus</hi> Burm. The short-winged
									form (of <hi rend="i">luctuosus</hi>) is by far the more common in Indiana, only a
									few long-winged individuals having been noted.</p>
								<p>The range of <hi rend="i">G. a. luctuosus</hi>, including the short-winged <hi
										rend="i">abbreviatus</hi>, is a wide one, extending from New England and Ontario
									west to Manitoba and Colorado, and south to southern Florida, Louisiana and Texas.
									In Florida it has been taken by me at Sanford, Key West, LaBelle, Ft. Myers and
									Dunedin, and recorded by others, mostly under the name <hi rend="i">G. rubens</hi>
									Scudd., from numerous other points, both on the mainland and keys. About <pb
										id="VAB8231-703" n="702"/> Dunedin it is the most common field cricket noted,
									both adults and nymphs occurring throughout the winter, the long-winged forms,
									there frequent, being often attracted to light. Hebard captured them in numbers on
									Feb. 9 beneath boards and stones along the main street of Miami, where "after dark
									they were stridulating at a great rate."</p>
								<p>In Ontario <bibl>Walker (1904, 250)</bibl> says that adults begin to appear about
									the second week in August and in September and October become very numerous and
									congregate in large numbers under every chunk, log or board, under the loose bark
									of old logs or in burrows in the sand. Late in the season they may be seen by
									hundreds sunning themselves on fences close to the ground.</p>
								<p>About Moline, Ill., according to <bibl>McNeill (1891)</bibl>, "the eggs of <hi
										rend="i">abbreviatus</hi> hatch in July and the first adults appear as early as
									the second week in August. During every stage of life they are social, feeding
									together, seeking shelter in company and when egg laying time comes, in October,
									the females collect by hundreds in some suitable locality, an abandoned or little
									used roadway suits them well, and each lays several hundred eggs in an irregular
									mass. After this duty is performed their business on this planet seems to be
									finished and they succumb to the cold, none surviving the winter. The eggs do not
									hatch until the following July, or if in rare cases they do they probably perish
									with cold."</p>
								<p><bibl>Allard (1911a, 157)</bibl> says that about Washington <hi rend="i"
										>abbreviatus</hi> "not infrequently takes up its quarters in the house,
									announcing its presence by its stridulations which are intermittent chirps,
									possibly louder than the chirp of <hi rend="i">G. pennsylvanicus</hi>."</p>

								</list>

								<p>From <hi rend="i">luctuosus</hi> this form may be distinguished by the shorter
									body, less swollen head of male and especially by the short ovipositor, which in
									Indiana specimens ranges between 13 and 14 mm. in length. The main distinguishing
									characters between <hi rend="i">pennsylvanicus</hi> and <hi rend="i">vernalis</hi>
									are set out under the latter form. Another, very noticeable in the field in
									spring, is the dull grayish tinge of fresh specimens of <hi rend="i"
										>pennsylvanicus</hi>, especially on the legs and pronotum, the whole body of <hi
										rend="i">vernalis</hi> being shining black.</p>
								<p>In Indiana <hi rend="i">pennsylvanicus</hi> is also everywhere a common cricket
									and for the most part survives the winter in the nymph stage, the young, on the
									approach of cold weather, making for themselves cone-shaped cavities an inch or
									two across the top and about as deep, in the mold beneath decaying logs and
									rubbish. Sometimes the margins of these burrows are surrounded by fragments of
									grass stems and pieces of decaying leaves. In warm, sheltered localities, some
									individuals evidently reach maturity in late autumn or early winter; a full grown,
									freshly moulted female having been taken in a greenhouse in Marion County, on
									December 14th. The males begin to pass their final moult in central Indiana about
									May 15th, and from then on through June and July the open woods pastures and the
									angles of old rail fences echo with the music of their song. The young hatch in
									July and August, and after the second or third moult form their winter abiding
									places, while the adults perish with the coming of the hoar frost. The long winged
									form is much less common than the short winged and is seldom met with in the
									field; but may often be found about electric and other lights during the summer
									nights. However, on two occasions in June, I have taken a long winged male in
									company with two short winged females beneath logs.</p>
								<p>The range of the form or variant <hi rend="i">G. a. pennsylvanicus</hi> is even
									wider than that of <hi rend="i">luctuosus</hi> extending from Prince Edward <pb
										id="VAB8231-705" n="704"/> Island, Nova Scotia and New England west to British
									Columbia and California and south and southwest to southern Florida, eastern Texas
									and New Mexico. <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1915c, 302)</bibl> say that "it is the dominant
									variant of the species in the well watered regions of temperate North
									America."</p>
								<p>In Florida I have taken <hi rend="i">pennsylvanicus</hi> at Ormond, Sanford,
									LaBelle, Sarasota and Dunedin. Elsewhere in the State it is recorded definitely
									only from Orange City Junction by <bibl>Caudell (1905)</bibl> and Miami by
										<bibl>Hebard (1915b)</bibl>. About Ormond it was the only field cricket noted in
									March and April, while around Dunedin both adults and nymphs are fairly plentiful
									from December to April.</p>
								<p>Of <hi rend="i">pennsylvanicus</hi> in Ontario <bibl>Walker says (1904,
										251)</bibl> : "The chirp of the adult is first heard about the third week in
									May, the last toward the end of July. They are numerous about midsummer, when the
									fields and pastures resound with their song. They are very difficult to obtain,
									for they are not gregarious like <hi rend="i">abbreviatus</hi>, but usually occur
									in pairs hidden in the rubbish under some thick tuft of grass or weeds or under
									the edge of a stone. It requires the utmost care and patience to trace the song to
									its source, but if this is done successfully one is often rewarded by finding the
									female as well as the male." Of its habits in the south <bibl>Allard (1911c,
										147)</bibl> says: <q rend="blockquote">
										<p>"Careful studies of a number of musical insects have shown the writer that
											very marked differences of stridulation may characterize certain species in
											different parts of their range. This has been found especially true of <hi
												rend="i">Gryllus pennsylvanicus</hi>. The sprightly intermittent chirps of
											the New England individuals no more resemble the weak, continuous <hi rend="i"
												>Oecanthus-</hi> like trill of the northern Georgia individuals than the
											notes of <hi rend="i">Oecanthus niveus</hi> resemble the very dissimilar trill
											of <hi rend="i">Oecanthus latipennis</hi>. Not only is the stridulation very
											dissimilar, but the general habits are unlike. In New England <hi rend="i"
												>Gryllus pennsylvanicus</hi> fairly swarms in grass fields and pastures
											during autumn, chirping everywhere in plain sight. In northern Georgia this
											cricket becomes exceedingly abundant in March, April and May. In this region
											it is very shy and secluded in its habits, stridulating beneath matted leaves,
											clods of earth, and grass in fields, and oftentimes in deep burrows in
											pastures. It is rarely seen unless deliberately uncovered and unearthed. By
											midsummer its stridulations are rarely heard."</p>

								<p>This shining black field cricket has been taken in Crawford, Posey, Vigo, Putnam,
									Marion, Marshall, Wells and Lake Counties, Indiana, and probably occurs throughout
									the State. It is here the first species of Gryllus to become mature in the spring,
									the note of the male--the first Orthopteran song of the season--having been heard
									on a number of occasions in the central counties as early as May 5th. The young of
									this species, as well as of <hi rend="i">G. pennsylvanicus</hi>, survive the
									winter as nymphs. In September and October, after passing the second or third
									moult, they seek the shelter of loose bark on log or stump, or crawl beneath chunk
									or rail where they form for themselves small, inverted cone-shaped burrows in the
									earth, in which they abide until spring. Those which attempt to pass the winter
									with only a shelter of bark above them almost always succumb to the changing
									temperatures of that season, but those which choose more wisely a burrowing place
									beneath some half buried log or chunk for the most part survive. The temperature
									of their hibernaculum is much more equable, and the insects becoming sluggish in
									late autumn remain so until called into new activity by the sunshine of spring,
									unless, meanwhile, they fall a prey to some shrew, mouse or other active winter
									insectivorous mammal. They emerge from their hiding places about April 1st, and
									after changing their garb two or three times, <pb id="VAB8231-707" n="706"/> reach
									the mating stage in early May, when the males begin to greet the passer-by with
									their merry chirp.</p>
								<p>Neither this species nor <hi rend="i">pennsylvanicus</hi> are social crickets.
									Sometimes two or three of the young have adjacent burrows beneath the same chunk,
									but more often both they and the adults are solitary. The eggs are laid in June
									and July, and the newly hatched young are to be found in numbers during July and
									August.</p>
								<p><bibl>Caudell (1907d, 292)</bibl> has stated that this form is the same as <hi
										rend="i">G. nigra</hi>
									<bibl>Harris (1841, 123)</bibl>, but that form was regarded both by <bibl>Uhler
										(1862, 152)</bibl> and Scudder as a synonym of <hi rend="i">pennsylvanicus</hi>
									which Harris did not mention. Moreover, the type of Harris is destroyed and his
									original description is so short and incomplete that no one can tell what species
									he had in hand.<ref id="ref_086" rend="super" target="note_086">83</ref> I
									therefore have retained this as a middle-western variant or form of <hi rend="i"
										>G. assimilis</hi>.</p>
								<p>From <hi rend="i">pennsylvanicus</hi>, with which form <hi rend="i">vernalis</hi>
									was confused until 1903, the latter may be readily separated by its smaller size,
									narrower pronotum, more uniform shining black color, shorter ovipositor, and the
									shape, and position, when at rest, of the female tegmina. The reticulation of the
									dorsal field of these tegmina is more noticeable in <hi rend="i">vernalis</hi>
									than in <hi rend="i">pennsylvanicus</hi>, the main diagonal nerves being closer
									together and the cross nervules more elevated and prominent. Moreover, <hi
										rend="i">vernalis</hi> reaches maturity in the spring about a fortnight the
									sooner.</p>
								<p>Outside of Indiana, <hi rend="i">vernalis</hi> (as <hi rend="i">G.
										americanus</hi>) has been recorded from Illinois and Texas by <bibl>Hart (1906,
										91; 1906a, 160)</bibl> and from Franklin County, Ohio by <bibl>Mead (1904,
										110)</bibl>. Hart mentions it as "undersized, tegmina wholly black, usually
									divergent in female, peculiarly crinkled," and (1906a) says: "From what I have
									seen of this in Illinois I should think it was clearly distinct."</p>

								<p>This form or variant is, according to <bibl>Scudder, (loc. cit.)</bibl> the most
									common one in New England. <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1915c, 302)</bibl> state that it is
									"found in the northeastern part of the distribution of <hi rend="i">C.
										assimilis</hi>, ranging southward in the high Appalachians to northern Georgia
									and is known from the Piedmont plateau only in Pennsylvania." To this form
										<bibl>Piers (1918, 343)</bibl> refers the only form of <hi rend="i">Gryllus</hi>
									found in Nova Scotia and says (p. 352) : <q rend="blockquote"> "<p>In the vicinity
											of Halifax it is usually found on dry, sloping banks, with scant vegetation
											and therefore somewhat earthy and having some flattish stones scattered about,
											on country roadsides, the borders of fields, and similar places. It does not
											seem to congregate in numbers but is usually met with in pairs, a male and a
											female, under small stones, and when the stone is lifted it runs rapidly
											about, this way and that, in a gewildered manner, looking for a hiding place
											or its little burrow. Its leaping power is plainly not so great as that of <hi
												rend="i">Nemobius</hi>, and it makes but short jumps, and prefers if
											possible to find a place of concealment by running away. Its timidity and
											secretive nature cause it to be seldom seen about Halifax; but its notes draw
											attention to its hiding-place beneath a stone or piece of rubbish, where it
											can easily be captured.</p>
										<p>"The eggs are deposited in loose soil in the latter part of the autumn and
											hatch the following year, possibly early in June or thereabouts. Its notes or
											shrilling are apparently first heard near Halifax about August 2 and are
											frequently heard during both day and night in suitable places; but by October
											the number is much lessened in daytime and few or none shrill at night. The
											note is considerably louder, and is a shorter, slower-timed, and more distinct
											and noticeable trill than that of <hi rend="i">Nemobius fasciatus</hi>. It
											sounds like the trilled syllable <hi rend="i">plee-e-e</hi>. After each such
											trill it is silent for a moment and then calls again, thus: <hi rend="i"
												>plee-e-e; plee-e-e</hi>; and so on. These notes sound out distinctly louder
											and more staccato from the omnipresent undertone and lower-toned tremolo
											resultant from the intermingled shrilling of countless numbers of <hi rend="i"
												>Nemobius</hi> on all sides. When both species call more faintly at the
											beginning of the season, it is much more difficult to differentiate between
											the two."</p>

								<p>The "house cricket" or "cricket of the hearth" appears to be scarce in Indiana.
									Until January 1, 1903, I had in my collection but three specimens, two long-winged
									males and a short-winged female, taken from beneath rubbish in a gravel pit near
									West Terre Haute, Vigo County, in October, 1894. On the later date mentioned I
									secured a dozen or more adults and nymphs in a greenhouse just north of the city
									of Indianapolis. The proprietor informed me that the males utter their call note
									throughout the winter and that the insect is seemingly most abundant at that
									season. It has also been noted near Bainbridge, Putnam County by J. S.
									Michaels.</p>

								<figure>
									<p>Fig. 239. Female. (After Lugger.)</p>
								</figure>

								<p>This is an Old World cricket and probaby occurs sparingly in most of the states
									east of the Rocky Mountains, though recorded from the south only from "Carolina,"
									Georgia, Alabama and Texas. Scudder states that he has seen no short-winged
									specimens from the United States, though they are common in Europe. It is probable
									that in many instances the so-called "house-crickets" of the present country homes
									are field crickets, especially <hi rend="i">G. luctuosus</hi>, which have striven
									to prolong their existence by seeking shelter within the domiciles of man.
										<bibl>Marlatt (1896, 52)</bibl> has given the following pleasing account of the
									habits of this house cricket: <q rend="blockquote">
										<p>"In Europe, and in some parts of the United States, no insect inhabitants of
											dwellings are better known than these domestic or house crickets, not so much
											from observation of the insects themselves as from familiarity with their
											vibrant, shrilling song notes. These notes, while thoroughly inharmonious in
											themselves, are, partly from the difficulty in locating the songster, often
											given a superstitious significance and taken, according to the mood of the
											listener, to be either a harbinger of good and indicative of cheerfulness and
											plenty, or to give rise to melancholy and to betoken misfortune. The former
											idea prevails, however, and Cowper expresses the common belief that the-- <q
												rend="blockquote">
												<lg>
													<l>'Sounds inharmonious in themselves and harsh,</l>
													<l>Yet heard in scenes where peace forever reigns,</l>
													<l>And only there, please highly for their sake.'</l>
												</lg>
											</q>
										</p>
									</q>
								</p>

								<p>"The house cricket usually occurs on the ground floor of dwellings and evinces
									its liking for warmth by often occurring in the vicinity of <pb id="VAB8231-710"
										n="709"/> fireplaces, concealing itself between the bricks of chimneys or behind
									baseboards, frequently burrowing into the mortar of walls. It is particularly apt
									to abound in bakehouses. It is rarely very abundant but at times multiplies
									excessively and becomes a very serious nuisance. During cold weather or in cold
									rooms in winter, it remains torpid, but under the influence of warmth it becomes
									active and musical. It is easily kept in captivity as a pet, and will reward the
									possessor by furnishing an abundance of its peculiar melody, and in Spain it is
									often kept, it is reported, in cages, as we do singing birds. It is in the main
									nocturnal in its habits, coming out in the dusk of the evening and roaming about
									the house for whatever food materials it may discover. It feeds readily on bread
									crumbs or almost any food product to which it can get access, and is particularly
									attracted to liquids, in its eagerness to get at which it often meets death by
									drowning. It is a very pugnacious insect and will bite vigorously if captured, and
									is often predaceous or carnivorous, like most of its outdoor allies It is supposed
									to feed on various other house insects, such as the cockroach and is also probably
									canibalistic. A pair of native species kept in a cage by the writer, for a short
									period manifested the greatest friendliness, but the male shortly afterwards made
									a very substantial meal of his companion.</p>
								<p>"These Crickets, in common with most other Orthoptera, will occasionally in pure
									wantonness seemingly, cut and injure fabrics, and are particularly apt to cut into
									wet clothing, evidently from their liking for moisture. Any of the common field
									grasshoppers or crickets, entering houses, are apt to try their sharp jaws on
									curtains, garments, etc., and Dr. J. A. Lintner records the case of a suit of
									clothing just from the tailor which was completely ruined in a night by common
									black field crickets (<hi rend="i">Gryllus luctuosus</hi>), which had entered an
									open window in some numbers. There is a popular superstition also to the effect
									that if a cricket be killed its relatives will promptly cut the garments of the
									offender.</p>
								<p>"The house cricket may be readily destroyed by taking advantage of its liking for
									liquids, and any vessel containing beer or other liquid placed about will usually
									result in crickets being collected and drowned in numbers. It may also be
									destroyed by the distribution of uncooked vegetables, such as ground up carrots or
									potatoes, strongly poisoned with arsenic. In the use of poisoned baits in
									dwellings great care, however, should always be exercised."</p>
								<p><bibl>Walker (1904, 252)</bibl> records the taking of all stages of <hi rend="i"
										>G. domesticus</hi> in late autumn in the basement of the General Hospital at
									Toronto, Ontario. They were "lurking in the chinks between the bricks of the wall
									and positively swarmed under loose bricks close to the furnace. Morse does not
									mention it from New England (1919a) though <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1915c)</bibl> state
									that it has been recorded from Connecticut.</p>

							<p>Slender bodied crickets of a pale color having the head elongate, horizontal or
								nearly so; vertex declivent, passing gradually <pb id="VAB8231-711" n="710"/> into

								closely about the body; wings usually longer than tegmina; legs very slender; fore
								and middle tibiæ unarmed, the former dilated near base and furnished each side with

							<p>All our species of <hi rend="i">Oecanthus</hi> are mainly arboreal, living on
								trees, vines, shrubbery and the taller herbaceous plants. They especially frequent
								the various species of golden-rod and wild sunflowers, and often three or four can
								be found on a single one of these plants. For the most part they remain quiescent
								during the day, but are quite active at night.</p>
							<p>The first mention in this country of the peculiar mating habits of <hi rend="i"
									>Oecanthus</hi> was made in my former work (1903, 452) as follows:</p>
							<p>On September 18, 1898, I was in late afternoon in a wet prairie near Hammond,
								Indiana, where <hi rend="i">O. fasciatus</hi> was more than usually abundant on
								clumps of wild sunflower. A half dozen or more pairs were seen in copulation. In
								this act it seems that the female mounts the body of the male, the latter first
								raising the tegmina until they stand at an angle of about 45 degrees, so as to give
								the female access to a pair of glands which lie immediately beneath the base of
								wings. The female worked at these glands with her mandibles, the male meantime
								moving the inner wings gently sideways, in and out. After working over the glands
								for ten or fifteen minutes, the female would usually leave the body of the male and
								crawl onto an adjacent head of the sunflower. The male meantime kept the tegmina
								raised, seemingly in waiting for her return, which was always at the end of five or
								six <pb id="VAB8231-712" n="711"/> minutes. During the process, no intromittent
								organ of the male was noticeable, nor was any union of the parts at the end of the
								abdomen seen. Is it possible that in the mating of these Oecanthids the female
								removes the semen from the glands whose openings are beneath the tegmina of the male
								and then fertilizes her ova?</p>
							<p>Since then the mating habits of the different species of <hi rend="i"
									>Oecanthus</hi> have been carefully studied and described by <bibl>Hancock (1905,
									1911)</bibl> and <bibl>Houghton (1909)</bibl> and they are concisely stated by
									<bibl>Fulton (1915, 3)</bibl> as follows: <q rend="blockquote">
									<p>"The interest in these insects centers chiefly about their remarkable
										reproductive structures and instincts and their peculiar oviposition habits. The
										song of the male, which serves to attract the female, is produced by a minute
										rasp on the under side of the forewing which is scraped by a structure on the
										inner edge of the opposite wing. In producing the sound the wings are raised at
										right angles to the body and vibrated rapidly. When the wings are so raised,
										there is exposed on the metanotum a glandular hollow, the secretion of which is
										very attractive to the female. The latter climbs over the abdomen and feeds on
										the secretion. The male takes advantage of the position and inserts the barbed
										capillary tube of a spermatophore into the genital opening of the female and the
										sperms pass into the seminal receptacle. The spermatophore is formed in a
										peculiar pouch at the tip of the abdomen of the male by the hardening of a
										viscous liquid about a mass of sperms."</p>
									<p>"The female prepares for oviposition by chewing a small pit in the bark of the
										plant. The drilling is accomplished by quick downward thrusts of the ovipositor
										and a slower twisting motion. After the egg is deposited a quantity of
										mucilaginous substance is discharged into the hole, and with most species the
										female plugs up the opening with chewed bark or excrement."</p>
									<p>"The songs of tree crickets form a considerable part of the insect sounds to be
										heard in late summer and autumn. The males generally place themselves in some
										hidden retreat among the leaves, with only their long antennæ projecting to warn
										them of approaching danger. They stop singing at the slightest jar of the ground
										or movement of the plants in which they are located, but at night a strong light
										can be thrown on them without appreciably disturbing them.</p>
									<p>"In preparing to sing the male raises the fore wings or tegmina perpendicular
										to the body. This movement automatically unfolds them so that the inner portion,
										which normally lies over the back, and the inflexed outer portion, come to lie
										in the same plane when the wings are raised. The sound is produced by the fore
										wings vibrating rapidly in a transverse direction, so that the overlapping inner
										portions rub against each other.</p>
									<p>"The mechanism which produces the sound is found near the base of the wing, the
										broad expanded distal part serving as a resonator to increase the volume of
										sound. A short but prominent transverse vein, about one-fourth way from the
										base, is modified beneath to form a minute filiform rasp. It is from one to one
										and a half millimeters long according to species, and bears from 20 to 50 short
										teeth which are inclined slightly toward <pb id="VAB8231-713" n="712"/> the
										opposite wing. In all of many specimens examined the right wing laps over the
										left. The latter has a fine thickened ridge along the inner edge just opposite
										the file. This scrapes against the teeth of the file on the right wing and thus
										produces the sound vibrations. The underside of the left wing has a file
										practically identical to the other but this is apparently seldom, if ever,
										used."</p></q></p>
							<p>The eggs of the white tree crickets are deposited either singly and irregularly in
								the bark of trees or shrubs, or singly but usually in more or less regular rows in
								the pith of twigs, berry canes, grape vines and weed stems. By these habits of
								oviposition they often cause much damage to the growing plants, which is in part
								offset by their habits of feeding upon aphids and perhaps the young of other
								injurious insects.</p>
							<p>In addition to the works above cited treating especially of the mating habits the
								principal literature treating of our North American species of the subfamily is as
								follows: <bibl>Fitch, 1856</bibl>; <bibl>Saussure, 1874, 456-464, 1878,

								<p>While the snowy tree cricket occurs in all parts of Indiana, it appears to be
									less common in the State than either <hi rend="i">O. angustipennis</hi> or <hi
										rend="i">quadripunctatus</hi>, and much of the published literature relating to
									it has doubtless been of these and other species. Like the other members of its
									genus <hi rend="i">niveus</hi> reaches maturity in southern Indiana about July
									1st, and in the central part a fortnight later, and exists in that stage until
									after heavy frosts. The females appear to be more plentiful than the males, the
									latter being more often heard than seen. During the day they keep themselves
									hidden among the foliage and flowers of various plants, but as night approaches
									they come forth and the male begins his incessant, shrill, chirping note, which he
									continues with little or no intermission till the approach of morning warns him to
									desist.</p>
								<p>The range of <hi rend="i">niveus</hi> is said by <bibl>Fulton (1915)</bibl> to be
									wider than that of any other <hi rend="i">Oecanthus</hi>, extending from New
									England and Ontario to Minnesota and Utah, south and southwest to Georgia, Texas,
									Cuba and Mexico. It is not recorded from Florida and <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1916,
										296)</bibl> state that Thompson's Mills, Ga. and Cranberry, N. Car. are the only
									reliable definite records from the southeastern United States.</p>

								<p><bibl>Fulton (loc. cit.)</bibl> says that <hi rend="i">O. niveus</hi> "is a tree-
									and bush-inhabiting form. It is found most abundantly in apple orchards and is
									more or less common in plantings of other fruit trees and in raspberry
									plantations, shrubberies, vines and bushy fence rows. Among forest trees it is
									less common, although a few can often be heard singing in such places, especially
									along the edge of a wood. In general this species prefers a cultivated region to a
									wilderness. However, in orchards that are regularly sprayed with arsenicals, the
									crickets do not become very abundant."</p>
								<p><bibl>Morse (1919a)</bibl> states that <hi rend="i">niveus</hi> is common
									throughout southern New England in shrubbery near houses, orchards and gardens
									from late August till October. <bibl>Walker (1904, 253)</bibl> says that <hi
										rend="i">niveus</hi> is very common in the cultivated parts of Ontario and that
									of native trees he had found it most partial to butternut, where the females are
									found on the trunk and lower branches, but the males higher up and more difficult
									to obtain. He adds: "<hi rend="i">O. niveus</hi> is generally held responsible for
									a great deal of mischief done to raspberry and blackberry canes by the females in
									laying their eggs. It is my belief that most of this damage, at least in this
									locality, is done by <hi rend="i">O. fasciatus</hi> and <hi rend="i"
										>quadripunctatus</hi> which abound on raspberry bushes, while <hi rend="i"
										>niveus</hi> is seldom if ever found on them." This belief, as will be noted
									below, has been since proven to be correct.</p>
								<p>The first definite account of the song and habits of <hi rend="i">niveus</hi> is
									that of <bibl>Fitch (1856, 406)</bibl> in part as follows: <q rend="blockquote">
										<p>"In the southern part of New York the song of the snowy tree cricket begins
											to be heard as early as the first of August. Perched among the thick foliage
											of a grapevine or other shrubbery, some feet up from the ground, and remaining
											in the same spot day after day, its song begins soon after sunset and before
											the duskiness of twilight arrives. It is distinctly heard at a distance of
											several rods, and the songster is always farther off than is supposed. Though
											dozens of other crickets and katydids are shrilling on every side at the same
											time, the peculiar note of this cricket is at once distinguished from all the
											rest, consisting of repetitions of a single syllable, slowly uttered, in a
											monotonous, melancholy tone, with a slight pause between. The children regard
											the cricket as no votary of the temperance cause; they understand its song to
											consist of the words <hi rend="i">treat-treat-treat-treat</hi>, which words,
											slowly uttered, do so closely resemble its notes that they will at once recall
											them to the recollection of almost every reader. And the song is thus
											continued without the slightest variation and without any cessation, I think,
											the whole night through. I, however, have sometimes heard it at the first
											commencement of its evening serenade uttering three syllables resembling the
											words <hi rend="i">treat, treat, two; treat, treat, two--</hi>as though the
											songster was supplicating a libation for his voiceless mate as well as
											himself, a longer pause following each <pb id="VAB8231-717" n="716"/> third
											note. This prelude is probably performed in limbering or otherwise adjusting
											his organs, preparatory to performing the regular carol, which is struck into
											in a few moments."<ref id="ref_088" rend="super" target="note_088"

								</p>

								<p><bibl>Houghton (1904, 1909a)</bibl> and <bibl>Parrott and Fulton (1914)</bibl>
									have shown that <hi rend="">O. nigricornis</hi> and not <hi rend="i">O.
										niveus</hi> is the tree cricket that does so much damage by ovipositing in rows
									in raspberry canes and that <hi rend="i">niveus</hi> deposits the eggs singly in
									apple, plum, elm and other trees, though sometimes singly in the raspberry canes.
									The method of ovipositing by <hi rend="i">niveus</hi> is thus described by Parrott
									&amp; Fulton: <q rend="blockquote">
										<p>"The female selects a suitable spot on a tree or bush and prepares to
											oviposit by first chewing a small hole in the bark, choosing the upper side of
											a branch in preference to the lower side, and working with the head uppermost
											when on a sloping or vertical surface. Upon the completion of the cavity she
											then walks forward a little, arches her back so as to bring the ovipositor
											about perpendicular to the branch and begins moving it up and down until she
											strikes the hole. She then starts to drill by giving the ovipositor quick
											thrusts and at the same time slowly turning it around by twisting the abdomen
											30 or 40 degrees to each side. As the ovipositor is forced in it takes a more
											or less oblique course, according to the thickness of the bark, so that the
											egg usually comes to lie nearly parallel to the surface. It generally takes
											from six to seven minutes to force the ovipositor to its base the first time,
											but in some cases it takes much longer, depending on the resistance of the
											bark. After the operation this organ is pulled nearly out and drilled in again
											several times, each effort taking about one and a half or two minutes. When
											the hole is sufficiently reamed out and the ovipositor drilled in for the last
											time the female forces out a drop of excrement and, by stretching out the tip
											of the abdomen, fastens it to the bark just below the hole. The egg is then
											forced down and the ovipositor is slowly withdrawn. The female pauses with
											only the tip remaining in the hole and deposits some mucilaginous substance.
											She then removes the ovipositor, moves a slight distance backward, seizes the
											drop of excrement in her mouth and places it over the opening; then spends
											several minutes packing it in and smoothing it out so that the wound is neatly
											capped. The whole process of depositing an egg, from starting to drill until
											the hole for the reception of the egg is sealed, may consume from twenty
											minutes to three-quarters of an hour.</p>
										<p>"In trees having a rather soft, fleshy bark, such as apple and plum, <hi
												rend="i">niveus</hi> prefers to oviposit in fairly large branches from one
											to three inches in diameter. The eggs may be placed in almost any area in the
											bark, but a favorite location is in a lenticel where the initial drilling is
											more easily accomplished. In bushes and trees in which the large branches have
											a tough bark the eggs are commonly laid in the smaller branches in thick
											places in the bark on each side of the base of a small twig or bud. In
											raspberry canes, where the eggs are sometimes fairly common, oviposition
											usually occurs in the fleshy area at the side of the bud in the axils of the
												<note id="note_088"><ref target="ref_088" rend="super">85</ref>Other
												interesting accounts of the song of <hi rend="i">O. niveus</hi> are given by
													<bibl>McNeill (I891)</bibl>, <bibl>Scudder (1893)</bibl>, <bibl>Shull
													(1907)</bibl> and <bibl>Allard (1911</bibl>.)</note>
											<pb id="VAB8231-718" n="717"/> leaves, and we have never found more than one
											egg on each side of a bud. However, the egg never extends through the woody
											layer into the pith, as is the case with <hi rend="i"
										>nigricornis</hi>."</p></q></p>

								<p>Whatever injury <hi rend="i">O. niveus</hi> may do in ovipositing is, in part at
									least, offset by its carnivorous propensities, as the young which hatch in May or
									early June, feed, until they reach maturity, largely upon the various species of
									aphids or plant lice which infest the shrubbery they frequent. <bibl>Walsh (1867,
										54)</bibl> was the first entomologist to call attention to this carnivorous
									habit, but it seems little attention was given to the matter until <bibl>Murtfeldt
										(1889)</bibl> gave an interesting account of some experiments and observations
									concerning this habit from which the following extract is taken: <q
										rend="blockquote">
										<p>"Some leaves of plum infested with a delicate species of yellow aphis were
											put into a jar with the .young of <hi rend="i">Oecanthus niveus</hi>, but
											attracted no immediate attention. As twilight deepened, however, the crickets
											awakened to greater activity. By holding the jar against the light of the
											window, or bringing it suddenly into the lamplight, the little nocturnal
											hunters might be seen hurrying with a furtive, darting movement, over the
											leaves and stems, the head bent down, the antennæ stretched forward, and every
											sense apparently on the alert. Then the aphids provided for their food would
											be caught up one after another with eagerness and devoured with violent action
											of the mouth parts, the antennæ meanwhile playing up and down in evident
											expression of satisfaction. Unless I had provided very liberally not an aphis
											would be found in the jar the next morning and the sluggish crickets would
											have every appearance of plethora."</p>

								<p>The narrow-winged tree cricket does not appear to be a common insect in Indiana,

									"among the golden rods and other low plants by the side of the road; also on small

								<p>The known range of <hi rend="i">O. angustipennis</hi> extends from New England
									west to Minnesota and Nebraska and south and southwest to Georgia, Dunedin, Fla.,

									known, says Morse, only from near Boston and at various points in Connecticut,
									where it "frequents orchards, fruit trees and even low thickets of sweet fern."
										<bibl>Beutenmüller (1894, 270)</bibl> says that about New York City it is "not
									as common as <hi rend="i">niveus</hi> and inhabits the higher parts of different
									kinds of forest and fruit trees. The note is fainter than that of <hi rend="i"
										>niveus</hi> and may be represented by <hi rend="i">reeeeeee</hi>, lasting about
									five seconds, and terminating abruptly, with an equal interval of rest. It usually
									sings at night only, but sometimes also late in the afternoon in shady places, and
									on cloudy days." Fox (Ms.) reports it from Clarksville, Tenn. and Hubbell from
									Washtenaw Co., Mich. In Nebraska Bruner found it "pretty well distributed over the
									eastern part of the State."</p>
								<p><bibl>Fulton (1915, 27, 29)</bibl> says of <hi rend="i">angustipennis</hi>: <q
										rend="blockquote">
										<p>"It is often found in company with <hi rend="i">niveus</hi> and is generally
											abundant in apple orchards. It is more strictly arboreal than the latter
											species, and seems to be confined to woody plants, either trees or large
											bushes. About Geneva, N. Y., it has never been taken on raspberry, grape or
											weeds of any kind. Among forest trees it is more common than <hi rend="i"
												>niveus</hi>. Many specimens have been collected from scrub and post oaks on
											Long Island, and from alder in a swamp near Geneva. The song of this species
											is not so loud as that made by <hi rend="i">niveus</hi> and is of a more
											mournful quality. It is, like that, intermittent, but can be readily
											distinguished by its longer notes and rests and its nonrythmical character.
											Each trill continues from one to five seconds. The periods of rest vary more
											and may be from one to eight seconds or longer. On trees where <hi rend="i"
												>angustipennis</hi> occurs in equal abundance with <hi rend="i">niveus</hi>,
											its song is nearly drowned out by the synchronous beat of the latter species
											and only by listening intently can it be detected. So far as observed it sings
											throughout the night and remains silent during the day."</p>

								<p><bibl>Allard (1910b)</bibl> wrote of the song of <hi rend="i">angustipennis</hi>
									in north Georgia as follows: <q rend="blockquote">
										<p>"It sings on cloudy afternoons, though its song is best heard after sunset.
											As the shadows become deeper in the oak trees and the breezes have ceased, a

											repeated by others in different keys at brief intervals. The notes of this
											cricket, to me, inspire a weird pathos, unlike any <pb id="VAB8231-720"
												n="719"/> other insect music. The phrase <hi rend="i">pr-e-e-e</hi> does not
											sustain the same uniform pitch, but dies away in a slightly lower key, a
											change which is hardly noticeable to the untrained ear. Each note is a
											mysterious, momentary wail amidst the shadowy foliage of the oaks, and seems
											like the voice of a complaining spirit interrupting the serenity of the

									the female "would fasten a drop of excrement to the bark before depositing the egg

										(1904, 254)</bibl> records it as "by far the commonest tree cricket in Ontario,
									and during August and September it abounds on shrubs and tall herbs, especially
									golden-rod, and is particularly plentiful on low grounds. Partially cleared bush
									lands supporting a rank growth of raspberry bushes, golden rod, boneset and other

									escapes without being more or less damaged. The eggs are laid in autumn, and at

									the cane or branch frequently dies above the puncture, or is so much injured as to
									be broken off by the first high wind. If the injured and broken canes containing
									the eggs be collected and burned in early spring the number of insects for that

								<p><bibl>Bruner (1895, 112)</bibl> has written of the habits of oviposition of <hi

										<p>"In addition cultivated fruits the snowy tree cricket also deposits its eggs
											in the stems of a large variety of other plants and trees--the main <pb
												id="VAB8231-723" n="722"/> requirements being a soft fibre and pithy
											interior to the twigs selected. Among the trees the white willow suffers most.
											I have seen hedges of this tree so completely utilized that scarcely a twig
											escaped being deposited into. Other species of willow, cottonwood, elm, maple,
											box elder, cherry, dog-wood, black locust, sycamore, ash, honey-locust, and in
											fact almost all kinds of trees, are sometimes attacked. Elder is a great
											favorite, too. After these come weeds, as the artichoke, sunflower,
											golden-rod, ambrosia, and many others. All of these latter being annuals, or
											dying to the ground each year, whether attacked by the cricket or not, the
											conclusion is plain. All the cricket requires is a receptacle for her eggs. It
											matters but little whether a dead or a living plant furnishes that
											oondition.</p>
										<p>"While woody plants are known to be very commonly used as receptacles for the
											eggs of this cricket, it is by far the most numerous upon such weeds as those
											mentioned above during its entire career; but more particularly so during its
											latter days when looking after the perpetuation of its kind."</p>

								<p>In central and southern Indiana this tree cricket is almost as common as <hi
										rend="i">nigricornis</hi> but in the northern part of the State it appears to
									occur in fewer numbers. It frequents shrubbery and weeds in gardens, along
									roadsides and borders of cultivated fields, and is often found in company with <hi
										rend="i">nigricornis</hi>. An adult female was taken in Crawford County on June
									28, an early date for a tree cricket in Indiana.</p>
								<p>In Florida I have found <hi rend="i">quadripunctatus</hi> the most common of <pb
										id="VAB8231-724" n="723"/> the tree crickets in late fall and winter, specimens
									having been taken at Sanford, Cape Sable, Sarasota and Dunedin. About Dunedin it
									occurs on the tall grasses and weeds growing about low places in the pine woods
									and is also often swept from huckleberry bushes and other low shrubs; adults
									having been taken during every month from October to April. It has before been
									recorded from numerous localities in the State as far south as Ft. Myers.</p>
								<p>By some authors, notably Fulton and R. &amp; H., <hi rend="i"
										>quadripunctatus</hi> is regarded as a distinct species, but numerous specimens
									at hand show that intermediates occur. It is often found in numbers on the same
									clumps of weeds or bushes in company with <hi rend="i">nigricornis</hi>.
										<bibl>Walker (1904, 255)</bibl> says: "I believe this form to be merely a pale
									variety of <hi rend="i">O. fasciatus</hi> as I have a series of intergrades and am
									unable to draw a definite line to separate the two." Caudell is quoted by
										<bibl>Houghton (1909a, 114)</bibl> as stating that specimens bred from the same
									egg clusters sent in by Houghton represented both <hi rend="i">nigricornis</hi>
									and <hi rend="i">quadripunctatus</hi> and that he considered the latter only a
									variety of the former. Houghton quotes other evidence to show that Caudell's
									opinion is correct.</p>
								<p>On the other hand <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1916)</bibl> regard them as distinct,
									stating that in addition to color differences <hi rend="i">nigricornis</hi> has a
									heavier and wider pronotum and a depression between the eyes not "at all or rarely
									weakly indicated in <hi rend="i">quadripunctatus</hi>." <bibl>Fulton (1915)</bibl>
									separates them in his key only by color characters, but states that they have
									"constant differences in habits," <hi rend="i">quadripunctatus</hi> occurring in
									larger numbers in upland fields abounding in medium sized weeds such as aster,
									sweet clover, daisy, golden-rod, ragweed, and especially the wild carrot or Queen
									Ann's lace. Quite often in a field of this character where <hi rend="i"
										>quadripunctatus</hi> is prevalent, the brushy fence rows surrounding the area
									will be inhabited by <hi rend="i">nigricornis</hi>. In general <hi rend="i"
										>nigricornis</hi> prefers larger plants and more dense growth than <hi rend="i"
										>quadripunctatus</hi>, and its habitat is more varied, it being usually found in
									tall, rank growths of weeds, such as in swamps and river bottoms, in brush or
									second growth, in fence rows grown up with bushes, briers and vines, in raspberry
									plantings, vineyards, nurseries and even occasionally in orchards."</p>
								<p>As noted above specimens are at hand showing not only all intergradations in
									color from almost black <hi rend="i">nigricornis</hi> to the palest of <hi
										rend="i">quadripunctatus</hi>, but also in the form of the thorax .and
									depression on head mentioned by R. &amp; H. Moreover, Fulton states <pb
										id="VAB8231-725" n="724"/> that the "song of <hi rend="i">nigricornis</hi> so
									closely resembles that of <hi rend="i">quadripunctatus</hi> that it is very
									dififcult to distinguish the two," and <bibl>Allard (1911)</bibl> says that he
									"has been unable to find any constant differences which serve to distinguish the
									trills of these two species." I therefore regard <hi rend="i">quadripunctatus</hi>
									as only a color variety of <hi rend="i">nigricornis</hi>, gradually replacing the
									latter southward and wholly so in Florida. In Indiana, as perhaps elsewhere as far
									as can be judged from the records, the typical form <hi rend="i">nigricornis</hi>
									is more abundant in the cooler and moister regions and the variety in warmer and
									drier localities.</p>
								<p>The range of <hi rend="i">O. n. quadripunctatus</hi> as given by Fulton is almost
									exactly that of <hi rend="i">nigricornis</hi>, Florida, Colorado and Utah being
									added to the list of states mentioned and California not given. <bibl>R. &amp; H.
										(1916)</bibl> record it from many localities from Virginia southwestward to Ft.
									Myers, Fla., and state that it is "the most abundant species of <hi rend="i"
										>Oecanthus</hi> in the eastern United States." Morse says that it is widely
									distributed and locally abundant in southern New England and extends as far north
									as Brunswick, Maine. Lugger recognized two forms of <hi rend="i">nigricornis</hi>
									as occurring in Minnesota but evidently was not aware of Beutenmiiller's name for
									the pale one. I once found it abundant on the north shore of the Niagara River
									opposite Buffalo, N. Y., where it was the only <hi rend="i">Oecanthus</hi> seen in
									early September. Specimens are also at hand from Sherborn, Mass., North Madison,
									Conn., Mobile, Ala. and Agricultural College, Miss.</p>

								<p>This, our largest species of <hi rend="i">Oecanthus</hi>, occurs throughout
									southern Indiana but has not as yet been taken in the northern half of the State.
									It is found mostly on shrubs and vines along fence rows, roadsides, and especially
									in thickets along the borders of streams and with us appears to be most abundant
									in October, though adults have been taken the last of August.</p>
								<p>The known range of <hi rend="i">O. latipennis</hi> is southern extending from
									Long Island and New Jersey west to Missouri and Nebraska and south and southwest
									to Georgia and Alabama. Fulton mentions it from Michigan and Lugger, without
									definite locality, in his Minnesota work. Riley records a male from Columbia,
									Texas, but afterward states that it had black marks on antennæ, which would
									preclude its being <hi rend="i">latipennis</hi>.</p>
								<p>The eggs of the broad-winged tree cricket are usually laid in the pith of the
									smaller twigs of shrubs and vines, preferably in the slender twigs of the wild and
									cultivated grapes. <bibl>Riley (loc. cit.)</bibl> has described the method of
									oviposition as follows: <q rend="blockquote">
										<p>"The jaws are first used to slightly tear the outer bark. With the antennæ
											stretched straight forward and the abdomen bent up so as to bring the
											ovipositor at right angles with the cane, the female then commences drilling,
											working the abdomen convulsively up and down about twice each second. The eggs
											are laid lengthwise in the pith, but always in <pb id="VAB8231-727" n="726"/>
											two sets, one on each side of the hole. The number varies according to the
											size of the cane, and the distance between the holes is also variable. The
											hole is usually filled up with a white mucous secretion, though there is very
											little of it about the eggs. This secretion also doubtless serves to
											facilitate the drilling. The same female will lay over 200 eggs, and will
											sometimes puncture the same cane at intervals of one-third of an inch for one
											and a half feet or more."</p>
									</q>
								</p>

								<p>The day note of the male of <hi rend="i">latipennis</hi> is louder than that of
									any other species. I have heard it when 60 feet distant; have traced it up, and
									found the musician beneath a leaf or on a post in the angle of a rail fence,
									industriously sounding his cymbals. The note is kept up for 20 to 30 seconds, and
									is then succeeded by a pause of about five seconds, when it is begun once more.
									Riley has written of it, probably of the night song: "The shrill of <hi rend="i"
										>latipennis</hi> is continuous and recalls the trilling of a high-pitched
									dog-whistle in the distance. The key varies, however, and is sometimes much less
									high and more musical than at others. The commingled shrill of this species
									recalls also the distant croaking of frogs in spring. The broad wings are
									thoroughly elevated during the act, or even bent forward, and the vibration is so
									rapid that there appears to be no motion."</p>
								<p><bibl>Fulton (1915)</bibl> states that the song of <hi rend="i">latipennis</hi>
									is a loud clear whistle with a musical ringing quality. The eggs are usually laid
									in grapevines, though sometimes in large stalks of golden-rod growing near the
									vines. A single hole in the outer woody layer of the stem serves for the
									deposition of from four to twelve eggs which are placed side by side in the pith
									in two groups, one above and one below the opening. "The size of the pith
									determines the number of eggs. The grapevine has a small pith and will hold only
									two or three eggs on a side, while in the golden-rod as many as six can be found
									in a single cluster."</p>

								<p>This long-winged tree cricket appears to be very scarce, not only in Indiana, but
									usually wherever found. Here it has been taken only in Vigo and Marion counties,
									Aug. 3--27. Its known range is southern and a very wide one, extending in the
									United States from Connecticut west to Illinois and Kansas and south and southwest
									to North Carolina, Georgia and Mississippi. It is also recorded by Saussure and
									others from Mexico and Central America. DeGeer's type was from Pennsylvania.
										<bibl>Morse (1919a)</bibl> records it from New Canaan, Portland and New Haven,
									Conn., Aug. 14--Sept. 11; <bibl>Smith (1910)</bibl> from various points in New
									Jersey and <bibl>Fulton (1915)</bibl> from Ohio and Kansas. Near Cedar Point,
									Ohio, it was found by King on oak, willow and wild grape vines along the forest
									border or standing isolated at the edge of open sandy areas. <bibl>R. &amp; H.
										(1916, 300)</bibl> mention it as "extremely retiring, living only in the densest
									tangles of heavy forest undergrowth, where solitary examples can be found only
									after long continued and vigorous beating."</p>
								<p><bibl>Allard (1910b)</bibl> describing its habits in north Georgia says: <q

											continued only a few seconds, are separated by short intervals. Its notes are
											deeper, stronger, and richer than those of <hi rend="i">Oecanthus
												angustipennis</hi>. In tone quality they more nearly approach the song of
												<hi rend="i">Oecanthus latipennis</hi>. This cricket is not uncommon at

								<p>This handsome little cricket occurs in numbers in suitable localities throughout
									Indiana. In the northern counties it is found among the sphagnum mosses growing in
									dense tamarack swamps, and also on the shrubs about the margins of lakes and
									marshes. Farther south it is often very abundant on the leaves and stems of the
									arrow alum, cat-tail flags, button-bush and other semi-aquatic plants. It is very
									active and difficult to capture, and, on account of its small size, is doubtless
									overlooked in many localities where it occurs in numbers. In central Indiana it
									reaches maturity about August 1st, and exists until after heavy frosts. Unlike the
									Nemobids, which it most closely resembles, it is never found on the ground, but
									clings to the stems of bushes and grasses, a few feet above the surface. No
									long-winged individuals have been taken in Indiana but <bibl>R. &amp; H.
										(1916)</bibl> have recorded several from other states and note that they have
									open "auditory foramina" on both faces of fore tibiæ, while the brachypterous
									specimens have them only on the outer face of the tibiæ.</p>
								<p>This is our largest and most widely distributed <hi rend="i">Anaxipha</hi>, its
									known range extending from southern New England west to Minnesota and Nebraska and
									south and southwest to Jacksonville, Fla. and Brownsville, Texas. Say's types were
									from Missouri and the species has been many times recorded as <hi rend="i">A.
										pulicaria</hi> Burm.</p>
								<p>In New England <hi rend="i">exigua</hi> is recorded only from Westbrook, Conn.,
									where it occurs in tangled vegetation on or near salt marshes. <bibl>Davis
										(1889)</bibl> says that on Staten Island "it is not uncommon along the ditches
									in the salt meadows where the high tide bushes, <hi rend="i">Iva frutescens</hi>

									which are uttered rapidly and persistently by day and by night. It is, however,
									more strictly a night singer and its great chorus begins late in the afternoon
									and continues far into the night. Once begun it is impossible to single out a

								<p>This handsome vari-colored little cricket occurs in small numbers in the southern
									half of Indiana, but has not been taken north of Marion County. It reaches
									maturity about mid-August and occurs on low shrubs and vines about the margins of
									ponds and marshes, being especially partial to the foliage of the buttonbush, <hi
										rend="i">Cephalanthus occidentalis</hi> L. When approached cautiously <pb
										id="VAB8231-738" n="737"/> it may often be seen vibrating its large maxillary
									palpi in a rapid and curious manner. Uhler's types were from Maryland where he
									said it "was found quite abundantly amongst the grass and low bushes near ditches
									and jumps about with great rapidity."</p>
								<p>The known range of <hi rend="i">P. pulchellus</hi> extends from Staten Island, N.
									Y., west to central Indiana, Kentucky and Illinois and south and southwest to
									central Florida and northern Georgia. In Florida it appears to be very scarce,
									having been taken, as far as known, only at Jacksonville, Monticello, Gainesville
									and Sanford. Of its habits on Staten Island <bibl>Davis (1896)</bibl> says: "It
									commonly occurs on bushes and young trees and is often discovered on the sweet
									gum. If there is a dead curled leaf on the branch a male cricket will crawl within
									the chamber thus formed and sing. This is particularly the case on chilly days in
									the fall."</p>
								<p><bibl>Allard (1910b)</bibl> writing of <hi rend="i">pulchellus</hi>, as noted at

										<p>"This pretty cricket dwells on shrubbery usually within two or three feet of

												>Oecanthus quadripunctatus</hi>, although not as smooth and as uniform in
											tone. Heard close at hand, the trill is wavering, irregular, with an attendant
											unmusical shuffling or scraping of the wings, as if these were rather slowly

								<p>In Indiana this modest brown bush cricket has been taken only in the southwestern
									counties from Terre Haute to the Ohio River, the adults occurring from August to
									November. In Vigo Co. the first ones discovered were on the slender twigs of some
									prickly-ash shrubs which grew in a damp upland woods. The place was visited a
									number of times and the crickets were always found, perfectly motionless, and
									immediately above or below one of the thorns or prickles jutting forth from the
									twigs. The tips of the hind femora were raised so as to project above the body,
									thus causing them to resemble the thorns; and the color of the insect,
									corresponding closely to that of the bark, made them very difficult to discover
									even when in especial search of them. On every clump of prickly-ash in the woods
									mentioned a number of specimens were secured, but they could be found nowhere else
									thereabouts. A second locality was about the roots of a scarlet oak, Quercus
									coccinea Wang, which grew on a sandy hillside. Here they were plentiful, and
									resting motionless in the depressions of the bark or beneath the leaves in the
									cavities formed by the roots of the tree. A pair were also noted in another place
									on the flowers of golden-rod.</p>
								<p>Of all the males taken in Indiana but one or two had the tegmina entire, and
									usually both tegmina as well as the rudimentary wings were wholly absent, while
									every female had both pairs unharmed. I at first ascribed this wing mutilation to
									the males fighting among themselves, but finally discovered a female in the act of
									devouring the wings of a male. Why this curious habit on the part of one sex?
									Possibly the females require a wing diet to requite them for their bestowed
									affections, or, perchance, they are a jealous set, and, having once gained the
									affections of a male, <pb id="VAB8231-741" n="740"/> devour his tegmina to keep
									him from calling other females about him. It is more than probable, however, that
									the mating of the sexes takes place in a similar manner to that of the white tree
									crickets (<hi rend="i">Oecanthus</hi>), the females gnawing away the tegmina of
									the males in order to more readily reach the alluring glands which lie beneath.
									The openings of these glands, located on the dorsum of the metathorax, are visible
									in dried specimens at hand.</p>
								<p>In Florida I have found <hi rend="i">H. agitator</hi> more common than in
									Indiana, a few specimens having been secured at most of the collecting stations.
									About Dunedin it is taken in winter more commonly in dense hammocks where it
									hibernates in bunches of dead leaves which have lodged in the thick tangles of
									vines and shrubs. The males at that season probably represent a late fall brood
									which have not yet mated as the tegmina are mostly intact, while those taken in
									spring have them partially eaten away. It has been recorded by other collectors
									from numerous localities throughout the State, mostly under the name <hi rend="i"
										>H. quadratus</hi>
									<bibl>Scudder (1868b, 140)</bibl>, a form relegated to synonymy by both Scudder
									and Saussure, but restored as a valid species by <bibl>R. &amp; H. (1905,
										52)</bibl>, and again reduced by them to a southern race (1916, 309.) No
									differential characters which can be used in a key can be found in comparing
									southern Indiana and Florida specimens, some of the former being fully as large
									with tegmina and hind femora as long as those from Dunedin. As <bibl>R. &amp; H.
										(loc. cit.)</bibl> admit that the two so-called races merge in North Carolina
									and at the most "show little definite differentiation," I do not consider the name
										<hi rend="i">quadratus</hi> worthy of retention. The known range of <hi rend="i"
										>agitator</hi>, as here recognized, extends from Long and Staten Islands, N. Y.,
									west to southern Indiana and eastern Nebraska and south and southwest to southern
									Florida, Cuba and Brownsville, Texas. <bibl>Uhler (1864)</bibl> says that about
									Baltimore it inhabits grape vines and dense shrubbery and is found fully developed
									about the middle of September. The <hi rend="i">Orocharis uhleri</hi>

								<p>This slender bodied bush cricket occurs in small numbers throughout the southern
									half of Indiana, frequenting the undergrowth of dense woods, the thickets along
									the borders of streams and the shrubbery of orchards and yards. A half dozen
									specimens were once found on Aug. 22 concealed in the folds of an old coat hanging
									in a grape arbor near the center of the city of Indianapolis. When disturbed it
									often seeks safety in flight and when it alights flattens out its body close
									against its resting place.</p>
								<p>In Florida it is much more common than in Indiana, scores of specimens in both
									nymph and adult stages having been taken about Dunedin during the winter and
									spring months. There it is often beaten from the lower limbs of oak and other
									trees and also from bunches of leaves, and especially the large epiphyte, <hi
										rend="i">Tillandsia utriculata</hi> L., in which it is hibernating. Elsewhere in
									the State I have taken it at Ormond, Sanford, Utopia, Lakeland, Cape Sable and Ft.
									Myers. By other collectors it is mentioned only from Jacksonville, Silver Springs,
									Pablo Beach and Miami.</p>
								<p>The known range of <hi rend="i">O. saltator</hi> extends from New Jersey west <pb
										id="VAB8231-744" n="743"/> to Nebraska and south and southwest to southern
									Florida, Mississippi and Texas. About Baltimore, the type locality, Uhler found it
									very common on Crattgus during September and October. Bruner mentions it (1893a)
									as occurring only occasionally in southeastern Nebraska. Southern specimens have
									been often erroneously recorded as <hi rend="i">O. gryllodes</hi>. Of the
									egg-laying and song habits of this cricket <bibl>Riley (1881, 62)</bibl> wrote as
									follows: <q rend="blockquote">
										<p>"In December, 1877, I watched a female of <hi rend="i">O. saltator</hi>
											ovipositing in the end of a dead and rather soft twig of the soft maple at
											Kirkwood. Missouri. The twig had been pruned and the bark was somewhat gnawed
											by the cricket and the eggs thrust in irregularly from the end and from the
											sides. Both wood and pith were crammed with eggs, but all longitudinally
											inally inserted. The favorite nidus of the species is, however, the soft and
											somewhat corky, rough bark of the trunk and older branches of the American
											elm, the eggs being thrust in singly or in small batches, either
											longitudinally with, or very slightly obliquely from, the axis of trunk or
											branch. The female is very intent in the act, working her abdomen deliberately
											from side to side during the perforation.</p>
										<p>"The stridulation of this cricket is a rather soft and musical piping of not
											quite half a second's duration, with from four to six trills, but so rapid
											that they are lost in the distance. The key is very high, but varies in
											different individuals and according to moisture and temperature. It most
											resembles the vibrating touch of the finger on the rim of an ordinary tumbler
											when three-fourths filled with water-repeated at intervals of from two to four
											per second, and it may be very well likened to the piping of a young chick and
											of some tree frogs. As the species is very common in the southwest its chirp
											is everywhere heard and is so distinctive that when once studied it is never
											lost amid the louder racket of the katydids and other night choristers. It is
											frequently heard during the day time in cloudy or damp weather, and I have
											heard it at St. Louis the first days of November after a slight frost.</p>
										<p>"The courting of the sexes is amusing. They face each other and play with
											their antennæ for the best part of an hour or more than an hour. The female
											is, otherwise, pretty quiet, but the male continually mouths the twig or the
											bark upon which the courting is being done, and plays his palpi at a great
											rate, very stealthily approaching nearer to his mate meanwhile. At last the
											antennal fencing ceases and those of the female bend back and then the male
											approaches until their heads touch. He then deliberately turns round, elevates
											the elytra and slips his abdomen under the female, who virtually mounts and
											assists him, his elytra overshadowing her head."</p>
