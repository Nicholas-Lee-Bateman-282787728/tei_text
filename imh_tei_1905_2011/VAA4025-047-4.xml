            <p>Indiana in 1840 was a mixture of similar and dissimilar elements. No general description of
                    population, sources of immigration, soil, climate, agriculture, or attitudes can be applied to the
                    entire state; yet in spite of the fact that Indiana presented a picture of dissimilarities, there
                    were many fundamental conformities which tied the state into a cohesive unit.</p>
            <p>Indiana can best be described by treating separately each of its three natural sections: the
                    southern, the central, and the northern portions.</p>
            <p>In 1840, more than four-fifths of the people of Indiana lived in the southern half of the state. A
                    belt of counties in the southeastern section had an average of forty-five persons per square
                    mile—a family for about every one hundred acres. Most of the remainder of the southern
                    half of the state had an average of eighteen to forty-five inhabitants per square mile. The relative
                    compactness of population can be shown by the fact that one-half of the settlers lived within
                    seventy-five miles of the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Geographically, southern Indiana is bounded on the south by the only natural state boundary of any
                    consequence— the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>. Rather than setting off Indiana as a
                    discrete unit, this great stream merely dissects a large soil region; there is no important
                    difference in the physiography of the region on either side of the river, for southern Indiana is an
                    extension of the soil regions of the Appalachian Uplands.</p>
            <p>In southeastern Indiana, the topography is much like that of the Outer Bluegrass Region of <placeName>

                    unglaciated for the most part in Indiana.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Southwestern Indiana is made up a
                    rugged section extending away from the river, characterized by a great diversity of surface
                    features. It is an area which has never been able to support a large population.</p>
            <p>Collectively, these areas extend side by side like long fingers in a north-south direction away from
                    the river. Into these fingers had gone the bulk of Indiana's population by 1840.</p>
            <p>That the settlers wandered here first is not surprising. First, southern Indiana bordered the more
                    heavily populated areas of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. By 1818, emigrants' handbooks advised their readers that "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> has passed the era of rapid increase from emigration. The best lands are sold and have
                    become expensive." Indiana, on the other hand, was described to the prospective settler
                    with glowing praise. "It may be doubted whether any state of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, all things duly considered, can present more advantages than Indiana. Intersected or
                    bounded in all directions by navigable rivers or lakes, enjoying a temperate climate and an immense
                    variety of soil. Near two-thirds of its territorial surface is yet in the hands of the Indians, a
                    temporary evil, that a short time will remedy."<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>Second, the natural routes of migration led to southern Indiana. They were varied in character and
                    often were not normal in the sense of direction. By 1818, the National Road was available as far as

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> could be used. Other settlers came down the Kanawha River to reach the westward flowing <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Of great importance to Indiana was the old Wilderness Road across <placeName>

                    the interior of the state.</p>
            <p>Third, Indiana was a familiar region to the people from across the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>.

                    not as a dividing line but more as an obstacle to be crossed in the search for new opportunities.
                    The physical difficulty of crossing the wide stream was its most stubborn feature. In all else, it
                    was more of a unifying force for the section and at the same time a doorway to the outside world.</p>
            <p>By 1850 the rate of immigration in the lower counties of Indiana was declining. The more favorable
                    lands had been taken up in an area having a limited number of acres that could be cultivated
                    successfully. This slowing down of immigration was due, however, not so much to the lack of
                    available land as to the changes which had taken place in the section of the country which had been
                    the source of settlement. Chief among these were the social and economic changes that had occurred
                    in the Upland South itself. The extension of the plantation system to the Piedmont, pushing the
                    yeomen farmers further west and north, had been decelerated. Furthermore, the path of migration for
                    many had shifted to the new Southwest, to the growing and flush cotton kingdom. Soil exhaustion had
                    in part completed its task of sending men out to seek newer and more fertile lands to exploit.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> The extension of slavery into the upland areas of the South resulted in
                    migration movements away from the institution; this was illustrated particularly by the Quakers who
                    moved north across the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and on to the West.</p>
            <p>A quantitative analysis of the population of Indiana is difficult to accomplish. Sources of
                    information are incomplete and, more important, are of a misleading character. The census reports
                    show merely the birthplace of the residents of any state, disregarding the interim residences
                    between the time of their birth and the year of the census. Nor is the age of the migrant considered
                    in the published reports. For many people, this means that the states which had had the greatest
                    influence in molding the character of the migrants are not indicated—only the place of
                    birth is revealed.</p>
            <p>In order to by-pass some of the dangers of the use of census statistics, a study was made by Joseph

                    Land Office Reports and local history sources. The place of last residency, not nativity, was given
                    preference, for it was assumed that the influence of the area from which the settler had migrated
                    had had a greater influence on his social and political attitudes than the factor of nativity,
                    unless the two coincided.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

            <p>Layton's method was essentially a sampling technique. The total number of persons coming to
                    the various counties from outside sources found in the study was 82,135. According to the <placeName>

                    boundaries of the state.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> The fact that this study located settlers according to
                    counties was of great value in the determination of trends of settlement. Layton's chief
                    point of variance with the census statistics was that he credited a higher percentage of Indiana
                    residents as having come from <placeName>

            <p>Life north of the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> had a sameness about it as compared to what it had
                    been back on the old farm. For many settlers, the economy was one of subsistence. The river bottoms
                    and stream terraces produced a variety of products, only a few of which could be harvested in
                    quantities sufficient to provide an easily transportable surplus for marketing or trading. Whisky,
                    corn, and hogs were among these few. Agriculture was not often booming and fruitful, nor was it
                    always progressive, although many unsuccessful efforts were made to find an agricultural bonanza in
                    a new crop. By 1845, the <placeName>

                    our farmers are acquainted with only one rotation of crops, poor corn, poorer corn, poorest corn;
                    then mean oats, then an excuse for wheat, and then poor corn again. But hard times all the

            <p>For the most part, agricultural production in the generally rugged area of southern Indiana,
                    especially in the limestone belt, was limited. It did not require years of development to accomplish
                    a maximum expansion. The unglaciated, fertile soil belts hemmed in by rough terrain determined the
                    extent of the clearings. When the hillsides were bared, farmers could label these patches
                    "ten-year soil"—they could be cultivated for that period, but with the approach
                    of the eleventh year, the soil would be depleted by erosion.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

            <p>In many respects, then, the mode of living, the economy, and society were not much unlike what they

                    which could furnish new threads for the social pattern. Apparently there were no great commercial
                    links back to the older points of departure; rather, the avenues of communication, narrow at their
                    best, were toward newer areas. Since emigration from the Upland South was not a continuing process,
                    there were few new agents from the old home culture.</p>
            <p>During this period, the nation was made up of sections within sections, and the South was no
                    exception. There were many Souths. The South with which trade and communication was established was
                    that of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the Gulf Plains, although the Upland Piedmont migrants to Indiana had never known
                    this area intimately. The <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> as an artery of communication had turned
                    the interests of the Lower Northwest toward new markets, not back to the Valley of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> or the Blue Grass Basin. The Wilderness Road and the Kanawha River, for example, served
                    people principally, not goods, and for a one-way journey.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> One reason for this
                    lack of communication with the older regions was that there was little opportunity to sell and
                    profit in trade with an area that was in a competitive position.</p>
            <p>The migrants to Indiana from the South arrived in the greatest numbers at a time when the region from
                    which they had departed also thought of itself as the West—inhabitants of these upland
                    areas considered themselves western men whether they resided in <placeName>
                  <country reg="ncu">North
                            Carolina</country>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, or
                    Indiana. Thus it seemed natural to them to transplant institutions and attitudes from one pioneer
                    settlement to another, with the result that in Indiana there was a repetition of the frontier social
                    and economic processes. Each jump meant a beginning again. Given a somewhat similar environment all
                    along the route of advancement, cultural patterns persisted. That this should occur was more or less
                    a necessity, for the new problems of gaining a foothold in a raw wilderness were in reality old
                    problems which had been met along the road before.</p>
            <p>Thus the political, social, and economic attitudes were those of an Upland South which had already
                    lost some of <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>

                            the mountains to the Piedmont. The volume of this trade was small and it continued for only

                    attitudes of these peoples who had come to Indiana were the attitudes, not of the contemporary
                    mother region, but of the mother region of the past. Isolated in many localities, traditions
                    remained uncontaminated, and the economic needs and desires of these settlers remained nearly
                    constant. Among these needs were: good market outlets, adequate currency, fertile land, equality in
                    taxation, and, in general, new material opportunities. The political demands that resulted had a
                    certain common basis that resembled much older claims expressed years before. In a sense, the
                    stresses and strains had moved westward.</p>
            <p>However, although these people had brought with them the traditions and attitudes and problems of the
                    South, it does not necessarily follow that they were <hi rend="i">pro</hi> southern, for they had
                    come, not from <hi rend="i">the</hi> South, but from an older West. The problems of the contemporary
                    South were not necessarily their problems, and so it was possible for them to be indifferent to many
                    of them. Nor did they feel obliged to agree with all elements in the life of a southerner. Thus
                    Indiana settlers could disagree with southern ways as readily as they could find fault with ways of
                    life that existed in the East or even right in their own vicinity. These immigrant farmers disdained
                    the planter who did not toil with his own hands, observing there was "a difference between
                        <hi rend="i">farming</hi> and <hi rend="i">planting.</hi> One supports a <hi rend="i">family</hi>; the other supports <hi rend="i">pride</hi>, until pride gets a fall."<hi rend="sup">13</hi> The financial successes of the eastern capitalists were criticized just as
                    vehemently. "Money makes money, and it is by speculation, and not by labor, that men become
                    rich. Society is wrong. Labor instead of money ought to be made the capital," wrote one
                    Hoosier editor.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> The Indiana farmer could not, by the same token, condone those
                    in his own community who had not acquired material wealth and social status through their own
                    physical exertions. The local press could rant against "the white fingered, and perhaps <hi rend="i">light</hi> fingered, fops and dandy lawyers of <placeName>

                    he looked down from a plateau of unconcern at the political and economic evils of the presence of

            <p>By 1850, the southern section of Indiana was at the peak of its influence. It was an ideal
                    representation of the culture of the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> world.</p>
            <p>The central counties of Indiana underwent the most significant changes during the two decades before
                    the Civil War. By 1850, about one-half of the population of the state lived in this rich interior
                    section.</p>
            <p>Most of this region is a part of a fertile plain that stretches west from the Scioto basin in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Composed of a complex glacial till containing limestones, dolomites, granite, and
                    sandstone, the soils of the area, although not uniformly as fertile as the great prairies to the
                    west, were capable of maintaining their native fertility over a long period of time. The nearly
                    level terrain and the uniformity of rainfall as compared with the ruggedness and the intense rains
                    of southern Indiana, were added benefits to agriculture.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> All of these elements
                    led to a type of agriculture that could be diversified profitably. Large farms were possible since
                    large areas of fertile land were available. It was a region capable of great expansion and of
                    supporting a stable agrarian economy.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

                    When Indiana was admitted to the Union in 1816, the Indians still claimed about two-thirds of the

            <p>The filling-in process in central Indiana was relatively unhampered by the speculator. This had also
                    been true, though to a lesser degree, of the settlement of southern Indiana where some large-scale
                    speculating had taken place; however, it is doubtful if it had seriously hampered settlement. In
                    central Indiana, most of the land passed directly from the government to actual settlers.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> Thus, in addition to its easy access, the land-seeking farmer found a more
                    democratic land system which offered to him an added inducement to settle in this rich area.</p>
            <p>Another lure to settlement was the prospect of an internal improvements program. Legislative
                    log-rolling resulted in a proposed system of canals, roads, and railroads that would benefit all
                    sections of the state. Indiana, however, was interested primarily in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and Erie Canal. The proposed route was far north of the bulk of the population; thus
                    there was available land to be taken up by settlers who sensed the possibility of profits in land
                    and in produce.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, as in the peopling of many other areas of the Old Northwest where growth was often sporadic,
                    there were spurts of unusual development with intervening lulls.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> In the period
                    from 1840 to 1845, the rapid progress of the settlement of central Indiana was brought to a near
                    halt in part by the collapse of the internal improvements bubble and in part by the economic
                    stagnation that followed the Panic of 1837.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> The funds for the construction of

            <p>However, in the remaining years of the decade, after these economic crises had been alleviated to a
                    large degree, there was another spurt of migration into central Indiana. Some of the stigma of the
                    near repudiation of the state debt was removed by a compromise agreement between the state and its

            <p>The growth of central Indiana during the latter years of the forties has an added significance when
                    the population is considered in the light of its source. It has often been pointed out that Indiana
                    received more of its population from south of the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> than did the
                    neighboring states of the Old Northwest, and in the light of the census statistics, it does appear
                    that Indiana was outstanding among the states of the Northwest in this respect. However, to approach
                    a more accurate view of the settlement of Indiana, it is necessary to consider the role of <placeName>

                    population by emigration was from the backbone counties where the farmers were from the same stock
                    as were the farmers who had moved on to the more fertile lands of central Indiana. They were,
                    generally speaking, from the same democratic corridor of western <placeName>

                    region. The different elements had adopted different customs, perhaps, and the isolation of their
                    respective worlds had made their interests local in nature; yet wherever the settlers came from,
                    there were certain common ideas and purposes—democracy and individualism among them. In
                    the long process of westward movement, certain signs of distinctiveness were taken on by each wave
                    of emigrants. In the forties in central Indiana, the rush of occupation had thrown many of these
                    individuals together within a short period of time, and a man readily identified his neighbor by the

                    never had an existence before anywhere else—the purely indigenous farming of the great

            </p>
            <p>In this productive soil, high returns were readily achieved. By 1850, more corn and wheat were raised
                    here than in any other section of the state. The stable soils supported a great variety of crops.
                    The counties that led the state in wheat production seem also to have been the leading areas in corn
                    production. It would be difficult to point out great belts of specialized agriculture, although
                    there were tendencies in this direction. Corn seemed to be outdistancing wheat in central Indiana,
                    and by 1850, northern Indiana was producing as much wheat as was the central section; however, the
                    general pattern of agriculture had not yet been changed much.</p>
            <p>The bountiful returns of the soil brought the farmer face-to-face with the problem of disposing of a
                    surplus which, unless trade outlets were found, would be wasted. To some editors, the problem of
                    waste was a moral one—the squandering of a hundred bushels of corn was unimportant, but
                    the habit of wasting was a great evil. It was predicted that the time was not far off when these
                    habits would make wastrels of the sons and daughters of the farmer. However, <hi rend="i">The

            <p>In broad perspective, the central counties of Indiana presented a picture of a potentially rich

            <p>Nearly all of the settlers of the northern third of Indiana arrived after 1830—at that
                    time, only a small area had as many as two people per square mile. Although the population more than
                    doubled in the northernmost eighteen counties in the period from 1840 to 1850, only about twelve per
                    cent of the citizens of Indiana lived in this part of the state. In 1840, one-half of the population

            <p>The departure of the glacier had left a large morainal area with immature and swampy lacustrine
                    plains in northern Indiana. The stream pattern is erratic and in some instances the continental
                    divide is difficult to determine. Much of the land is poorly drained and there are numerous lakes,

            <p>Several explanations have been offered to account for the slow development of northern Indiana. New
                    Englanders on their journeys west avoided the area primarily because their routes of travel skirted
                    the borders of the state. Whether they avoided settlement because of the presence of
                    "shiftless southerners" who were reaching up from the <geogName>Ohio
                    River</geogName> is debatable.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> It is more likely that they were discouraged by
                    the large amount of wet land in the area. Of almost equal importance was the fact that northern
                    Indiana and the Upper <geogName>Wabash Valley</geogName> were blocked from the Northeast by the
                    great Black Swamp of northwestern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Added to these deterring physical factors was the almost legendary notoriety of the
                    combined areas as the "chief terror of travelers Westward" with their
                    disease-ridden swamps. Settlers were also discouraged by the fact that speculators had gobbled up
                    huge tracts of land particularly in the prairie counties along the northwestern borders of the
                    state. As for wet lands which required co-operative drainage programs for reclamation, the
                    contention follows that if these speculative holdings had been more democratically owned, and had a
                    more equitable land system been operating, individual owners would have solved the problem of
                    reclamation by common effort.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>

            <p>In a contemporary view of the situation, <hi rend="i">The Indiana Farmer and Gardener</hi> summed up
                    the attitude of a land-seeking farmer: "We do not suppose that the time has come in Indiana
                    for the general introduction of a system of <hi rend="i">Draining</hi>, although there is not,
                    perhaps, another State where so much first rate land might be redeemed by it. Before many years
                    there will be thousands of acres pierced with drains. But the inducements to it which make it wise

                    two. Many farmers have already more arable land than they can till to advantage. Land redeemed from

                    Although the emphasis here was on wet land in general, it would also apply to northern Indiana in
                    particular.</p>
            <p>The large holdings of nonresidents in this area created a problem of taxation, and bred enmity
                    between the citizens of the state and the speculators. The <hi rend="i">Logan Chief</hi> urged the
                    recovery of these lands for the settler through a system of onerous taxation of unimproved lands. As
                    a result of the present situation, it declared, "The upper <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>

                    the people see to this matter themselves : it can be effected by taxing all lands

            </p>
            <p>Collectively all the above factors account for the small population of the 1840's; yet this
                    was a growing section. As was true concerning the other sections of the state, the sources of
                    population were varied, although more of the early settlers were natives of other parts of the
                    state. In the extreme northern tier of counties there was a sizeable number of New Yorkers. In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">La Porte</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
                    </placeName> counties, Pennsylvanians were found in significant proportions. In studying <placeName>
                        <region type="county">La Porte County</region>
                    </placeName>, Layton found that slightly over six per cent of the population had come from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An agriculture of abundance in this area of Indiana was limited generally to the northern tier of
                    counties. By 1850, these counties were large producers of wheat and hay, with the seven northernmost
                    counties out of the ninety-two in the state producing slightly less than fifteen per cent of all the
                    wheat grown in Indiana for the year.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus here was a section that, although it could not yet match the development of central and southern
                    Indiana, was making tremendous strides. This fact is even more illuminating when one considers the

            <p>The direction of trade in the northern counties of Indiana was almost exclusively directed to the
                    East. The mode of transportation out of the state was either by canal or by direct lake
                    transportation. The one lake port of any consequence in the state was <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Michigan City</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The canal was inaccessible to northwestern Indiana, but it provided a good outlet for
                    the most northern of the northeastern counties.<hi rend="sup">51</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <geogName>St. Joseph River</geogName> furnished another outlet to the lakes. In 1831 the first

                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>

                    </placeName> merchants with a great share of their merchandise. A local writer in 1847 reported that

                    However, there were certain limitations of this avenue to market. The winding course and shallow bed

                    warehouses, and commission merchants as well as twelve dry goods stores. In the same year,

                    "In view of the embarrassed and languishing conditions of the Farming community,
                    notwithstanding the unparallelled exertion, labor, and toil, we are led to inquire—is
                    there no system or plan that can be devised, that will secure to us, exclusively, the rewards of our

                    therefore, in view of these considerations, in order to sustain ourselves, enter into a compact for
                    the purpose, if possible, of saving the enormous expenditures that are daily made, and which are
                    saping the very foundations of all agricultural pursuits, exerting not only a prostrating influence

                    Further, the dangers of lake commerce raised shipping charges. The merchant and shipper blamed the
                    federal government for the dangers and the added expense of the lake commerce due to the failure to
                    improve lake navigation. But to some farmers, at least, the real culprit was the merchant who was
                    claiming the lion's share of the farmer's labor. Some of these basic antagonisms
                    were later carried into the political arena.</p>
            <p>Northern Indiana was the newest section of the state. Much of it was but a few short years away from
                    the raw frontier. Merchants who had managed Indian trading posts at the south bend of the
                        <geogName>St. Joseph River</geogName> had shifted their interests to the white trade of the town
                    of <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>Land speculators were still on the scene in the forties. Villages and towns sprang up nearly
                    overnight as the Indians were removed and the land put up for sale.</p>
            <p>Yet it must be remembered that close to all this activity were counties that in 1850 were the least
                    populated in the state. Northern Indiana was passing out of the stage of initial thrust. The filling
                    up process was about to take place.</p>
            <p>The boundary lines of Indiana had been superimposed upon a portion of the western wilderness by
                    politically minded men in order to create for their constituents a more governable portion of that
                    which they desired most—land. The diversities of the carved portion were imperceptible at
                    first, but as men toiled to convert the raw environment more to their own ends, these differences
                    emerged with greater clarity. As the road to maturity was traveled, new obstacles appeared as life
                    became more complex. In the give and take of existence, certain attitudes on the part of the
                    inhabitants were buffeted about and changed, others maintained. Sectionalism in the physical sense
                    revealed itself. Some men had more in common with their neighbors in other states than with their
                    fellow citizens, since physiographic and economic units extended beyond political boundaries. The
                    state of Indiana was in a sense an intermixture of shreds and patches torn from a greater cloth.</p>

            <p>It can be seen that the Great Lakes, the Appalachian Plateau, the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>,
                    and the central till plain as they were represented in Indiana were merely segments of the whole,
                    each of which influenced the mode of action in a comparable degree wherever men encountered these
                    physiographic features of the West. Closely tied to these physical influences were the economic
                    interests shaped by them and created out of them. Finally the cultures developed in and near these
                    same plains, rivers, lakes, and hills bred common attitudes which were implanted in men's
                    thoughts and habits. Yet, despite the conglomerate nature of Indiana, there remained a common cement
                    which served to fuse the dissimilar elements. One of the more important of these elements was the
                    predominance of agriculture carried on by the small independent farmer. The great commercial centers
                    of the Old Northwest were outside the boundaries of the state; thus Indiana was in the forties the
                    backdoor neighbor of the surrounding states, a hinterland from which the entrepots of trade siphoned
                    off the surplus commodities in exchange for consumer goods. It is true that trade channels flowed
                    off in several directions, yet the position of the Indiana farmer did not change greatly in the
                    general pattern of commerce. There was thus a certain back-country flavor to the state to which the
                    Hoosier folk-type, applied promiscuously in the past, became a stereotype of the Indiana
                        resident.<hi rend="sup">57</hi>

            <p>The trading position of Indiana among its neighbors resulted in a concomitant lack of urbanization
                    and commercialization. In 1840, the largest city in Indiana was <placeName>

                    elements. The general absence of northeastern emigrants has been noted above. There were also very
                    few foreign born. In 1850, Germans, the principal group, made up about four per cent of the total
                    population. These immigrants were found for the most part in the older counties bordering the

            <p>The basic homogeneity of the population of Indiana has been discussed above. Collectively, then,
                    there was a surprising degree of common background in the population of the state. It was possible
                    for middle state, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and southern emigrants in the same environment to find a rather broad area of mutual
                    interest. The predominance of small farmers from upland areas has also been shown. Since most of
                    them remained farmers, their mode of life continued to carry with it agrarian ideals. By 1850, many
                    of these men had resided side by side long enough to rub off some of the cultural layers brought
                    with them to Indiana. In the initial encounter, only the superficial characteristics of strangers
                    are inclined to be noticed. Obviously, there was some of the inheritance that remained but a certain
                    accommodating and blending could occur that would round off some of the sharper surface differences.
                    Part of that which remained could seemingly be vestigial, while some could be active and resistant
                    to change. The Indiana landscape even today is dotted with architectural transplantations
                    represented in homes that have outlasted their builders for more than a hundred years. Is it not
                    feasible to suggest that more pliable entities were unable to resist change and were being moulded
                    anew in the forties?</p>
            <p>This then was the broad setting in which the politicians were to act. The relation between political
                    behavior and social and economic forces, as a recent study has pointed out, is not always clear.
                    Political parties are often made up of people of the most diverse interests who for various reasons
                    find satisfaction in a common name.<hi rend="sup">60</hi> Yet, according to another recent analysis,
                    parties are limited by the climate of opinion that sustains their cultures. Politicians and

            <head>Eugene V. Debs: Conservative Labor Editor</head>
            <byline>David A. Shannon∗</byline>
            <p>Just eleven years before the great American Railway Union strike of 1894, which established Eugene V.
                    Debs as America's most militant and radical labor leader, Debs had written,
                    "Strikes are the knives with which laborers cut their own throats."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> A few years after the ARU strike Debs was to sign his letters "Yours for the
                    Revolution"; in the early 1880's he signed them, "Yours in Benevolence, Sobriety,
                    and Industry." Indeed, had enemies of the militant Socialist investigated his early trade
                    union background, they could have found in Debs's own writing an abundance of conservative
                    arguments to be used against him.</p>
            <p>When Debs became editor of the <hi rend="i">Locomotive Firemen's Monthly Magazine</hi>,
                    official journal of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, in July, 1880, there was little to
                    suggest that the twenty-five-year-old editor would be America's most famous radical within
                    a few years. The ambitious, hard-working young editor turned out a magazine that fitted well the
                    Brotherhood's conservative purposes, which were summarized in its motto
                    "Benevolence, Sobriety, and Industry." In its early days the Brotherhood of
                    Locomotive Firemen was more of a fraternal lodge and a mutual insurance company than a trade union.
                    The hazardous duties of locomotive firemen prevented commercial insurance companies from issuing
                    policies to firemen at premiums they could afford. To meet this situation, locomotive firemen
                    established their Brotherhood, which levied a periodic assessment on the members to build a death
                    and disability benefit fund.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> The other parts of the motto, sobriety and

                    engineer or "move to the right-hand side." In the early days of his editorship,
                    Debs took every opportunity to impress his readers with the importance and worthiness of these
                    purposes and to disparage more radical aims.</p>
            <p>When Debs became editor of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> in 1880 he also assumed the duties of Grand
                    Secretary-Treasurer, and it was a proud young officer who announced seventeen months later that the
                    death benefit of the order was increased to a thousand dollars, nearly double the amount of the old
                    benefit. The Brotherhood would ever "extend the hand of charity to the home of …
                    widow[s] and little ones," and any "lukewarm communicants" in the order
                    who could see no personal benefits from aiding the widows and orphans of brother firemen were

                    lacking in benevolence were few, but there were many who needed strengthening in their sobriety and

                    respectable. "The very irregular life of this calling," Debs wrote,
                    "caused men to fall into bad habits, and in place of spending their time in improving
                    themselves and in the interest of their families, they would, when not on the road, 'take
                    the town in with the boys,' as it is vulgarly termed, and so the profession fell into
                    disrepute." Debs was merciless in his attacks upon drunkenness among the brothers. No
                    locomotive fireman had "the right to allow himself to become intoxicated under any
                    circumstance, or at any time. If he does so, he forfeits his membership in our Order." He
                    urged railroad managers to close their depot saloons to remove temptation from their employees. Debs
                    thought, probably with too much optimism, the temperance campaign yielded results. When O. S.
                    Lyford, superintendent of the C. &amp; E. I., told Debs he had not had to fire any men because
                    of drunkenness for two years, Debs attributed the record to the activities of the <list type="footnotes">

                    nonalcoholic regime: "Instead of drunken rowdies … we now see dutiful sons,
                    loving husbands and kind fathers, who, when they have finished their day's work, go to
                    their homes … to caress their bright-eyed children and to kiss and make glad the
                    companions of their heart."<hi rend="sup">4</hi> But temperance was only part of the
                    program of uplift; hard work, honesty, self-sac00rifice, and "mental improvement"
                    were also necessary to make a self-made man of a fireman.</p>
            <p>After Debs became radical, he exhorted his listeners to be loyal to their class, to work for the
                    elevation of their class. But in the early 1880's, in his adulation of the self-made man,
                    there was the inarticulate basic premise that one should rise from, rather than with, one's
                    class. Debs himself had been moderately successful as a result of following the
                    lift-your-self-by-your-own-bootstraps philosophy. Forced to quit school at the age of fourteen, he
                    had gone to work on the Vandalia Railroad. Four years later he left railroad work to attend a <placeName>

                    encyclopedia, certainly in the best tradition of self-made men. After helping found a debating
                    society for young men, he went into politics and never lost in election as a Democrat. The voters of <placeName>

                    out the moral for young firemen: "Let no day go by without doing something that will fit
                    you to accept a position better than the present one, whatever that may be. Strive for excellence in
                    all things. If all known duties are honestly and conscientiously done, the reward will
                    come." Wasting time, drinking, "all those things that are usually called bad
                    habits, do not <hi rend="i">pay</hi>, in a business sense," and should therefore, be
                    avoided. Even after his disastrous experience in the <placeName>

                    earlier conservative ideas, he still reminded his readers that never in the history of the world had
                    conditions been so favorable for ambitious young men who "regarded 'time as
                    money' and [who] … husbanded it with miserly care," a view he
                    reaffirmed even early in the panic of 1893.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Debs could put his emphasis on individual self-help, on personal uplift, rather than on the usual
                    demands of trade union leaders, because he saw no economic conflict between capital and labor. The
                    American Federation of Labor unions, for example, in making their demands for job control and better
                    wages, hours, and working conditions, assumed a conflict between themselves and their employers and
                    assumed a show of labor strength was necessary to wrest concessions. Debs did not come around to
                    this point of view until the late 1880's and then reluctantly. Until then, contrary even to
                    the teachings of Adam Smith, he held the interests of labor and capital to be harmonious.
                    "One of our fundamental doctrines is that labor and capital are brothers."
                    "Steadily we have inculcated the doctrine that labor and capital are friends…
                        ."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> But, of course, even among friendly brothers, differences will
                    sometimes arise. Such differences could and should be settled by reasonable and peaceful means,
                    rather than by strikes or violence, in the manner of brothers rather than in the manner of economic
                    rivals.</p>

                    railroad strikes of 1877 one of the Grand Officers had "usurped" power and
                    authorized some of the eastern locals to strike, but "as an organization the Brotherhood
                    had nothing to do with the origin or development of that strike nor any other… . They
                    have never destroyed one dollar's worth of property, nor struck one blow at a railroad
                    company. On the contrary they have always counseled moderation and in many instances carefully
                    guarded the property of their corporations." Over and over, Debs repeated that strikes were
                    wrong and unnecessary, that they brought only grief to labor, that "no good has ever or can
                    ever come from resorting to violence and bloodshed," and that conciliation and compromise
                    could settle whatever differences might arise between railroaders and their employers.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

            <p>Alert railroad officials were quick to see the wisdom of befriending the Brotherhood of Locomotive
                    Firemen and its young editor. Railroads furnished annual passes to the Brotherhood officers, and
                    many railroad managers wrote Debs letters in which they spoke of the organization "in the
                    kindliest terms." William H. Vanderbilt of the <placeName>

                    Brotherhood's funds. When the firemen met in convention, the management of the railroads

                    Gould, Debs admitted the robber baron was a stock waterer and a ruthless speculator, but by the
                    standard of ethics of his colleagues, Debs thought, Gould stood rather well. Furthermore, Gould
                    never ordered his employees not to join unions and never hired Pinkertons.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

            <p>Debs's view of the relations of management and labor was an eminently conservative one,
                    recognizing no basic conflict between the two and disparaging the strike. Yet there was a Christian
                    demand for justice and a frontier spirit of social equality in Debs's thought that did not
                    sit well with the most autocratic of railroad officials. Debs's desideratum was one of
                    peace and co-operation between labor and capital, but he expected management to treat labor with
                    respect, honor, and social equality. "We want to be friendly with our employers, and serve
                    them faithfully. We want to become intelligent and respectable enough to merit their sympathy and
                    confidence. We want to have it so that if any difference or difficulty exists between us, we can
                    stand before them upon a perfect social equality, and state our grievances like men." A
                    railroad employee should "show proper respect for … superiors" and go
                    to his employer "with an olive branch in his hand," but he should do so as a man.
                    "American working men are not serfs—they will not wear the collar of railway
                    superintendents… . They are not cringing, fawning, lickspittles, who approach railway
                    superintendents on their bellies in the dust." Debs roundly condemned railroad managers who
                    used "spotters" to test the honesty of their conductors because such a practice
                    indicated these managers doubted the integrity of their employees. However, until the strike on the

            <p>With such views of society it was logical for Debs to have much the same attitude toward radicals as
                    conservatives later had about him. Radicals, Debs held, retarded the advancement of labor's
                    interests because the general public mistook their unpopular opinions for the beliefs of the
                    workingmen of the country. "The wild utterances of blatherskites have been the texts upon
                    which the press has commented as voicing the aims of the great body of laboring men…
                    ." These radicals, Debs charged, motivated by selfish interest, continually attempted to
                    create disturbances between labor and capital so that they could ride to political power on the wave
                    of artificially stimulated discontent. Such demagogues should be ignored. They should be ignored,
                    but Debs disagreed with those who thought radicals should be silenced. The anarchists convicted in

                    their right to hold and preach such mistaken doctrines. Socialists did not fare much better with
                    Debs than did the anarchists. As late as just a few months before the great Pullman strike he could
                    denounce the goals of socialists as "castles of moonshine" and charge that

                    "insufferable snobs" and "gold-lace parasites." He leaned toward
                    silver as against gold, but so had such <list type="footnotes">

            <byline>Hugh Hazelrigg∗</byline>
            <p>Alacrity of musical composition achieved merely by borrowing nice tunes from the classics, apparently
                    is not an innovation by Tin Pan Alley's songsmiths.</p>
            <p>Manuel del Popolo Vicente Garcia is called the composer of the melody for Stedman Whitwell's
                    "Land of the West," written for Robert Owen's party as they were sailing
                    toward this country in 1825, in Paul Brewster's article "Three Songs From <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>

                    <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi> of March 15, 1826, quoting a "<placeName>

                    </placeName> paper," says "A beautiful air, full of appropriate character and
                    expression, was composed (for Whitwell's ode) by Señor Garcia, with that
                    facility for which he is remarkable."</p>
            <p>Apparently Garcia's facility, in this instance, was merely an aptitude for quick
                    appropriation of an air "full of appropriate character and expression," for the
                    tune is none other than that of the national hymn of <placeName>
                        <country reg="au">Austria</country>
                    </placeName>, composed by Franz Joseph Haydn in 1797.</p>
            <p>Garcia gets the credit also from Robert Dale Owen, who in <hi rend="i">Threading My Way</hi> devotes
                    much space to Garcia and his opera company, who were aboard the packet "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>" with the Owenites.</p>
            <p>Says Owen, referring to the song, "The music, graceful and spirited, was by Garcia. It was
                    afterwards published in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, under the title 'Ebor Nova', and had quite a run, for the Garcias
                    won for themselves an enthusiastic reception."</p>
            <p>It would be interesting to know if the famous Garcia actually pretended to compose the tune for the
                    Owenites, or, perhaps because of language difficulties, they misunderstood when he merely undertook
                    to "provide" a melody. The above quotation from Owen would seem to indicate that
                    Garcia took no steps to disclaim composition when the song became a success in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. It is, of course, possible that Garcia never heard of it again after the shipboard
                    performance.</p>
            <p>Perhaps Garcia got a bit of malicious pleasure from hoodwinking the Englishmen, with whom relations
                    were slightly strained. Owen tells of Garcia's violence toward his <list type="footnotes">

                    the brig by the ship's captain after a public outburst in which Garcia knocked down his
                    son.</p>
            <p>At any rate, Garcia's reputation for facility in composition seems to be accepted as bona
                    fide by two of the better known music historians, Sir George Grove and Francois Fetis. Grove says
                    that "words and music seem to have been alike easy to Garcia," and Fetis credits
                    him with no less than 97 operas—71 in Spanish, 19 in Italian, and 7 in French!</p>
            <p>Haydn was commissioned to compose the tune (to words by Lorenz Leopold Hoschka) by Count von Saurau,
                    Imperial High Chancellor, because he considered Haydn alone capable of writing anything
                    approximating in merit the English "God Save the King." In part, the enterprise
                    was intended as an antidote to the influence of the French revolution.</p>
            <p>Under the title "God Preserve the Emperor Francis," the song was the Austrian
                    national hymn from 1797 to the time of the setting up of the republic in 1918. After that, it was
                    officially retained, with new words by Ottokar Kern-stock.</p>
            <p>Haydn did some borrowing himself, but definitely openly, by taking a Croatian folk melody and
                    altering and extending it to suit the words. He made a number of versions, still in existence,
                    improving the tune gradually until he arrived at the present smooth form.</p>
            <p>The tune is a favorite of chamber music addicts, as Haydn used it as a theme for a fine set of
                    variations in his string quartet, Opus 76, No. 3, known as the "Kaiser" or
                    "Emperor" quartet. Haydn loved to play the melody on the piano, especially when
                    the French were bombarding his home city, Vienna, in the year of his death, 1809. It is said to have
                    been the last music he performed.</p>
            <p>The melody is to be found in many hymn books, usually under the title "<placeName>
                        <country reg="au">Austria</country>
                    </placeName>," and is also the music of "Deutsch-land Über
                    Alles."</p>
            <p>As printed in the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>, the tune has been altered slightly
                    in the first half-measure of both the verse and the refrain of "Land of the West,"
                    apparently in order that it would fit the syllables. Somewhere, however, this alteration has gone
                    slightly awry. The second eighth-note in these measures has been added. Therefore, an eighth-note
                    value should have been eliminated from the dotted quarter-notes in these measures by dropping the
                    dots.</p>

            <head>Roots of the Principle of Separation of Powers in the Indiana Constitution</head>
            <byline>Darwin N. Kelley∗</byline>
            <p>In both the 1816 and 1851 constitutions of Indiana the framework of the government is the principle
                    of separation of powers. In the constitution of 1816 Article II states the principle: "The
                    powers of the government of Indiana shall be divided into three distinct departments, and each of
                    them be confined to a separate body of magistracy, to wit: Those which are legislative, to one;
                    those which are executive, to another; and those which are judiciary, to another. And no person, or
                    collection of persons, being of one of those departments, shall exercise any power properly attached
                    to either of the others, except in the instances herein expressly permitted." In the
                    constitution of 1851 the same principle is found in Article III, Section 1: "The powers of
                    the government are divided into three separate departments; the legislative, the executive including
                    the administrative, and the judicial; and no person charged with official duties under one of these
                    departments shall exercise any of the functions of another, except as in this constitution expressly
                    provided."</p>
            <p>The other states, as well as the framers of the federal constitution of 1787, used the principle of
                    separation of powers, this being one of the most important principles followed by the early
                    constitution makers. Practical applications of the principle, and the operation under the stress of
                    necessity, are deserving of separate considerations. Only the theoretical roots will be considered
                    in this study.</p>
            <p>Although there are many names associated with the evolution of this theory, the two Europeans,
                    Montesquieu and Locke, deserve paramount respect.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The purpose of the theory is

                            the same time one of the most irreproachable moral characters; and yet, when called upon to
                            frame a constitution of government, he may demonstrate to the world that he has reflected
                            very little on the subject. There is a great hazard in saying all this of John Milton; but
                            truth and the rights of mankind demand it." Adams then quoted at length from <placeName>

            <p>The three powers, according to Locke, are legislative, executive, and federative. The extent of the
                    legislative power makes it supreme: "The great end of men's entering into society
                    being the enjoyment of their properties in peace and safety, and the great instrument and means of
                    that being the laws established in that society, the first and fundamental positive law of all
                    commonwealths is the establishing of the legislative power; as the first and fundamental natural law
                    which is to govern even the legislative itself is the preservation of the society and, as far as
                    will consist with the public good, of every person in it. This legislative is not only the supreme
                    power of the commonwealth, but sacred and unalterable in the hands where the community have once

                    employed for preserving the community and members of it. But because those laws which are constantly
                    to be executed, and whose force is always to continue, may be made in a little time, therefore there
                    is no need that the legislative should be always in being, not having always business to do. And
                    because it may be too great a temptation to human frailty, apt to grasp at power, for the same
                    persons who have the power of making laws to have also in their hands the power to execute them,
                    whereby they may exempt themselves from obedience to the laws they make, and suit the law, both in
                    its making and execution, to their own private advantage, and therefore come to have a distinct
                    interest from the rest of the community contrary to the end of society and government; therefore, in
                    well ordered commonwealths, where the good of the whole is so considered as it ought, the
                    legislative power is put into the hands of divers persons who, duly assembled, have by themselves,
                    or jointly with others, a power to make laws; which when they have done, being separated again, they
                    are themselves subject to the laws they have made, which is a new and near tie upon them to take

            <p>Montesquieu's definition of liberty makes it practical. "In governments, that is,

                            judges, it was natural for him to rename Locke's executive power judicial power,
                            inasmuch as the executive's function as described by Locke had been to execute the
                            laws. This transformation was accompanied by another, whereby Locke's federative
                            power emerged as the executive power with Montesquieu. By elaborating the importance of
                            maintaining internal as well as external peace and by thus assimulating the police functions
                            to those of defense and foreign policy, Montesquieu constructed the modern executive power
                            which included also the prerogative that English lawyers had always carefully kept apart for
                            special purposes. In this wise there arose a picture of the ideal balanced state,
                            guaranteeing liberty, which fascinated the eighteenth century with its passion for dynamic
                            symmetry and constructive speculations. It was of the greatest moment that these
                            constructions happened to fit the constitutional experience of most of the American
                            colonies, where a governor, a distinct colonial legislature and a fairly independent
                            judiciary had come to constitute the essential organs of government and where after the
                            Declaration of Independence a brief experiment with legislative supremacy leading to
                            majority tyranny had made the people ripe for a practical application of the celebrated

                    to will." Moreover, "We must have continually present to our minds the difference
                    between independence and liberty. Liberty is a right of doing whatever the laws permit, and if a
                    citizen could do what they forbid he would be no longer possessed of liberty, because all his
                    fellow-citizens would have the same power."<hi rend="sup">18</hi> Then too, liberty and
                    safety are one. "The political liberty of the subject is a tranquillity of mind arising
                    from the opinion each person has of his safety. In order to have this liberty, it is requisite the
                    government be so constituted as one man needs not be afraid of another."<hi rend="sup">19</hi> And the way to achieve this liberty is by separation of powers. "When the
                    legislative and executive powers are united in the same person, or in the same body of magistrates,
                    there can be no liberty; because apprehensions may arise, lest the same monarch or senate should
                    enact tyrannical laws, to execute them in a tyrannical manner. Again, there is no liberty, if the
                    judiciary power be not separated from the legislative and executive. Were it joined with the
                    legislative, the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control; for the
                    judge would be then the legislator. Were it joined to the executive power, the judge might behave
                    with violence and oppression."<hi rend="sup">20</hi> With expert skill the subject was not
                    exhausted but rather made the starting place for a plan. "I should be glad to inquire into
                    the distribution of the three powers, in all the moderate governments we are acquainted with, in
                    order to calculate the degree of liberty which each may enjoy. But we must not always exhaust a
                    subject, so as to leave no work at all for the reader. My business is not to make people read, but

                                especially Blackstone. That the influence of other authorities than Locke and
                                Montesquieu was great is not questioned. Yet on the point of preserving liberty it does
                                not seem that they had a strong appeal. Black-stone may be used as an example.

                                preservation of liberty the colonists could well go directly to Montesquieu. Not only
                                does Blackstone use Montesquieu as an authority, but also has such statements as these:
                                "In all tyrannical governments, the supreme magistracy, or the right of both
                                    <hi rend="i">making</hi> and of <hi rend="i">enforcing</hi> the laws, is vested in

                                "modern political science must emancipate itself from the deadweight of the

                                been transformed into a dogma. Montesquieu demanded the separation of powers merely
                                because he believed that it alone could enable a counter-power to check power, so that a
                                maximum of liberty could be assured. It is not the constitutional form that stands in
                                the center of his theory, but its social substructure. No one was less inclined than
                                Montesquieu to make a fetish of the constitution." lxiv.</p>

                            rise of contending political forces impossible or difficult. A pluralistic social structure
                            and a flexible multi-party system are far more important to liberty than the monopolication
                            of legislation by the legislature and the reduction of the administrative power into a
                            law-enforcing agency. The threat to liberty, inherent in the ascendance of administration,
                            cannot be curbed by curtailing administrative activity but by subjecting it to a
                            parliamentary control and assuring popular participation in administration." lxiv.</p>
                        <p>"Montesquieu had changed his conception after a study of English political
                            institutions. He would equally have changed it after a study of mass democracy in

                        <p>The present controversy about separation of powers is not within the scope of this study;
                            only to show present interest and questioning in the above quotation given. But it is
                            fitting to point out that, since the use made of Montesquieu in the Constitution of the <placeName>
                                <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                            </placeName> and the state constitutions is largely a use of his wording to express the
                            American experience up to that time, to change the principle of separation of powers would
                            be to change the basis of experience on which the government is established. Whether or not
                            this change should be made, rather than the meaning of Montesquieu, is the heart of the

                    26, 1819, he laid out Saundersville, but by 1830 this little village had practically disappeared
                    except for the post office.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Fourteen years later, however, there were still

                                    of the bounty of English Christians, and claiming as well the natural as the
                                    sympathetic ties of holy brotherhood, we humbly venture to plead our necessity, and
                                    hope to "gather some of the crumbs that fall from our masters tables";
                                    praying that the missionary spirit which is being so largely poured out from our
                                    native home, and the bosom of our own mother church may extend one of its heavenward

                        <p>Led hither as we trust by a proper motive to seek for our families a home, we still
                                    feel a void;—but it is a want which has been frequently supplied to
                                    foreigners.—and we earnestly emplore it now for Englands own Children.

            <byline>Thomas P. Martin∗</byline>
            <p>Perhaps the times are propitious in Indiana for a new historical survey, a survey of economic and
                    business history materials. Initial inquiries among businessmen have brought encouraging responses.
                    It may be that we are already in a movement like that which has become a cropper in <placeName>

                    "Centennials," of the "100th birthday" celebrations of
                    villagers, city folks, "century farms," churches, business concerns, etc. The
                    centennial observance in 1936 of the creation of <placeName>

                    </placeName> Territory had apparently stimulated local observances and a movement for a mammoth
                    celebration in 1948 of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>'s admission to statehood. The State Centennial with its displays of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>-made manufactures in turn "quickened interest in the State's history
                    and brought its industrial role into sharp focus." Businessmen asked the State Historical
                    Society to help them prepare their histories. This the Society speedily prepared to do by getting on
                    mailing lists of important firms, collecting company printed materials, and inaugurating a Business
                    Records Survey; first, of manufactures. David Clark Everest, "a history-conscious paper
                    manufacturer," offered a prize of $1,000 each year for ten years for the best
                    manuscript on <placeName>

                    </placeName> economic history.</p>
            <p>The first results of the Business Records Survey of Manufactures have been announced. Forty-six per
                    cent of four thousand manufactures filled out an inquiry form; and of these over 225 wrote that they
                    would be willing to open their records at any time to a qualified researcher. These 225 presumably
                    had their records under control and readily accessible or wanted the advice and help of historians.
                    Many sent company brochures, pamphlets, and photographs—ephemerae which for the most part
                    perish with the passing of a generation. The more substantial materials revealed and in part
                    received virtually reorient the work of the Society. A geographically arranged file on selected
                    (20,000 out of 65,000) firms representing many types of business now "gives an industrial
                    picture of each region of the State and contains information about records pertinent to their
                    business history."<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>This biography of General Charles Lee is a successful effort to remove the spots with which posterity
                    has smeared his reputation and to present a correct estimate of his character and achievements. This
                    has been done in a very acceptable manner. The necessary facts have been assembled and related in a
                    clear straightforward way. Controversial questions are handled with skill, and the evidence is given
                    a judicial appraisal.</p>
            <p>At the outbreak of the Revolution, Lee had had a long career in the British army, during which he had
                    attained the rank of lieutenant-colonel, but was now inactive on half pay. Near the beginning of the
                    war he resigned from the British service and became a major general in the American army. Although
                    his new rank was a marked promotion over that held by him in the British army, there can be no
                    reasonable doubt as to the purity of his motives in taking this important step. With
                    liberal—almost radical—political views, he had all along been violent in his
                    attacks on what he considered the despotic policy of the king and his ministry. He had also strongly
                    opposed the Stamp Act and the other measures that led to the revolt of the colonies. He came to
                    America in the fall of 1773 and soon became active in the publication of pamphlets and newspaper
                    articles in support of the revolutionary propaganda.</p>
            <p>Owing to his wide experience in military affairs, Lee was regarded by the patriot leaders, both
                    military and civilian, as a most valuable addition to the army. This high estimate of his military
                    ability was confirmed by useful service and successful achievements in the American service. His
                    greatest success was the repulse of the British under Clinton at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charleston</settlement>
                    </placeName> (June 28, 1776). It is true that the chief merit for this victory belongs to Colonel
                    Moultrie and his men for their successful defense of Fort Sullivan; but a large share of the credit
                    properly went to Lee, who was in chief command.</p>
            <pb n="382" id="VAA4025-047-4-066"/>
            <p>When he returned from the South adorned with the laurels of victory, he was rated by both military
                    and civilian authorities as the ablest of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s lieutenants. This might have been the final verdict of history but for two
                    unfortunate events in his career. These untoward occurrences were his capture by the British and his
                    retreat at Monmouth Courthouse.</p>
            <p>Lee was captured by the British in December, 1776, and was held by Howe until April, 1778, when he
                    was exchanged for General Prescott. While a prisoner he drew up and presented to General Howe a plan
                    purporting to show how the latter could quickly win the war. That Lee had made such an offer to the
                    enemy was not known (except to a few) until more than seventy years after his death, when the
                    documents which revealed this proposal were made public. On the basis of these papers the charge of
                    treason has been brought against Lee by some later historians.</p>
            <p>This action on the part of Lee poses a difficult problem for his biographer. The latter is unable to
                    say whether Lee's purpose was to lead Howe astray by an unwise suggestion or to end the war
                    by a speedy British victory. The author considers it not improbable that he felt that the American
                    cause was lost and that a prompt ending of the war would be the wisest outcome for both
                    belligerents. Lee contended that he was trying to aid the Americans by inducing Howe to adopt a
                    strategy that would weaken his forces. The British general's movements were influenced
                    little, if at all, by the (apparently unsound) advice of his captive.</p>
            <p>The most serious blow to Lee's reputation as a military leader was the severe criticism
                    which was leveled against his behavior at the battle of Monmouth Courthouse. In this battle the
                    American army, with Lee in command of the advance contingent, came in contact with the strong
                    British forces under Sir Henry Clinton (June 28, 1778). Noting the strength of the enemy, Lee
                    withdrew to a more favorable position. In this withdrawal there was some confusion, for which
                    apparently Lee was not responsible. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> joined Lee with his force while the retreat was in progress. Feeling that Lee should
                    have attacked instead of retreated and noting the confusion, he gave Lee a severe reprimand in the
                    presence of other officers. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> did not use profanity, as tradition relates, but he did lose his temper and acted
                    hastily and unjustly toward his subordinate.</p>
            <pb n="383" id="VAA4025-047-4-067"/>
            <p>Lee was cut to the quick by this wound to his pride and asked for a court martial, feeling sure of
                    vindication. In this expectation he was sorely disappointed for the verdict of the court was that he
                    had made an unnecessary retreat and had been guilty of disobedience and disrespect to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The penalty imposed was suspension from the army for a period of one year.</p>
            <p>The author regards the verdict of the court as grossly unfair. In his opinion, Lee had in this battle
                    exhibited courage, coolness, and self-control. He had also acted on sound principles and any
                    mistakes that he made were minor and natural. The success of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s movements after he took command was due largely to the favorable position in
                    which Lee had placed his forces. The disgraced general had therefore performed a most important
                    service to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. "It is quite likely that his retrograde movements at Monmouth prevented
                    Clinton from delivering a smashing counter attack."</p>
            <p>One naturally wonders why such an unjust verdict was rendered. For this miscarriage of justice Lee
                    himself was partly to blame. In his correspondence with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> after Monmouth he made statements that the latter resented. In this way he created an
                    issue between himself and the commander-in-chief. A decision favorable to Lee would have meant a
                    loss of prestige for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Since both the witnesses and the judges in the trial were officers whose future
                    advancement would be controlled by the commander-in-chief, it is not improbable that they were
                    influenced by considerations that should have no place in a judicial decision. Young Alexander
                    Hamilton seemed especially biased in his testimony as a witness.</p>
            <p>In this biography Lee appears as an interesting, but not an admirable character. He had scholarly
                    tastes, knew several languages, and was widely read in the classics. He was noted for his strength
                    of will and utter fearlessness. As an offset to these good qualities, he was afflicted with undue
                    vanity, a soaring ambition, and a badness of temper which led him into numerous disputes. There also
                    ran through his personality a streak of eccentricity which at times assumed the appearance of
                    near-insanity.</p>

            <p>A new book by the editor of the <hi rend="i">Dictionary of American Biography</hi> commands
                    attention.</p>
            <p>This is the second volume in what promises to be a general history of the American
                    nation—the first volume entitled <hi rend="i">The First Frontier</hi> was published in
                    1948. The dust cover carries the subtitle "The Story of the Fabulous Century in which the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> was born: 1664-1765." This subtitle would be appropriate on the title page. It
                    more accurately describes the content of the volume than does the major title.</p>
            <p>The book is well written and retains the interest of the reader. It has grip. Apparently it was
                    intended for the general reading public. The style is descriptive and narrative and seldom
                    expository. Chapters do not open with a key paragraph but with some incident intended to catch the
                    attention of the reader, much like the style of many popular short stories.</p>
            <p>Even the first chapter, entitled "Birth of an Empire" opens with a lurid incident
                    of hurrying slaves overland from New Amsterdam to New Amstel in northern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName>, men chained together, women and children following, moving at a "brisk
                    trot" on a warm August morning after traveling on foot all night and covering some twenty
                    miles since the evening before. Any one who has seen well seasoned soldiers marched twenty miles in
                    one night has extreme difficulty in believing that slaves could have been moving at a
                    "brisk trot" the next morning. Examination of the cited reference shows no mention
                    of children, the rate of march or the use of chains. It merely states when they started. The rest of
                    the book is much sounder than this fanciful introductory paragraph.</p>
            <p>The work is divided into thirty-one chapters with short colorful titles. Chapters vary greatly in
                    length. In some cases titles give little clue to the contents of the chapter. Of the 536 pages of
                    text, 473 deal with the period before 1750. One chapter of twenty-three pages is devoted to the
                    preliminary contest for the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> country and another of ten pages to a detailed description of the Braddock disaster.
                    Only fourteen pages are used to discuss the growing causes of <pb n="385" id="VAA4025-047-4-069"/>
                    friction after 1763. Thus the great bulk of the volume deals with colonial development from 1660 to
                    1740.</p>
            <p>There are twenty-eight full page, black and white maps, especially made for this work. In the main
                    they are very good. Those on pages 63, 123, and 143 seem to need alignment or compass direction.
                    There are sixty-two illustrations, of which more than half are portraits of contemporary characters.
                    Most of the others deal with colonial homes and their furnishings. Each chapter heading has a
                    decoration adapted, so we are told on page 464, from the cartouche on the Fry and Jefferson map of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. Paper and press work are excellent.</p>
            <p>The point of view is strictly provincial with the central emphasis upon the constantly shifting
                    frontier, including the English, French, and Spanish. It is a detailed story of the occupation of
                    the area east of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>. More space is given to LaSalle than to the issue of taxation. The West and not <placeName>
                        <country>New England</country>
                    </placeName> receives major treatment. Problems of imperial organization and relations with the
                    mother country receive very minor attention.</p>
            <p>The chief contribution to historical information is in the field of synthesis. It gathers together
                    the results of a century of historical scholarship, including general and special studies of the
                    most recent date, and weaves them into a continuous narrative. As one reads the book he becomes more
                    and more impressed with the attention that has been given to individuals and their connection with
                    events over a long period of time. No other author has done this so well. Maximum use has been made
                    of the material in the <hi rend="i">Dictionary of American Biography.</hi> Of the more than one
                    thousand citations, 116 include references to this outstanding biographical work.</p>
            <p>The coming of foreign peoples—Scotch, Scotch-Irish, Swiss and Germans—is
                    treated in much detail with definite information as to their leaders, how they came and where they
                    settled. The Moravians, the Labadists, the Methodists, the Great Awakening and other religious
                    movements are fully treated.</p>
            <p>The use of references departs from common research practice. There are a total of 1,083 separate
                    footnote citations, regularly at the close of a paragraph. These on their face resemble the usual
                    citations. All references are consolidated <pb n="386" id="VAA4025-047-4-070"/> by chapters in the
                    back of the book, making a total of fifty pages. These are labeled "Bibliography."
                    Literally they are short bibliographies for each paragraph and not authorities for statements in the
                    text. This makes it very difficult to verify any specific statement. It is hoped that this practice
                    will not spread to other historical writing.</p>
            <p>As in most books of this scope, there are minor features that can be questioned. The chief adverse
                    criticism is likely to be the omission of any adequate presentation of material that would help
                    place the colonies as a part of the British Empire, their relation to the sugar islands and the
                    fisheries, the part they played in eliminating forever <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> as a colonial power in America and the inclusion in the account of so many trivial
                    contemporary local episodes. Readers can go to other works for the former. For a long time they will
                    turn to this volume for the latter. We need such a contribution as Coleman has given us.</p>

            <p>This is by no means a complete biography and its author makes no such claim for it. Here instead is a
                    portrayal of Joseph Gurney Cannon after he reached his three score and ten years. This in itself
                    marks a unique achievement, for about how many Americans could a book be written, that opened with
                    the subject's seventieth birthday? Bolles has not attempted a detailed narrative about
                    Cannon's life which began after the latter reached the Psalmist allotted life span but he
                    has written a monograph on only one phase of a complex personality. The author frequently refers to
                    the earlier life of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Tyrant when he feels the necessity for acquainting the reader with material that
                    explains later action.</p>
            <p>Generally speaking, Cannonism in 1906 meant standpatism. To use Cannon's classic statement,
                    "America is a hell uv a success. Why change it?" He threw the dictatorial powers
                    of the Speakership of the National House, which position he held from 1903 to 1911, into the fight
                    for maintaining <pb n="387" id="VAA4025-047-4-071"/> the status quo. He successfully
                    "balked Roosevelt's attempt to marry social consciousness to political
                    science."</p>
            <p>In 1908, Taft won the Republican nomination for president but Cannon won the party. Discontent grew
                    rapidly in the fertile soil of the Speaker's repeated opposition to a growing demand for
                    national reforms. Stripped of his autocratic authority in March, 1910, Cannon tendered his
                    resignation only to have it rejected. Though Cannon served until the Democrats organized the House
                    in 1911 he was never happy after he was deprived of his personalized power.</p>
            <p>As a politician, "Uncle Joe," as Cannon was called affectionately, was as fair as
                    the "exigencies of American politics" would permit. As a raconteur of racy tales,
                    he had a varied jovial audience. As one of the best poker players in public life, Cannon was
                    respected by official <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. As a prolific swearer or a vulgar mouthed old man, he had no equal in American
                    politics in his generation, but it is as the architect of standpatism that Cannon will be remembered
                    historically.</p>
            <p>Bolles declares that Joe Cannon was the creator of the welfare state. The author bases his conclusion
                    on Cannon's determined refusal to countenance any changes, whatsoever. This obstinacy
                    forced all reformers into the cavalcade of Wilson's New Freedom, Roosevelt's New
                    Deal, and Truman's Welfare State. Obviously, such a thesis will not be accepted
                    unanimously.</p>
            <p>This book is well written, has an ample bibliography and an accurate index. Unfortunately, several
                    mistakes have remained. For example, E. H. Harrison, correctly stated in the index, is given as E.
                    R. Harrison twice in the book (pp. 14-15); David G. Phillips' popular book in
                        1903—<hi rend="i">The Treason of the Senate</hi> is listed <hi rend="i">Treason in
                        the Senate</hi> (p. 16); a Biblical reference "Garden of Gethsemane" is
                    "Garden of Olives" (p. 34); John Sharp Williams did <hi rend="i">not</hi> attend
                    the Democratic National Convention at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Denver</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1908, as stated (p. 155) nor did he write the plank in the platform attributed to him
                    (p. 156). Elected as a delegate-at-large to this convention, Williams got drunk on the way to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Denver</settlement>
                    </placeName> and later was found by a policeman in <placeName>

                    </placeName> sitting on a street hugging a lamp post. These are minor errors, however, in an
                    excellently written book. Certainly, a full-length scholarly biography of Uncle Joe Cannon is long
                    overdue.</p>

            <p>The second printing of Miss Larson's <hi rend="i">Guide</hi>, an expensive book, in the
                    second year of publication emphasizes the importance of business history and increases our concern
                    about the place which Indiana materials hold in it.</p>
            <p>It seems that the development of American business history as specially defined by Miss Larson (pp.
                    3-6) — administration and operation in the past—was overdue a quarter century
                    ago. About 1925, Wallace B. Donham, dean of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> Graduate School of Business Administration, 1919-1942, undertook to promote it; and
                    Professor N. S. B. Gras of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>, a former student of Wallace's predecessor, Edwin F. Gay, accepted the new
                    Straus Professorship of Business History at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Leading businessmen and institutions of learning have given generous support. Since
                    American business history covers Small Business as well as Big Business, we may expect it to become
                    a popular, practical part of education and training. For older, conventional economic, social,
                    political, and diplomatic history, this development may be termed, with no pun intended, a
                    "grass roots" movement.</p>
            <p>Patriotic Indianans will encounter the index with mixed emotions, if they do not first get acquainted
                    with the book by reading the introductory material by Professor Gras and Miss Larson. For the index
                    was designed for a guide, not for a bibliography, and should be worked several ways. Of course it is
                    not perfect. Under "Indiana" one sees subheads —automotive industry,
                    banking, capitalists "industrial" and "petty," and limestone.
                    "Drug industry" yields only two references, one being R. C. Clark's <hi rend="i">Eli Lilly and Company, 1876-1946</hi> described in the text as "Better than
                    the average run of anniversary volumes. Emphasizes executives and product and gives some indication
                    of policy and personnel and sales management." There are intriguing and suggestive subheads
                    under "Drug trade retail" and "Drug trade, wholesale." Under
                    "Furniture," "Hardware," and "Steamships" <pb n="389" id="VAA4025-047-4-073"/> there are no references distinctly Indianan. Under
                    "Machinery," which is too general, there is no reference, say, to Oliver Chilled
                    Plow Works; under "Oliver, James," there are two references, with specific comment
                    on one. Entries, with comments, of A. R. Erskine's <hi rend="i">History of the Studebaker
                        Corporation</hi> (1924), Logan Esarey's "State Banking in Indiana,
                    1814-1873" (1912), and J. A. Batchelor's <hi rend="i">Economic History of the
                        Indiana Oolitic Limestone Industry</hi> (1944) are included. Though the reader knows that
                    references in the <hi rend="i">Guide</hi> are a "selection" peculiar to the Gras
                    School, he is perhaps dissatisfied with the showing of his own Hoosier Indiana: Not enough; should
                    be more.</p>
            <p>There are illuminating references under the headings "Business records,"
                    collection, control and preservation; "Business research"; and "Manuscript
                    collections." One might now add, "Records management," on which a
                    considerable literature has sprung up since 1948. Though there has been severe damage done by
                    indiscriminate destruction and loss of our business manuscripts and records, many still can be
                    found, as one may see in current Indiana University announcements regarding the papers and records
                    of The Howard Shipyards, <placeName>

                    outside the boundaries of Indiana, perhaps not even by many readers outside the confines of his
                    native community, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Ehrmann's work included poetry, philosophical prose, and closet drama, all of
                    varying length and pretension. He was a minor poet and philosopher of ability who made a deep
                    impression upon a few very respectable critics through his sincerity, his thoughtfulness, and his
                    abiding will to express to his fellowmen the product of that thoughtfulness. When he died in 1945,
                    Ehrmann had completed a half-century of post-collegiate writing activity. The majority of this
                    writing, particularly <pb n="390" id="VAA4025-047-4-074"/> the drama, had been done in the earlier
                    part of that period, although there has been a flurry of republication since 1945. With the hope
                    only of orienting the reader and without any derogatory implications whatsoever, Ehrmann may be
                    looked upon as a kind of intelligent and intellectual Edgar Guest, or perhaps better, a lesser
                    Emerson with the same analytical mind and concern for mankind but without any very great sustained
                    originality, at least in his poetry.</p>
            <p>The most interesting aspect of Ehrmann's career—and the one portrayed most
                    successfully by Mrs. Ehrmann—is his life-long allegiance to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Born in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> of German immigrant parentage, Ehrmann was educated at DePauw and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He returned to his home town, also that of Debs and Dreiser, both well-known to him,
                    and began the practice of law. However, he was fired with the urge to conquer the literary and
                    intellectual world. Throughout Mrs. Ehrmann's study of her husband, there is apparent the
                    gradual, though never complete, defeat of that urge and its slow supplanting by a growing
                    satisfaction with being the revered intellectual of a small city, a prophet with credit. For the
                    sake of the unity of Mrs. Ehrmann's tribute to her husband, it is unfortunate that this is
                    not the prevailing theme of her study, for it is quite evident that in considerable degree the key
                    to the interpretation of Ehrmann's life is the interplay of these two forces, national
                    recognition versus local recognition.</p>
            <p>Throughout, there is portrayed an admirable personality of some significance and peculiar literary
                    pretensions, known by and knowing important personages of the first half of the century, and, above
                    all, remarkably typical of that strange American phenomenon the local sage. Such a character
                    deserves a good, full biography. This book of Mrs. Ehrmann will have to be taken into consideration
                    by any further biographer of Ehrmann.</p>
            <p>As a parting remark, almost a footnote—and a very hesitant one since here the reviewer is
                    out of his field— would not a study of the local sage as a type be a worthwhile
                    undertaking? Perhaps even two studies, one historical and one literary. Certainly, the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> has had many such figures, some of great national impact. And the local sage has been
                    popular in fiction and in folklore. In any such historical <pb n="391" id="VAA4025-047-4-075"/> or
                    literary study, Max Ehrmann would have to be dealt with at length.</p>

            <p>Hoosiers appreciate the exhibition arranged by the Library of Congress in commemoration of the
                    establishment of Indiana Territory in 1800 and they are also proud of the record of their
                    fellow-Hoosier, Elmer Davis. The address here printed, which contrasts the life of the
                        <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> counties with the rest of the state, is stimulating and
                    interesting. It is concerned, however, with a much later period than that of the Territory of
                    Indiana and is largely composed of the author's memories of his youth and the changes that
                    have come to Indiana with industrialization. His interpretation of Edward Eggleston as a portrayer
                    of upstate Indiana will be questioned by many readers. The brevity of the address hardly permits one
                    to ascribe significance to it, however interesting it may have been to those who listened to it.</p>
            <p>There is one aspect of the pamphlet that cannot be passed without sharp criticism. Historical
                    literature at seventeen cents per page is unreasonable. There is nothing about the address to
                    justify such extravagance. It is out of harmony with the spirit of Indiana. The Indiana Territory
                    Sesqui-centennial Commission produced a celebration of the same event without an appropriation. The
                    Library of Congress might have published the address without extravagance and used the savings to
                    publish important documents.</p>

            <p>At first thought it may seem that a volume which "aims at providing … the exact
                    texts of some of the most important documents and illustrative reading materials relevant to
                    … the history of Europe since 1918" is a far cry from Indiana history. A
                    moment's contemplation of the way in which the lives of Hoosiers have been intimately and
                    drastically affected by the course of events in Europe since 1918, however, will serve to correct
                    such a thought. Whether we like it or not, Indiana history has become enmeshed with world history,
                    and the innumerable treaties, pacts, constitutions, laws, court decisions, manifestoes,
                    proclamations, and minutes of conferences included in this collection will certainly contribute to a
                    fuller understanding of world history. A reading of the minutes of the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam
                    conferences, for instance, would be educational.</p>
            <p>Those who edit or write books on contemporary history which have in their titles
                    "since" some date inevitably face the harassing task of keeping their volumes
                    somewhere near up-to-date. Significant events have a way of continuing to occur even after a history
                    book is published. The first edition of the volume under review appeared in 1939. In this edition
                    327 pages have been added to the original material which, so far as the reviewer has discovered, has
                    not been altered. Essentially, therefore, the earlier volume has been enlarged rather than revised.
                    The new material consists almost entirely of official documents issued during the years 1939-1948,
                    the great bulk of them falling within the period of the Second World War and its immediate
                    aftermath. The book provides a convenient way for students of contemporary history to secure a
                    reading of many documents which are not readily accessible in the form in which they originally
                    appeared, documents from which much of the history of the period must be written.</p>
            <p>But one who confines his reading to official documents only may learn much that is true and still not
                    get the real "feel" of the period. Such documents tend to be cold and somewhat
                    abstract. Ultimatums, declarations of war, military reports, and treaties all are needed for the
                    writing of the history of the Second World War, for instance, but one might wish that in addition
                    excerpts from Ernie Pyle's <hi rend="i">Brave Men</hi>, Konstantine Simonov's <hi rend="i">Days and Nights</hi>, Curt Riess's <hi rend="i">Underground Europe</hi>, and
                    other similar sources had <pb n="393" id="VAA4025-047-4-077"/> been included. Such excerpts would
                    give the reader a much deeper appreciation of the desperate fighting on the beaches of Normandy, the
                    heroic Russian defense of Stalingrad, and the valiant deeds of the members of the resistance
                    movements in the various Nazi-conquered countries than any number of official documents could do.
                    But the volume under review is designed to be primarily a collection of such documents, and in this
                    somewhat restricted though important field the editors have done an excellent job.</p>

            <p>This preliminary report has been submitted in answer to a request from President Truman that the
                    Commission send him a statement on "what can be done—and should be
                    done—to make available to our people the public and private writings of men whose
                    contributions to our history are now inadequately represented by published works." The
                    Commission bases its report on the results of consultations with scholars in many fields of American
                    history. From their recommendations a list of 66 persons of national stature, at or near the top in
                    their respective fields, has been compiled and presented here as a tentative list of those persons,
                    the publication of whose papers would be of particular value. In the selection of names a broad
                    interpretation of the word "history" has been adopted. As a result, along with the
                    names of those who have been important in political history, will be found captains of industry and
                    labor, inventors, scientists, educators, religious leaders, editors, writers, and architects. Names
                    of many persons of national stature have been omitted. For some of these papers are not known to
                    exist in sufficient quantities to justify publication. For others the papers have already been
                    adequately published or are now in process of publication. For each person listed years of birth and
                    death, occupation, a brief summary of his or her <pb n="394" id="VAA4025-047-4-078"/> career,
                    information on the location of the main bodies of papers, and a statement on the extent to which
                    papers have or have not been systematically published, are given.</p>
            <p>The Commission believes that the work of editing and publishing of papers should be carried out
                    principally by private agencies, such as universities and historical societies. It sees its own role
                    as that of serving as a central body to assist in planning, promoting, and giving direction to the
                    program, and that of the federal government as one of assistance, perhaps by sharing printing costs.</p>
            <p>In addition to the publication of papers of individuals two other projects to which the Commission is
                    applying itself are of considerable interest. One is the establishment in cooperation with other
                    interested organizations of a central register to serve as a union list of manuscript collections in
                    depositories or private hands in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. The other is a survey of documentary publications in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> at the national level for the purpose of determining major gaps in the published
                    documentation of the Government's activities in order to recommend a program for filling
                    the gaps.</p>
            <p>This report is presented as a basis for further discussion, and comments and suggestions are
                    requested.</p>

                    their missions, 1789-1906, which is scattered through various series of State Department records.
                    The arrangement is alphabetical by names of agents followed by the year of appointment of each, a

                    agents, performing duties similar to those of consuls; agents for boundary and claims commissions;
                    diplomatic representatives for special negotiations, whose appointments were confirmed by the
                    Senate; and representatives of the U.S. at international congresses, conferences, and exhibitions.
                    The closing date, 1906, marks the time at which the filing system of the State Department was

                    correspondence relating to missions of special agents may be found.</p>
            <p>An appendix arranges the special agents by the geographical areas in which they served or with which

            <p>The preliminary inventories series of the National Archives is designed as a first step in providing
                    the finding aids needed to facilitate the use of the records of the federal government preserved in
                    that repository. Each inventory contains a brief statement of the history and functions of the
                    agency with which it deals, and a description of its records, series by series.</p>
            <p>Of the inventories considered here the first, no. 24, concerns itself with the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> War Ballot Commission, which was established April 1, 1944 to facilitate absentee
                    voting by members of the army, navy, and merchant marine, and abolished April 19, 1946.</p>
            <p>No. 25 describes all the records of permanent value of the Office of War Mobilization and
                    Reconversion, with the exception of a few in the custody of other agencies. From May, 1943, until
                    June 1, 1947, this agency served as the highest government authority, except for the President, in
                    regard to policy planning for industrial and civilian mobilization and reconversion activities. The
                    records concern themselves primarily with top-level policy and program planning. A wide number of
                    specific fields are involved including food, agriculture, <pb n="397" id="VAA4025-047-4-081"/>
                    employment, economic stabilization, fiscal policy, public works, foreign economic operations,
                    housing, the utilization of industrial facilities, manpower, transportation, the production of
                    critical and strategic materials, education, veterans affairs, demobilization, contract terminations
                    and cutbacks, and surplus property disposal.</p>
            <p>Inventory no. 26, <hi rend="i">Records of the Bureau of Aeronautics</hi>, is the only one, of those
                    listed here, to extend farther back than World War II. It describes those records of the Bureau,
                    established August 10, 1921, which had been transferred to the National Archives by December, 1950.
                    Some records of predecessors of the Bureau, to which it fell heir, are also included.</p>
            <p>The inventory, <hi rend="i">Records of the Selective Service System, 1940-47</hi>, does not limit
                    itself to records now in the National Archives, but includes also a section listing those remaining
                    in the Selective Service System both at national and state headquarters. National headquarters has
                    transferred to the National Archives some correspondence, material relating to national selective
                    service lotteries, conscientious objectors, and appeals, directives, and reports. Some field
                    records, consisting principally of minute books of local and appeal boards, have also been placed in
                    the National Archives. The National Headquarters of the Selective Service System has retained the
                    records of paid employees, some correspondence, records of the budget officer, and reports and
                    surveys. State Headquarters have retained possession of records relating to registration,
                    information, classification, delivery and induction, and delinquents; records relating to aliens,
                    appeal board records, reports of separation; and records of volunteer personnel.</p>
            <p>Inventory no. 28 describes records transferred to the National Archives in 1947 from the Retraining
                    and Reemployment Administration, established February 24, 1944, to serve as a clearing house for
                    federal programs dealing with the retraining and reemployment of persons both veterans and
                    nonveterans discharged or released from the armed services or other war work.</p>
            <p>No. 29 concerns itself with <hi rend="i">Records of the Foreign Economic Administration.</hi> This
                    World War II agency established economic controls and carried on foreign economic operations, the
                    purpose being to assist Allied nations and to <pb n="398" id="VAA4025-047-4-082"/> deny to enemy
                    nations materials and manufactured products of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. This agency which existed from September 25, 1943, to September 27, 1945, resulted
                    from the consolidation of various other agencies, among which its duties had been divided. The
                    records transferred to the National Archives and described here include those of the Chairman and
                    Executive Secretary of the President's Liaison Committee, one of the predecessors of the
                    Foreign Economic Administration; central files and a number of files of officials of the Lend-Lease
                    Administration, the Administrator of Export Control, the Economic Defense Board, the Board of
                    Economic Warfare, the Foreign Economic Administration, and the Office of Foreign Relief and
                    Rehabilitation Operations.</p>
            <p>The last of the preliminary inventories to be considered here is that of the War Shipping
                    Administration records. This agency was established February 7, 1942, to control the operation,
                    purchase, charter, requisition, and use of all oceangoing vessels of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> except naval vessels and transports of the armed services. In addition to records of
                    the agency transferred to the National Archives before January 1, 1951, this inventory describes
                    those of its records inherited by the Maritime Administration of the Department of Commerce after
                    the termination of the War Shipping Administration, September 1, 1946.</p>

            <p>You may wonder what started me off on the search. It was a good deal like the old tale of the woman
                    who washed a spot off her kitchen wall and wound up by redecorating her whole house. I
                    didn't wake up one fine morning and say to myself, "This is a good day to start
                    work on a tome complete with bibliography and footnotes." Instead, I tamely thought it
                    would be a good idea to make labels for a couple of family portraits I'd inherited. Even
                    the idea for the labels wasn't original. When our children were young we used to rent a
                    house in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fairfield</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
               </placeName>, for the summer and in that house were a lot of antiques.
                    The owner of the house had put a tag on each of its heirlooms—sometimes inside the top
                    drawer of a highboy, sometimes on the under side of a cradle —giving the name and dates
                    of the original owner, and occasionally a bit of the heirloom's story.</p>
            <p>So it was that soon after the expressman left a pair of large portraits on my doorstep I thought
                    I'd imitate our landlady. All I knew about the pictures was that their subjects, a man in a
                    towering collar and a woman in a gauze headdress, had been my great-great-grandparents, and that
                    their names were John M'Coy and Jincy Collins M'Coy. Other tiny bits of
                    information were lodged in my memory, dust-laden with the years that had passed since my grandfather
                    told them to me. There was something about John M'Coy's having founded a college;
                    something else about his having killed a bear—and what man who lived a century and a half
                    ago didn't kill a bear!—and something further about Jincy Collins
                    M'Coy's having raised a flock of children. But the dates of their lives, the
                    circumstances under which they lived, even the name of the painter who'd made the
                    portraits, were blank.</p>

            <p>There may have been good fairies around my cradle; there was certainly one prankish one, for among
                    the traits she bestowed upon me is a curiosity that rivals that of the Elephant's Child.
                    Discovering that I knew almost nothing about these people was all it took to make me want to find
                    out a good lot.</p>
            <p>And because what I did discover came in a tumbled fashion, without the least regard for chronology or
                    sequence, may I shift it about and tell you, in fairly orderly fashion, what the search revealed? It
                    will help us all if, at the outset, you know what sort of man John M'Coy was, and why I
                    think he merits the mark of the real McCoy, that stamp of quality, be it applied to strong liquor or
                    a knockout punch or, as in his case, just to signify "tops."</p>
            <p>In the first place, he was a pioneer. He was born in a settler's fort in western <placeName>
                        <region reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> in 1782. He grew up in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> when that region was truly "dark and bloody ground." He was one of
                    the first settlers in Clark's Grant—and, if that name is unfamiliar to you, just
                    translate it into its modern equivalent, southern Indiana on the <geogName>Ohio
                    River</geogName>'s banks. He was a major in the War of 1812, a founder of Franklin College
                    and a champion of progress in education, in religion and in Indian affairs. He died at the age of
                    seventy-seven in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charlestown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in 1859.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, you see, M'Coy's life spanned the period between the end of the Revolution
                    and the beginning of the Civil War, a period of American history that was marked by great expansion
                    and swift progress. When he was born, there were just the thirteen original colonies; when he died
                    there were thirty-three states. Material progress? John M'Coy himself made the transition
                    from wearing buckskin to broadcloth; from traveling afoot or horseback to riding on trains. His era
                    was an exciting one, for while like Paul he could say (and this is what many a man whose birth took
                    place on the heels of the Revolution did say with pride): "I was born free," yet
                    the development of that freedom into more than words rested on those whose birthright it was.</p>
            <p>It has been said that men either mold their times or are molded by them. M'Coy was one of
                    the first group—finding his world far from ideal, he set himself to better it. Often

                    <pb n="401" id="VAA4025-047-4-085"/> his views ran contrary to those popularly accepted; but, once
                    he was convinced of the Tightness of an action, nothing could stop him from carrying it out. It was
                    not easy—men who work for progress have a way of being unpopular—but he
                    persisted. Added to the opposition he met from his contemporaries was a handicap that was peculiarly
                    his own: throughout his life he suffered from periodic migraine headaches. Anyone who has that same
                    trouble knows what a thorn in the flesh it is.</p>
            <p>In three specific fields John M'Coy worked unflaggingly: for higher education, for humane
                    treatment of the Indians and for an unselfish religion. His success is shown by the fact that some
                    of his aims have been accepted as such commonplaces of everyday life that they are taken for
                    granted. We assume that Indians are human beings and even think it a little laughable that they
                    should be considered vermin, yet in M'Coy's day to accept such a premise, and to
                    act upon it, called for courage. Then, too, many today have known the benefit of a college
                    education—yet in M'Coy's time his plans for a college were met with
                    scorn and ridicule. "Look at me," one of his neighbors might say, "all I
                    kin do is make my mark but the deeds I sign that-a-way are as good as if I'd writ the whole
                    works." Men on the frontier felt that a strong arm had it all over an educated mind, and
                    they were not slow to say so. As for M'Coy's championship of Sunday Schools,
                    missions, and a general distribution of religious texts, this championship brought him the hardest
                    fights of his entire life. Twice, because he stood firm on his principles of sharing his religion
                    with others by these means, he was excluded from his church—and exclusion, in those days,
                    meant about what excommunication does now.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In all his efforts for progress, and in their attainment, John M'Coy was, consciously or
                    unconsciously, helping make the America we know today. Christopher B. Coleman, late secretary of the
                    Indiana Historical Society, summed up his life in these words, "He is as good a
                    representative as could be found of the men, who, without making much noise or attaining political
                    fame, built up this commonwealth in the <list type="footnotes">

                    seventeen-year-old boy exclaimed after reading M'Coy's biography, "That
                    guy had guts!" I hope you'll agree that he merited the epithet, the real McCoy.</p>
            <p>Now that you have some idea of what the search revealed, let's see how the facts were found.
                    There were three main trails leading to the goal: printed records, personal papers like wills and
                    letters and diaries, and people. Having been trained as a librarian in methods of research, I found
                    that a map was already in my hand: my curiosity had a means of finding some of the answers to the
                    many questions it asked.</p>
            <p>And at the very start of my search I discovered one essential fact: John M'Coy
                    didn't live in a vacuum. None of us do. We're influenced by the times in which we
                    live, by our families, by our religious convictions (or the lack of them), and by the places with
                    which we're associated. In the case of this man, I quickly found that I was just as
                    ignorant as could be; in fact, I don't see how just one person could possibly have known so
                    little about so much. Among the topics on which I found it essential to inform myself were American
                    history, especially that of the pioneer period, McCoy genealogy, Baptist history (for John
                    M'Coy's life was interwoven inextricably with that of his church), and Indiana
                    affairs—to say nothing of the similar-sounding but quite different Indian affairs.</p>
            <p>Much of this I was able to find in printed sources. To Miss Leonora Patton of the George L. Pease
                    Memorial Library a debt of gratitude is due for patiently sending to out-of-town and even to
                    out-of-state libraries for some of the rare books in these various fields. Even with the privileges
                    of the interlibrary loan, however, it was impossible to get all the books needed, and consequently
                    it was necessary to visit a number of other libraries.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was from books, then, that it was possible to absorb enough of John M'Coy's
                    background to begin to understand the circumstances of his life. But what about the man himself? No
                    one had ever written about his career, save in fragments, and no one, so the Indiana State Library
                    informed me, <list type="footnotes">

                    him as an individual, I had to follow trails that sometimes came to a dead end, or that, in other
                    cases, branched out into a regular network of cow paths. These roads led, metaphorically speaking,
                    through old documents and through the personal recollections of many people.</p>
            <p>The first documents any competent biographer tries to find are a man's love letters. Why?
                    Not just to pry into the secrets of his tender moments but because in his love letters a man reveals
                    his character as he does in no other written form of expression. Ideals, ambitions,
                    shortcomings—all are shown more clearly in those letters than in any others a person
                    writes. And did I find John M'Coy's? I did not. The young woman he married was a
                    neighbor, there in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>; their courtship had the customary brevity of frontier days and the chances are a
                    hundred to one that John never wrote Jincy a line before they were married. So much for the most
                    fertile field of study of the character of a man. In M'Coy's case, that field just
                    didn't exist.</p>
            <p>Since there were no love letters, requests were directed to various members of the family for other
                    letters written by M'Coy, or to him. And out of those first few inquiries developed a
                    correspondence so varied and so far-flung that one of my cousins called me "The Lady Who
                    Lives in Her Mailbox." One relative would send the name of a sister who might have a few
                    facts; she in turn would refer me to a great-aunt, and so it went until letters were being exchanged
                    with people all over the country.</p>
            <p>What sort of people? The sort you'll find, if you look for them, in any long-established
                    American family: dozens of farmers' wives, doctors, a forest ranger, a saloonkeeper,
                    members of the clergy, insurance salesmen, teachers, railroad men, members of the D.A.R., students
                    (one of them was a Rhodes scholar), many who are "old and … nodding by the
                    fire," politicians, an undertaker's wife and members of the American Association
                    of University Women. Two of my favorite correspondents, a Catholic priest from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and a Choctaw Indian, wrote me only after the book was published, but there was enough
                    of a variety among the earlier ones to suit almost any taste.</p>
            <p>What did we write about? The first letter of inquiry was a generalized one, asking for information
                    about John <pb n="404" id="VAA4025-047-4-088"/> M'Coy. Later more specific questions were
                    asked. Among them were questions like these: What was the M'Coy hog brand? (And what
                    possible interest or bearing that could have on the man's biography it is difficult to say.
                    It's true that every family had its own particular hog brand, for hogs ran loose in the
                    early days, just as branded cattle do now on the western plains, and "a crop in the right
                    ear" or "three crops and a slit in the left ear" served to distinguish
                    John Jones's hogs from Henry Anderson's.) What happened to the third picture of
                    John M'Coy? (It was possible to locate only two, one being the oil painting, another a
                    daguerrotype—but his diary referred to a third.) Why did he wait until he was forty-two
                    to join a church? When did M'Coy make his first trip to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>? How did he travel? (It turned out that he went by river boat.) When and where did he
                    buy the piano he left to his daughter Eliza in his will? (The answer to that one: He acquired it
                    from an <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> steamboat that went on the rocks at the Falls of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, near his home.) The questions were as varied as the life of the man they concerned.</p>
            <p>When the correspondence piled up and the ramifications of the family began to be more than I could
                    carry in my head, I started a genealogical outline. That, too, was in the nature of the spot on the
                    kitchen wall. From a few notes set down on slips of paper, it has grown until now it has the makings
                    of a fairly complete genealogy of the descendants of James McCoy—John's
                    immigrant grandfather. Seventy-five hundred names are in it so far and it's still not
                    finished. You can see why "The Lady Who Lives in Her Mailbox" isn't a bad
                    name for me.</p>
            <p>Sometimes cousins trustingly sent their prized old papers without hesitation. One was a young woman
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> who forwarded a whole trunkful of them. The trunk itself was a handmade wooden chest,
                    first used by a son of John M'Coy when he went off to college about 1829. That son, by the
                    way, was the first Indiana Baptist to earn a degree— and he came off with an M.A.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> His wooden chest stayed in our dining room all winter; and, in the intervals

                            M'Coy is listed in that institution's first catalogue which was issued in
                            1831.</item>
               </list>
                    <pb n="405" id="VAA4025-047-4-089"/> I'd read handfuls of them. None were from John
                    M'Coy himself—in fact, by the end of the search no more than a dozen of his own
                    letters had come to light, and some of them were in a museum in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>—but among those old letters were a good many indirect references to him.</p>
            <p>For instance, in a letter written by an old, old lady there was an account of how, when she was a
                    little girl, she experienced an Indian raid. One dark night prowling Indians took advantage of the
                    absence of the father of the family—he was off fighting in the War of 1812—to
                    set fire to the flax that was piled in the dooryard, intending to invade the house and kill the
                    occupants when the flames were bright enough to light the massacre. The mother escaped out a side
                    door with her children, hiding them in the underbrush. Happily for the family, neighbors as well as
                    Indians saw the flames in the dark and came posthaste to drive off the attackers. No wonder it made
                    a vivid impression on the little girl, and no wonder that, as an old woman, she thought it a story
                    worth recounting. And what did it have to do with John M'Coy? Just this: it was he whose
                    home was attacked, and it was one of his daughters who never forgot the prancing silhouettes of the
                    marauding Indians.</p>
            <p>Other papers in that chest revealed much about John M'Coy's children: that there
                    were ten of them and that the brood Jincy mothered was augmented by her sister's motherless
                    flock. Little more is known of this pioneer mother, Jincy Collins M'Coy, beyond the odd
                    fact that she was not married until she was twenty-five; an age which, by pioneer standards, made
                    her an old maid, and that the orphans she raised "rose up and called her blessed."
                    She, as well as John M'Coy's own mother, were literate. And, if it appears odd
                    that this fact is mentioned, it should be noted that for a frontier woman to be able to write a
                    well-composed letter denoted almost as much in the way of educational privileges as the A.B. degree
                    does today. Truly, "the world do move," and women with it.</p>
            <p>The trunk was the largest item that a member of the family sent me, but there were smaller things
                    that also shed light on the real McCoy. One was the only personal description of him that remains.
                    It was written in 1884, twenty-five years after his death, to be sure, but while people who knew him
                    were still living. It described him as "tall, slender <pb n="406" id="VAA4025-047-4-090"/>
                    and homely." This scrap was forwarded by a doctor in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">San Bernardino</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It was months later when the original brief biographical sketch from which the
                    description had been taken was found, and it was discovered that the doctor's secretary had
                    miscopied it to the extent of changing one letter. That letter made quite a difference, for the
                    original description read, "tall, slender and comely." She'd transformed
                    the man from what today might be called "tall, dark and handsome" into a fellow
                    like Ichabod Crane.</p>
            <p>Some of my correspondents were less trusting than those just mentioned. For example, there was a
                    banker in <placeName>
                        <region reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>. He ignored my first letter so I wrote him again, mentioning that I was acquainted with
                    someone in his city; in fact, I'd been her guest recently. His reply came by air mail.
                    "Here's the information you want," he said. "Why didn't
                    you tell me you knew Laura Miller? She was my first Sunday School teacher and anyone she takes under
                    her roof <hi rend="i">must</hi> be all right."</p>
            <p>Another distant cousin, this time from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, sent a full transcript of the records in her old family Bible, but attached to the
                    transcript was a notarized statement that these records were not for publication. Under those
                    circumstances, they did little good but eventually it was possible to get her consent to use them.</p>
            <p>Then there was another midwest cousin who wrote, "Anything you can do to add lustre to the
                    McCoy name will suit me fine. I'm sick and tired of being asked if I've killed any
                    Hatfields lately." It was possible to reassure this cousin, for thanks to research done by
                    William Woodson Harris, it has been proved that the McCoy family of which John M'Coy was a
                    member had no relation to that of the Hatfield-McCoy feud.</p>
            <p>Now and then one of the correspondents would refer obliquely to the diary of John M'Coy. No
                    one, however, admitted ever having seen it or knowing its whereabouts. It was only by chance that it
                    was discovered, right in the keeping of my own aunt, Mrs. Lafayette Hillis. She waited to make sure
                    that I was seriously interested in gathering material about John M'Coy, then she sent it to
                    me, from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>, one Christmas. Never did Santa Claus bring a gift that was more truly "just
                    what I wanted." All my explorations, up to that time, had uncovered no more than
                    half-a-dozen pages in <pb n="407" id="VAA4025-047-4-091"/> John M'Coy's own
                    handwriting. Here, at one clip, were hundreds of pages of his own records. The discovery of that
                    diary brought the realization that I'd come a good way from my original idea of just
                    writing out a label.</p>
            <p>Diaries vary with the individuality of the person who writes them. This one, every word of which was
                    legible, was the day-by-day record of a man between sixty-five and sixty-nine years of age, written
                    when his active life was largely over. Even so, it revealed so much of the detail of the live of his
                    times that even to my non-professional eyes it was an important historical document. The Indiana
                    State Library confirmed my guess, offering to finance having the diary put on microfilm. The
                    library's object was to preserve the diary against possible loss and also to make it
                    available to researchers. I had the interesting experience, then new to me, of supervising the
                    making of the microfilm. Copies of it were ordered by various large libraries across the country,
                    after which, to my chagrin, I proceeded to lose the negative in the mail. It wasn't done
                    "with malice aforethought" but it ended the microfilm production abruptly. Now, of
                    course, the text of that diary is incorporated in <hi rend="i">John M'Coy: His Life and His
                        Diaries</hi> so there is no need of a microfilm.</p>
            <p>The diary is a source of historical information because few diaries of the place and period are
                    available, and more and more, historians are coming to value the social history which such records
                    afford. Written on the spot, they make up for their neglect of big topics by their wealth of detail
                    about small ones.</p>
            <p>An instance of what M'Coy's diary showed is his incidental mention of income and
                    expense. His diary is no account book, but from its pages can be reconstructed one man's
                    scale of living and what it cost him to maintain it. The diary shows that in 1851, just a century
                    ago, a man could live comfortably in retirement on an income of less than two hundred dollars a
                    year. Before you sigh for the Good Old Days, let me add that he had to pay a tax bill of
                    $36.73, about eighteen per cent of his entire income. And even by today's
                    yardstick, that proportion is fairly high. But think of a man's clothing costing only
                    $17.50 for a whole year, even though it included a pair of tailor-made trousers (which
                    M'Coy called "pantaloons") and—supreme luxury— <pb n="408" id="VAA4025-047-4-092"/> a black silk cravat and matching pocket handkerchief, for
                    $2.30.</p>
            <p>With one diary in my possession, that inborn curiosity of which I've spoken drove me to try
                    harder than ever to find the others—for there was clear internal evidence that there were
                    others. By baiting a great many hooks and pulling in the lines at the slightest twitch, I did find
                    two more. There were five of John M'Coy's diaries in all, covering the last
                    seventeen years of his life. Those that eventually came to light were the first, third, and
                    fifth—the second and fourth may have gone up in flames during some good
                    housekeeper's spring cleaning, or they may have floated off in an <geogName>Ohio
                    River</geogName> flood—it was on the banks of that stream that M'Coy and his
                    immediate family spent much of their lives. Even the publication of the book about M'Coy
                    has brought no sign of those missing diaries, as I hoped it might. Copies of the book have been
                    bought in practically every state in the Union and dozens of its readers have communicated with me.
                    None, however, have known anything about the two still-missing links. I do know that as late as 1920
                    one of them was Deep in the Heart of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>, but even though I've visited that state and made many inquiries there,
                    it's never come to light.</p>
            <p>The other two diaries that did materialize were both given me because a member of the family had met
                    me and become convinced that I could be trusted to return them. For instance, a cousin
                    who's on the staff of a hospital in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> came out to have a picnic with our family one day while the search for the real McCoy
                    was in progress. She must have sent a good report back to her <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> kinfolks, for the next thing—up popped a second diary from that quarter. All
                    the persuasive letters which had been written to that branch of the family had brought not so much
                    as a hint of the diary: a single personal contact gave the needed assurance.</p>
            <p>The surrender of the third diary came about in a different way, but again through a personal meeting.
                    One summer my husband and I took our then-small daughter with us on an <geogName>Ohio
                    River</geogName> trip. We followed the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>'s me-anderings aboard the "Gordon C. Greene," a typical
                    river boat, from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>. When we reached <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where we were to wait over a day before the return <pb n="409" id="VAA4025-047-4-093"/> trip, I remarked casually that some of my far-flung cousins lived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Piqua</settlement>
                    </placeName>, whereupon my husband said, "Let's call them up and see if
                    they're at home." We did, they were, and so we hired a drive-yourself car and rode
                    through the pleasant <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> countryside to Piqua. There I met for the first time a cousin, Maysel Davis, who later
                    became a firm friend and a hearty supporter of the search for the real McCoy. That day we visited
                    her she brought down boxes of old papers from her attic—boxes that had much to interest
                    me in their contents. And later, after we got back to Ridgewood, came a letter saying she'd
                    persuaded her brother, an Indiana man, to lend me his treasured diary.</p>
            <p>Through such personal contacts it was possible to gather some of the facts about John M'Coy.
                    A cousin in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, a Presbyterian minister, helped to identify the artist who painted those portraits
                    that set me off on the search. While it isn't a hard-and-fast fact, for the portraits are
                    unsigned, there is a strong probability that they are the work of Matthew Harris Jouett, a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> artist who was a pupil of Gilbert Stuart. His work is highly valued and even within the
                    last year some of his paintings, including one of John M'Coy's brother Isaac, were
                    pictured in <hi rend="i">Town and Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then there was Grace Marshall who, at the time of her sudden death, was a candidate for
                    president-general of the D.A.R. She knew of my interest in her family and drove over from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> to call on me. She shared with me the results of her search of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> records, including a full copy of the will of John M'Coy's
                    great-grandfather, John Bruce. Others who called were a French teacher from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName>, an official of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> Automobile Association, and a charming young woman from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the most valuable personal contact of all was with the aunt in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>, the one who gave me her own copy of a diary. We had never been close while I was
                    growing up, largely due to the accident of geography, but as we wrote back and forth about the
                    progress of the search, we became so. It ended by Mrs. Hillis' paying us a
                    visit—her only trip east—and by my going to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Wichita</settlement>
                    </placeName> to help take care of her when she was seriously ill. Her interest in the search for the
                    real McCoy grew by leaps and bounds, and I am indebted to her for much help with it. Until her
                    health failed, she made forays in the midwest for me and even after she was <pb n="410" id="VAA4025-047-4-094"/> no longer able to travel she used her influence with other members of
                    the tribe on my behalf. She was a childless widow with comparatively few demands on her time and as
                    her interest in the story of John M'Coy developed she became more and more eager to see it
                    finished. Although she didn't live to see the book in print she did read the completed
                    manuscript and hers were among the first words of commendation it evoked.</p>
            <p>There were times, of course, during the search when I wondered if it were worth all the trouble and
                    expense. Mrs. Hillis' encouragement helped to pull me out of the Slough of Despond, and
                    then, after the first chapter was written, another lift came. A distant cousin—distant in
                    space as well as in degree of relationship—wrote that he'd heard I'd
                    gathered the story of the start of our McCoys in this country, and offered me twenty-five dollars
                    for the privilege of reading the single chapter then completed. What's more the check was
                    enclosed with the letter. It was the first sign that anyone might care enough about the material to
                    pay for it, and it was a spur.</p>
            <p>And so, a little at a time, the story of John M'Coy's life crossed my desk. True,
                    there were gaps in it—there still are. One of them concerns his second marriage. Jincy
                    Collins M'Coy died at the age of fifty-seven, a victim of tuberculosis, the same disease
                    that carried off her sister and left that sister's children for her to raise. Five years
                    later her husband married again, but his second wife, Elinor Finley, lived only a short time. What
                    she was like, where she came from, who her people were, remain unsolved mysteries. A greater riddle
                    is why John M'Coy's children never referred to her, nor did he himself in the
                    diaries written after her death. The full story is one I hoped might come to light with the
                    publication of the book, but like the missing diaries it remains lost in limbo.</p>
            <p>Another gap is how M'Coy felt about slavery. The conflict over it was brewing throughout the
                    years in which he kept his diaries, yet there is not the slightest indication in them of his feeling
                    on the matter. His three brothers, with whom he was on the best of terms, were strong in their
                    feeling that slavery was wrong, and if he differed with them it is the only instance in which they
                    did not see eye-to-eye on a question of morals. Two of those brothers left wills that <pb n="411" id="VAA4025-047-4-095"/> showed how strongly they felt on the subject. Isaac McCoy wrote in his
                    will that he was the owner of a young slave woman and her children, having bought them out of pity
                    lest the family be divided. He left explicit instructions that the slave children were to be given
                    the same kind of education as his own, and at the expense of his estate, while the mother was to be
                    given her freedom as soon as she had worked long enough for her wages to balance her purchase price.
                    Another brother, Royce McCoy, wrote a letter of sound advice to his children. In it are these words:
                    "Never, my dear children, stain your hands with the blood of the poor oppressed negroes.
                    That is, take no part in oppressing them, in buying, selling or hiring them, and let not one cent
                    come into your possession by the traffic in them." And in his will he provided that a small
                    sum of money that was due him, his share of an inheritance that came from the sale of a slave, was
                    to be multiplied by four and used either to buy that slave's freedom or as a contribution
                    to one of the antislavery organizations, the American Colonization Society.</p>
            <p>Perhaps there is a sound reason for John M'Coy's strange silence on this subject.
                    There were, on the Indiana side of the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>, stations on the underground
                    railway which was used by escaping slaves. Remember Eliza crossing the ice? It is barely possible
                    that M'Coy had a part in helping those fugitive slaves. Perhaps some of the
                    innocent-sounding recurrent expressions he used in his diaries, expressions such as "tended
                    to some little domestic affairs," were his code for activities having to do with the
                    underground railway.</p>
            <p>Much material was gathered by mail and through visitors, but not all the facts about M'Coy
                    came to me while I sat like a spider in the middle of her web. There was other material, much of it
                    quite important, that necessitated traveling. I visited some sixteen libraries and historical
                    institutions, scattered from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>; I searched in courthouses and in old cemeteries and, finally, I visited a number of
                    the scattered cousins who'd written me. The courthouses were often, to put it bluntly,
                    drafty and smelly; the old cemeteries had briars that snagged my stockings, but the cousins were a
                    real delight.</p>
            <p>One trip took me to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where I consulted the National Archives and two other libraries. To a researcher, the
                    National Archives is like a dream come true. Once the <pb n="412" id="VAA4025-047-4-096"/> hurdle of
                    gaining a card of admission is past, using that collection of important documents is like using the
                    very finest private library. Each user, for instance, is assigned a private desk, well lighted,
                    comfortable and—as a crowning attention—equipped with the particular make of
                    typewriter he is accustomed to use at home. The staff is just as outstanding as the equipment;
                    courteous, intelligent, thoroughly familiar with the resources of this great public collection of
                    historic documents.</p>
            <p>I was working primarily with the pension records of men of the McCoy family who had fought in the
                    three wars that had a special bearing on John M'Coy's life—his sons and
                    grandsons, by the way, served on both sides of the conflict that is known to some as the War Between
                    the States and to others as the Civil War. One surprising feature of the pledge one must sign to
                    work with these pension records is a statement that you will keep secret anything you uncover that
                    may be to the detriment of a soldier. Naively, I asked what could appear in the records, other than
                    desertion, to injure a man's reputation. The man behind the desk looked up and said wryly,
                    "There <hi rend="i">is</hi> such a thing as a soldier's having illegitimate
                    children, you know." After that warning I was relieved, I confess, to find that all the
                    little McCoys named in their father's pension applications were born in wedlock.</p>
            <p>The Indiana State Library and the William Henry Smith Memorial Library of the Indiana Historical
                    Society are other institutions for which I have a warm admiration. Before visiting there,
                    I'd corresponded with members of the staff, and had received many courtesies from them,
                    but, even so, I wasn't prepared for the warmth of the welcome I received in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>At some of the institutions visited, the staff's attitude was clearly that of,
                    "Well, some people have queer tastes, and here's one of the queerest."
                    And at others I was made to feel that I was something that ought to be swept under the rug. Doing an
                    extended research project isn't all free lunches!</p>
            <p>In complete contrast to the institutions just mentioned —but not specifically
                    named—was the red carpet welcome received at the Dallas Museum. I went there to examine
                    some family papers that are kept in a locked vault. One of <pb n="413" id="VAA4025-047-4-097"/> John
                    M'Coy's sons, his namesake, in fact, was a founder of Dallas and consequently
                    anything pertaining to him is valued by the city. The archivist was as cordial and helpful as could
                    be, and so was the director of the Dallas Historical Society, Herbert Gambrell.</p>
            <p>Another excursion took me to Franklin, Indiana, the seat of the college that John M'Coy
                    helped to found in 1834. Franklin is small and its costs are low, but its standards are high. It is
                    fully accredited, nationally as well as regionally.</p>
            <p>Thinking that it might add to the story of M'Coy to discover what the college he worked so
                    hard to establish had grown to be, I asked the administrative offices for a guide. The head of the
                    English department was assigned and together we toured the buildings and the campus. Then I inquired
                    about the college's collection of nineteenth century periodicals. It's an odd fact
                    that small midwestern college has material in that field that is absolutely unmatched. No other
                    copies of some of the periodicals it owns are to be found anywhere else at all, not even in the
                    Library of Congress or the British Museum. And so it was that the professor, a muscular man as well
                    as a good-tempered one, spent a large part of one Sunday afternoon lugging big damp volumes off the
                    library's basement shelves. Why <hi rend="i">damp?</hi> Because there'd been a
                    flood in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> that spring and the pages of those extremely rare volumes were still wet with the
                    waters of that flood. It was well for their preservation that those periodicals were printed on
                    durable rag paper. In their pages was much material valuable for my purpose—stories,
                    written while the events they chronicled were actually happening, of how John M'Coy and
                    those few who agreed with him were struggling against ignorance and even having the hardihood to
                    establish such a college as Franklin.</p>
            <p>And so it was that the search for the real McCoy drew to its close—or as much so as the
                    story of a real person ever can be said to be finished. There were enough facts to build up a story
                    of John M'Coy's life on sound evidence; there were transcripts of hundreds of
                    pages of the diaries he'd kept, together with a mass of identifying notes; there were maps
                    and pictures and a family chart to illustrate the story. In dutiful librarian-fashion I'd
                    prepared a bibliography as well as an index. All that was lacking was a publisher, and then, thanks
                    to the suggestion of Howard Peckham of the <pb n="414" id="VAA4025-047-4-098"/> Indiana Historical
                    Bureau, even that gap was filled. With the publication of <hi rend="i">John M'Coy: His Life
                        and His Diaries</hi>, the search came to its end. It started small, like the spot on the kitchen
                    wall, and it ended, not with a fine, fresh, newly-redecorated house, but with a five hundred page
                    tome.</p>
