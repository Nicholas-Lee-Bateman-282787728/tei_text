                    It seems like the more smilin' an' cheerful folks are th' more ther teeth
                        need lookin' after.
                    We've certainly improved in side steppin' since th' ole three-wheel
                        velocipede wuz regarded as a menace t' pedestrians.

                    Ever once in a while somebuddy is carted off t' th' poor house who used t' be
                        the best dancer in town.
                    Some folks are called green when they're only respectable.
                    What has become o' all th' child wonders we used t' know in school?
                    Mrs. Birdie Moon, whose brilliant weddin' wuz th' event o' th' Yuletide,
                        would like t' trade some silver sugar trays fer a ton o' coal.
                    Goin' t' work will be found twice as profitable as knockin' th' rich.
                    
                    We never respect our own gray hairs.
                    No matter how hard th' times git th' wages o' sin are allus liberal an' on
                        th' dot.
                    Politics makes strange pustmasters.
                    No matter what kind of a spring we have, it seems like th' crop of
                        originality is allus short.

                    Th' Lost Art o' Letter Writin'
                    By Miss Fawn Lippincut
                    In these days o' quick an' handy communication how refreshin' it is t'
                        receive a real letterï¿½a long, well composed, interestin' handmade letter
                        with a little personality an' feelin' in it.
                    Th' telephone an' lettergram. t'gether with souvenir pustal cards showin'
                        Main streets, public libraries, mountain peaks an' state houses, have all
                        worked shoulder t' shoulder t' discourage th' gentle art o' letter writin.
                        Th' ole longhand letters o' th' past, whether passin' between friends or
                        lovers, scented or unscented, reflected th' real inside works o' th' author
                        as could no other medium o' communication. A misspelled word wuz not
                        regarded as a matter of course, but looked upon as a grave error not t' be
                        passed o'er lightly. Th' laws o' punctuation, too, wuz lived up t' an'
                        respected.
                    T'day th' loved one who crosses th' plains an' leaves a two-column void in
                        th' anxious hearts behind does little t' relieve th' anxiety  in th' rear beyond sendin' a few views o'
                        Pike's Peak or th' Mormon Temple. How an' ole time twenty-page descriptive
                        letter written 
                            CONSULTIN' TH' READY LETTER WRITER IN 1878
                         with a pen an' ink would cheer th' fond an' lovin' mother as she
                        watches thro' th' kitchen window fer th' postman t' cut across th' flower
                        beds t' th' back door.
                    
                    Th' Ready Letter Writer, a handy guide t' correspondence, appeared in th'
                        early seventies an' its popularity wuz only rivaled by that o' th' conch
                        shell, which had become an established favorite in th' home. It told how t'
                        write a letter requestin' an interview with any young lady you might happen
                        t' admire; how a widower should profess his attachment fer a widow; how t'
                        confess an unfavorable conclusion after serious reflection: how t' write a
                        letter accompanyin' a contribution t' a clergyman; how t' accept th' gift o'
                        a comb an' brush by mail; how t' write a letter accompanyin' th' gift o' a
                        gold pen or a coral bracelet; how t' write a letter of advice t' a gentleman
                        who contemplates leavin' th' farm, an' other matters requirin' delicate
                        handlin'. Follerin' is a sample letter lifted from Th' Ready Letter Writer,
                        supposedly from a young gentleman t' a young lady o' whom he has become
                        enamored at first sight:

                                            April 10, 1870.
                                        
                                        Dear Miss Maitland:
                                    
                                    No doubt you will be at a loss t' guess who th' writer of
                                        this letter is. I confess that takin' this method o'
                                        addressin' one whom I have met but once, is rather a rude
                                        one; but not knowin' when I should see you agin, if ever, I
                                        ventured upon this plan of informin' you that the impression
                                        produced by your charmin' disposition, amiability an'
                                        accomplishments is a most pleasin' remembrance, an' if I
                                        mistake not, a lastin' one. If by your kind permission. an'
                                        th' approval o' your parents, I shall be granted th'
                                        privilege t' wait upon you, th' writin' o' this letter will
                                        never be regretted. I am well an' I hope these few lines
                                        will find you th' same.
                                    
                                        From your admirer, Clarence Van
                                            Sickle.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    Note th' excellent English, th' faultless composition an' th' true ring o'
                        sincerity an' genuineness in th' foregoin'. Note how trite an' unmistakable
                        th' writer expresses th' feelin'  that burns
                        within him, at th' same time spell-in' Amiability right an' supplyin' th'
                        required number o' d's in Addressin'. Study th' letter from ever' angle an'
                        then try t' imagine what a girl o' th' present generation would do t'
                        Clarence Van Sickle.
                    How th' love letters o' yisterday gushed with love an' sentiment! T'day th'
                        affairs o' th' heart are breathed by word o' mouth or handled o'er th'
                        'phone. We seem t' be afraid t' put 'em down in black an' white lest they
                        git in th' courts.
                    Once in a long while some feller retires from th' poultry business instead o'
                        quittin'.
                    Lafe Bud says th' most difficult thing about bein' a Progressive is keepin'
                        off th' ticket.
                
                
                
                    
                        Bstands fer barber, suave an' debonair, Who never hones
                        his razor till you git in his chair.
                    The cooler a fat man dresses th' hotter he looks.
                    A bad cold wouldn' be so annoyin' if it wuzn' fer th' advice of our
                        friends.
                    In th' days before th' phonergraph an player pianner a feller could visit his
                        friends in safety.
                    It must be great t' be rich an' let th' other feller keep up appearances.
                    
                    Th' half-frozen look now bein' worn by th' girls is about th' most unbecomin'
                        fad they've adopted so fer.
                    When a speaker begins his remarks by sayin' "I'm not goin' t' take up th'
                        valuable time o' this convention," you kin git ready t' be bored.
                    If Carnegie wants t' die poor why don't he start a cash grocery.
                
                
                
                    Th' Nose an' Its Relation t' Character
                    By Dr. Mopps
                    As th' month o' June draws nigh th' prospective bride should take a few
                        moments each day from her talcum powder an' devote 'em t' sober reflection.
                        Th' step she is plannin' t' take is th' real big headliner act of her life.
                        Let her consider it well. Let her study th' teachin's o' th' world's
                        greatest physiognomists, whose theories are interwoven with th' findin's o'
                        ever' known science, before she leaves th' ole home, or resigns her downtown
                        job. Let her take up nose readin' durin' th' few golden weeks that
                        remain.
                    I wonder how many girls o' t'day who are filled with rose-tinted visions o' a
                        happy married life know that th' septum o' th' nose is th' partition between
                        th' nostrils? I wonder how many girls o' t'day who are countin' th' minutes
                        till th' month o' roses know that ther whole future happiness depends on th'
                        thickness o' her fiance's septum an' its inclination t' droop or not droop?
                        If his septum is thin an'  not disposed t'
                        droop let her take warnin' ere it is too late, fer it is a never failin'
                        sign of a retired liver. Tho' th' breakin' o' her engagement 
                            CLOSE RANGE STUDY OF TH' NOSE
                         may embitter her fiance's life an' cause her many a heart ache, it
                        will be better fer both, as her alliance with an inactive liver  would mean nothin' better than a life filled
                        with misery an' regret.
                    Th' nose is nature's most humble organ next t' th' big toe. Th' whole human
                        character is boldly written thereon so that even she who runs may read.
                        Ther's no reason fer any-buddy but a blind girl gittin' stung. Whether th'
                        nose is pale, red or veined, it is now regarded as th' only reliable index
                        to character.
                    Ideality, veneration, constructiveness, cautiousness, mental imitation,
                        sublimity an' especially acquisitiveness (a disposition t' acquire property,
                        money, etc.,) are all factors in th' success o' life which may be easily
                        read in th' nose, an' which should be carefully considered by ever' girl
                        before she signs away her happiness.
                    Th' upper lip may be a perfect cupid's bow an' full o' amativeness, or th'
                        lower lip may be thick with a desire t' promote happiness, but neither
                        indicate anything in th' way o' makin' a livin'.
                    Th' eyes, long regarded as th' windows o' th' soul an' th' true index o'
                        character, are  worthless without a gilt edged
                        nose. A fullness o' th' upper an' soft part o' th' cheek o'er th' malar bone
                        is another overworked sign that counts fer nothin' when appearin' in
                        conjunction with a thin septum. A square nose indicates a well developed
                        conscience, which is all well an' good if th' accompanyin' septum is of
                        standard gauge. Th' septum is th' thing whether th' nose is concave or
                        convex.
                    Fullness an' breadth o' th' nose above th' nostrils indicate a capacity fer
                        gittin' th' goodsï¿½a quality too rarely considered before wedlock, but
                        later regarded as bein' of inestimable value in th' pursuit o' happiness.
                        Such a quality, too, avails but little, however, if th' septum is thin.
                    O' course, its purty hard t' associate any sentiment with th' nose no matter
                        how close we occasionally git t' it, but jest th' same if th' prospective
                        bride while holdin' hands, 'll jest make a careful analysis o' her finance's
                        nose while ther' is yit time it may be th' means o' savin' her th'
                        embarrassment o' th' pale, hungry expression that is t' be found all too  often on th' faces o' those who have sought
                        happiness at th' altar o' love.
                    What's become o' th' ole time farmer who used t' give each of his children a
                        calf when they became of age?
                    If it wuzn' fer th' fellers who "intend t' put it back t'morrow" who'd keep

                    Some fellers chaw a se-gar like th' bit wuz under ther tongue.

                    Th' Passin' o' Whiskers
                    By Ex-Editur Cale Fluhart
                    It haint been so many years ago since you could stand on th' corner an' come
                        purty close t' guessin' ever' feller's age who passed along by th' cut o'
                        his jib. O' course our estimates were based largely on th' length an' style
                        o' whiskers. T'day whiskers are th' exception an' th' feller who throws
                        himself on th' tender mercies of a capable barber kin easily pass fer
                        thirty-two till he's seventy-nine.
                    In th' ole days when whiskers wuz th' hight o' ever' feller's ambition
                        nobuddy wuz ever taken seriously until they showed unmistakable evidence o'
                        ther ability t' grow a beard. After a feller raised a full set o' crisp
                        glossy whiskers, either red or black, he at once became eligible t' discuss
                        th' most momentous questions, either national or international Whiskers
                        denoted a mature mind. Professional men cultivated them in large bunches.
                        Sideburns wuz in high favor. Sometimes they were under control an' sometimes
                        they were  allowed t' foller ther own
                        inclinations. Full sets were all th' rage with medical men, an' no family
                        doctor could expect t' enjoy th' full

                         confidence of his patients unless he had all th' space on his face
                        under cultivation except his nose an' forehead A teller's ability wuz
                        measured by th' length o' his whiskers, an' 
                        When they wuz streaked with grey his judgment wuz supposed t' be ripe an'
                        ready t' pull.
                    Once in a while some feller wuz darin' enough t' wear a smooth face, but he
                        wuz soon drowned out o' th' conversation. If a young bare faced squirt
                        proposed t' a girl she would call him fer his presumption an' say: "Begone!
                        When you kin show me a neat velvety mustache I'll talk business, but not
                        until." A girl used t' believe that a feller that could work up t' a firm,
                        evenly spaced mustache could easily master all th' later problems in
                        life.
                    A few architects still stick t' th' ole time Van Dykes an' we occasionally
                        meet a government employe who stands defiantly under th' civil service laws
                        wearin' a hedge. Th' trailin' arbutus, or Wild Bill mustache, is almost
                        extinct. It wuz undermined above th' lip an' allowed t' droop from either
                        corner o' th' mouth after th' fashion o' cypress moss. In some sections
                        where land sells fer eighty cents per acre we not infrequently encounter
                        human bein's wearin' a tangled mass interspersed with cow licks. Virgin
                        forests o' th' face as it wereï¿½beards  that
                        have never been disciplined or felt th' keen edge o' th' razor.
                    Within th' year a party o' surveyors wuz choppin its way thro' th' hills o'
                        southern Indianny when it came upon a feller wearin' neatly trimmed chin
                        whiskers with th' hair line dropped fully an inch below th' lower lip, th'
                        intervenin' space bein' carefully parked. Otherwise th' feller seemed
                        intelligent enough an' asked many questions showin' that he took a weekly
                        paper.
                    But th' American continent is fast loosin' its whiskers an' let us hope that
                        no effort will be made t' conserve th' last shaggy remnant.
                    Jest give some fellers plenty o' t'backer an' they'll tell you th' country
                        wuz never as prosperous.

                    Eats
                    By Dr. Mopps
                    Th' great national curse t'day is over-eatin'. We do not only eat too much,
                        but we devote too much time thinkin' about eatin'. Some of us eat alone in
                        peace while others eat at home; some of us prefer t' dine al fresco where
                        th' elbows will have th' freedom of a snare drummer's, an' others prefer th'
                        secluded corner o' some cafe where they kin gargle ther soup t' music under
                        a pale green light; some folks like t' dine a la carte, while others go in
                        fer a table de hote dinner an' loaf over a dry Martini in happy anticipation
                        o' what's t' come; fer others th' long boardin' house table with its
                        pyramids o' boiled messes has its charmsï¿½where you kin reach pro an' con
                        like a Swiss bell ringer, an' where th' scandal o' th' day is passed around
                        with th' butter an' th' tooth-picks.
                    Ever'where we look there's a eatin' place. In the corridors o' our great
                        sky-scrapers we find th' lunch counter. Wherever ther's population  enough t' fill a few stools we find a great
                        brazen coffee urn an' a stack o' buns. It's interestin' t' watch a little
                        dried up feller all schrooched down in a one-arm chair listlessly stirrin' a
                        mug o' coffee while he munches a large sticky coil an' studies th' fantastic
                        patterns in th' tile floor. Th' first thing a stranger does when he gits in
                        a town is t' look fer a good resturint, an' th' only thing he remembers
                        about th' town in after years is th' coffee. Many folks form ther impression
                        o' a city by it's coffee. Th' best advertisement in th' world fer any town
                        is good coffee. Th' only thing some folks ever associate with th' delights
                        o' country life is fried chicken. An' th' only thing some folks ever see in
                        th' grandeur o' our autumnal colorin' is th' oyster season, Th' sublime
                        beauty o' winter, when all nature wears a mantle o' glistenin' white, is
                        entirely lost on some folks because succotash is out o' season. Instead o'

                        is not complete unless we top it off with a dinner fit fer a tiger. Even
                        when we return from a business trip or a weddin',  or a visit t' Aunt Lide or t' Paris er Rome, th' first question
                        we're asked is "How wuz th' eats?"

                        semiannual good humors an' proceeds with caution, a charmin' half hour's
                        entertainment is assured him. Since th' ravages o' time have disqualified
                        th' Professor fer further activity in musical affairs he has grown sullen,

                    Th' Newspaper
                    By Tell Binkley
                    What's become o' th' ole feller who used t' boast that he didn' read no
                        newspapers an' that he jest knowed what he knowed?
                    Th' country used t' be filled with such folks. They were sot in ther ways an'
                        they thought that ther wuz some ketch t' a newspaper. But they believed
                        ever' thing they heard an' half o' ever'thing they seen. While ther wuz lots
                        o' ignorance, th' bliss wuz o' poor quality. T'day th' daily newspaper
                        penetrates ever' nook an' corner in th' land carryin' with it th' news o'
                        th' world, t'gether with th' council proceedin's o' Kokomo, pictures o'
                        leadin' club women an' recipes fer creamed carrots.
                    Some folks subscribe fer a daily newspaper, some borrow it jest t' read,
                        while others take it. Ever 'buddy gits hold o' a daily newspaper somehow,
                        Even th' farmer who lives ten miles off th' pike wants his news while it's
                        hot. It gives him somethin' t' discuss besides a new calf when he gathers
                        his family about  him in th' evenin'. Th' daily
                        newspaper takes a society woman's mind off her finger nails an' causes th'
                        purple magnate t' ponder as he sets all spread out in his easy chair after
                        th' day's manipulations. No matter who you are or where you live there is no
                        reason in th' world why you should not be able t' talk glibly an' without
                        hesitation on the affairs o' the world. Even in towns o' three bread boxes
                        an' a few sparrows th' most caloused lounger kin discuss th' complicated
                        condition of European affairs. He knows when sumbuddy presents President
                        Wilson with a ten pound sweet p'tater an' he kin talk fluently about four
                        murder cases at once.
                    In th' ole days folks in the cross road towns use to worry along an' wait fer
                        a weekly newspaper an' then all th' out-o'-town news they'd git wuz a
                        lumbago ad from Boston. Th' daily newspaper has been th' principal factor in
                        th' development o' this country. It's civilizin' influences have changed our
                        whole style o' pitchin' an' filled us with ambition an' pride.
                    There's no prettier sight than th' modern 
                        family (when it is possible t' git its members t'gether fer an hour) settin'
                        around a cozy grate devourin' th' contents o' a daily newspaper. 
                            "WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS!"
                         Mother skims over th' burglaries an' settles down t' th' soap ads,
                        while father expresses hearty approval on th' Monroe doctrine. Th' boys
                        argue o'er th' Giants and Athletics,  while th'
                        girls set on th' blue plush davenport an' knock ever'buddy in th' society
                        column.
                    It's impossible t' estimate th' value o' newspaper publicity fer good. It
                        drags th' four flusher int' th' limelight an' keeps th' spineless public
                        servant on th' job. While ther's still some things in this country that
                        don't jest exactly come up t' our ideas we should thank th' daily newspaper
                        that we're permitted t' breathe.
                    No normally constituted feller kin read a daily newspaper without
                        congratulatin' himself that he haint in jail or a candidate fer office.

                    Our Appallin' Literary Output
                    By Miss Fawn Lippincut
                    When we look at th' great mass o' literature that tests th' capacity o'
                        bookstores an' newsstands we can't help thinkin' what a scramble ther must
                        be fer even standin' room in th' field o' literature. Most anybuddy roundin'
                        forty kin easily remember th' day when two or three family story papers, a
                        couple o' magazines, a stock o' Ned Buntline's yeller backs, an illustrated
                        pink weekly devoted t' crime an' th' prize ring an' "Lovell's Library"
                        constituted what wuz regarded at th' time as a first class book an' news
                        depot. "Lovell's Library" wuz made up of paper backed novelsï¿½thrillin'
                        stories of adventure an' heart meltin' tales o' loveï¿½by such celebrated
                        writers as Wilkie Collins, Clark Russell, Mrs. Henry Wood. Ouida, Hugh
                        Conway, Charlotte Braeme, Robert Buchanan an' Th' Duchess. Th' great
                        popularity o' Adam Bede, Th' Mill on th' Floss, Black Beauty, Lena Rivers,
                        Uncle Tom's Cabin, Robinson Crusoe an' Enoch 
                        Arden had dwindled t' a fair demand, but were t' be found among th'
                        others.
                    Jest think o' th' apallin' literary output o' 
                            A LITERARY DISPOSAL PLANT IN OPERATION
                         t'day. It would require an abandoned skatin' rink t' carry a full
                        line o' current literature. In th' average home th' cartin' away o' th'
                        accumulated literature has come t' be as much 
                        of a problem as th' removal o' ashes an' garbage. A literary disposal plant
                        is one o' th' urgent needs o' th' times. On returnin' from a week's vacation
                        one has t' tunnel thro' th' great drifts o' papers an' magazines t' reach
                        th' front door.
                    Ther's no longer any mystery about how th' other half o' th' world lives. It
                        writes. Fer ever' mail box ther's an amateur writer. As th' day draws t' a
                        close he may be seen skulkin' along thro' th' shadows t' a mail box bearin'
                        a thick reel o' manuscript addressed t' some magazine publisher. He knows
                        some magazine needs it t' balance up its advertisin.' When a magazine editur
                        returns a manuscript it's because he hain't got room fer it. It's no sign he
                        has read it. Writers know that. They jest remail it t' some other editor.
                        Th' great difficulty in contributin' t' th' magazines is knowin' which
                        magazine needs your stuff. When a magazine editur rips open a story he
                        counts th' pages an' calls t' his assistant: "George, kin we use about
                        twenty-eight hundred words next month?" an' George answers  right off th' bat (bein' throughly familiar
                        with th' number o' ads): "Yes, it'll jest balance up th' ads."
                    Th' amateur author never gits discouraged. Sometimes he drys up fer a week or
                        ten days, but he's soon at it agin. He knows that ther must be somewhere
                        some editur that's holdin' his forms open fer his story an' he mails it an'
                        remails it till he hits th' right editur.
                    Writin' looks awful easy, an' most of it must be awful easy. That's th'
                        reason so many neglect ther personal appearance an' become writers. I've
                        often thought I'd lay off some afternoon an' write a novel. But writin' fer
                        magazines is th' best sport. It's as lazy an' fascinatin' as fishin'. You're
                        your own master. You don't even have t' be available. Jest so your story is
                        long enough or short enoughï¿½jest so th' editor has rook fer it.
                    When we reflect that Pilgrim's Progress wuz writt'n in jail, that Silvio
                        Pellico an' Tasso did ther best writin' behind th' bars, that Sir Walter
                        Raleigh's admirable history o' th' world wuz written with his hands
                        handcuffed  behind him in th' Tower o' London,
                        that Leigh Hunt wuz layin' out a fine when Rimini wuz written, an' that
                        Daniel Defoe laid th' plans fer Robinson Crusoe while he wuz in a lock-up we
                        must confess that th' world t'day is lenient indeed.

                    Some folks are jest quietly good an' others use an orchestra
                        accompaniment.
                    Next t' waitin' till somebuddy gits thro' tellin' a story th' hardest thing
                        is givin' your seat t' a lady on a $1 excursion.

                        prices.
                    Nothin' makes some fellers feel their importance like a roll top desk an' a
                        swivel chair.

                        without lightin' a pipe or takin' a couple o' drinks.
                    Who remembers th' ole time "grand ball an' oyster supper"?
                    We're all more or less musically inclined when it comes t' fiddlin'
                        around.
                    
                    What I can't understand about a circus is why it takes eight horses t' pull a
                        cage containin' a nineteen-pound kangaroo.
                    Long hair an' a Windsor tie won't git you by unless you're really great.
                    Fer ever' feller that's got a little dab o' money ther's ten fellers figurin'
                        on how they're goin' t' separate him from it.
                    What's become o' th' ole fashioned feller who wuz willin' t' begin at th'
                        bottom?
                    Tilford Moots says he never gambled in his life, 'cept he raised a son.
                    
                    It's all right fer a feller t' be self made, but he ought t' hire a press
                        agent an' not try t' do ever'thing himself.
                    Ther's allus been a suspicion that Mexican presidents held out, but Huerta
                        wuz certainly th' limit.
                    You never hear o' any o' th' couples who go t' Niagary Falls fer ther
                        honeymoon returnin' in after years fer a peace conference.
                    Some folks, like most resturints, seem t' think a clean front is all that's
                        necessary.
                    It seems like one o' th' hardest lessons t' be learned in this life is where
                        your business ends an' somebuddy else's begins.
                
                
                
                    Personal Magnetism
                    By Prof. Alex Tansey
                    Personal magnetism is that quality in human nature which enables a feller t'
                        git by with a red carnation in his lapel an' little ability--that
                        indefinable somethin' which enables us t' appeal t' others with success.
                    Personal magnetism, like th' squash, may be cultivated an' developed, an' th'
                        reward, as in th' case o' th' squash, is allus fer in excess o' any trouble
                        or expense incurred.
                    Th' next time you see a promoter, or a politician, carefully study his
                        magnetic quality. He may not have a warm, soggy clasp o' th' hand or a
                        fireman's mustache, an' he may not be dressed accordin' t' th' magazine ads
                        or belong t' any loges. But ther's somethin' about him which attracts you t'
                        him. At first he may impress you as bein' a hoss doctor, or one interested
                        in th' culture o' bees, but after you're under his spell fer a moment you
                        feel a crumblin' sensation. You realize he's got your number an' that it's
                        useless t' plead. We've  all bought life
                        insurance or a hat or somethin' else we didn' want while under th' same
                        spell.
                    Magnetism means social as well as financial 
                            A POP'LAR CITIZEN IN TH' HANDS O' HIS FRIENDS
                         success, since it makes warm useful friends without th' aid o'
                        money.
                    Th' first step in developin' personal magnetism is t' learn t' be cheerful
                        tho' bored. A  wide radiant smile is th'
                        foundation o' magnettism. But a smile t' be effective must have a well
                        ordered background. Th' teeth should be plugged an' evened up. After you've
                        mastered th' art o' smilin' an' bein' cheerful begin t' train yourself t'
                        sayin' an' doin' only agreeable things, rememberin' that one little mean act
                        'll counteract a whole day's smile.
                    In your battle t' become magnetic you'll often become discouraged as your
                        effort t' avoid causin' friction in other natures will be fraught with many
                        difficulties. This is where a strong heart with an overhead valve comes in
                        handy if th' best results are t' be achieved. As you proceed you'll attract
                        new friends. You'll be asked t' join clubs an' lodges, an' lead parades.
                    O' course if you're well fixed you kin do without personal magnetism. But if
                        you're jest startin' out in life with a piano half paid fer personal
                        magnetism is invaluable.
                    What a pity it is that so many o' us refuse t' become acquainted with our own
                        great powers, but instead prefer t' struggle along an'  toady after those who have seen th' light an' found th'
                        way.
                    When a woman ties a handkerchief around a dime it's a sign she takes no
                        chances.
                    Miss Fawn Lippincut has a new sleepin' porch that looks like a squab
                        loft.
                    Next t' listenin' t' somebuddy describin' a play ther hain't nothin' as
                        tiresome as waitin' fer a parade.
                    Next t' a city th' loneliest place in th' world when you're broke is among
                        relatives.
                    Why don't th' florists set aside a day each year fer father?
                    
                    It's jest like havin' some one return from th' grave t' have a daughter come
                        home from a canoe ride.
                    Th' only thing t' do these days is t' be sure you waive your rights then go
                        ahead.
                    Tell Binkley says he allus hates t' motor thro' a dry town on account o' th'
                        broken beer bottles.
                    Lots o' us pretend t' be out when we're really all in.
                    Ther hain't much excuse fer makin' mistakes in figures these days.
                    It's what a feller thinks he knows that hurts him.
                
                
                
                    
                        Hstands fer hosiery, bold, flashy an' thin, If I had t'
                        make th' world better I'd know where t' begin.
                    Some folks go clean thro' life without findin' a becomin' hat.
                    It takes th' average boy or girl two years t' settle down after makin' a hit
                        in a amateur show.
                    Tell Binkley wuz found in his office t'day on account o' water in th'
                        carbureter.
                    Nobuddy has ever been turned down yit that started out t' borrow trouble.
                    Clemmie Pash has a diplomy, but no job.
                    
                    Pinky Kerr says you don't have t' be an epicure t' know that an occasional
                        roast is better than a daily stew.
                    What's become o' th' feller who used t' lick his se-gar from one end t' th'
                        other before he lit it?
                    Don't worry when your boy leaves th' farm. He'll be back.
                    Tell Binkley is back from Californy an', like ever'buddy else, he'd like t'
                        live thereï¿½if he had a million dollars.
                    An amateur theatrical is allus good fer two or three weddin's.
                
                
                
                    Th' Hen Egg
                    By Miss Germ Williams
                    Th' hen egg plays a most important part in th' great melodrama o' life. No
                        recipe is complete without from one t' six eggs. No shampoo is complete
                        without th' softenin' influence of at least one egg. A cook is powerless
                        without eggs. Th' breakfast table looks cold an' uneventful without th' warm
                        golden orbs of a few upturned eggs. Ther is no understudy fer th' egg. An
                        egg may be fresh, strictly fresh, guaranteed or laid in Aprile an' on
                        parole. Ther are gilt-edged firsts and ordinary firsts. An' then we have th'
                        smooth plausible lookin' egg that turns up after bein' lost fer years.
                    In spite o' all th' advancement in th' culinary art ther's nothin' that
                        touches th' spot like ham an' eggs. Th' average feller enters a cafe or
                        resturint with only two thoughtsï¿½ham an' eggs.
                    When sickness enters th' home an' th' patient is tenderly nursed through th'
                        crisis an'  finally propped up with pillows in
                        th' bay window t' spend th' convalescent period those near an' dear tempt
                        him with choice viands. But with his first returnin' strength he wearily
                            
                            TH' MORNIN' MEAL ON TH' FARM
                         turns his lustreless eyes an' looks wistfully toward th' dining'
                        room door an' says, "Mother. I believe I could worry down an egg."
                    
                    T'day ther is ever' inducement fer a hen t' lay. Th' poultry medicine chest
                        is filled with concoctions t' keep her in th' mood. Her food is even
                        prepared along scientific lines an' contains all th' makin's o' a
                        first-class egg. All th' hen is expected t' do is to assemble 'em. Th'
                        modern hen house is constructed in th' most approved fashion with reversible
                        roostin' accommodations, clean airy nests, sanitary drinkin' fountains an'
                        perfect ventilation. Even th' windows are so arranged that th' light falls
                        over th' hen's left shoulder. Yet th' ole fashioned farmers with th' ole
                        fashioned hens fetch all th' eggs t' town.
                    T' th' husband who is often left t' his own resources ther is no friend like
                        th' egg.
                    Mrs. Tilford Moots is confined t' her home by an unsprightly liver.
                    A house divided agin itself is bad enough, but a skirt is th' limit.
                    
                    If th' average woman paid as much attention t' an ugly disposition as she
                        does to an ugly complexion ther wouldn' be so many men on th' street after
                        supper.
                    Some fellers are naturally quiet, some don't want t' start anything an' some
                        talk freely when they git better acquainted, but as a rule a close mouthed
                        feller is hampered fer information.
                    No woman cares how much her husband stays away from home in th' daytime.
                    Th' more a feller really amounts to th' worse his clothes fit.
                    We'd all like t' vote fer th' best man, but he's never a candidate.
                
                
                
                    
                        Istands fer Indian, "Umph, me kill 'em!" Th' only good red
                        man is th' one in th' film.
                    After a girl gits too big fer Santy Claus she begins t' cast around fer an
                        easy mark.
                    A woman is never satisfied unless she's puttin' confidence in somebuddy.
                    Th' election hain't very fer off when a candidate kin recognize you across
                        th' street.
                    If ther wuz only some shorter an' more direct route t' th' devil it would
                        save an awful lot o' sorrow an' anxiety in this world.
                
                
                
                    Farmin'
                    By Young Lafe Bud
                    Th' day is not fer distant when th' irksome duties o' th' farm will be
                        minimized t' such a degree that they will in no way interfere with croquet
                        an' motorin'.
                    
                        FREE FROM HEARTLESS COMPETITION
                    
                    Th' exodus from th' fields t' th' cities is do-in' much t' cut down th'
                        operatin' expenses o' th' farm. Agriculture, unlike other professions, will
                        never be overcrowded on account  o' th'
                        plowin', an' those who are left behind will eventually enjoy a monopoly o'
                        th' food producin' business o' th' country. T'day a farmer may enjoy
                        Argentine beef without feelin' like he is robbin' himself. With th' currency
                        question out o' th' road an' so many inventions under way fer motor driven
                        an' self operatin' implements th' farmer may well be happy in th' prospects
                        of a fer greater return fer less work in th' future. Th' dawn o' a new era
                        is gittin' in shape an' th' long delayed day is jest around th' corner when
                        ther'll be nothin' t' do on th' farm but dress fer town.
                    A high brow concert allus has a rag time audience.
                    Most o' th' studyin' is done out o' college.

                    How t' Live Happily Ever Afterward
                    By Mrs. Tipton Bud
                    Ere th' roses o' June have spent ther fragrance an' scattered ther petals t'
                        th' summer breezes many a bride an' groom will have returned from Pendleton
                        "an' other eastern cities" with love's fondest illusions shattered.
                    Rev. Wiley Tanger says marriage is an achievement. It prob'ly is an
                        achievement t' round up some girls, an' it may be somethin' closely
                        resemblin' an' achievement t' hypnotize some fellers an' railroad 'em t' th'
                        altar. But the plain, ever' day Niagry Falls marriage kin hardly be called
                        an achievement any more than fallin' over a wheelbarrow in th' dark an'
                        escapin' with your life. Fer a man an' wife t' find 'emselves settin' on th'
                        verandy in th' twilight o' life in complete harmony with 'emselves an' th'
                        world after bein' harnessed t'gether fer fifty years is an achievement.
                    Th' reason nine-tenths o' th' marriages come nearer bein' calamities than
                        achievements is because at th' very moment a young couple  begin t' set ther caps fer each other they
                        begin t' disguise ther real natures. They try t' make ther tastes an'
                        preferences an' very thoughts conform. They pretend t' study each other's
                            
                            DON'T SPEND YOUR MONEY FOOLISHLY."
                         every wish. "Do you like my hair this way?" or "What kind of a hat
                        would you git?" or "I don't care fer ice cream if you don't." Sometimes a
                        couple 'll stall an' fourflush an' lie t'  one
                        another fer o'er a year, or until she feels that they're perfectly matched.
                        Then she'll say, "I don't want you t' spend your money on me, Albert," which
                        is jest another way o' sayin', "We'll need it after we're married." After
                        th' weddin' comes th' ole time honored "If I'd only known" o' th' wife, an'
                        "If I wuz only single agin' " o' th' husband.
                    Some married couples are tactful enough t' hold t'gether, others split up,
                        some arbitrate, some keep on fourflushin' in public an' fightin' at home,
                        while those who have been on th' level from th' time they first met live
                        happily ever afterward because they knew jest what they were gittin'.
                    A husband or wife should have some occasional diversion outside th' home. If
                        possible such diversion should be enjoyed hand in hand, thereby disarmin'
                        unfavorable comment an' at th' same time relievin' th' husband from eatin'
                        at th' Busy Bee.
                    June is not only th' weddin' month but also th' month o' strawberries. Many a
                        marriage that seemed t' have all th' ear marks o' smooth  sailin' has been unceremoniously wrecked when,
                        scarcely out o' th' bay, th' young unsuspectin' husband has been confronted
                        by his wife's first strawberry short cake.
                    I don't think much of a dance where th' girl looks like she wuz bein' carried
                        out of a burnin' buildin'
                    It ought t' please th' joy riders t' know that hell's paved.
                    There's allus plenty o' room in th' wrong car.
                    A friend when you're goin' t' seed is a friend indeed.
                    Ther's too many folks o' limited means who think that nothin's too good fer
                        'em.
                
                
                
                    
                        Kstands fer kimono, a flowered housegown, It's all right
                        fer th' home, but don't venture downtown.
                    It's funny a woman don't shut a car door once in a while without
                        thinkin'.
                    Oh, fer th' good ole times when a feller could hold his head up in a
                        community without havin' his clothes pressed three times a week.
                    Miss Tawney Apple says she don't know whether t' remain single or go t'
                        DePauw University.
                    Housework an' fresh air used t' turn out some purty good lookin' women.
                    
                    What's become o' th' ole fashioned mother who wuz allus talkin' about
                        somebuddy bein' "full o' th' ole Harry"?
                    Jest because a candidate kin place you while he's runnin' fer office it's no
                        sign he kin do it after he's elected.
                    It seems like th' surest an' easiest way t' live a long while is jest t' be
                        downright worthless.
                    Th' intelligence of a family is very frequently in th' wife's name even if
                        father does look after th' votin'.
                    Some fellers idea o' bein' public spirited is havin' ther hair trimmed once a
                        week.
                
                
                
                    Songs o' T'day
                    By Miss Mame Moon
                    When I stand idly by an' watch th' tango er set thro' a modern problem play I
                        can't help thinkin' how fer we've traveled since th' days when th' mere
                        mention o' "The Black Crook" caused th' ole time mother t' turn purple with
                        shame. Jest think o' th' hug, kiss an' cuddle songs o' t'day an' th' dear
                        ole ballads o' yisterdayï¿½songs like "Only a Pansy Blossom," "Ther's a
                        Letter in th' Candle," "Meet Me by Moonlight Alone," "Molly Darlin," "Sweet
                        Genevieve," "My Ole Kentucky Home," "Sweet Violets," "Suwanee River," an'
                        "In th' Gloamin', Oh, My Darlin'". Th' ole songs inspired sentiment an'
                        patriotismï¿½they were songs that brought out th' best that wuz in us,
                        ballads that caused burnin' tears an' aroused tender emotions.
                    After th' ole time beau listened t' a couple o' verses o' "In th' Gloamin'."
                        or "Take Back Your Heart," his brain whirled with lofty thoughts an' he wuz
                        perfectly safe t' have  around. Ther's nothin'
                        about "Sweet Genevieve" or "Silver Threads," or any o' th' ole songs, t'
                        inspire home wreckin'.
                    
                        DESECRATIN' A PARLOR
                    
                    T'day our parlors are thrown open t' an appallin' list o' "tremendous
                        metropolitan hits" an' no questions are asked. Fer instance: (Allegro
                        Moderato.
                    
                    "Most ever' feller meets a girl some day, Some little girl who steals his
                        heart away. You leave your dearest friends t' take th' girlie home.
                    Give up all you own t' be alone.
                    You've got a chance t' press her t' your heart, But you've just met th' girl
                        an' you're afraid to start.
                    Ther's your parlor, lights are low.
                    If you had any sense you ought t' knowï¿½
                    
                        (Chorus)
                        All th' time she's waitin' fer you t' hold her,
                        All th' time she's hopin' you'll get bolder,
                        All th' time, all th' time,ï¿½she's waitin' fer some kissin',
                        Oh boy! Oh boy! look at th' fun you're missin'.
                        All th' time she's givin' you chances
                        But you never make a move or show a sign,
                        She's gittin' closer inch by inch,
                        If you move over it's a cinch,
                        She's waitin fer you t' love her all th' time."
                    
                    Here's th' chorus of another "terrific hit" that's findin' instant favor in
                        our most exclusive  homes. It is full o'
                        inspiration an' designed especially t' cause th' average youth t' spring
                        upon his prey long ere th' last line o' th' chorus has died away:
                    "Come up t'night my honey, come up t'night, Whistle so I'll know it's you
                        (whistle) Come up t'night an' wear your love makin' clothes An' I'll find a
                        cozy corner no buddy knows."
                    Here's another sample illustrative of what is termed a "parlor hit" an' it's
                        enough t' make a se-gar Indian topple from grace:
                    "Hoo ray! Hoo ray! I'm eighteen years ole t'day an' have never been
                        kissed.
                    Ma tells me I'm old enough, Pa tells me I'm bold enough, So put your arms
                        around me I insist."
                    Is your daughter singin' th' reignin' hits o' th' day while some buddin'
                        Lothario sets unhandcuffed in th' same room?
                
                
                
                    
                        Lstands fer love, we've all been imbued; 'Tis better t'
                        have loved an' lost than never t've been sued.
                    Ther's all kinds o' wives, includin' the one that's allus wantin' t' move t'
                        another town.
                    A pessimist is usually a feller that haint got th' goods.
                    If ever'buddy wuz as pleasant as th' feller that's tryin' t' skin you wouldn'
                        this be a swell world?
                    I never knowed a successful man that could quote poetry.
                    Some folks jest seem t' thrive on adverse criticism.
                    
                    It used t' be a common sight t' see a feller in ordinary circumstances
                        greasin' his saw with a bacon rind.
                    Anybuddy that's got time t' read half of th' new books has got entirely too
                        much time.
                    Th' feller that tells a good story allus has t' listen t' a couple o' poor
                        ones.
                    Th' less a feller deserves th' keener he seems t' feel some
                        disappointment.
                    Th' store keeper who don't advertise generally has a circus bill hangin' in
                        his window thro' th' winter.
                    
                    How soon we are fergotten while we're still here.
                    Who remembers th' ole fashioned cardamom seeds a feller used t' chew before
                        he asked a girl t' waltz with him?
                    No self-made man ever did such a good job that some woman didn' want t' make
                        a few alterations.
                    I wonder what ever become o' th' feller who used t' have a friend in th'
                        country who gave him a turkey ever' Thanksgivin'
                    Ther's nothin' in a name, an' anybuddy who has ever eaten a Ben Davis apple
                        knows ther's nothin' in a color.
                
                
                
                    Great Men o' Humble Origin
                    By Rev. Willey Tanger

                        humanity must possess th' qualities that win. What are th' qualities that
                        win? Energy an' thrift! Standin' in front o' th' pustoffice complainin'

                        somethin' better, but once a poor hod carrier allus a poor hod carrier. I
                        speak o' hod carryin' because it's employment in every sense o' th' word.

                        Rockefeller, Henry C. Frick, Tilford Moots an' 
                        Charley Schwab are all men o' humble origin who have brushed th' snow from
                        ther pillows in th' days o' ther youth. Carnegie wuz a telegraph operator,
                        often workin twenty-four hours straight in his barefeet; Tipton Bud wuz a
                        barefooted boy in Kokomo, beggin' a banana from each one he met; John
                        Rockefeller wuz a plain clerk behind th' counter where his feet could not be
                        seen; Tilford Moots plowed in his bare feet, sometimes on circus dayï¿½even
                        missin' th' parade. Charley Schwab, o' th' steel trust, stood around th'
                        forge in his bare feet, often steppin' on a hot slug; Henry C. Frick, th'
                        steel magnate, blew stumps on his father's farm before he worked up t' his
                        first pair o' boots. Tell Binkley is another member o' th' ole barefoot
                        squad who wuz well ont' forty years ole before he tasted his first lobster.

                        went t' work, walkin' fourteen miles t' his task an'  carrying' his dinner, which consisted of a cold buckwheat
                        cake.

                    If it wuzn' fer th' plain, common, ever'day folks who pay cash, it wouldn' be

                    Th' First Robin
                    By Ex-Editur Cale Fluhart
                    There's three kinds o' spring — forward, backward an' th' plain almanack
                        variety, which arrives with th' vernal equinox on th' twenty-first day o'
                        March, rain or snow.
                    Ther's many harbingers o' spring which are regarded as bein' absolutely
                        trustworthy signs that th' season which we long fer is comin' soon." Wild
                        geese flyin' north, marble playin', blue-eyed violets peepin' out o' th'
                        slush, th1 robin, th' shaggy umbreller mender with th' workhouse palor, th'
                        candidate fer sheriff with his fresh hair cut, an' th' display o' onion
                        sets, winter elbows an' garden tools—all are looked upon as bein'
                        unmistakable evidence that winter is beatin' a hasty retreat.
                    While we're liable t' burn more coal after th' arrival o' th' first robin
                        than we've burned since he took his departure, he's still th' most highly
                        regarded forecaster o' th' vernal season in th' business.
                    Th' political candidate has been fooled so 
                        often by th' first robin that he withholds his activities till th' umbreller
                        mender shows up an' th' frost is out o' th' court house steps an' it's balmy
                        enough t' lean agin th' pustomce. We rarely have any sleighin' after th'
                        ambitious office seeker gits his neck shaved an' his cards printed.
                    But t' return t' th' first robin. Nature, in spite o' her celebrated
                        reputation fer lookin' out fer ever'buddy, seems t' have given th' robin th'
                        worst of it. Unequipped fer anything colder than 30 above, he's more
                        frequently th' forecaster of a blizzard than th' dandelion. Un-gressive an'
                        meek, he'd sooner starve than question th' priority o' th' English sparrow.
                        Th' only thing a robin '11 attack is th' blind, helpless, squirmin' angle
                        worm. Yit nature sends him north a full four weeks before the angle worm is
                        available. Utterly lackin' in th' instinct t' keep away from his natural
                        enemies he invariably selects a buildin' site within easy reach o' th'
                        family cat, or in th' roof gutter, where he an' his family fall an easy prey
                        t' th' April freshet.
                    
                    But th' amount o' publicity th' first robin gits is enough t' make th'
                        Colonel turn green with envy. He's th' only bird that gits his 
                            TH' ARRIVAL O' TH' FIRST ROBIN FROM GREENSBORO. NORTH CAROLINA.
                         name on th' editorial page. Long before he gits fairly balanced on
                        th' bare twig of an apple tree his arrival is heralded broadcast by  th' nearest newspaper an' discussed in every
                        home.
                    How many times have we drawn th' curtain in th' mornin' an' looked out upon a
                        bleak, snowy landscape an' beheld th' first robin with a sad fer away look
                        in his eye, an' wonderin' what kind of a meteorological disturbance nature
                        wuz goin t' hand him next.
                    Napoleon, standin' on th' barren, slaty bluffs o' St. Helena, lookin'
                        gloomily out o'er a vast expanse o' speckless sea, didn' have anything on
                        th' first robin.
                    Ever' once in a while we miss a nuisance, an' then find out he's got a
                        political job.
                    Remember when your big sister used t' write you an excuse t' stay out o'
                        school 'f you'd promise t' build a fire in the parlor stove Sunday
                        afternoon?
                    
                    A boy never begins t' appreciate his mother till his father tells him t' go
                        t' work.
                    It seems like it's impossible for a girl t' get through life without wastin'
                        a lot o' valuable time on some handsome fool.
                    Miss Fawn Lippincut went up t' Indynoplus t' see "Th' Garden o' Allah" last
                        night. She says ther wuzn' anybuddy settin' behind her that had seen th'
                        play in Chicago, but ther wuz a woman in front o' her who had read th' book
                        in Seymour.
                    Some fellers think they're gittin' off easy by givin' ther wives ever'thing
                        they want.
                    When a woman says somethin' wouldn' surprise her much she means it would
                        please her.

                        supplanted by Ethyl, Ellyn, Edythe an' Mayme.
                    When a woman says "they say" she means herself.
                    All th' world's a film an' most of us are merely cowboys an' Indians.
                    None but th' brave kin live with th' fair.
                    What's become o' th' ole time grocer that blew in th' sack?
                    Th' day has gone by when you have t' invite anybuddy t' dinner twice.
                
                
                
                    Toadyin' After th' Great
                    By Miss Fawn Llppincut
                    "Ze thing about your Amerika which impresses me ze most is ze great army o'
                        bores —let me see—hero worshippers, I think you call 'ern—that camp on ze
                        trail o' ze great," said Signer Antone Colorado Maduro, th' celebrated
                        Icelandic accordion player, while hidin' in a box stall at th' livery stable
                        t' avoid th' entertainment committee o' th' Ladies Art Society. "In no other
                        country in ze world have I found so many—let me see—toadies I think you call
                        'em—as I find in your Amerika. They no let me sleep! They no let me walk!
                        It's ze tea, ze dance, ze reception an' ze luncheons. I no take a bath. See,
                        my beard has grown beyond my control! I can no shave! I shake ze hands an'
                        eat all ze time! My stomach no good! It's—let me see—all shot t' pieces I
                        think you call it!"
                    Th' craze t' be mixed up in some way or other with th' great an' almost great
                        has about reached th' limit in this country. In time th'  fad will drive our own great celebrities
                        abroad, as well as discourage those o' Europe from seekin' laurels an' other
                        things among us.
                    Real celebrities want t' be let alone. Great 
                            ON TH' TRAIL OF A CELEBRITY
                         speakers an' musicians an' statesmen an' actors an' actresses must
                        rest an' bathe an' shave jest like paperhangers an' lawyers an' other folks.
                        If great people didn' need th' money an' pub- 
                        licity they wouldn' stand a minute fer th' average celebrity trailer. It
                        seems t' be as much a part o' th' contract o' a celebrity t' stand fer bein'
                        bored all th' time as it is fer em t' play or sing or speak.
                    What a tryin' ordeal it must be fer a Nor-wegion xyclophone player, or a
                        Scandanavian 'cellist, or a Peruvian pianist, or a noted exponent o'
                        altruism, t' be surrounded by a bunch o' perfumed an' powdered tea pourers
                        while he feels th' need o' a bath, or a shave, or a steak with onions.
                    Some celebrities, o' course, travel in ther own special cars an' kin sleep
                        an' shave while they hide on a side track in th' suburbs, but they've all
                        paid th' price early in ther careers.
                    It's great fun t' watch a reception committee while it waits fer th' train
                        bearin' a celebrity. Th' plan o' attack has been arranged an' rehearsed like
                        a fire drill. Ever' contingency is provided fer, Th' committee huddles
                        t'gether with grave an' sober faces. Each member is thoroughly sensible o'
                        his great responsibility. Each thinks only o' th' part he  is t' play. Th' occasional click o' a huntin'
                        case watch is all that disturbs th' quiet vigil. Th' committee knows its
                        business. When th' whistle blows it's th' signal fer th' leadin' hardware
                        merchant t' crank his Ford an' have it in readiness. Th' leadin' banker an'
                        prominent pastor move t' a position where th' coach bear-in' th' celebrity
                        is likely t' halt. It is th' pastor's business t' greet th' celebrity an'
                        pass his luggage t' th' leadin' banker. At this juncture th' mayor who has
                        remained in th' offin' walks forward an' extends a fat damp hand an' escorts
                        th' party t' th' Ford. Then th' celebrity is spirited t' th' home o' a
                        prominent club woman, where th' committee on entertainment take him in
                        charge. At eight-ten p. m., after eatin' an' shakin hands an' inspectin' th'
                        new water works an' th' heatin system o' K. of P. hall, th' celebrity
                        appears pale an' exhausted fer th' evenin's entertainment.
                    Have you ever noticed that th' greater a celebrity is th' later he arrives in
                        town an' th' earlier he gits out? Next t' thunderous applause ther haint
                        nothin' a really great cel-  ebrity likes
                        better'n gittin out o' town before his audience kin recover from his closin'
                        remarks.
                    Th' penalty fer being great is bein' bored.
                    What's become o' th' feller who used t' be willin' t' work at anything till
                        somethin' better come along?
                    Th' only time some fellers are ever seen with their wives is after they've
                        been indicted.
                    Ever'buddy seems t' think it's funny t' be a bad speller.
                    Who ever saw a woman that wuz polite enough t' quit talkin' while another
                        woman talked?
                
                
                
                    0 stands fer opery, grand opery, you know; Nobuddy kin see
                        it, but a few of us go.
                    Th' feller that walks th' chalk at home goes th' limit downtown.
                    Some folks never miss a show or pay a bill.
                    Mrs. Lafe Bud has traded a cradle fer a foldin' card table.
                    No girl is ever so sure of a feller's love that she'll let him see her before
                        breakfast.
                    Nearly ever' day we meet somebuddy who moved t' Floridy once.
                    
                    Some fellers don't let their wives run anything but th' furnace.
                    Nothin' makes a ugly feller as mad as t' have a candidate shake hands with
                        him an' say: "I ought t' remember your face."
                    It don't make no difference where you wear your heart if your liver is out-o'
                        order.
                    Th' trouble with mixin' business with pleasure is that th' pleasure allus
                        comes t' th' top.

                    Gossip
                    By Miss Tawney Apple
                    We kin fortify ourselves agin a burglar er recover from a cheap plumber; we
                        kin flee t' th' mountain an' avoid th' flood that sweeps th' lowlands er we
                        kin muff a Wagner recital, but ther is positively no escape from a
                        gossip.
                    "Ther goes Hattie Moon t' th' pustoffice agin jist as fast as her skirt'll
                        let her. It's th' fifth time since ten o'clock. Is it any wonder decent
                        people talk about her?" said Mrs. Tip-ton Bud t' Mrs. Tilford Moots this
                        mornin'. Th' two women had stopped t' exchange reports on Art Simmons an'
                        his new wife an' discuss th' possibility o' an early divorce.
                    Now th' truth is Hattie Moon is takin' stenography by mail with th' intention
                        o' support-in' her widowed mother, but as she is purty an' stylish th'
                        chances are she'll have t' git out o' town. Gittin' talked about is one o'
                        th' penalties fer bein' purty, while bein' above suspicion is about th' only
                        compensation fer bein' homely.
                    
                    Ever'buddy that hears a little dash o' gossip remounts it an' burnishes it up
                        an' sends it on its way. If you try t' head it off you only stir 
                            ''THER SHE GOES."
                         it up. Nearly ever'buddy is more er less inclined t' gossip, but
                        not allus maliciously. Folks gossip t' be interestin'. Th' fact that Ike
                        Brown is a model husband an pays his  debts
                        don't interest no one. Th' fact that his wife is a splendid good woman has
                        no news value. But if you intimate that Ike Brown is on his last legs er
                        that his wife has been vis-itin' her mother unusually long you have a crowd
                        around you in a minute. Jist whisper t' some friend that a certain woman
                        looks unhappy an' th' card clubs '11 have her separated from her husband in
                        a week.
                    An' gossippin' haint confined t' women an' little towns. Wherever ther's
                        people ther's gossip. Clubs are clearin' houses fer gossip. Some clubs are
                        organized fer historical research, some are organized t' better social
                        conditions, some are organized t' combat certain evils, some are organized
                        t' gamble fer stock-in's an' pottery while others are organized .fer purely
                        social pleasure. Yet I doubt if any-buddy ever attended any kind o' a club
                        meetin' without annexin' a little information o' a sen= sational nature.
                    Nobuddy's affairs ever demanded so much o' ther time that they couldn' give a
                        little attention t' gossip. It's wonderful how much  capacity some folks have—how easily they kin watch ever' detail
                        o' their own business an' yours too.

                        curtains than a Scotland Yard detective could find out in a year.

                    Th' Liver
                    By Dr. Mopps
                    Th' shameful treatment that is bein' accorded th' human liver in this day an'
                        age is a reflection on our boasted civilization. We're rushin' ahead unitin'
                        oceans, reducin' th' tariff, passin' currency bills an' checkin' hog cholera
                        while th' great American liver struggles along doin' two livers' work
                        without a friend in either branch o' Congress.
                    Th' human liver (Swedish LEFVER) is a large light maroon colored digestive
                        gland about the size of a catcher's glove that reposes in th' upper right
                        hand corner o' th' abdominal cavity an', when conditions are as they should
                        be, it weighs one-fortieth as much as th' body t' which it is attached. It
                        is th' main gazabo o' th' human works but, notwithstandin' th' important
                        role it plays in our pursuit o 'life, liberty an' happiness, it is th' most
                        abused, most misconstrued, most ignored, most imposed on, most neglected an'
                        lied about organ  of which th' medical
                        fraternity has any knowledge.
                    Next t' a yeller dog ther hain't nothin' that 
                            WHEN TH' LIVER IS HITTIN' RIGHT.
                         responds as readily t' kindness as th' human liver. Prunes, when
                        properly stewed, are fine fer th' liver, but how many of us are darin'
                        enough t' ask for them? We occasionally eat  an
                        apple jest t' please th' liver, but we rarely take th' liver int' our
                        confidence when we attend a Jefferson Day banquet. We are not chummy enough
                        with th' liver. How many of us have any knowledge of it's plumbin'?
                    A feller's disposition is regulated by his liver. Th' liver is th'
                        switchboard o' his inclinations an' impulses. We often hear it said of a
                        feller that he entered int' this er that with his whole heart. It wuz his
                        whole liver. Most o' th' credit that goes t' th' heart rightfully belongs t'
                        th' liver.
                    Some fellers are very lavish till ther asked t' do somethin' fer ther liver.
                        Next t' a poor relative ther hain't nothin' they're less interested in than
                        ther own liver. Some girls laughin'ly powder over a liver spot on ther cheek
                        without ever thinkin' of goin' t' th' seat o' th' trouble,
                    One o' th' hardest things that come up durin' th' liver's daily routine is
                        handlin' a large steak after its owner has consumed it an' sunken heavily
                        int' an easy chair.
                    When th' human liver (Latin JECUR) is  happily
                        situated an' th' lines leadin' therefrom are open t' traffic ther is nothin'
                        that looks as bright an' beautiful as th' world.
                    Ther's gittin' t' be too many thirty-cent people that look like a million
                        dollars.
                    So many clerks seem t' have missed their callin'.
                    Some folks never begin t' figure till ther's nothin' t' add.
                    Keepin' a marriage a secret must be a good deal like hidin' a bass drum.
                    Lots o' fellers are not known by th' company they keep.

                    A optimist is often a feller that lives fer t'day an' lets his grocer take
                        care o' t'morrow.
                    So fer I haint heard o' nobuddy who wants t' stop livin' on account o' th'

                    Ther's no secret about success. Did you ever know a successful man that didn'
                        tell you all about it?

                    When we watch some folks eat we can't help thinkin' what great brickmasons
                        they'd make —'specially if ther's some apple butter on th' table.
                
                
                
                    Popularity
                    By Ex-Editur Cale Fluhart
                    Th' trouble with most men an' women who chase after popularity without makin'
                        any noticeable headway is that ther either lackin' in th' peculiarities o'
                        th' genuine or money.
                    Ther's two kinds o' popularity—th' real, inexpensive, natural finish, or
                        uncommon variety, an' th' smilin', smirkin', flashy, shim-merin' short-lived
                        sort which depends entirely on one's willin'ness t' come across.
                    Th' ultimate obscurity that seems t' be th' inevitable fate o' all who have
                        known th' glamor of a brief, wasteful season o' popularity is often
                        pathetic. T' be suddenly, or even gradually, torn from those who have
                        laughed at your jokes, those who have used you an' fattened on your vanity,
                        those who have got ahead thro' your generosity an' those who have shown you
                        a good time no matter how much it cost you, is one o' th' common an'
                        pitiable spectacles o' life.
                    Look at th' grand ole mansion that has been 
                        turned int' a boardin' house because it no longer met th' requirements o'
                        th' gay throngs whose laughter once shook its great chande- 
                            HOLDIN' HIS FRIENDS.
                         Hers from ther moorin's! T'day it is a shrine fer th' forlorn
                        failures o' society—fruit tree agents, outcasts an' solicitors.
                    How many people do you know who were  once
                        pop'lar an' who, thro' some breach o' th' code or ill luck are carryin' th'
                        banner t'day, frazzled an' fergotten?
                    Popularity is fleetin'. It is here t'day an' gone t'morrow. It vanishes
                        before sudden adversity like a paper dollar on Saturday night. Popularity is
                        like a babe. It must be nursed an' cuddled lest it withers an' fades. As it
                        thrives its unkeep increases.
                    It's as hard t' build up a long neglected popularity as it is t' put a run
                        down hotel back in th' game. T' keep his popularity in good runnin' order a
                        feller should be a nice even tempered goat with a kind word an' a good
                        se-gar fer all.
                    Ever' time I see a widely pop'lar feller surrounded by a lot o' smilin
                        coyotes I allus think o' that dear ole lyric, "I'll Love You When Your
                        Honey's Gone, But I'll Not Be With You."
                    
                    A flirt allus thinks one good turn deserves another.
                    If ther wuz jist some way t' bridle th' energy that's wasted knockin'

                    Th' older a feller gits th' less he wants t' take a sleigh ride.
                    No feller wuz ever so pop'lar at home that he didn' have t' go out o' town
                        fer his fame.

                        when we're trimmed by a "New York success".
                    It's wonderful what a run ther is on worry when you consider that it never
                        helped anything.
                    Th' hardest thing about bein' a aviator is knowin' when t' quit.
                    Folks in a little town don't worry half as much about ther pustmaster's
                        qualifications t' run his office as they do about his wife's ability t'
                        gossip.
                    Steaks are rarer, while th' consumer continues to be well done.
                    
                    Next t' a yeller buggy whip with a blue ribbon tied t' it ther haint nothin'
                        that looks as good t' a country boy as a street car conductor.
                    Ever' time I read where some woman gave a "short talk" I wonder how she
                        stopped.
                    Next t' a painter climbin' around on a scaffold ther haint nothin' as cute
                        an' cunnin' as a parrot.
                    When I look at some rich folks I don't blame fortune fer smilin'.
                    You don't have t' be on th' water wagon t' notice th' days gittin'

                    Trouble
                    By Prof. Alex Tansey
                    If we kin believe ever'buddy we talk to ther haint nothin' that's as equally
                        distributed in this life as trouble. Trouble finds its way int' th' tall
                        stately mansion among th' elms an' in th' humble cot. Th' smilin' grafter,
                        th' well groomed man o' wealth, th' glossy loafer an' th' tired shoveler all
                        have ther troubles.
                    We see a prosperous lookin' feller whizzin' by in a luxurious tourin' car an'
                        we think how happy he must be. It never occurs t' us that he may be goin' t'
                        th' depot t' meet a lot o' relatives, er has jist paid two dollars t' have a
                        valve ground.
                    People who act th' happiest may have th' most troubles. A feller may be all
                        life an' sunshine in th' presence o' his associates an' brood when alone
                        because he looks like h—1 in a dress suit. A gushin' society belle may be
                        th' queen o' her set an' still weep bitter tears because she's got a mole in
                        th' wrong place. A husband may eat a hearty supper an' chat  pleasantly with members o' his household an'
                        then jump in th' river t' keep from meetin' a note. A wife may be surrounded
                        by ever' lux- 
                            "OH, SHOOT!"
                         ury t'day an' leave a note in th' mornin' sayin', "I've gone t'
                        Seattle."
                    Trouble is jist a part o' th' scheme o' life an' no home seems t' be complete
                        without its  errin' son er daughter, its
                        mortgage, its poverty, or calamity o' some sort. Trouble softens us. It
                        disturbs that feelin' o' selfish security that's all too likely t' develop
                        with a little easy money. Trouble is a great leveler an' a wonderful conceit
                        diminisher an' it seems t' make a specialty o' hittin' th' high places. Fer
                        how often we see folks readin' th' help wanted ads t'day that were frownin'
                        down on us from th' dizzy peaks o' prosperity yisterday.
                    So th' fact that ever'buddy has ther troubles should make us all th' more
                        reconciled t' our own. Let us study th' beautiful optimisim o? poor Robert,
                        th' laborer, in th' ole third reader story, when he says: "Well, then I must
                        sup t'night on an onion. Last night I had nothin'. ' It will make no
                        difference with me t'-morrow what I have had t'day." So sayin' he trudged
                        on, singin' as before.
                
                
                
                    S stands fer Steve, of melodrama fame, "Stand back, dad,
                        don't tech her, th' gal haint t' blame!"
                    What's become o' th' ole twenty-five-cent dinner with eight side dishes,
                        includin' a piece o' cross barred apple pie in left field?
                    Next t' a dinin' car mutton chop ther hain't nothin' as rare as a day in
                        June.
                    Th' less ther is back o' you th' better front you need.
                    There'll allus be somethin' funny about a weddin' write-up no matter how
                        seriously it's written.
                    
                    Th' demand fer heart balm is allus in excess o' th' supply.
                    Whenever ther's an errin' husband th' spinsters allus say : "That's a man fer
                        you. Ther all alike!"
                    When does a college student study?
                    Mrs. Tipton Bud's nephew, who wuz recently convicted o' manslaughter, has
                        been denied a new trial as he only had one farm.
                    It takes some folks five minutes t' put a flag up an' a week t' take it
                        down.
                    Ther's lots o' difference between makin' over a husband an' a last year's
                        hat.
                
                
                
                    Noises
                    By Rev. Wiley Tanger
                    Oh, fer th' ole restful noiseless days when nothin' disturbed th' peace an'
                        quiet o' th' community but th' milkman's bell, or an occasional grind organ!
                        Oh, fer th' joy o' livin' agin through that blissful period precedin' th'
                        advent o' th' raspin' phonograph!
                    When it comes t' din th' blatant notes o' a minstrel pe-rade are as soft an'
                        soothin' as a summer zepyr compared t' th' turmoil an' clatter o' th' march
                        o' progress, with its player pianners, typewriters, automobiles, addin'
                        machines, belchin' motorcycles, nickel the-ater megaphones, flat wheeled
                        street cars, hospital ambulances an' rumblin' interurbans. With th' possible
                        exception o' th' rubber heel all o' cur modern inventions an' innovations
                        are accompanied by some nerve rackin' noise. Wherever we turn we run int'
                        some new kind of a noise. The quiet Sunday at home passed out with th'
                        comin' o' th' player pi-anner. Th' wheezin' graphophone has  drowned out th ole enjoyable conversations
                        around th' cheerful grate, while th' impatient ring o' th' telephone bell
                        destroys one silent 
                            "YOU MADE ME LOVE YOU," ETC.
                         meditation after another. If we seek th' lonesome seclusion o' th'
                        country lane we're startled by th' auto horn or snortin' motorcycle. In th'
                        cafe th' low necked cabaret nightingale  sings
                        "You Made Me Love You" as she wabbles aimlessly among th' tables scatterin'
                        talcum dust o'er th' steaks an' caviar sandwiches. Ever'where is noise. In
                        ever' town that's flourishin' enough t' support a "Pearl" laundry or a
                        "Weekly Banner" we find th' fussy little gasoline engine puffin' like an
                        enraged wart hog brought t' bay. Thro' th' turmoil an' bustle o' traffic we
                        cross th' downtown street with our life in one hand an' a cane or a mackerel
                        or somethin' in th' other. In th' evenin' when we git ready t' retire some
                        neighbor decides t' try out a new grand opery record on th' Victroly, 'or
                        th' blushin' debutante next door grows tired o' holdin' hands an' concludes
                        t' do a little foot work on th' player pianner. At intervals thro' th' night
                        we're aroused by th' milkman as he whistles his way t' th' window sill t'
                        keep up his courage, or by th' rough voice o' th' street sweeper as he
                        curses his mules. In th' mornin' th' wide open muffler o' some early
                        chauffeur proclaims th' breakin' day. Once .back in th' city streets we hear
                        th' constant rumble o' heavy trucks an' th' ter-  rific explosions o' countless tires an' our thoughts revert t' th' siege
                        o' Liege. We are surrounded by th' artillery o' traffic.
                    Nothin' seems t' succeed these days without a noise. Th' prosperity o' our
                        towns an' cities is measured by ther noise. Even a feller's prominence is
                        reckoned by th' noise he makes.
                    If a feller quietly buys a nickel se-gar these days th' bang o' th' cash
                        register destroys his whole line o' thought.
                    Who remembers th' ole days when ever' ventriloquist wore a mustache like a
                        walrus?
                    T' hear 'em holler you'd think some fellers had been hit by an ax instead o'
                        th' income tax.
                
                
                
                    
                        T stands fer tango, knocked by pulpit an' press,
                        Which largely accounts fer its tremendous success.
                    
                    Makin' a long stay short is a great aid t' popalarity.
                    No Mexican news is good news.
                    Lem Granger's trial fer hoss stealin' is set fer next week, an' Attorney Tell
                        Binkley is rehearsin' his wife an' baby on how t' cry in court.
                    You never find a poor man in th' hands o' his friends.
                    
                    It's too bad that anything as cheap as politeness hain't nutritious.
                    Why is it that th' feller who owns a tourin' car (or has one) allus smiles
                        when he hears o' someone else buyin' one?
                    A real friend never gives your name t' an agent.
                    Some folks seem t' make a specialty o' makin' a short story long.
                    A sober second thought is all right, but it's th' sober first thought that
                        counts.
                
                
                
                    Th' Attitude o' th' Father Toward th' Son
                    By Prof. Alex Tansey
                    Does your boy run up an alley when he sees you comin'? If he does, why does
                        he? Why don't he run down t' th' corner t' meet you? If he don't, why don't
                        he? Does he boast o' 'my paw' t' his companions, or does he refer t' you as
                        'th' ole man'? Does your boy place his order fer a new bicycle tire, or a
                        haircut, or a pair o' shoes, thro' his mother, or does he come direct t'
                        you? If he don't, why don't he? Is your boy afraid o' you? If he is, why is
                        he? Is it because you're a receiver fer a cannin' factory where your word is
                        law, or because yothre a director in two or three business concerns an' feel
                        yer importance? Is it because you've been prominently mentioned fer county
                        treasurer?
                    If your boy is afraid o' you because you are great it is only a question o' a
                        few years till he gits on t' you. Then he'll laugh—er run away. He'll find
                        out that after all you are only a human bein', an atom with nothin' new t'
                             offer. A plain man with a little downtown
                        responsibility.
                    Do you come home in th' evenin' with a knit brow an' sink int' th' best chair
                        an' pull out your watch? At th' evenin' meal do you ever 
                            'BEAT IT, HERE COMES TH' MAIN SQUEEZE!".
                         shove th' butter over where your boy kin reach it. or show him
                        other little attentions t' make him feel that he's your son an' that you're
                        goin' t' see him thro' till he gits a start? Or do you scowl when he timidly
                             looks at his mother an' lifts an egg t'
                        his plate?
                    Confide in your boy. Take walks with him. Fight off ole age by makin' a chum
                        o' him. Make him respect you an' discipline 'll take care o' itself.
                    Not long ago I wuz strollin' along th' street in th' residence district o' a
                        city when I came upon two youngsters who were discussin' croquet. Suddenly
                        th' older o' th' two said, "Hurry! Beat it! Here comes th' Main Squeeze!"
                        an' they both rushed panic stricken across a lawn an' were soon lost in th'
                        shrubbery. Turnin' about I saw a pompous gentleman ap-proachin'. His chin
                        wuz well up an' he seemed t' be entirely unconscious o' th' fact that any
                        other livin' thing existed besides himself. That he wuz a gentleman o' rare
                        ability ther could be no doubt, but in what callin' or profession he
                        excelled I wuz unable t' figure out. I walked leisurely t' th' corner an'
                        halted. I wished t' study him at close range. My hopes were shattered when
                        he turned t' enter th' residence across th' lawn of which th' boys had  disappeared. I watched him. He never limbered
                        or seemed t' fergit th' fact that he wuz great. His bearin' never changed.
                        He entered th' house, an* thro' a window I caught a last glance o' him. His
                        chin wuz still up. I wuz much interested. I asked a gentleman who chanced t'
                        pass who lived in th' house. He replied "Th' cashier o' some public service
                        monopoly. I've never heard his name."
                    Th' feller who tells how his wife fixes turnips is hard up fer news.
                    Th' average voter would jump at th' chance t' exchange his right o' franchise
                        fer th' courtesy an' consideration that is shown a woman.

                    A five-cent picture show don't only leave somethin' fer th' imagination, but

                    Some folks are too polite t' be up t' any good.
                    Don't knock th' weather. Nine-tenths o' th' people couldn' start a
                        conversation if it didn' change once in a while.
                    
                    Th' ole time father who used t' go home at noon an' eat a hearty dinner now

                    Uncle Hiram Blake, aged ninety-three, froze t' death while choppin' wood east

                        located.
                    Some folks read ever'thing but th' signs o' th' times.
                    Haint it about time fer th' farmer t' pass th' prosperity?
                    Th' more a feller amounts to th' worse he looks in a plug hat.

                    Th' Cost o' Sparkin'
                    By Miss Tawney Apple
                    After a feller gits thro' sparkin' these days he's insolvent. Lots o' good
                        sensible fellers would like t' git married but they can't afford t' take th'
                        time an' money. If a feller could git married after a week's sparkin' he
                        might be able t' catch even again. But th' modern girl seems t' demand a
                        long extravagant courtship before she's willin' t' give in an' drop out o'
                        th' game. Then th' young husband finds himself bankrupt with a yeller cane,
                        a plug hat, a dress suit an' a doll on his hands. With each spurt o' economy
                        her love grows colder. He gits tired o' lookin shiny an' her muff goes out
                        o' date. A separation soon follers—th' wife returns t' her ole home on
                        Chestnut street an' th' husband joins his regiment on th' rialto.
                    Back in th' ole days o' th' fuschia nosegay, ice cream parlors, cinnamon
                        drops an' autograph albums a feller had a chance t' win a heart without th'
                        use o' dancin' pumps an' ne-glectin' his business. Love makin' wuz almost
                             self-sustainin' in 1880. Girls looked
                        ahead o' ther noses, an' th' feller who gave promise o' bein' able t'
                        support a wife eventually wuz 
                            PLAYIN' TH' GAME.
                         grabbed off in a hurry. Girls didn' make love o'er th' chop suey
                        bowl or in a dark 5-cent theater. An' they didn' expect t' git on th'
                        outside of a few cocktails an' a filet mignon after  ever 'performance o' "The Two Orphans" or "East Lynne." Th'
                        parlor or th' narrow livery rig wuz th' clearin' house fer affairs o' th'
                        heart.
                    What's th' sense o' exhaustin' all th' pleasures o' life durin' th' first few
                        months o' courtship? Why not save a few pleasures t' look forward t' after
                        you've satisfied th' instalment houses? Marriage at best is quite a comedown
                        fer most any girl, 'specially if her engagement period wuz one long an'

                    Th' Element o' Boldness an' Its Relation t' Success
                    By Dr, Mopps
                    We're livin' in an age o' sharp competition, when no element is so
                        indispensable as boldness in th' attainment of all that is desirable in
                        life. A finished education, purty hair, an' unimpeachable character, finely
                        chiseled features, th' form of an Apollo, a fine tenor voice, fashionable
                        raiment an' good folks avail but little in th' battle o' life when
                        unaccompanied by th' element o' boldness—or nerve.
                    Boldness is a positive characteristic o' th' spirit. A feller may be bold
                        thro' fearlessness, but he may be fearless without bein' bold. He may be
                        fearless where there is no apprehension o' danger or no cause fer
                        apprehension, but he is bold only when he is conscious or apprehensive o'
                        danger an' has th' nerve t' encounter it.
                    Th' venerable example o' penniless ole age who loves t' chaw t'backer an'
                        refer t' th' time when he could have bought th' ground  where th' pustoffice stands fer two dollars, an' th' spinster
                        who could have married th' best man in town, both illustrate t' us how a
                        whole 
                            A VENERABLE EXAMPLE O' PENNILESS OLE AGE.
                         life may be changed an soured thro' th' lack o' a little
                        nerve.
                    Th' best maxims o' t'day were written almost a century ago, an' if they
                        fitted condi-  tions as they existed then how
                        much truer are they t'day when th' minds an' energies o' th' most
                        resourceful amongst us are often exhausted in an effort t' even rise above
                        mediocrity. If "Strike when th' iron is hot" meant anything in 1836 how much
                        more must it mean t'day? If he who hesitated fifty years ago wuz lost what
                        chance is ther t'day fer th' feller who says, "I'll think about it?"
                        "Nothin' ventured nothin' won" wuz a pop'lar sayin' long before th' death o'
                        Cornwallis, an' yit t'day ther's folks tryin' t' succeed without
                        adver-tisin'.
                    So in our modern system o' reachin' th' front boldness is th' all important,
                        over shadowin' pre-eminent an' dominant requisite. If we're t' git a seat on
                        th' end o' th' aisle in th' third row we'll have t' beat somebuddy t'
                        it.
                    As Tell Binkley says, "Faint heart never won fair lady or sold any life
                        insurance."
                    
                    All day t'day a steady stream o' friends called t' congratulate Mrs. Tipton

                    Fears is about all some people ever entertain.
                    Speakin' o' th' war, one o' th' latest styles o' four flushin' is pretendin'
                        t' be uneasy about relatives.
                    One o' th' commonest ailments o' th' present day is premature formation o'
                        opinion.
                    Who remembers when we used t' call a kiss a buss?

                        T' fill some girl with taffy in auto or park.
                    
                    A good fer nothin' husband is bad enough, but an idle wife is th' limit.
                    An ole night shirt makes a dandy dust rag fer a auto.
                    Carryin' a tune, writin' a beautiful hand an' rollin' a perfect cigarette are
                        among th' little accomplishments o' life that seem t' have a peculiar
                        fascination fer th' feller who's "not doin' anything now,"

                    You never really know some folks till they go on a trip an' write a letter
                        back t' ther home paper.
                    A mountain goat hain't got nothin' on a movie actor when it comes t' climbin'

                    Some fellers git credit fer bein' home lovin' when they're really doin' th'
                        housework.
                    Th' worst drawback t' hot weather is th' odor that hovers about some folks
                        like they wuz runnin' with th' emergency breaks on.
                
                
                
                    Th' Industry o' Knockin'
                    By Tell Binkley
                    Ther's one great an' growin' industry in this country employin' hundreds o'
                        thousands o' people in ever' city, nook an' hamlet that's not losin' any
                        sleep on account o' President Wilson's program, an' that's th' business o'
                        KNOCKIN',
                    Ther's allus been a little knockin' goin' on here an' there since th'
                        beginnin' o' time, but it has operated under th' sobriquet o' backbitin' an'
                        wuz widely scattered. But somehow it got in with the' vanguard o' our
                        country's progress an' t'day it is regarded as a matter o' course, jest th'
                        same as th' typesettin' machine an' th' straight front corset. It is one o'
                        our established customs. It seems t' be impossible t' make th' most
                        commonplace remark without leadin' up t' a knock. Th' one thing above all
                        others, t' my mind, that has furnished more real practice fer th' anvil
                        chorus is th' automobile. What a relief it must be fer a poor auto owner t'
                        git away from his neghbors an'  spin along th'
                        quiet country lanes an' be able t' look int' th' faces o' smilin' cows an'
                        friendly woodpeckers.
                    If knockers don't know anything mean about 
                            FLEEIN' FROM TH' ANVIL CHORUS.
                         somebuddy they'll change th' subject. Ambitious wives with poor
                        husbands make th' worst knockers, unless it's a bookkeeper with twelve
                        children, Even at a weddin' knockers are am- 
                        bushed behind banks o' sweet smellin' blooms, er tall stately palms, waitin'
                        fer a burst o' laughter er th' low mumblin' tones o' th' organ that they may
                        put over a well aimed knock without bein' heard. At th' banquet table, where
                        good cheer an' friendship are supposed t' abide, th' knocker sits with glass
                        turned down an' fumbles his roquefort cheese while he waits fer a chance t'
                        slip one over. When a new baby comes t' brighten th' home an' fond neighbors
                        flock t' shower congratulations er run t' th' drug store, th' knocker is th'
                        first one t' jolly th' mother an' chuck th' tiny pink stranger under th'
                        chin—an' th' first one t' go away an' make fun o' its nose. Even in th'
                        stricken home th' knocker appears an' snoops around with a solemn face an'
                        stands with bared head under a pear tree in th' door yard an' remarks t' his
                        nearest neighbor, "She won't be a widder long."
                    
                    No matter how well a boardin' house is conducted, it seems like it's jest
                        impossible t' keep th' feller who likes t' set around in his undershirt off
                        th' verandy.
                    What's become o' th' feller who used t' refer t' an ole sweetheart as an ole
                        flame?
                    It's jest as wrong fer some folks t' take a vacation as it would be fer 'em
                        t' take a pocket-book.
                    Wherever ther's a courthouse th' jail is hard by.
                    Of all th' home remedies a good wife is th' best.
                
                
                
                    
                        X stands fer Xenia, O., a hamlet o' note,
                        Th' birthplace o' Wilbur Nesbit, toast-master an' poet.
                    
                    "Th' poor we have allus with us," t'gether with th' feller who says, "You
                        won't ketch me in this climate another winter."
                    It's easier t' git t'gether at a banquet than it is at th' polls.
                    Another style o' four flushin' is applaudin' an imitation of an actor you
                        never saw.
                    A crank allus starts somethin'.
                    
                    Let's all join th' good roads movement an* mend our own ways.
                    A feller don't only come back from a vacation tired, but he proceeds t' make
                        ever'buddy else tired.
                    Miss Fawn Lippincut tried t' filmize "Ten Nights in a Barroom," but gave it
                        up. Too many reels.
                    Some folks crave cherry pie, some have a hankerin' fer ice cream, some sigh
                        fer watermelon, while others would give th' world fer somethin' sour, but
                        ther's times in all of our lives when ther hain't nothin' that hits th' spot
                        like ham an' eggs.
                    
                    Ever notice how an office seeker's eyesight fails after he gits what he
                        wants?
                    Lots of us make ourselves more miserable in extreme weather by worryin' about
                        th' folks who could escape it if they wuzn' so stingy.
                    Th' longer it takes you t' select a cantalonpe th' worse it is.
                    Th' honeymoon ends when th' husband puts his wife on an allowance.
                    Since it takes all kinds o' people t' make a world what's th' use o'
                        knockin'?
                
                
                
                    Th' Little Town
                    By Rev. Wiley Tanger
                    Stew Nugent is at home t' put his feet under his mother's table. He has been
                        t' th' city fer three years an' says that th' trouble with a little town is
                        that ever'buddy knows ever'bud-dy else's business. That's th' reason Stew
                        went away, an' it's one o' th' best things about a little town. You know who
                        your next door neighbor is, an' you know who lives over th' hardware store.
                        An' you know who's able t' own a tourin' car.
                    In a city where you don't need no other credentials but a good front it's
                        different. Some folks flourish in a city that couldn' git trust fer a box o'
                        corn flakes in ther home town. Some fellers apologize fer livin' in a little
                        town. When you ask 'em where ther from they color up an' stammer an' say,
                        "I— er—why—I—I'm from Rossville—that is my folks live ther. I've been livin'
                        ther too, but I'm thinkin' o' goin' t' Chicago. Ther's no opportunities in a
                        little town fer a young man."  An' when you
                        size him up you can't help pic-turin' what a flurry he'll cause in Chicago.
                        O' course some folks that go t' th' city succeed, but they've got th' ole
                        home metal in 'em.
                    
                        "I WONDER WHAT THER DOIN' AT HOME?"
                    
                    In th' great city parks th' benches are filled with poor unfortunates from
                        th' little towns who have tried an' failed. Pride alone keeps  'em from returnin' an' they become aimless
                        wanderers an' are lost an' fergotten in th' mist o' time.
                    Some folks jist seem t' be cut out fer th' artificiality o' th' city, an'
                        that's where they ought t' live. But if you want t' live an honest, quiet,
                        peaceful life an' enjoy th' love an' confidence o' your friends an'
                        neighbors, ther's no place like th' little town where one-half th' people
                        knows how th' other half lives, where respectability is a real asset, where
                        a K. of P. watch charm won't save you if you can't toe th' mark, an' where
                        you're remembered long after th' hearse gits back t' th' livery stable.
                
                
                
                    
                        Y stands fer yeller, in hues without number,
                        Pop'lar with journalism an' th' seedlin' cucumber.
                    
                    Why don't th' feller who says, "I'm no speechmaker," let it go at that
                        instead o' givin' a demonstration?
                    Even merit has t' be advertised before it pays.
                    Somehow things never seem th' same agin after your wife comes home with a
                        cute little serviceable ever' day hat without much on it fer $24.
                    Next t' an Osage orange ther hain't nothin' as bitter as a disappointed
                        Democrat.
                    
                    Ther's two critical periods in ever' feller's life—when he wants t' belong t'
                        a band an' when he feels entitled t' an office.
                    When we read about th' spring styles we almost dread t' see th' first
                        robin.
                    Show me a smile that won't come off an' I'll show you a cheerful idiot.
                    Th' feller who quits work in th' evenin' like he wuz leavin' a penitentiary
                        never reaches Easy Street.
                    It must make some folks mad t' feel at home.
                
                
                
                    
                        Z stands fer Zanzibar, in th' tropical zone
                        Where th' belles dress as scantily as our girls here at home.
                    
                    Why does a Republican lawyer allus have a Dimmycratic partner?
