                <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
                <p>It is something of a literary presumption to introduce to any one that can read, a volume that bears
                    on its title page the name of James Whitcomb Riley. And yet because of its departure from the
                    naturally expected, this collection seems to make an introduction not only pertinent but courteous
                    as well.</p>
                <p>When we were all some years younger than we are now, &quot;Benj. F. Johnson of Boone&quot;
                    dipped his rosy muse in the melodious waters of The Old Swimmin&apos;-Hole and brought her forth
                    wearing on her shining forehead the homely but imperishable sign of dialect.</p>
                <p>The century that was then old has gone to its final reckoning, and ten full years have been recorded
                    against its young successor. During this time it has been given to &quot;Benj. F.
                    Johnson&quot; to write much. In the fourteen volumes that now represent his collected verse,
                    almost every poetic form finds a place, and normal English, in distinction from dialect, holds an
                    equal authority. Yet if you say &quot;Riley&quot; to the man in the street he will reply:
                    &quot;When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder&apos;s in the shock.&quot; The
                    poet, I am sure, has no grievance with this answer; nor is there quarrel anywhere with the fixed
                    association of Riley&apos;s name <pb id="VAA2380-009" n="[]"/> with his homelier form of verse.
                    Such an alliance is as worthy as it is inevitable. His destinies are garlanded with old fashioned
                    roses and time will judge him and reward him accordingly.</p>
                <p>As a consequence, however, his normal English verse is not, perhaps, fully recognized either for its
                    extent or for its quality. And so in this belief, as well as in answer to an ever-continuing demand,
                    these poems have been brought together and the volume comprising them named for the little street in
                    which their author has long lived and worked.</p>
                <p>For permission to reprint certain poems here included grateful acknowledgment is made to Messrs.
                    Charles Scribner&apos;s Sons and the Century Company, of New York.</p>

                            <l n="5">I could hear the hungry Winter prowling round the outer door,</l>

                            <l n="8">That mingled with the current of a lazy-flowing dream.</l>

                            <l n="18">On a damask-coveredhassock that was sitting on the hearth;</l>
                            <l n="19">And at a magic signal of his stubby little thumb,</l>
                            <l n="20">I saw the fireplace changing to a bright proscenium.</l>

                            <l n="31">And they threw aside their treasures in an ecstasy of glee,</l>
                            <l n="32">And bent, with dazzled faces and with parted lips, to see.</l>

                            <l n="1">HE called her in from me and shut the door.</l>
                            <l n="2">And she so loved the sunshine and the sky!</l>
                            <l n="3">She loved them even better yet than I</l>
                            <l n="4">That ne&apos;er knew dearth of themmy mother dead,</l>
                            <l n="5">Nature had nursed me in her lap instead:</l>
                            <l n="6">And I had grown a dark and eerie child</l>
                            <l n="7">That rarely smiled,</l>
                            <l n="8">Save when, shut all alone in grasses high,</l>
                            <l n="9">Looking straight up in God&apos;s great lonesome sky</l>
                            <l n="10">And coaxing Mother to smile back on me.</l>
                            <l n="11">&apos;Twas lying thus, this fair girl suddenly</l>
                            <l n="12">Came on me, nestled in the fields beside</l>
                            <l n="13">A pleasant-seeming home, with doorway wide</l>
                            <l n="14">The sunshine beating in upon the floor</l>
                            <l n="15">Like golden rain.</l>
                            <l n="16">O sweet, sweet face above me, turn again</l>
                            <l n="17">And leave me! I had cried, but that an ache</l>
                            <l n="18">Within my throat so gripped it I could make</l>
                            <l n="19">No sound but a thick sobbing. Cowering so,</l>
                            <l n="20">I felt her light hand laid</l>
                            <l n="21">Upon my haira touch that ne&apos;er before</l>
                            <l n="22">Had tamed me thus, all soothed and unafraid</l>
                            <l n="23">It seemed the touch the children used to know</l>
                            <l n="24">When Christ was here, so dear it wasso dear,</l>
                            <l n="25">At once I loved her as the leaves love dew</l>
                            <l n="26">In midmost summer when the days are new.</l>
                            <l n="27">Barely an hour I knew her, yet a curl</l>
                            <l n="28">Of silken sunshine did she clip for me</l>
                            <l n="29">Out of the bright May-morning of her hair,</l>
                            <l n="30">And bound and gave it to me laughingly, no</l>

                            <l n="31">And caught my hands and called me &quot;Little girl,&quot;</l>
                            <l n="32">Tiptoeing, as she spoke, to kiss me there!</l>
                            <l n="33">And I stood dazed and dumb. for very stress</l>
                            <l n="34">Of my great happiness.</l>
                            <l n="35">She plucked me by the gown, nor saw how mean</l>
                            <l n="36">The raimentdrew me with her everywhere:</l>
                            <l n="37">Smothered her face in tufts of grasses green:</l>
                            <l n="38">Put up her dainty hands and peeped between</l>
                            <l n="39">Her fingers at the blossomscrooned and talked</l>
                            <l n="40">To them in strange, glad whispers, as we walked,</l>
                            <l n="41">Said this one was her angel motherthis,</l>

                            <l n="44">Closed her soft eyes and kissed them d&apos;er again.</l>
                            <l n="45">And so did she beguile meso we played,</l>
                            <l n="46">She was the dazzling ShineI, the dark Shade</l>
                            <l n="47">And we did mingle like to these, and thus,</l>
                            <l n="48">Together, made</l>
                            <l n="49">The perfect summer, pure and glorious.</l>
                            <l n="50">So blent we, till a harsh voice broke upon</l>
                            <l n="51">Our happiness.She, startled as a fawn,</l>
                            <l n="52">Cried, &quot;Oh, &apos;tis Father!&quot;all the blossoms gone</l>
                            <l n="53">From out her cheeks as those from out her grasp.</l>
                            <l n="54">Harsher the voice came:She could only gasp</l>
                            <l n="55">Affrightedly, &quot;Good-bye!good-bye! good-bye!&quot;</l>
                            <l n="56">And lo, I stood alone, with that harsh cry</l>
                            <l n="57">Ringing a new and unknown sense of shame</l>
                            <l n="58">Through soul and frame,</l>
                            <l n="59">And, with wet eyes, repeating d&apos;er and d&apos;er,</l>
                            <l n="60">&quot;He called her in from me and shut the door!&quot;&apos;</l>

                            <l n="61">He called her in from me and shut the door!</l>
                            <l n="62">And I went wandering alone again</l>
                            <l n="63">So lonelyO so very lonely then,</l>
                            <l n="64">I thought no little sallow star, alone</l>
                            <l n="65">In all a world of twilight, e&apos;er had known</l>
                            <l n="66">Such utter loneliness. But that I wore</l>
                            <l n="67">Above my heart that gleaming tress of hair</l>
                            <l n="68">To lighten up the night of my despair,</l>
                            <l n="69">I think I might have groped into my grave</l>
                            <l n="70">Nor cared to wave</l>
                            <l n="71">The ferns above it with a breath of prayer.</l>
                            <l n="72">And how I hungered for the sweet, sweet face</l>
                            <l n="73">That bent above me in my hiding-place</l>
                            <l n="74">That day amid the grasses there beside</l>
                            <l n="75">Her pleasant home!&quot;Her pleasant home!&quot; I sighed,</l>
                            <l n="76">Remembering;then shut my teeth and feigned</l>
                            <l n="77">The harsh voice calling methen clinched my nails</l>
                            <l n="78">So deeply in my palms, the sharp wounds pained,</l>
                            <l n="79">And tossed my face toward heaven, as one who pales</l>
                            <l n="80">In splendid martyrdom, with soul serene,</l>
                            <l n="81">As near to God as high the guillotine.</l>
                            <l n="82">And I had envied her? Not thatO no!</l>
                            <l n="83">But I had longed for some sweet haven sol</l>
                            <l n="84">Wherein the tempest-beaten heart might ride</l>
                            <l n="85">Sometimes at peaceful anchor, and abide</l>
                            <l n="86">Where those that loved me touched me with their hands,</l>
                            <l n="87">And looked upon me with glad eyes, and slipped</l>
                            <l n="88">Smooth fingers o&apos;er my brow, and lulled the strands</l>
                            <l n="89">Of my wild tresses, as they backward tipped</l>
                            <l n="90">My yearning face and kissed it satisfied.</l>
                            <l n="91">Then bitterly I murmured as before </l>
                            <l n="92">&quot;He called her in from me and shut the door!&quot;</l>
                            <pb id="VAA2380-123" n="113"/>
                            <l n="93">He called her in from me and shut the door!</l>
                            <l n="94">After long struggling with my pride and pain</l>
                            <l n="95">A weary while it seemed, in which the more</l>
                            <l n="96">I held myself from her, the greater fain</l>
                            <l n="97">Was I to look upon her face again;</l>
                            <l n="98">At lastat lasthalf conscious where my feet</l>
                            <l n="99">Were faring, I stood waist-deep in the sweet</l>
                            <l n="100">Green grasses there where she</l>
                            <l n="101">First came to me.</l>
                            <l n="102">The very blossoms she had plucked that day,</l>
                            <l n="103">And, at her father&apos;s voice, had cast away,</l>
                            <l n="104">Around me lay,</l>
                            <l n="105">Still bright and blooming in these eyes of mine;</l>
                            <l n="106">And as I gathered each one eagerly,</l>
                            <l n="107">I pressed it to my lips and drank the wine</l>
                            <l n="108">Her kisses left there for the honey-bee.</l>
                            <l n="109">Then, after I had laid them with the tress</l>
                            <l n="110">Of her bright hair with lingering tenderness,</l>
                            <l n="111">I, turning, crept on to the hedge that bound</l>
                            <l n="112">Her pleasant-seeming homebut all around</l>
                            <l n="113">Was never sign of her!The windows all</l>
                            <l n="114">Were blinded; and I heard no rippling fall</l>
                            <l n="115">Of her glad laugh, nor any harsh voice call;</l>
                            <l n="116">But, clutching to the tangled grasses, caught</l>
                            <l n="117">A sound as though a strong man bowed his head</l>
                            <l n="118">And sobbed aloneunloveduncomforted!</l>
                            <l n="119">And then straightway before</l>
                            <l n="120">My tearless eyes, all vividly, was wrought</l>
                            <l n="121">A vision that is with me evermore:</l>
                            <l n="122">A little girl that lies asleep, nor hears</l>
                            <l n="123">Nor heeds not any voice nor fall of tears.</l>
                            <l n="124">And I sit singing o&apos;er and o&apos;er and o&apos;er,</l>

                            <l n="4">Of this most patriotic republic on earth!</l>
                            <l n="5">But &apos;twas justice, of course, to admit that the sight</l>
                            <l n="6">Of the old Stars-and-Stripes was a thing of delight</l>

                            <l n="9">That meant not to brook any turbulent glee</l>

                            <l n="18">And its horrible havoc had ever been born!</l>
                            <l n="19">Or to wish, in his wakefulness, staring aghast,</l>

                            <l n="33">Of the national colors, and lured from his purse</l>

                            <l n="39">And a passionate thrill in his breast, as he felt</l>

                            <l n="3">The glory and peace of that slumber of mine,</l>

                            <l n="7">O a nest of delight, from the foot to the head,</l>
                            <l n="8">Was the queer little, dear little, old trundle-bed!</l>

                            <l n="10">The stars through the window, and listened with awe</l>
                            <l n="11">To the sigh of the winds as they tremblingly crept</l>
                            <l n="12">Through the trees where the robin so restlessly slept:</l>
                            <l n="13">Where I heard the low, murmurous chirp of the wren,</l>
                            <l n="14">And the katydid listlessly chirrup again,</l>
                            <l n="15">Till my fancies grew faint and were drowsily led</l>
                            <l n="16">Through the maze of the dreams of the old trundle-bed.</l>

                            <l n="19">Its snowy-white sheets, and the blankets above,</l>
                            <l n="20">Smoothed down and tucked round with the touches of love;</l>
                            <l n="21">The voice of my mother to lull me to sleep</l>
                            <l n="22">With the old fairy stories my memories keep</l>
                            <l n="23">Still fresh as the lilies that bloom o&apos;er the head</l>

                            <l n="84">Upon the tumbled sands that marked the way</l>
                            <l n="85">The robber-woman went, he turned and chased</l>
                            <l n="86">His long black shadow o&apos;er the edge of night.&quot;</l>

                            <l n="88">With such concern as nipped his utterance</l>

                            <l n="90">Lifting a slow smile to the King, and then</l>

                            <l n="102">And found him tethered in a thicket wild,</l>
                            <l n="103">As tangled in its tress of leaf and limb</l>
                            <l n="104">As is a madman&apos;s hair; and down the path</l>
                            <l n="105">That parted it and ran across a knoll</l>
                            <l n="106">And dipped again, all suddenly I came</l>
                            <l n="107">I heard, blown o&apos;er my senses faint and clear</l>
                            <l n="108">As whiffs of summer wind, my brother&apos;s voice</l>
                            <l n="109">Lilting a love-song, with the burden tricked</l>
                            <l n="110">With dainty warblings of a woman&apos;s tongue:</l>
                            <l n="111">And even as I listening bent, I heard</l>

                            <l n="113">For freedom at the bars that prison it.</l>
                            <l n="114">So turned I then and fled as one who flies</l>
                            <l n="115">To save himself alone-forgetful all</l>

                            <l n="132">Pranced from the archway of the court, and led</l>
                            <l n="133">His glittering lances down the gleaming road</l>
                            <l n="134">That river-like ran winding till it slipped</l>
                            <l n="135">Out of the palace view and spilled their shields</l>
                            <l n="136">Like twinkling bubbles o&apos;er the mountain brim.</l>

                            <l n="139">Right merrily. His brother, as he said,</l>

                            <l n="141">Such shallowness of fancy for his heart</l>
                            <l n="142">To drift about inthat he well believed</l>
                            <l n="143">Its anchor would lay hold on any smile</l>
                            <l n="144">The lees of womanhood might offer him</l>
                            <l n="145">As for himself, he loved his brother well,</l>

                            <l n="147">In marble death than that his veins should burn</l>

                            <l n="149">So garishly it knew no steady blaze,</l>
                            <l n="150">But ever wavered round as veered the wind</l>
                            <l n="151">Of his conceit; for he had made his boast</l>
                            <l n="152">Tho&apos; to his own shame did he speak of it</l>
                            <l n="153">That with a wink he could buy every smile</l>
                            <l n="154">That virtue owned. So tattled Raelus</l>

                            <l n="223">As might a maiden lilyblossom be</l>

                            <l n="226">And fondled by the sun, was glossier</l>
                            <l n="227">And bluer black than any raven&apos;s wing.</l>

                            <l n="230">Then drawing rein, and wheeling suddenly,</l>

                            <l n="258">Whereat the others joined with inward glee</l>

                            <l n="260">The knights chimed, too, and he, the vanquished one,</l>

                            <l n="263">And echoes leap and revel in delight.</l>
                            <l n="264">Then spake the vanquished knight, with mental eye</l>
                            <l n="265">Sweeping the vantage-ground that chance had gained,</l>

                            <l n="279">And told you, ere the asking, that he bides</l>
                            <l n="280">The coming of his friends a league from this,</l>
                            <l n="281">Hard by a reedy mere, where in high tune</l>
                            <l n="282">We left him singing, nigh an hour agone.&quot;</l>
                            <l n="283">Then, as she lightly wheeled her horse about</l>
                            <l n="284">To follow, gaily cried: &quot;Tell Raelus</l>

                            <l n="289">Her steed&apos;s hooves struck the highway at a bound;</l>

                            <l n="299">Till, mystified at last and wholly lost,</l>

                            <l n="301">But that a sudden voice brake on their ears</l>
                            <l n="302">All piteous and wailing, as distressed:</l>
                            <l n="303">And, following these cries, they sharply came</l>
                            <l n="304">Upon an open road that circled round</l>
                            <l n="305">A reedy flat and sodden tract of sedge,</l>
                            <l n="306">Moated with stagnant water, crusted thick</l>
                            <l n="307">Entangled, and blind bubbles bulging up</l>
                            <l n="308">And bursting where from middle way upshot</l>
                            <l n="309">A tree-trunk, with its gnarled and warty hands</l>
                            <l n="310">As tho&apos; upheld to clutch at sliding snakes</l>
                            <l n="311">Or nip the wet wings of the dragon-fly.</l>
                            <l n="312">Here gazing, lo! they saw their comrade, he</l>
                            <l n="313">That had gone on with Raelus; and he</l>
                            <l n="314">Was tugging to fling back into its place</l>
                            <l n="315">A heavy log that once had spanned the pool</l>
                            <l n="316">And made a footway to the sedgy flat</l>
                            <l n="317">Whence came the bitter wailing cries they heard.</l>
                            <l n="318">Then hastened they to join him in his task;</l>
                            <l n="319">But, panting, as they asked of Raelus,</l>
                            <l n="320">All winded with his work, yet jollier</l>
                            <l n="321">Than meadow-lark at morn, he sent his voice</l>
                            <l n="322">In such a teittcring of merriment,</l>
                            <l n="323">The wail of sorrow died and laugher strewed</l>
                            <l n="324">Its grave with melody.</l>

                            <l n="327">And even in the weeds that edged the pool</l>
                            <l n="328">Fell wrestling with his mirth.&quot;Why, Raelus,&quot;</l>
                            <l n="329">He said, when he at last could speak again,</l>

                            <l n="335">Then on again; and still a second time</l>

                            <l n="379">Until he did confess such villainy</l>
                            <l n="380">As made me wonder if his wits were sound</l>
                            <l n="381">Confessed himself a renegadea thief</l>
                            <l n="382">Ay, even one of them, save that he knew</l>
                            <l n="383">Not that nice honor even thieves may claim</l>

                            <l n="386">For deafest shame had even stopped my ears</l>
                            <l n="387">But that my wrists were lockt. And when he came</l>

                            <l n="388">To his confession of his lie at court,</l>
                            <l n="389">By which was gained our knightly sympathy</l>
                            <l n="390">And valiant service on this fools&apos; crusade,</l>
                            <l n="391">I seemed to feel the redness of my blush</l>
                            <l n="392">Soak thro&apos; my very soul. There I brake in:</l>
                            <l n="393">Fair lady and most gallant,to my shame</l>
                            <l n="394">Do I admit we have been duped by such</l>
                            <l n="395">An ingrate as this bundled lump of flesh</l>
                            <l n="396">That I am helpless to rise up and spurn:</l>
                            <l n="397">Unbind me, and I promise such amends</l>
                            <l n="398">As knightly hands may deign to wreak upon</l>
                            <l n="399">A thing so vile as he.&apos; Then, laughing, she:</l>

                            <l n="401">Your knightly brothers and my enemies.&apos;</l>
                            <l n="402">To which I answered, truthfully, I knew</l>
                            <l n="403">Not where you lingered, but not close at hand</l>
                            <l n="404">I was assured. Then all abrupt, she turned:</l>

                            <l n="406">And scarce a dozen minutes ere they came</l>
                            <l n="407">Outpouring from the cave in such a guise</l>
                            <l n="408">As made me smile from very wonderment,</l>
                            <l n="409">From head to heel in woman&apos;s dress they came,</l>
                            <l n="410">Clad richly, too, and trapped and tricked withal</l>
                            <l n="411">As maidenly, but in the face and hand,</l>
                            <l n="412">As ever damsels flock at holiday.</l>
                            <l n="413">Then were their chargers bro&apos;t, caparisoned</l>
                            <l n="414">In keeping; and they mounted, lifting us,</l>
                            <l n="415">Still bounden, with much jest and mockery</l>
                            <l n="416">Of soft caress and wanton blandishments,</l>
                            <l n="417">As tho&apos; they were of sex their dress declared.</l>
                            <l n="418">And so they carried us until they came</l>
                            <l n="419">Upon the road there as it nicks the copse;</l>
                            <pb id="VAA2380-385" n="375"/>
                            <l n="420">And so drew rein, dismounted, leaving some</l>
                            <l n="421">To guard their horses; hurried us across</l>
                            <l n="422">This footway to the middle of the flat.</l>
                            <l n="423">Here Raelus was bounden to a tree,</l>
                            <l n="424">Stript to the waist; my fetters cut, and then</l>
                            <l n="425">A long, keen switch put in my hand, and &apos;Strike!</l>
                            <l n="426">Strike as all duty bids you!&apos; said the queen.</l>
                            <l n="427">And so I did, with right good will at first;</l>
                            <l n="428">Till, softened as I heard the wretch&apos;s prayers</l>
                            <l n="429">Of anguish, I at last withheld my hand.</l>
                            <l n="430">&apos;What! tiring?&apos; chirpt the queen: &apos;Give me the

                            <l n="431">And swish, and swish, and mercy how it rained!</l>
                            <l n="432">Then all the others, forming circlewise,</l>
                            <l n="433">Danced round and round the howling wretch, and jeered</l>
                            <l n="434">And japed at him, and mocked and scoffed at him,</l>
                            <l n="435">And spat upon him. And I turned away</l>
                            <l n="436">And hid my face; then raised it pleadingly:</l>
                            <l n="437">Nor would they listen my appeal for him;</l>
                            <l n="438">But left him so, and thonged and took me back</l>
                            <l n="439">Across the mere, and drew the bridge, that none</l>
                            <l n="440">Might go to him, and carried me with them</l>
                            <l n="441">And back I turned, tho&quot; loath, to succor him.&quot;</l>
                            <l n="442">And even as he ceased they heard the wail</l>
                            <l n="443">And Raelus they found, and without word</l>
                            <l n="444">They loosed him. And he brake away and ran</l>
                            <l n="445">As runs a lie the truth is hard upon.</l>
                        </lg>

                            <l n="447">Who knew of it said naught at court of it,</l>
                            <l n="448">Nor from that day spake ever of him once,</l>
                            <l n="449">Nor heard of him again, nor cared to hear.</l>

                            <l n="2" rend="ti-1">With a neck apoplectic and thick</l>
                            <l n="3">An abdomen on him as big as a drum,</l>
                            <l n="4" rend="ti-1">And a fist big enough for the stick;</l>
                            <l n="5">With a walk that for grace is clear out of the case,</l>
                            <l n="6" rend="ti-1">And a wobble uncertain-as though</l>
                            <l n="7">His little bow-legs had forgotten the pace</l>
                            <l n="8" rend="ti-1">That in youth used to favor him so.</l>

                            <l n="11">And his nose and his two chubby cheeks are as red</l>
