                    wildfire," one writer has observed, "the Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s largely remains
                    a historical enigma."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Over the past eight decades analysts of the
                    movement have offered widely varying assessments and explanations. Early studies tended to portray
                    the Klan as a reactionary movement based on ignorance and fear, centered in rural or small-town
                    America, and pursuing a nativist or racist agenda aimed against blacks, Catholics, Jews, and
                    foreigners. Similar views continued to prevail in the 1950s; such historians as John Higham, Richard
                    Hofstadter, and William Leuchtenburg stressed the Klan's violence and vigilantism, aimed at
                    white Protestant moral slackers as well as minorities, and depicted its members as economically
                        marginal.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the 1960s, however, one could discern a shift from this orthodox position. Kenneth
                    Jackson's 1967 study, <hi rend="i">The Ku Klux Klan in the City</hi>, pointed to the
                    Klan's substantial urban following. Although his account acknowledged some Klan
                    vigilantism, he contended that the "most distinguishing characteristic of urban Klansmen
                    was a preoccupation with politics." During the 1970s and 1980s there appeared a substantial
                    number of works that so challenged previous portrayals of the Klan that one could begin to speak of
                    a revisionist school of thought. Although their conclusions were not uniform, revisionists generally
                    stressed that there were significant variations in the Klan movement depending on locality and that
                    the focus of study should be on regional or local Klans. They questioned traditional assertions that
                    Klan members came primarily from marginal economic groups and that they were especially prone to
                    violence or irrational behavior. Instead, they argued, klansmen fell mostly within the economic and
                    social mainstream. Revisionists concluded that genuine local problems such as political corruption,
                    vice, and the violation of Prohibition played more of a role in generating local Klan movements than
                    did ethnic, racial, or religious prejudice, although often such prejudice was interwoven with these
                    other concerns.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

            <p>Perhaps the most avowedly revisionist work is Leonard Moore's <hi rend="i">Citizen Klansmen:
                        The Ku Klux Klan in Indiana, 1921-1928.</hi> Moore demonstrated that members represented a wide
                    occupational cross section of white Protestants but with few supporters from either the economic
                    elite or the poor. He maintained that in Indiana the Klan movement was "essentially
                    decentralized and community-oriented." Moore's thesis was that the Indiana Klan of
                    the 1920s, although nativist in tone, could best be understood as a populist organization that
                    "concerned itself primarily not with persecuting ethnic minorities but with promoting the
                    ability of average citizens to influence the workings of society and government." Disturbed
                    by crime, political corruption, and lax Prohibition enforcement, Klan members "sought to
                    revitalize a sense of social and civic unity in community life and uphold traditional religious and
                    moral values." He suggested that the extreme rhetoric directed against Catholics and aliens
                    was largely hyperbole; that the Klan's anti-Catholicism and xenophobia were commonly
                    accepted parts of white Protestant culture in Indiana; that boycotts against Catholic and Jewish
                    merchants were generally ineffective; and that there were few if any documented instances of Indiana
                    Klan members using direct physical violence against individuals from minority groups. Instead, the
                    Klan's primary targets were the political and economic elites who had become locally
                    dominant by the 1920s and whom the Klan saw as hostile or apathetic toward moral and political
                    reform. Moore contended that the Klan movement could be described as a "white Protestant
                    nationalism" with a "capacity to arouse a sense of solidarity… to unite
                    disparate groups… to assert a powerful populist influence in community life."<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

                        of view. Kathleen Blee emphasizes the violent, racist, nativist, anti-Catholic and anti-Semitic
                        dimensions of the movement, and Nancy MacLean regards the Nan as a petit-bourgeois,

                            as a fairly accurate count at a time when Klan membership in Indiana had already passed its

                    organized in the 1840s. In the 1870s St. John's Catholic Church was built, and during the
                    early 1890s the Sisters of <placeName>

                    Irish immigrants in the late nineteenth century, the Catholic population grew. By 1926 the census
                    showed 830 Catholics in the county; they represented the third largest religious group after the
                    Methodists (2,503) and the Disciples of Christ (2,195). The Jewish population consisted of just

                            analysis "confirms that the size of the Indiana Klan in 1925 was not influenced by
                            either the urban or rural status of potential members" and concludes that the Klan
                            found enthusiastic support in both urban and rural regions. <hi rend="i">Ibid.</hi>, 59-60.

                    </placeName> would soon be the scene of active Klan organizing. The Tribune reported that several
                    members of the community had already been initiated into the Klan the previous April, although there
                    was not yet any formal klavern, or local unit. Throughout early October there were serious efforts
                    at recruitment, but one organizer suggested disappointment at the initial meager results,
                    commenting, "I am working night and day to do the best I can." There had even been
                    difficulty keeping the cross burning at one Klan rally, leading to the organizers' decision
                    to use an electric cross on future occasions.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On October 16 the Klan sponsored a by-invitation-only meeting at the Old Woodman's Hall.
                    Some two hundred and fifty invitations were sent out, and the Klan hoped to attract one hundred new
                    members. While the organizers obtained assistance from the nearby <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kokomo</settlement>
                    </placeName> klavern and attempted to create an air of mystery and intrigue about the event,
                    according to the Tribune only about one hundred persons attended, and most of them did not
                    immediately join. But a week later a local Methodist minister, Asher S. Preston, presented a
                    pro-Klan address at his church to a crowd estimated at more than a thousand. In his address Preston
                    represented the Klan as a "one-hundred-percent American" organization dedicated to
                    moral reform; he spoke in favor of racial segregation and warned of the dangers posed by an
                    "antidemocratic" Catholic Church and by Jewish bankers and revolutionaries.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                    </placeName> Klan strove to enhance its visibility in the county by means commonly used by klaverns
                    throughout the nation. Members distributed baskets of food to needy families, and robed klansmen
                    descended upon church services throughout the county, leaving donations with the pastors. They
                    staged well-publicized "Klan funerals," featuring huge floral tributes in the
                    shape of a cross. The first of these was held in April 1923 for charter member John D. Smith and was
                    supervised by a company of forty-two robed klansmen. But probably the most successful methods of
                    promotion were the public demonstrations, picnics, and parades that the Klan held in the town of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                    </placeName> and in the smaller communities of the county, such as Sharpsville, Kempton, Windfall,
                    and Goldsmith. The appearance of hundreds of robed marchers and fiery crosses undoubtedly made a
                    dramatic impression on these small villages. In 1923 alone there were at least seventeen public Klan
                    demonstrations throughout the county. On April 24, at an event described by the Tribune as
                    "immense in every phase," a reported crowd of two thousand robed klansmen gathered
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                    </placeName> to attend a rally and parade that featured three visiting bands, two drum corps,
                    horsemen, American flags, and the fiery cross, as well as the initiation of four hundred Klan
                    candidates and an address by evangelist E. J. Bulgin. The following month the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Klan announced they had organized a twenty-piece band, and in November the Klan hosted
                    a reportedly well-attended state meeting. Soon after, the KKK band leased the Martz theater to show
                    D. W. Griffith's <hi rend="i">The Birth of a Nation</hi>, which celebrated the original
                    post-Civil War Klan. On Christmas eve a large crowd gathered to see a fiery cross that illuminated
                    the entire courthouse square; the event was followed by Christmas caroling by klansmen and
                        klanswomen.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

                    </placeName> Klan experienced some difficulties in establishing women's organizations in
                    the county. The first effort in January 1923 floundered when the main speaker failed to appear
                    before an audience of sixty to seventy women assembled in the public library. Press reports also
                    show that the Kamelia, a women's group established by former Imperial Wizard William J.
                    Simmons, who had been ousted by Hiram W. Evans as national Klan leader in 1922, competed for members
                    with the Evans-approved Women of the Ku Klux Klan. According to Kathleen Blee's study, <hi rend="i">Women of the Klan</hi>, such organizational differences and strife were typical. Yet,
                    in the end, if <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> accounts are to be believed, several hundred women

                    pattern detected in a number of studies, including Moore's, in which the earlier members of

                    klansmen on the 1924 lists for whom occupations are known were listed in the 1920 census as having

                    </placeName> Klan membership with blue-collar workers was the general distribution of population in

                    </placeName> whose names do not appear on the available Klan membership lists reveals that those in
                    blue-collar jobs outnumbered white-collar workers by a significant margin—151 to 70, or
                    68.3 percent to 31.7 percent—among the adult men who were not engaged in agriculture.
                    Thus it would appear that white-collar workers were actually overrepresented in the 1924 Klan,

                    significantly overrepresented in the 1924 man, since they formed nearly one fifth of the members and
                    only 8 percent of the 590 whose names were not on the Klan list.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

            <p>This distribution reveals that farmers, although a majority in the above sample, were noticeably
                    underrepresented in Klan membership, even when the comparison is made with the 1922 Klan lists where
                    farmers represented 37.5 percent of the members. One explanation for this discrepancy may be the
                    heavy concentration of Catholics in the farming areas of the county.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> In
                    contrast, white-collar occupations were substantially overrepresented in both the 1922 and 1924 Klan
                    lists, and semiskilled workers were very much overrepresented in the 1924 list. It is also
                    interesting that although the high-white-collar category constituted only 12.6 percent of the 1922
                    Klan membership lists and 5.5 percent of the 1924 Klan membership lists, this category formed just
                    4.7 percent of the general non-Klan sample. Thus, while it is true that the <placeName>

            <p>The availability of 1920 census figures also permits a comparison of age distribution between those

                    fined. The mayor responded defensively that under his administration the town had been freer from

                    its moral crusade. In March 1925 the paper, which lacked an editorial page but freely interjected
                    its views in its news stories, remarked that the "drastic" manner in which the
                    county had handled liquor violations "has brought it down to the point where a bootlegger
                    in this territory is about as scarce as Ku Klux at a Knights of <placeName>

                    boasted that the county now stood "at the top of the dry column in the

                    the county, declaring that every child should be taught "to respect Sunday, the day of rest

                    traditionalists about a decline of morals during the jazz age, particularly among youth. The
                    flouting of Prohibition, the raucous music and dancing, the sexual explicitness of Hollywood films,
                    and the new personal freedoms permitted by the automobile all contributed to this concern, and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                    </placeName> was hardly immune. Modern dancing, an impassioned evangelist at the West Street
                    Christian Church proclaimed, "is immodest, it is immoral, and wicked. It breaks down all
                    modesty, it cultivates familiarity that leads to brazenness, it destroys that innate modesty and
                    innocence that is the charm of young womenhood [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>], and the glory of
                    manhood…." A particularly sore point was the decision of the proprietors of the
                    Sand Island Amusement Park on the west edge of town to remain open on Sundays and to permit dancing.
                    Despite protests organized by local pastors and elders, some of whom had Klan affiliations, the
                    park's first Sunday opening took place shortly before Christmas 1924 and was well attended,
                    although the <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> claimed most of the crowd came from <hi rend="i">neighboring</hi> towns. The presence of bootleg alcohol at the park was another cause of concern;
                    after much agitation, a raid, and an unsuccessful effort to prosecute, the Sand Island dance hall
                    was finally padlocked in 1928 for a year under court order.<hi rend="sup">39</hi>

            <p>Juvenile delinquency became an increasing concern in the community, not only because young men were
                    arrested for the illegal consumption of alcohol but also because girls were accused of sexual
                    misconduct. Investigations launched by a newly appointed probation officer revealed "a

                    on moral reform. Yet its involvement in local politics was somewhat less typical. The Klan has been
                    viewed as operating primarily in Indiana through the Republican party, although there were Democrats
                    in its ranks. And in a number of communities the Klan's moral campaigns were linked with

                    proportion of political candidates from both political parties had Klan connections that its impact
                    was canceled out in elections. In 1924 both the Democratic and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Republican county</region>
                    </placeName> chairmen were Klan members. There was a split in the county races, with five Democrats
                    and four Republicans winning— and of these victors, three Democrats and one Republican
                    were identified in Klan records as members. The Klan's showing was even stronger in the
                    1925 city elections. Of the six men elected to city office (four Democrats and two Republicans),
                    four (three Democrats and one Republican) can be identified as Klan members or former members,
                    including both the new Democratic mayor and his defeated Republican opponent. The Klan's
                    own 1925 report stated, "All [Tip-ton] county officials are sympathetic and most of them

            <p>Open anti-Klan sentiment among Protestants did not take any concerted political or economic form; it
                    was small and found in very isolated expressions. In the fall of 1922, just as the Klan was
                    beginning to organize in the county, the Reverend J. J. Ashenhurst of the Bethesda Presbyterian
                    Church, six miles southwest of the town of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                    </placeName>, vigorously attacked the Klan before a reportedly large audience, asserting that the
                    order was un-American, unpatriotic, and unchristian. He soon after sent a letter to the Tribune,
                    noting the opposition of the Federal Council of the Protestant Churches of America to secret, masked
                    organizations that generated religious prejudices and racial antipathies. In April of the following
                    year Judge Earl Stroup of the <placeName>

            <p>After the summer of 1923, as the Klan made more inroads in the community, public criticism ceased,
                    except by the Catholics. Not until the spring of 1926, well after the conviction of former Grand
                    Dragon Stephenson for second-degree homicide in the death of Madge Oberholtzer, did the local paper
                    report another instance of a Protestant objecting to bigotry, and this was from an outsider. At the
                    Tip-ton High School commencement Methodist Bishop Edwin Holt Hughes denounced the "low

                    "ethnic conflict… played only a minor role in the success of the Klan

                    local neighborhoods of Catholics, Jews or blacks…. Given the insignificant threat these
                    groups represented to white Protestant dominance and the fact that numerous means already existed to
                    control them if it appeared necessary," Moore wrote, "Klan chapters generally had

            <p>Alfred Fletcher was a key figure in the drive against Catholics. A minister as well as prosecutor, he
                    was publicly identified with the Klan as early as November 1923. Not listed as an officer in the
                    1925 Klan rolls, by the next year he emerged as the local organization's leading public
                    spokesman. As prosecutor he had made little effort to conceal his anti-Catholicism; he even traveled
                    outside the county to Hope, Indiana, to deliver a lecture on "The Beast and His Image vs.
                    The Invisible Empire," in which he condemned "Roman political
                    machinations." Fletcher created a stir in early 1927 when as a private attorney he filed a
                    writ of habeas corpus against the mother superior of the local <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s Catholics felt during the Klan era. One Catholic resident who was in her
                    early teens when the Klan was at its zenith testified decades later to the fear and anger her family
                    experienced; a slightly older Catholic resident remembered that he had sensed little apprehension
                    among his coreligionists. The <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> reported that John Langan, who was active in

                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> and superintendent of the electric utility department, lost his job in early 1926 when
                    the newly elected mayor, a Klan member, combined that department with the water plant. But despite
                    rumors that the Klan might burn crosses at the convent or march on St. John's Church,
                    apparently nothing like this occurred. The Knights of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> were prompted to sponsor two public lectures that denounced movements that generated
                    hate, and at least one Catholic wrote to the <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> challenging Klan accusations
                    against the church. Probably the most dramatic action taken by Catholics was a boycott of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Free Fair during the summer of 1923, when the fair's board of directors agreed
                    to have one day designated as "Klan Day," at which the main speaker would be
                    Secretary of State Ed Jackson, widely assumed to be the Klan's candidate in the next
                    gubernatorial election. The <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> characterized the controversy as a
                    "regrettable situation" that had resulted from "a comparatively minor
                    affair." <hi rend="i">Fiery Cross</hi> presented the outcome as a victory against
                    un-American forces and charged that the boycott was really the work of Pat O'Donnell,

                    engaged in small retail businesses, they probably were not in a position to be very outspoken.

                    boycotts is also unclear, although Simon Rosenthal, the most prominent figure in this group, gave up
                    his clothing business in 1925. Rosenthal was a pivotal figure in raising funds to develop a city
                    park in 1913, and during the 1920s he served as fire chief under Mayor Standerford, <list type="footnotes">

                        lynchings.<hi rend="sup">54</hi> While the Klan's racist rhetoric and commitment to
                    white supremacy had considerable appeal in such an environment, it would appear that this racism was
                    something that the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                    </placeName> Klan exploited rather than generated.</p>
            <p>The situation in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                    </placeName> thus provides some evidence to support Moore's position. Prejudice against
                    minorities predated the rise of the Klan; it appears that such prejudice was not the only reason
                    people gravitated towards the organization; and there is no clear evidence of the use of physical
                    violence against minorities. Yet, whether or not the Klan had "reason" to harass
                    minorities, the harassment certainly occurred. The TWK campaigns in some instances may have been
                    less than completely effective; some Catholics may not have felt personally endangered; and there is
                    even evidence that at least some Klan leaders regarded Fletcher as too extreme.<hi rend="sup">55</hi> Yet possibly religion was a factor in John Langan's removal from office, and
                    Catholics were sufficiently disturbed that they sponsored lectures on tolerance and boycotted the
                    county fair.</p>
            <p>Perhaps Moore's most controversial assertion is that, despite the corruption among the top
                    leadership and despite the resistance they often evoked from community elites, klaverns represented
                    a genuinely unifying force among white, native-born Protestants. Moore contends that the Klan stood
                    for preserving an older definition of community against a newer one based on business success. Klan
                    chapters, he wrote, "forcefully asserted the notion that the essence of community was its
                    shared ethnic culture, not simply its ability to generate profit."<hi rend="sup">56</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true that the Klan was able to gather under its banners a remarkably high percentage of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                    </placeName>'s white, native-born Protestants and to mobilize them in a crusade to protect
                    some traditional values. Yet in the end the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Klan movement appeared to generate more disharmony in this community than unity.</p>
            <p>First, the Klan's significant attrition of membership suggested its inability to unite the
                    community. In his detailed master's thesis on the Indiana Klan, <placeName>

                    long. The available records reveal that the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Klan, despite the many who passed through its ranks, had difficulty sustaining a
                    consistent membership. Members not only had to pay an initiation fee but were assessed dues and
                    taxes. These assessments contributed to dissension and divisions within the ranks of the Hoosier

                    thus be suspended alarmed state Klan officials enough to prompt them to send memos to local leaders
                    urging them to conduct special campaigns to reinstate these lapsed klansmen. Of the 1,067 names that
                    appear in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Klan records, 656 (or 61.5 percent) had been suspended at least one time, presumably
                    for nonpayment of dues. Of those suspended, 230 were eventually reinstated, but the figures suggest
                    the difficulty of sustaining membership; in fact 38 members were suspended more than once.<hi rend="sup">57</hi>

            <p>Secondly, although the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Klan pursued a reform agenda, its crusades often generated friction and suspicion even
                    within its own ranks. A case in point is the career of Fletcher, who as prosecutor became involved
                    in a public dispute in November 1923. His adversary was the junior high school principal, another
                    klansman who later served as the klavern's chaplain. Fletcher had charged two vendors with
                    illegally selling cigarettes to minors. After it was revealed that the principal had instructed the
                    students to make the purchase Fletcher dismissed the charges, but at the same time he accused the
                    principal of contributing to delinquency. Fletcher was officially "naturalized" as
                    a Klan member in the third quarter of 1924, shortly before his bid for reelection, but he was
                    soundly defeated, even though fellow klansmen swept the positions of circuit judge, sheriff,
                    surveyor, and treasurer by considerable margins. In 1926 and 1928 he also met defeat in the
                    Republican primaries when he ran for prosecutor. During the 1927 controversy over the
                    "kidnapped" nun at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName>'s convent, Fletcher's charges were publicly refuted by the sheriff, a
                    Democrat who had also been associated with the Klan.<hi rend="sup">58</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although the Klan had pledged itself to an anticorruption campaign, and although a large number of
                    city and county posts were held by klansmen from both major parties, they did not appear to work in
                    unison as a political machine, as the 1927 dispute between Fletcher and the Democratic sheriff
                    illustrated. By 1928 rumors circulated concerning the activities of current and former county
                    officials, and in July the deposed superintendent of the Cicero Creek <list type="footnotes">

                    sordid details were loath to believe they were true," as the Tribune delicately put it. The
                    minister was formally charged with the rape of two girls under the age of sixteen, and the state
                    alleged that this abuse was part of a long pattern. Some who had been associated with the Klan
                    rallied to Noland's support by contributing to his bond, and Noland denied the charges. A

                    activities of the Phi Delta Kappa fraternity, which according to a 1922 Klan document had served as
                    a front for the Invisible Empire. The nature of any continued connection between the two
                    organizations remains unclear, but it is interesting to note that the first Tribune article on the
                    fraternity indicated that inactive members might reinstate their membership without paying a
                    reinstatement fee and that the names of all four men listed as its temporary officers appear in the

                    its own unique jargon was "Non Silba Sed Anthar," meaning "not self but
                    others"—the whole movement was so beset by huckstering and the pursuit of
                    self-gain that one has to wonder not just about the leaders' motives, but also those of the

                    reflected the manner in which the Klan of the 1920s "adapted to contemporary fashions in

                    a role on every level. For example, the TWK program was designed not only to discriminate against
                    Catholic and Jewish enterprises but also to enhance the fortunes of klansmen.<hi rend="sup">67</hi>
                    The Klan, despite its objections to the degrading effect on youth of the "Jew-produced

            <p>The term "populist" that Moore uses to describe the Klan movement in Indiana
                    implies a grass roots endeavor. There is certainly validity to the claim that local Klans had
                    agendas that reflected community concerns, but one must ask if there really could have been much of
                    a Klan movement without the top leadership, state and local, who obviously had independent
                    interests. Perhaps it is to be expected that the one local history of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tipton County</region>
                    </placeName> that mentions the Klan— and then only briefly—reports that
                    "after people realized its leaders used it to further selfish purposes, they withdrew. Upon
                    deposit of a fee of $10, members were proclaimed 100-percent Americans. This is about all
                    the benefit its members realized from their money."69 This is somewhat self-serving, to be
                    sure, but it nonetheless contains an element of truth.</p>

                    Fletcher had proposed Bible study in public schools as a remedy for juvenile delinquency and

                    "arrogant" klansmen vilified Catholics and Jews.<hi rend="sup">73</hi> The candor
                    and accuracy of such individual reflections may be open to question, but in aggregate such
                    statements reflect the complexities of possible motives. We must also keep in mind that the Klan in
                    the 1920s operated in a context in which joining fraternities, each with its own set of elaborate
                    rituals and extensive social activities, was much more commonplace than today and that Klan
                    membership was often encouraged by local clergymen, if not by national church leaders and
                        publications.<hi rend="sup">74</hi>

            <p>It seems safe then to suggest that for a variety of reasons historians will continue to find the
                    truth about the Klan movement of the 1920s elusive. If the revisionists provide no final answers,
                    they at least raise important issues that need to be considered. An examination of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                    </placeName> Klan to some degree bears out the revisionist hypothesis. It gathered into its ranks a
                    broad spectrum of residents and to a certain extent operated as a social action group aimed at
                    addressing genuine social issues in a time of rapid cultural change. It tapped and reflected, rather
                    than initiated, the community's prejudices against Catholics, Jews, African Americans, and
                    foreigners, but there is no evidence of direct violence being employed against any of these groups.
                    It is perhaps significant that the old vigilante Horse Thief Detective Association was revived in
                    1923 in the county in the wake of the Klan's success. Possibly some klansmen took action
                    along with the association against "moral slackers," although there is little
                    surviving evidence of what occurred in <placeName>

            <p>In the late 1830s rumors spread that two Catholic priests in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> had sexually assaulted several young women. In May 1836 Presbyterian editor Nathan
                    Lewis Rice claimed that David Alexander Deparcq, a chaplain of a Catholic girls' school in
                    Calvary, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, had seduced and then abducted a female penitent. A year later in nearby <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName> an anonymous Protestant writer charged another Catholic clergyman, Edward McMahon, with
                    lewd behavior toward the schoolgirls under his care. Neither charge was brought before a court
                    though both accusations enlivened public conversation for some time. In order to explain the
                    anti-Catholic climate that may have advanced these kinds of allegations, historians of the
                    Protestant crusade have chronicled widespread fear of European Catholic immigration, as well as more
                    specific suspicion directed at the growing number of Catholic schools.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Yet
                    another, largely unexplored, incident suggests a different interpretation. On May 6, 1842, a priest
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, was formally charged with rape of a female penitent. The subsequent trial
                    gained national attention. Most earlier commentators, as well as more recent accounts of the story,
                    describe the priest as a victim of "a deep-set hatred of Catholics, existing all over the
                        country."<hi rend="sup">2</hi> A reexamination of the circumstances surrounding the
                    case, however, identifies more personal motives and qualifies the claim that anti-Catholic bigotry
                    was widespread.</p>
            <p>Catholics were few in southwestern Indiana before the 1840s. In the summer of 1836 the Indiana state

                    religious duties." At least twice while hearing confessions Weinzaepfel withheld absolution
                    (that is, remission of guilt for sin), convinced that the penitents had not yet thoroughly examined

                    ill will from Catholics and Protestants alike, and some of them soon became Weinzaepfel's

                    of the Assumption. According to her later testimony, while in the box he scolded her for being proud
                    and for dressing better than she could afford, or at least better than her neighbors. Because of
                    this admonition she confided to another individual that Weinzaepfel was "a good priest
                    because he talked to her, and advised her as other priests had done." But on New

                    immigrant named Martin Schmoll. He was a somewhat older Lutheran widower of some means, who seemed
                    no more familiar with the Catholic faith than he was with Maria—they had met just a week

            <p>Maria's father, Lewis Long, did not approve of the marriage and asked Weinzaepfel to
                    investigate its validity. Since Weinzaepfel did not know secular or church law concerning this
                    matter, he sought the advice of the bishop. Hailandière admitted that the union was
                    lawful, even though in his mind Maria had committed a grievous sin in marrying outside the church.
                    Hailandière also suggested that Long persuade Martin Schmoll to promise that he would not
                    interfere with the religious duties of his wife. On Sunday, May 1, 1842, Schmoll signed a
                    certificate before two witnesses in which he pledged to allow his wife to raise their children as
                    Catholics and to "never… afflict through word or deed her Catholic
                    conscience." Though Weinzaepfel accepted the bond, he doubted its sincerity.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Maria had not been to church since her marriage and hoped to attend mass on May 5, Ascension
                    Thursday. She had been taught that Catholics should take communion on that day more than any other,
                    but first she felt compelled to confess her sins and asked her husband to find Weinzaepfel. Schmoll
                    looked for the priest at the home of Heinrich, who told Schmoll that Weinzaepfel would return to
                    church later that evening. Schmoll said he would send his wife, but he also told Heinrich that she
                    should spend as little time as possible in church since he wanted her home to care for household
                    duties and especially to prepare his dinner. About five or six o'clock that evening
                    Heinrich escorted Maria to Weinzaepfel's confessional. Heinrich then left the building, and
                    Maria's confession was heard. Among other things Weinzaepfel chastised her for marrying a
                    Protestant. Maria returned home just after dark.</p>
            <p>Two days later Schmoll stormed back to church and demanded that Weinzaepfel return the certificate
                    Schmoll had signed several days before. The priest surrendered the document and inquired what had
                    provoked this change of mind. Schmoll then accused Weinzaepfel of raping his wife after having heard
                    her confession. "Had I done this," the priest replied, "I would be the
                    worst man in the world!"<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Later that same day Weinzaepfel was formally

                    she fell off her chair and fainted. Prosecuting attorneys James Davis and James E. Blythe announced
                    that she was pregnant and simply too ill to continue. Weinzaepfel's Protestant counsel,
                    brothers William T. T. Jones and James G. Jones, demanded time for cross-examination, but Schmoll
                    shouted that he would not allow his wife to be detained or abused any longer."</p>

            <p>A group of Schmoll supporters, some of whom lived in his house, took over the courtroom and attempted
                    to seize Weinzaepfel, and some Irish friends barely managed to rescue him. Order eventually was
                    restored, but Maria apparently had not yet recovered. Her account of the event would be completed
                    later. In the meantime the Schmoll supporters grew irate and began to consume alcohol. It was not
                    uncommon for drunken groups to terrorize western cities during this period; in March 1843 over a
                    thousand persons would loot several recently failed banks in <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>The bail for Weinzaepfel was raised from $2,000 to $4,000, and it was instantly
                    pledged by twelve courageous men. One supporter was severely beaten, and others were harassed by the
                    now thoroughly drunken mob, which roamed the streets carrying torches throughout the night, forcibly
                    entering a number of Catholic homes, including Heinrich's. Their battle cry was
                    "Whiskey on the death of the priest!" even though plenty of whiskey had already
                    been consumed. A few "right minded Protestants" tried in vain to stop the
                        violence.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> The mob finally located Weinzaepfel at the residence of a Mr.
                    Stahlhoefer, a Catholic, and threatened to burn down the place if he did not deliver the priest.
                    Weinzaepfel hid in a closet under the stairs while another Catholic, a Dr. McDonald, distracted the
                    mob by freeing many of their horses from the public hitching post.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two Catholic allies named O'Connell and Walsh quickly disguised Weinzaepfel in a dress and

                    the priest through the woods to the towpath of the canal. There Weinzaepfel set off on his own

                    Weinzaepfel, Hailandiere was convinced that the priest was innocent. The bishop showed his support
                    by not relieving Weinzaepfel of his priestly duties but instead assigning him to the <placeName>

                    civil duties with church interests and thus donned an antirepublican spirit. In response to these

                    </placeName> where according to one report, "he was greeted on all hands, both by
                    Protestants and Catholics, many of the former calling on him for the purpose of expressing their
                    conviction of his innocence." Although most favored the accused, a significant minority
                    clearly did not. A few men intimidated the proprietor of the Sherwood Hotel, who consequently
                    refused Weinzaepfel lodging. Others threatened to harm the priest, hoping that he might leave town.
                    But Weinzaepfel courageously remained. On September 29, he pleaded not guilty before Elisha Embree,
                    the presiding judge of the <placeName>

                    that, as he argued, sufficient evidence could be gathered. In fact, however, he hoped that with time
                    the anti-Catholic fever would subside. Embree postponed the proceedings to March 1843. fir continued

                    </placeName>, Maria longed for a husband despite the insistence of her parents that she should not
                    marry, not even to, as Hein put it, "the sickest man [that is, the individual most in need
                    of a wife] in <placeName>

                    </placeName>."<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Maria grudgingly took a job as a domestic with Charles
                    H. and Elizabeth Ann Winter on Lower Market Street. Mr. Winter described Maria as "a large
                    and powerful girl" who actively sought male companionship.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> Within a
                    few weeks he chastised her for repeated nighttime rendezvous with at least one unnamed man. After
                    she violated a curfew, Mr. Winter locked her out. The following day she returned to pack up her
                    things, and, furious with her employer, she hid in her suitcase a silk handkerchief belonging to
                    Winter and some undergarments belonging to his wife. Maria then fled to Hein's grocery
                    where she got drunk with young male patrons, including her brother Jacob. Mrs. Winter later found
                    Maria in the store and was able to recoup about five dollars' worth of stolen property.</p>
            <p>Maria subsequently lived in a variety of places. For example, during the "Big Snow"
                    of late 1840 she resided for a month with Isaac Adkins. In the middle of this stay she hurt her hand
                    severely while washing. For a few weeks in January 1841 she lived with Mary and John J. Webb, who
                    considered her a very good girl. She was the godmother of a child of Earhart Geyer and also rented
                    part of Catherine Rhinehart's pew at the German St. Mary's Catholic Church, where
                    she fell behind in paying church dues.</p>
            <p>In March she went with Mina to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> to attend to her dying mother. During this time, probably at the funeral, Maria must
                    have met Weinzaepfel. That summer she returned alone to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> dressed in mourning. For two weeks in June she boarded with Susan Gray at Captain

                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Just before returning to the city she was accused of stealing a handkerchief. She then
                    took a room on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Broadway</settlement>
                    </placeName> at a boardinghouse operated by Susan's parents, Jane and Oliver Gray. After
                    only a few weeks Mr. Gray accused her of stealing a brooch and wedding ring. She denied the
                    accusation, but moments after the brooch was found Maria was seen in the vicinity. She consequently

            <p>Sometime during all these moves Maria hurt her foot. Several persons, including Catherine Broksat and
                    Rhinehart, periodically checked on her condition. On one occasion they watched her lift her dress as
                    high as her knee in order to expose the wound to several men. Broksat and Rhinehart reproved her for
                    what they considered to be unladylike behavior. Disregarding this reprimand, she later showed the
                    sore to George Kehn by lifting her dress to her knee, this time in broad daylight on Fifth Street
                    between Main and Walnut.</p>
            <p>Perhaps to ease her foot problem she ordered two pairs of shoes from Nicholas Meyer but refused to
                    pay for the first pair after it was delivered. Mary Meyer held Jacob Long accountable for the debt,
                    but he argued that it should be his father's responsibility. Unbeknownst to Jacob, after
                    his mother's funeral Maria had been given forty dollars from her father to share with the
                    family in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. About the time of the shoe incident Jacob discovered that Maria had kept this money
                    for herself. He then threw her out of his house. A few days later on December 11, 1841, he found her
                    with her brother Lewis at the home of John Groschevit. In a fit of anger, Jacob called Maria a

                    Maria was a prostitute, though a later, somewhat related document may shed some light on her
                    situation. In 1855 the Protestant Home for the Friendless and Female Guardian Society opened its

                    </placeName>, yet after collecting nearly thirty more testimonies one of the prosecuting attorneys,
                    Davis, mysteriously disappeared and was not heard from again. He may have been disturbed either by
                    the unfavorable rumors he had heard about Maria or by the redeeming testimony he had discovered on
                    behalf of the accused.</p>
            <p>Incomprehensibly, after all the collection of evidence about Maria the defense decided not to
                    introduce their depositions, in the naive conviction that their case was airtight. A priest from

                    </placeName> with a group of Irishmen who pledged to defend the accused against possible violence.
                    None broke out, but the first trial, held in late March 1843, demonstrated Schmoll's
                    influence when the jury nearly convicted the priest. Only one juror, Charles Harrington, had the
                    courage to defy threats against his life by arguing for Weinzaepfel's innocence. The jury
                    was hung. Judge Embree ordered that the case be reconsidered the next September. In the meantime a
                    Presbyterian minister in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Jeremiah R. Barnes, speculated that Harrington refused to convict Weinzaepfel only
                    because sometime earlier Harrington had made a vow never to trust the testimony of a woman.
                    Harrington adamantly denied this interpretation.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Barnes claimed that Maria Schmoll enjoyed "the sympathy of the whole Protestant
                    community," but other reports demonstrated that most observers, including her own husband,
                    did not believe her.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> Shortly before the second trial began Maria fled from
                    Martin. She then called Deydier to her father's home in order to baptize her sick infant. A
                    few days later the child died. Martin Schmoll supplied two coffins, one placed inside the other, and
                    allowed the infant to be buried in the Catholic cemetery. But later that night he reopened the grave
                    and reinterred the smaller coffin in the public burial grounds. Maria afterwards fell so ill that
                    the trial again had to be delayed. A later report suggested that the "real cause [of the
                    delay] was that there was trouble in the Schmoll household."<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, by late February 1844 the prosecutors informed the defense that 130 local persons had
                    agreed to testify on her behalf. Few if any of these persons were acquainted with Maria Schmoll. All
                    undoubtedly had been enlisted by her estranged husband. In response to this planned counterattack,
                    the defense followed earlier precedents by conceding that Maria's past would not be
                    mentioned. Many observers later considered this decision to have been a crucial mistake. Defense
                    attorney Benjamin Thomas actually withdrew his services when the other lawyers on the team outvoted
                    him on this strategy. The prosecution accentuated the fact that the defense had decided not to
                    discuss character, arguing that Maria Schmoll's reputation was not questioned because it
                    was unimpeachable.</p>
            <p>The three-day trial began on March 4,1844, with the excited testimony of the alleged victim. Before a
                    jury composed of three Methodists, two Baptists, two Cumberland Presbyterians, and five unchurched
                    men, Maria testified that not only had Weinzaepfel questioned the validity of her marriage, but also
                    that he had asked how often she had sexual relations with her husband. Weinzaepfel apparently later
                    admitted that he had interrogated her along these lines. It was his duty to ask, he had said, and
                    her obligation to tell. At first she refused to answer, but after his repeated inquest, she told him
                    she had sex with her husband either once or twice a week. Weinzaepfel next suggested that she should
                    try to live in peace with her husband even though, Weinzaepfel believed, it was very hard to do so
                    with a Lutheran. He also instructed her not to reveal to Martin the topic of their conversation,
                    because, as Weinzaepfel reportedly said, "it did not belong to the confessional."
                    He concluded the interview and assigned a penance. Intimate questions in the confessional may have

                    subsequently reported to the jury, that "I thought when Catholics had their sins forgiven
                    they feel more contented and lively." Early in the morning she told him "something

                    from Weinzaepfel. Not until the following evening did she allegedly tell her husband that she had
                    been raped. He vowed to "take a pistol and go and shoot the priest," but Maria

                    husband's maltreatment. At the time of the trial she considered her husband, as she
                    reported to the jury, "her greatest enemy." In cross-examination he admitted that,
                    at least at the time of the trial, he did not live on friendly terms with his wife. All the evidence

            <p>The following day Jones of the defense began his closing remarks. He speculated that Maria's
                    behavior may have given Martin Schmoll reason to doubt her faithfulness; she seemed to have lingered
                    at the church longer than expected, and also she avoided direct contact with her husband upon
                    returning home. Jones speculated that Schmoll had wrongly concluded that she had had sexual
                    relations with the priest. Martin had admitted that he was madly jealous of his wife. In fact, he
                    testified that upon seeing her after the alleged rape, he examined her genital region but found no
                    evidence of recent sexual penetration. Jones theorized about the source of Schmoll's
                    jealousy: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Mrs. Schmoll went to confession to the defendant a week before she was married; and counting
                            from that time you will find that the term of nine months had just about elapsed at the
                            birth of her child, and as the priest and Schmoll are both Dutch, and both have black hair,
                            it was impossible to tell whether the child was "begotten by its own
                            daddy" or not.</p>
                    </quote> While Jones clearly stated that he believed Weinzaepfel had not had sexual relations with
                    Maria, he speculated that Schmoll might have believed that if Maria became pregnant right away he
                    might be cheated and have to accept Weinzaepfel's child as his own. Yet these speculations
                    concerning paternity were proposed as possible ruminations of Martin Schmoll. Jones went on to offer
                    a motive for Maria to lie about the "rape": upon returning home after confession
                    she may have seen accusations of infidelity on the impatient face of her spouse. Thus when pressed
                    upon exactly what had transpired in the church, she may have fabricated the questions of Weinzaepfel
                    about the marriage and later conjured up the accusations of rape. But the priest clearly was
                    innocent, Jones concluded.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>

            <p>The jury was not convinced; after forty minutes of deliberation on Saturday, March 9, the foreman

                    Weinzaepfel did not blame the jury but rather implicated, as he wrote to a friend, "the
                    malice and sworn hatred previously manifested by my enemies." He remained calm but added,
                    "Who can reflect without indignation on the malicious slander and wicked persecution so
                    wantonly heaped on a person, that as the persecutors themselves best know, is not even guilty of the

            <p>First thing the next morning, a Sunday, Sheriff Kirkman and twenty-four armed men escorted
                    Weinzaepfel to a blacksmith shop where he was chained to a Methodist who had stolen five dollars.
                    The sheriff then transported his ward to the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, stopping the stage, at least according to Weinzaepfel's recollection,
                    "on every occasion to show the <hi rend="i">wild beast</hi> he had chained up." On
                    the steamboat to the state prison at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName> Kirkman was ordered by several passengers to stop mistreating his prisoner. His instant
                    accession to this request illustrated the first signs of popular opinion sympathetic to Weinzaepfel,
                    in contrast to what Weinzaepfel described as the "deep prejudice that… bad
                    spread across] the whole county of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName>."<hi rend="sup">39</hi> The passengers devised a plot to set the sheriff on
                    the shore and land the priest wherever he wished. The pilot was ready to implement the plot, but
                    Weinzaepfel refused to cooperate. He explained, "I now suffer unjustly under the law, but I
                    trust that the higher courts will rectify the wrong which had been done me. I prefer to be
                    imprisoned in <placeName>

                    transgression of the law."<hi rend="sup">40</hi> At the end of the journey, Sheriff Kirkman
                    recommended that the warden, James R. Pratt, treat the priest with kindness. ‘You should
                    have brought the jury,’ remarked Pratt, "and not the priest!"<hi rend="sup">41</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In prison Weinzaepfel was treated well and admitted that he was far happier than he had expected to
                    be. The guards asked little of him, while Irish Catholics from <placeName>

                    </placeName> attended to his needs. John Larkin, S.J., of St. Ignatius Literary Institution (and the

                    </placeName>) every week crossed the river for a visit, and Bishop Benedict Flaget of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and coadjutor Martin John Spalding called upon Weinzaepfel several times. While
                    traveling down the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> Archbishop Anthony Blanc of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> gave Weinzaepfel a gold cross and chain to be sold to defray legal expenses. The trial
                    had cost $1,597.92, of which Weinzaepfel paid $184.92 out of his own funds.
                    The Catholic Church assumed responsibility for the remaining balance. As late as the summer of 1847,
                    Bishop Hailandiére had collected only $135.00 and thus remained
                    $1,244.37 in debt. At this time he ran two notices in the <hi rend="i">Catholic

            <p>Three days after the trial Durbin visited Weinzaepfel in jail and then delivered to the <hi rend="i">Catholic Advocate</hi> his account of what he had seen at the "one-sided and
                    unfair" trial. "From an impartial hearing of the testimony, and consideration of
                    the circumstances," he wrote, "I am convinced of the innocence of the present
                    victim of judicial prosecution, and, though no prophet, I hesitate not to say, that there will yet
                    be proof of this." Within a short while priests from both Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, along with (reportedly) the Catholic hierarchy from the entire nation, concurred with
                    Durbin's estimation and acclaimed Weinzaepfel's past piety, regular deportment,
                    and edifying example. To have garnered such seemingly unanimous support despite his relatively short
                    time in the country either Weinzaepfel must have seemed saintly to many or, more likely, this case
                    provided the opportunity for his brethren to rally against this expression of anti-Catholicism. Even
                    Durbin admitted that he had been unacquainted with Weinzaepfel before the accusations.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fervor both for and against Weinzaepfel was slow to dissipate. A few months after the trial
                    Chandler circulated an eighty-page <hi rend="i">Report of the Trial and Conviction of Romain
                        Weinzoepflein</hi> [sic], <hi rend="i">a Roman Catholic priest, for rape, committed upon the
                        person of Mrs. Anna Maria Schmoll, while at confessional, in the Catholic Church at <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                        </placeName>, Ind.</hi> The work included accurate summaries, briefs, and some verbatim
                    testimony and closing arguments, as were commonly published for controversial trials. The <hi rend="i">Catholic Advocate</hi> described Chandler's tract as "<hi rend="i">exparte</hi> and garbled," "gross and obscene in the extreme," and
                    certainly not appropriate for a respectable woman to read. To further illustrate the so-called
                    "catch-penny" nature of this piece, the <hi rend="i">Catholic Advocate</hi>
                    referred to two portraits presented inside the cover: "no modest person can view these two
                    faces," the paper surmised, "without at once deciding which is stamped with
                    virtue, and which disgraced with vice." Whereas Weinzaepfel appeared calm, resigned,
                    humble, and with "purity of heart and purpose," Maria looked bold and impudent:
                    "A big, gross, German woman, weighing 150 pounds, with a broad face, coarse features, and
                    eye which seems never to have batted, with a cool unfaltering purpose, denoted in the expression of
                    the eye and lips and forehead;—the whole features bespeaking rather the bold and reckless
                    and practiced profligate, than the meek, and humble, and virtuous Christian female." Anyone
                    familiar with phrenology, the paper concluded, had an advantage in this case. Underlying this
                    analysis was the contemporary expectation that women should be submissive to men. Maria Schmoll
                    challenged these cultural norms and thus for this alone might have been denounced.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>

            <p>Within a few months the Schmolls's story began to unravel. Maria, at least according to one

                    Maria had levied against him, then rebuked his wife as an alcoholic, a thief, and a liar. When the
                    child was born, he explained that <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>for various reasons [he] did not feel satisfied about its paternity and was so troubled about

                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>. What he actually meant in using the word "rape" was that Maria on
                    two occasions had consented to sexual relations with two different men. Before the judge Maria
                    admitted that these accusations were true. In September the court granted a divorce and ordered
                    Schmoll to pay $600 as alimony in lieu of dower and court costs.<hi rend="sup">46</hi>

                    </placeName>, his motivations in accusing Weinzaepfel. According to sworn testimonies given by these

                        <region type="county">Jasper</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, Schmoll admitted that he always had suspected that his wife had entertained
                    an affair with the priest. But Schmoll added that he had fabricated the accusation of rape in order
                    to punish the priest and embarrass his wife. Thomas published these new revelations in September

                    innocent man. Weinzaepfel lived to celebrate his Golden Jubilee as a priest. The obituary published
                    upon his death on November 11, 1895, at St. Meinrad again exonerated him. This report also described
                    him as a rather austere man.<hi rend="sup">56</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Weinzaepfel incident was clearly more complicated than simply another example of religious
                    tension in early nineteenth century America. The evidence supports the contention that the
                    accusations arose initially from the personal animosity of Martin Schmoll and probably his wife
                    toward the priest. Subsequently the smoldering divisions between Protestants and Catholics did
                    become part of the story, but even then the religious cleavage remained far from clear. As early as
                    the Pigeon Township hearing some Protestants tried to stop the mob. Immediately after the trial
                    Sheriff Kirkman was forced to stop mistreating the prisoner, and on the way to <placeName>

                    </placeName> Weinzaepfel's fellow passengers tried to set him free. A sizeable number of
                    people from various backgrounds across southern Indiana not only expressed their belief in
                    Weinzaepfel's innocence but were willing to fight for justice in this case. Ultimately the
                    priest was released, to the satisfaction of most observers. The overwhelming support for Weinzaepfel
                    by both Catholics and non-Catholics who knew him not only points to his innocence but also
                    demonstrates that many, possibly a majority of persons in southern Indiana, did not harbor strong
                    anti-Catholic sentiments. Nevertheless, a small group of drunks led by an influential and
                    contentious man not only assured the guilty verdict but also affected the future of religion in the
                    area. Perhaps because of the scandal surrounding the case, Catholicism in <placeName>

            <p>Ferry service at the Falls Cities followed the common history of industry and technology: humble
                    beginnings, improvement, expansion to large and profitable companies, and a decline caused by
                    competition from a more efficient technology. The earliest ferries used almost anything that would
                    float, including rafts, canoes, and skiffs. When the horse paths were widened to make wagon roads,
                    the heavy wagons required larger boats, usually scows. Owned by individuals or families, they were
                    propelled by manual labor using poles, oars, or even sails. Horsepowered ferryboats became
                    practicable in the 1810-1820 period, and in the 1830s steam propulsion began to replace human and
                    animal power, a transformation that took about thirteen years in the Falls area. Competition between
                    owners was unrestrained, even feral, notwithstanding charters, licenses, and efforts at local
                    governmental control. By 1820 attrition and consolidation had eliminated much competition, but
                    ferries and landings were bought, sold, traded, inherited, and even acquired by marriage in a
                    bewildering series of transactions until the middle of the nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>The introduction of steam power in the 1830s made ferryboats too expensive for individual ownership.
                    Ferry companies became large and profitable businesses, capitalized by partnerships and public stock
                    subscriptions. Schedules were formalized, and rates were controlled. By 1850 only two ferry services
                    remained at the Falls Cities, one between New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> landings. Since the two services were five miles apart by river and more by land,
                    competition between them was minimal.</p>
            <p>Major technological competition arose when railroad bridges were opened in 1870, 1886, and 1895
                    between the Falls Cities. This competition was redoubled when interurban cars supplemented trains in
                    the 1890s and early 1900s.</p>

                    </placeName> Ferry Company was in serious financial straits. A new company, the Falls Cities Ferry
                    and Transit Company, owned by the advocates for a highway bridge, ironically, carried on until the
                    end of 1929 as a public service. No longer needed when the bridge was opened, ferry service ended at
                    the Falls Cities in 1929.</p>

                    to carry wagons, teams, and cattle. The ferry carried an immense traffic in 1810, and often long
                    lines of wagons waited their turns to cross the river.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Wood also provided hotel

                    The owners sold the equipment, breathed a collective sigh of relief, and promptly disbanded the
                    company, ending 145 years of ferry service in the Falls Cities.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>

            <p>During the pioneer period ferryboats were propelled by manual labor using poles, paddles, or oars.
                    Service was provided on demand. The perfection of the steamboat in 1807 and its adaptation to the
                    western rivers in 1811 had no effect on ferry equipment in the Falls Cities area for two decades.
                    The biggest early change occurred when paths and trails were improved to become wagon roads. Ferry
                    owners replaced rafts and small boats with well-made scows ranging from forty to sixty feet in
                    length by twenty to twenty-five feet in width.</p>
            <p>Ferry franchises required their keepers to build and maintain approach roads between the high-and
                    low-water marks at landings. Owners building such approaches often limited their efforts to clearing
                    away the trees and underbrush, but at the busier landings owners installed corduroyed log or
                    cobblestone roads to provide better footing for vehicles and animals. Asphalt and concrete were
                    uncommon until the 1920s. Patrons used a bell, supported on pole or tree, to call the ferry from the
                    opposite shore.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>

            <p>First mentioned in 1824, by the 1880s all the Falls Cities ferries had landing floats, called flats,

                    In 1816 Scribner sold his ferry to Paxson and Smith, who replaced the scow with a horse-powered
                    ferryboat consisting of two flatboats joined by deck timbers. The horses walked a

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Black Locust</hi> was a catamaran steamboat with the paddlewheel between the hulls.
                    James Howard built the ferry using black locust timbers, which proved to be very durable. The Black
                    Locust's superstructure was rebuilt in 1847, and the hull lasted until the ferryboat was
                    cut down by ice in the winter of 1866—1867.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Later steam ferryboats were designed in one of three configurations, determined by hull shape and by
                    paddlewheel location. By far the most common were sidewheelers, with independently controlled
                    paddlewheels on each side. They were fast and extremely maneuverable because one wheel could come
                    ahead while the other backed, turning the boat almost on its axis. Sternwheel ferryboats were not so
                    handy, but they were cheaper to build and operate, since they needed but one engineer. Some small
                    ferryboats were built ‘bootjack’ style with a ‘U’-shaped
                    recess at the stern in which the paddlewheel turned. The name was derived from the hull shape, which
                    resembled the familiar household bootjack. No propeller-driven ferryboats served the Falls Cities.</p>
            <p>Boilers were enclosed in a superstructure designed to occupy as little deck area as possible. The
                    paddlewheels for bootjack and catamaran hulls were included in that space. Sidewheelers had the
                    wheels enclosed outside the hull, supported by the flaring guard deck, with passages between the
                    cabin and the wheel housings on each side for vehicles to reach the after deck. Passenger cabins on
                    the smaller ferries were on the main deck in spaces not needed for anything else. On the larger
                    boats the passenger cabin was on the second, or boiler deck, so-named because it was above the
                    boilers. Passenger accommodations were stringently functional, furnished with wooden benches and
                    little else. Water closets were unknown on the ferries; toilet facilities were open privies and the
                    waste dropped directly to the river through the seat, which gave patrons a terrifying view of the
                    water rushing below.<hi rend="sup">53</hi>

                    the pilothouse, which changed the current in the field coils. An impressive display of arcs and

                    Many did not even have railings. Their estimates of need were more strongly influenced by costs than

                    1838 Steamboat Inspection Act. That federal act was flawed by having few provisions for inspection
                    and penalties. In 1852 a new Steamboat Inspection Act required testing and licensing officers,
                    testing and inspection of machinery and boilers, and specified the kinds and quantities of safety
                    appliances and equipment necessary. Stringent penalties were enacted, and the law was enforced. The
                    inspection and crew licensing laws were made ever more comprehensive by later amendments to further

            <p>The maximum fares specified in charter grants were often modified by local governmental agencies to
                    prevent overcharges to users, but ferrymen could charge less. William Wright advertised that his

                    result in being swept away. The five-passenger canoe at the Utica-to-Transylvania crossing was well
                    above the perils of the falls, but passengers may have been obliged to part their hair in the middle
                    to enhance stability. The Clarksville and Shippingport ferries crossed at the lower end of the
                    falls. While there was no danger of being swept up the rapids, the outflow from them was frequently
                    very swift and turbulent.</p>
            <p>The falls represented a real hazard, for even when they were passable during high stages, the channel
                    was crooked and was lined with rocks on both sides. Any loss of power or steering could be fatal in

                    they were dignified with names. Rubel's Rock, also known as Wave Rock, lay near the head of
                    the Indiana chute and made a deceptive swell that looked like deep water. It was blasted away in
                    1889. Dick Smith's Wharf was a long rock ledge on the southeast side of Corn Island that
                    was particularly dangerous to the early ferrymen leaving Gray's Wharf when a freshet ran
                    out of Beargrass Creek.</p>
            <p>Fog, too, was a peril, as Captain Alfred Pirtle described it:</p>

                        navigation was attended with difficulties and dangers, especially in foggy weather, and only the
                        worst of fogs or storms laid up the boats. And now and then some accident, maybe of a log of
                        driftwood lodging in the wheel, might compel a crew to toll their big bell for some boat to come
                        to their assistance before the time of whistle signals. And fog sometimes rose so suddenly as to
                        shut out both shores and force a stoppage.</p>

                        compelling the pilot to stop his engines and float, peering in vain for a sight of land.
                        Suddenly the boat just rubbed bottom and then grounded. The fog was so dense that nothing could
                        be seen in any direction. The ringing of the bell attracted some boatmen on the <placeName>

                        were on the rocks at the head of the falls. After [an] hour or two the ferry people managed to
                        get a line to the boat and made strenuous efforts to pull it off with the assistance of the
                        other ferryboats, but in vain…. The companion boat took the passengers off, who were
                        transferred in skiffs from the grounded boat to the other…. Then the people having

                    broke their mooring lines and were carried away. When lines held firm, the ice often piled up and
                    climbed over the hull to shear away the cabin. Ice from one to four inches thick grinding along a
                    hull could trim that hull off neatly at the waterline. Only when ice was stabilized in heavy sheets
                    could people and vehicles walk or drive from shore to shore. New dangers arrived with each thaw, for
                    heaped ice formed gorges, backing up the river for miles. When such a gorge let go it swept
                    everything before it to destruction. Riverboats sought ice harbors in the mouths of tributaries, in
                    the chutes behind islands, or used the islands as shields. In any event, ice often stopped ferry
                        service.<hi rend="sup">66</hi>

                    custom that allowed a passenger to ride back and forth all day for one five-cent fare. Children
                    loved to watch and worry with delectable terror lest the soaring jack-staff should hit the Big Four

            <p>While the Falls Cities always competed with one another, like close-knit families, tribes, and
                    nations they also often rose to one another's defense. Fire equipment and firemen on loan

            <p>Police departments also cooperated with their cross-river counterparts. Miscreants who tried to flee
                    a jurisdiction on arrival across the river often found the police, alerted by telegraph or
                    telephone, waiting to prevent their landing; they were arrested when the ferry returned.</p>
            <p>The ferry steamers departed and arrived with as much panache as the floating palaces. When the last
                    rig or auto was safely aboard, the roof bell was rung three taps. The ready whistle chirped three
                    times. The mighty whistle sounded three blasts, ramps were raised by deckhands to form rails, and
                    lines were lifted from timberheads. The ferryboat left the landing flat with a flourish. The gentle

                    farthest reaches of the boat. About ten minutes later, upon the approach to the yonder landing, the
                    pilot blew a brassy landing signal, to announce the boat's arrival. Lines were heaved and
                    ramps slammed down. Autos were cranked up to bounce over the flat to shore.</p>
            <p>While passage time was short, waiting one's turn during rush hour in a long queue angling
                    down the wharf to the landing flat was tedious. It was irritating to be left behind when the boat
                    was loaded to capacity.</p>
            <p>The importance of ferries in the days of settlement of the American West, when every stream was an
                    obstacle to wheeled vehicular travel, cannot be overstated. Crossing a stream of the power and size

                    system was completed. During that whole time the humble, unsung ferryboats were vital to our
                    nation's growth.</p>

            <p>This fifth installment of the Indiana Archives series examines some of the local archival holdings
                    that can be found in the eastern part of Indiana. As has been the case in defining other regions
                    within the state, the boundaries of eastern Indiana reflect varying perspectives. Yet two interstate
                    highways, geography, and history help to give definition to eastern Indiana. The land east of
                    Interstate 69 and bisected by Interstate 74 ranges from flat and gently rolling terrain to deep
                    river valleys and steep ridges, some of which overlook the broad <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio River</region>
                    </placeName>. A largely rural area, the region's economy is primarily tied to agriculture.
                    Industry once flourished in this part of Indiana, beginning with the natural gas boom of the late
                    nineteenth century and continuing during the first half of the twentieth century. But a gradual
                    decline in durable goods manufacturing after the 1950s has meant a shift to more service-oriented
                    economic activity, including tourism in a number of communities. Eastern Indiana has long had a
                    diverse ethnic and religious heritage, with a highly visible Amish, Mennonite, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> presence in some areas.</p>
            <p>These economic and cultural characteristics point to several other historical sources of regional
                    identity. Antebellum eastern Indiana was an active conduit for the Underground Railroad,
                    transporting several thousand newly freed blacks through such communities as <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fountain City</region>
                    </placeName>, the so-called Grand Central Station of the system, and establishing institutional
                    support for African Americans through the Union Literary Institute in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Randolph County</region>
                    </placeName> and Eleutherian College in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jefferson County</region>
                    </placeName>, which was the second school west of the <geogName>Allegheny Mountains</geogName> to
                    offer interracial education. The Indiana Women's Rights Association was formed in 1852 in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne County</region>
                    </placeName>, a center of the women's suffrage campaign in the state during the nineteenth
                    century. John Hunt Morgan's Confederate raiders briefly swept through the area during the
                    Civil War before a force of around one thousand <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jennings County</region>

                    fueled a boom-and-bust economy in several towns, but the gas also induced some companies, most
                    notably the Ball Corporation, to set up operations and make far reaching economic and educational
                    contributions to the region. Eastern Indiana provided a fertile setting for the volatile cultural
                    contrasts of the 1920s; a reborn Ku Klux Klan gained national attention even as the Gennett studio
                    in <placeName>

                    a broadly-defined and ever-evolving process called modernization, was established shortly before the
                    Great Depression and continues to attract the attention of scholars, journalists, and film-makers.</p>
            <p>Eastern Indiana also gains a measure of regional identity through the authors, entrepreneurs,
                    politicians, and folkloric figures associated with it. Naturalist Gene Stratton Porter, humorist
                    Emily Kimbrough, historian Edward Eggleston, and novelist Ross Lockridge, Jr., all to varying
                    degrees made the area the backdrop for their works. The region was also home to James F. D. Lanier,
                    who financed Indiana's entry into the Civil War; Wilbur Wright, who with his brother
                    Orville ushered in a new era in transportation; and the Hillenbrand families of Batesville, whose
                    furniture-making company broadened into several other enterprises. In 1885 the Reverend James M.
                    Townsend of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>

            <p>The local historical societies, museums, halls of fame, restored riverfront mansions, and historic
                    preservation districts in eastern Indiana reflect both a local appreciation of the region's
                    past and a recognition of the benefits that result from a combination of conservation and commerce.
                    In his essay on archival holdings in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware County</region>
                    </placeName> John B. Straw indicates that there is even more of the much-studied "<placeName>

                    </placeName>" and its surrounding environment to be explored; he also notes the recent
                    acquisition of the Civil War correspondence of a physician serving in Indiana regiments and surveys
                    a broad scope of resources for the area's history. Thomas D. Hamm's survey of
                    Earlham College's manuscript collections reaffirms the centrality of the Friends in the
                    social and religious life of east-central Indiana in the nineteenth century, while noting that other
                    materials illuminate peace and civil rights activism for most of the twentieth century. <pb n="286" id="VAA4025-095-3-090"/> These essays suggest that some promising avenues for primary research
                    in the history of this part of the state have been prepared and that those pursuits can well lead to
                    national and international connections.</p>

            <p>The formation of a new state in an almost virginal territory and on a rapidly spreading frontier
                    demanded a continuing series of local political compromises by a host of individuals with often
                    conflicting personal views and objectives. The issues they faced were complex, reflecting the
                    challenges posed by a sparse and widely-dispersed population that required governments, roads, and
                    banking services. The creation of a workable revenue system, for example, was a monumental task, and
                    it was basic to maintaining even the most elementary public services. Achieving all of this required
                    more ingenuity and leadership than Indiana could provide in the period of its formation as a state.
                    Donald F. Carmony has identified the personalities who dominated the first half-century of the
                    state's history and has traced the many strands of their political disputes.</p>
            <p>The miracle of early Indiana history is that the state survived so well despite its perennial
                    inability to pay debts; during the first six years the state's revenues fell about
                    $8,500 short of expenditures annually. This problem stemmed from national overspeculation
                    and the panic of 1819. Like other parts of the rapidly expanding American frontier, Indiana was
                    deeply divided over the vexing issue of banking. Virtually every problem was a revenue problem.
                    There existed, for example, no greater challenge in the backcountry than penetrating the barriers to
                    internal travel and commercial intercourse. But while topography, sparsity of population, and rising
                    agricultural production made travel both essential and difficult, the central problem was the lack
                    of capital resources to improve transportation. State treasurer Nathan B. Palmer put it clearly when
                    he warned that capital for internal improvements would have to be raised from sources other than
                    taxation. Ultimately, the state's attempt to finance internal improvements resulted in
                    excessive debt, financial crisis, and bankruptcy.</p>
            <p>Education was another early challenge. The state might have become a testing ground for public
                    education, but delegates meeting in an early constitutional convention in Corydon faltered in their
                    responsibility by referring the issue to the future general assembly, which, they said, should
                    concern itself with the organization of public schools "as circumstances will
                    permit." Thus education in Indiana, as in most other states, was a subject to which
                    governors and legislators could pay eloquent lipservice without giving financial support <pb n="303" id="VAA4025-095-3-107"/> to schools. Carmony writes comprehensively of Indiana's slow
                    and wobbling steps to establish a public school system and the semblance of higher education as
                    well. While there were a number of men who expressed opinions freely in support of education, there
                    were few leaders capable of articulating policies to achieve reasonable ends.</p>
            <p>The author discusses the political views of the Jeffersonian and Jacksonian parties in proposing
                    solutions to the problems of the newer states of the union and describes their highly partisan
                    approaches to government. Internal improvements, banking, the final phases of border defenses, and
                    applying land policies all evoked the same kinds of partisan responses in Indiana that appeared in
                    other states. Carmony discusses the two parties in two chapters that place their conflicts in the
                    context of grass roots backcountry realities as well as in philosophical differences.</p>
            <p>With the emergence of state government in 1816 there appeared a galaxy of strong-willed personalities
                    who engraved their names permanently in the annals of Indiana history. Their pullings and haulings
                    as governors, state officers, and legislators demonstrated a mixture of statesmanship and sheer
                    demagoguery. This is reflected in the legislative record, where one can marvel that any rational
                    resolution of the complex problems of government ever occurred in such an environment of legalistic
                    hairsplitting. But most states' histories have revealed that constitution-makers rarely
                    made rules that withstood the test of changing times, and Indiana has been no exception to this
                    pattern.</p>
            <p>Somewhere and at some time there may have been a sociogeo-graphically oriented topographer able to
                    lay out on the face of the great American frontier a state without sharp sectional divisions, but
                    such a person was not around to employ this skill when Indiana was formed as a state. Indiana, like
                    its sister states, has from the beginning been saddled with a fair amount of sectional paralysis.
                    Few, if any, state histories contain so clear a statement of the impact of sectionalism as
                    Carmony's treatment of the subject.</p>
            <p>It must be questioned whether a more detailed treatment of state formation and the maturing process
                    than Carmony's <hi rend="i">Indiana</hi> exists anywhere; he has enriched the text with
                    details that illuminate personalities, public issues, economic and fiscal concerns, and the problems
                    of establishing democratic government in the Old Northwest. He includes 243 pages of notes and
                    bibliography to support his analysis. A future state historian will find little, if anything, to add
                    to the history of the foundation of the state. The famous progenitor of well-researched local
                    history, Leopold von Ranke, would bestow his blessings upon Donald F. Carmony's head.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Hoosier Schools, Past and Present.</hi> Edited by William J. Reese. (Bloom-ington:
                    Indiana University Press, 1998. Pp. xvi, 226. Notes, illustrations, figures, tables, index.
                    Clothbound, $29.95; paper-bound, $14.95.)</head>
            <p>According to editor William J. Reese, the nine articles that make up <hi rend="i">Hoosier Schools,
                        Past and Present</hi> reflect "the work of a new generation of scholars, whose
                    contributions explore moments in Indiana's educational past while stimulating further
                    inquiries" (p. xv). Presented chronologically, chapters address the central educational
                    issue of a specific time period. The first chapter deals with the leadership of common school reform
                    in the mid-nineteenth century; the second, written by Reese himself, discusses the cities'
                    leadership in school innovation after the Civil War. Subsequent chapters explore Progressive era
                    reforms: one reviews broad curricular expansion; a second, the changing definitions of social
                    studies education; a third, the expansion of the extracurriculum. The last four chapters,
                    approaching the present, study the evolution of high school basketball as an important supplement to
                    the curriculum; changes in funding urban schools after World War II that caused problems for
                    superintendents; Indiana's diverse response to racial issues; and reforms of the past
                    twenty years.</p>
            <p>While the book might have been strengthened by a concluding chapter that identified unifying themes,
                    each chapter stands on its own, and, moreover, the chapters fit well together. There is a surprising
                    uniformity of style, historical depth, tone, integration of Indiana's educational history
                    into the national context, and balance among theory, description, and analysis.</p>
            <p>Each of the chapters, as the editor intended, provides a more critical portrayal of
                    Indiana's educational past than have previous accounts (p. xv). Every chapter avoids
                    one-dimensional analyses, pointing out the multiplicity of cultural, political, and economic forces
                    that are always the context of education and that make reform difficult both to achieve and to
                    analyze. The essays provide complex portraits of educational reform, then and now, and ask new
                    questions. David G. Martin's chapter about the role of basketball, for example, notes both
                    that the sport excluded girls (p. 137) and that the sense of inclusion and local pride that team
                    support encouraged was similar to that fostered by the Ku Klux Klan, which played an active role in
                    Indiana's small towns (pp. 140-42). Such thought-provoking juxtapositions in all the
                    chapters show how education's history intersects with the broader culture.</p>
            <p>The book succeeds in placing 150 years of educational reforms in Indiana within the context of
                    national trends. The chapters are rich with references to <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> educational history and Indiana history. Students of education will praise this
                    volume's breadth, despite its single-state focus, while those interested in Indiana history
                        <pb n="305" id="VAA4025-095-3-109"/> will appreciate its inclusion of all of Indiana, as well as
                    the scope that a broader, national perspective contributes.</p>
            <p>The volume also convincingly links Indiana's educational past with its present. The final
                    chapters approach the present with topics that are very much a part of current educational
                    consciousness, dramatizing the continuity of struggle over educational policy throughout
                    Indiana's history. While historians of education might wish for yet more critical analyses,
                    this book succeeds well on its own terms and will richly reward readers of both Indiana and
                    educational history.</p>

            <p>This is an extraordinarily valuable study of Indiana's, and to some extent the
                    nation's, concrete bridges. Although the subtitle indicates an early twentieth-century
                    focus, the book in effect begins with the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> World's Fair of 1893 and explores the influence of its magnificent White City
                    upon subsequent architectural and engineering designs before delving into the main theme. As a
                    result, <hi rend="i">Artistry and Ingenuity</hi> is not only a comprehensive analysis of
                    bridge-building in Indiana during the first four decades of this century but also a history of
                    bridge engineering and engineers, of transportation systems, and of related developments, such as
                    the City Beautiful and Good Roads movements and the governmental bureaucracies, both state and
                    federal, involved in highway construction. All this is told within the framework of the fierce
                    battles waged between architects and bridge-design engineers, who won the first battle, and then
                    between empirically minded engineers and the "federal state alliance" of
                    government engineers, who generally prevailed during the Great Depression and afterwards.</p>
            <p>The engineers' approach to bridge-building was best articulated by bridge and structural
                    engineer H. G. Tyrrell, who found beauty in simplicity and called for selecting "the most
                    artistic form consistent with economy" (p. 71). This approach was practiced with a
                    vengeance by Indiana's Daniel B. Luten, the enigmatic, self-styled "Designing
                    Engineer," once a professor of engineering at Purdue University, who designed and built,
                    often through his own companies here and in other states, about 12,000 remarkable bridges using the
                    new material <pb n="306" id="VAA4025-095-3-110"/> of the time—reinforced
                    concrete—in daring and imaginative ways. Over the years Luten's nemesis was
                    Thomas H. McDonald, the long-time head of the Office of Public Roads based in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, D.C., who defended the more traditional, sometimes redundant structures built by the
                    government. Indeed, an excellent chapter in the book is "an imagined debate"
                    between Luten and McDonald on the proposition that "State Highway Commission Control of
                    Public Bridge Design Best Promotes the General Welfare" (pp. 100-106).</p>
            <p>With this book Cooper has reaffirmed and solidified his standing as the preeminent scholar of Indiana
                    bridges. <hi rend="i">Artistry and Ingenuity</hi> is a worthy companion to his previous study, <hi rend="i">Iron Monuments to Distant Posterity: Indiana's Metal Bridges, 1870-1930</hi>
                    (1987). Deeply philosophical as well as painstakingly detailed and technical, the book is not
                    without flaws. Although the writing is occasionally lyrical and the author at times whimsical in his
                    chapter titles and captions to the generally superb photographs, Cooper's self-published
                    book unfortunately suffers from the lack of an experienced copy editor to catch mechanical errors, a
                    few misspellings, and an infrequent opaque phrase. Nevertheless, I can strongly recommend the book
                    and support the author's wish that his more than two decades of work on
                    "Indiana's historic bridges" will help preserve at least some of them.
                    Shockingly, more than 60 percent of the bridges listed in the metal bridges book inventory are no
                    longer extant. Let us hope that a similar fate does not await the bridges inventoried here, county
                    by county, in the book's final pages.</p>

            <p>Hill and Hoover asked about such topics as their motivations for moving to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>; sources of income; attempts to establish and maintain a sense of religious and social
                    communality; accommodations to the prevailing gentile culture; and, of course, the effect, if any,
                    of the Ku Klux Klan on their peace of mind. Most of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Jews were descendants of Eastern European immigrants who arrived in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in the several decades just before and after 1900 and came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> from other American cities. Nearly all went into business for themselves or as partners
                    and salesmen in Jewish-owned enterprises. As with Jews in other American small cities, they dealt
                    primarily in clothing (from elegant to workingmen's) and in scrap metal and junk, though
                    some got involved in jewelry, linen supply, paper products, and office machines. Hardly any of the
                    first generation pursued education after high school, but virtually all their children, especially
                    the boys, attended college.</p>
            <p>Most of the community maintained "Jewish" homes, which varied widely in the ways
                    the sabbath and other holidays (not to mention dietary laws) were observed. They built a synagogue
                    that conformed generally to a Reform service, hired a rabbi when they could afford one, and provided
                    children with at least an idea of Jewish traditions. Almost all of the first generation married
                    Jews, usually finding spouses in nearby cities. Though a number recalled attending a YMCA camp in
                    their teens, they also joined various Jewish youth groups.</p>

                    </placeName>'s gentiles were for the most part correct, with some of those interviewed even
                    reminiscing about high school social clubs that elevated Jews to top offices, while others recalled
                    friendships with non-Jewish neighbors. But most interviewees also cited the
                    "closed-to-Jews" policies of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s leading social and fraternal organizations, especially the <placeName>

                    they encountered usually came from realtors who excluded Jews from the prominent residential
                    sections of Westwood and Kenmore or from childhood taunts and occasional fights. As for the Klan in
                    the 1920s, there was near unanimity among <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s older Jews that Catholics and blacks had much more cause for concern than
                    did Jews, probably because the former were more numerous and visible than the "numerically

                    city's most distinctive neighborhoods. The fact that "architecture" is
                    the first word in the subtitle is significant, for this is not a conventional narrative history.
                    Rather, Paul Diebold introduces the reader to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Irvington</settlement>
                    </placeName> through its built environment. The strategy no doubt comes naturally to the author, who
                    works for the Indiana Division of Historic Preservation and Archaeology. He is forthright about his
                    focus: "Although <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Irvington</settlement>
                    </placeName> is a community of people, it is the buildings and places of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Irvington</settlement>
                    </placeName> that shaped and will shape the self-image of its residents" (p. C.1).
                    Perhaps-but such an approach inevitably narrows the volume's appeal. The book will be of
                    considerable interest to residents past and present, historic preservationists, and architectural
                    historians. More general readers, however, are likely to learn a bit more about the details of
                    changing architectural styles than they really want to know and a bit less about the lives of the
                    people who lived, studied, worked, played, and prayed in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Irvington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s buildings.</p>
            <p>A large proportion of the volume examines the community's residential architecture, which
                    includes everything from the elaborate Italianate and Second Empire styles of the late-nineteenth
                    century to post-World War II ranch-style houses. There are also separate chapters on parks and
                    parkways, commercial and industrial structures, and (this reviewer's favorite) public and
                    institutional buildings. The latter chapter includes excellent discussions of <placeName>

                    Thomas Carr Howe High School and the national headquarters of the Christian Church (Disciples of
                    Christ).</p>
            <p>A few problems may be noted. There are some editorial lapses, although none is serious enough to
                    impede a reader's understanding. The illustrations should have been numbered for easier
                    identification and reference in the text. Additional maps, especially for the twentieth century,
                    would aid readers who do not know the neighborhood. That said, Diebold deserves credit for his
                    thorough research (the bibliography and appendices are quite impressive), for assembling a
                    remarkable collection of excellent illustrations, and for writing an informative and thoughtful
                    text. He is particularly good at putting developments in <placeName>

            <p>This book treats "the wrong end of Lincoln's life" (p. ix). It examines
                    the Civil War president's early years, a period of maturation haunted by melancholy, of
                    affairs of the heart and forays into politics, of the seedtime of legal practice and public service.
                    Since Lincoln scholarship primarily centers on the presidential era, there is, argues Douglas L.
                    Wilson, a regrettable lack of depth in historians' interpretations of the critical
                    formative years of Lincoln's life and the acceptance of generations of dubious
                    historiographical judgments.</p>
            <p>In this compilation of previously published articles, Wilson sets out to correct this oversight. By
                    examining afresh several long-held assumptions about Lincoln's experiences in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                    </placeName> and about the crucial sources for that period—particularly those collected
                    by the future president's law partner, William H. Herndon, whose work has been much
                    maligned by historians—Wilson challenges the premises of such scholars as Paul Angle,
                    James G. and Ruth Painter Randall, and David Herbert Donald. The result is a fascinating and, at
                    times, bold grappling with the accepted portrait of the young Lincoln.</p>
            <p>At the heart of the author's analysis is a refurbishing of Herndon's role as an
                    historian. Building on his earlier study of Herndon and his informants, done in collaboration with
                    Rodney O. Davis (1997), Wilson seeks to release Herndon from "the doghouse of Lincoln
                    scholarship" (p. 21) to which he has too long been consigned. In doing so, he cogently
                    argues that Lincoln's associate "deserves to be much better known" (p.
                    34) as a careful investigator of Lincoln's younger days. According to Wilson, Herndon
                    recognized that, soon after Lincoln's assassination, his image was being distorted into
                    that of a "plaster saint" (p. 39). To counteract that trend, Herndon thoroughly
                    checked the material gleaned from his informants and conscientiously adhered to a doctrine of
                    "necessary truth: that "even the most private and painful secrets must come out to
                    explain the extraordinary <pb n="310" id="VAA4025-095-3-114"/> character and
                    accomplishments" of an historical figure (p. 43). These traits of Herndon's
                    research alone underscore the author's contention that fairness to Herndon is in order.
                    Perhaps a revealing testimony to Wilson's success at rehabilitating Herndon's
                    image is that Donald—whose 1948 treatment of Herndon receives judicious criticism at
                    Wilson's hands—in his recent highly-acclaimed Lincoln biography claims to have
                    "learned a great deal" from the articles reprinted here, which informed his own
                    reconsideration of Lincoln's prepresidential years (<hi rend="i">Lincoln</hi>, 1995, p.
                    608).</p>
            <p>Donald's kudos reflects specifically upon Wilson's handling of Lincoln's
                    relationship with Ann Rutledge. This episode is seen as merely legendary by historians who reject
                    Herndon's sources—evidence which, according to Wilson, "they themselves
                    had not seen" (p. 75)— and Wilson claims it offers an insight into
                    Lincoln's personal growth and especially into the melancholy that tempered his spirit
                    throughout his life. Likewise, valuable glimpses of Lincoln's moral and emotional character
                    emerge from an account of the angst the young lawyer felt when he broke his engagement to Mary Todd
                    on New Year's Day 1841, an act he later reversed out of a sense of honor. In other chapters
                    one witnesses the unseasoned politician using an assumed name in editorially attacking his political
                    opponent, evangelist Peter Cartwright, and the more experienced campaigner using the Declaration of
                    Independence for "political advantage" (p. 173). Finally, students of Indiana
                    history will find Wilson's account of Lincoln's 1844 visit to his Hoosier boyhood
                    region informative; the trip proved to be a pivotal moment in his confrontation with "the
                    humbling fact of human mortality" (p. 142).</p>

            <p>In 1991 Larry Lankton presented a comprehensive account of the development of the mineral ranges on
                    the Keweenaw Peninsula in northern <placeName>

                        Mines.</hi> In this companion volume, <hi rend="i">Beyond the Boundaries</hi>, he concentrates
                    on the settlement of the region between 1840 and 1875 with emphasis upon the development of copper
                        <pb n="311" id="VAA4025-095-3-115"/> mining towns as they were transformed from crude isolated
                    mining camps to civilized communities.</p>
            <p>Other writers have concentrated on other aspects of this region— the geology of the
                    Keweenaw Peninsula, the technology of copper mining, Native Americans, the fur trade, and the role
                    of organized labor. Lankton focuses on the social history of the region, emphasizing the early
                    pioneers—the men, women, and children and the role they played in community life. Special
                    attention is devoted to a variety of related major themes, such as transportation and travel (not
                    only shipping from Sault Ste. Marie and the "world below," but overland travel
                    between the mines and the mining towns); the living conditions of explorers, missionaries, the
                    military, and the various groups associated with the copper-mining operation; the foodways of the
                    frontier and the yearly struggle to get sufficient supplies from "below" before
                    the ice and winter storms closed the Great Lakes for several months.</p>
            <p>Lankton gives special emphasis to family life on the mining frontier and the indispensable role of
                    pioneer women in building and maintaining homes for their spouses and children. The churches and
                    schools of the region are also covered in detail, based on official church records and the personal
                    collections and writings of religious leaders like Bishop Frederic Baraga and the Reverend John
                    Pitezel. For the educational aspects of the mining communities Lankton utilizes the school records
                    and the detailed account left by Henry Hobart, a young <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName>-born school teacher who contracted to teach at the Cliff mine from 1863 to 1865. Hobart
                    described the life of a teacher facing a daily average of ninety students between the ages of six
                    and twenty in a one-room schoolhouse. In his four-hundred-page journal Hobart provides insights into
                    the educational philosophy of the day, student activities, and the interaction of young scholars
                    with diverse ethnic backgrounds. Fortunately for Lankton and others concerned about the social
                    history of the region, Hobart was a keen chronicler of everyday life on the mining frontier, the
                    celebration of holidays, the rivalries between the Cornish, Irish, and German settlers, the
                    consumption of alcohol, and the establishment of community clubs and organizations like the
                    Independent Order of Good Templars and Oddfellows.</p>
            <p>Lankton also relies upon other diaries to shed light on living conditions on the Keweenaw during this
                    formative period. Lucena Brockway, who came to the area in 1843 with her husband Daniel, described
                    the difficult life of a pioneer woman in various mining towns. Ruth Douglass's diary
                    described her life on Isle Royale, an isolated island in northern Lake Superior. The writings of
                    John Forster, Henry Schoolcraft, Charles Whittlesey, and other pioneers provided additional
                    invaluable material for the book.</p>

                    reasoned, and well-written survey of key topics in what he calls the "second great
                    transformation" of rural life, 1870 to 1930. He breaks considerable new ground and also
                    provides a masterly synthesis of research interpreting changes in farm life during this time.</p>
            <p>First he examines two classic arenas of conflict between urban reformers and rural defenders of the
                    status quo—road reform and school reform. The localism inherent in the office of
                    pathmaster and the folkways supported by working out road taxes were unacceptable to city folk, who
                    wanted good roads for bicycles and, later, automobiles. Likewise the local autonomy of school
                    districts was seen as a stumbling block to urban reformers bent on establishing graded schools
                    through consolidation. These were "flash points" that "highlighted the
                    conflict between two competing visions of society" (p. 44). Farmers opposed the reformers
                    because they valued local autonomy and were frugal. Urban reforms, they knew, always cost them
                    money. Federal aid, gas taxes, and their own adoption of the automobile eventually made farmers more
                    favorable to road reform. Schools, however, reflected "culture and ideology" (p.
                    7), and so consolidation was thwarted.</p>
            <p>The second general area examined is farm organization. Barron looks first at dairy organizations in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> and second (with more pertinence to Indiana) at farmers' grain elevators in
                    the Midwest. Cooperative grain elevators were manifestations of localism too, striving to cut out
                    the middleman, but farmers found that pure localism was not tenable. To overcome obstacles and
                    boycotts initiated by private dealers, the cooperatives had to organize beyond their own
                    communities. Strictly as "a business proposition" (p. 128), they had to become
                    more cosmopolitan.</p>
            <p>The third and most interesting area treated is consumer culture, beginning with mail order catalogs
                    and progressing through chain stores, the proliferation of automobiles, movies, radio, and home
                    modernization before the "full flowering of a consumer <hi rend="i">culture</hi>"
                    by the <pb n="313" id="VAA4025-095-3-117"/> 1920s. Here is an intriguing discussion of how <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery</region>
                    </placeName> Ward established rapport with rural buyers; the importance of parcel post; the rise of
                    chain stores; the reordering of rural geography by the automobile; the custom of Saturday night
                    trading and movie attendance; and the ways farmers and the radio industry affected one another.
                    Farmers bought radios, thus entering consumer culture, but when they did, their listening
                    preferences in turn shaped radio programming. This interchange brought about not the displacement of
                    farm values by urban values but rather "a hybrid rural version of that culture,"
                    WLS Barn Dance and so on—a sort of mass rural culture.</p>
            <p>Farmers thus reaped a "mixed harvest," one of "resistance and
                    accommodation and of change as well as continuity" (p. 245). Barron's conclusions
                    are particularly refreshing in that he does not consign farmers to the victim culture so fashionable
                    in recent decades. Farmers made their choices, he says, and lived with them.</p>
            <p>A final note on Barron's method: it reprises the approach of Earl Hayter a generation ago in
                        <hi rend="i">The Troubled Farmer</hi>, drawing general insights from a set of related, topical
                    essays. As opposed to the new social history, which postholes specific topics in a small area, the
                    essay approach follows the connecting strands across the countryside. It is a good method, as well
                    as a readable one, and Barron proves it so in this exemplary work.</p>

            <p>Although Joanne L. Goodwin's book joins a long list of works published in the past decade on
                    the Progressive era origins of welfare "as we knew it," her <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> study is the first to focus on the local implementation of "mothers'
                    pensions," state level programs to aid single-mother families that were adopted by forty
                    states between 1911, when <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> passed the first law, and 1920. Unfortunately, mothers' pensions case records
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> were destroyed; so Goodwin depends principally on institutional reports and
                    contemporary research, much of which was undertaken to justify and bolster the program.
                    Consequently, there are few glimpses of the way the program was administered in specific cases.
                    Instead, Goodwin concentrates on the ideas and interests of the groups promoting and opposing
                    mothers' pensions in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, their struggles for power, and the ways compromises shaped the program.</p>
            <pb n="314" id="VAA4025-095-3-118"/>
            <p>Goodwin's story is essentially a familiar one: <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> mothers' pensions failed to provide adequate, dignified public assistance to
                    poor single-mother families. Despite popular rhetoric that stressed the social value of maternal
                    nurturance and the economy of supporting mother-only families in their own homes, fears of runaway
                    costs, runaway fathers, and big government undermined public support. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s politicians were hostile and stingy in providing funding because there was
                    no political payoff for them: the juvenile court administered the program and controlled the jobs.
                    Charities professionals rejected the law's social insurance philosophy and demanded
                    restrictions limiting pensions to citizens and to the "worthy" poor and required
                    ongoing supervision of recipients. Administrators also used racist criteria in enrolling families.
                    Goodwin argues that the pensions did not even keep single mothers out of the workforce, so that they
                    could rear their children full-time. She points out that administrators expected most mothers to
                    work for wages, at least part-time. She argues that this policy devalued both mothers' work
                    as childrearers and as wage-earners, since the "mother-work" was seen as less
                    important than wage-earning, yet the wage-earning was poorly remunerated and part-time.</p>
            <p>Goodwin is more sympathetic than some other scholars to the Hull House intellectuals (Julia Lathrop,
                    Sophonisba Breckinridge, and Edith Abbott) who provided the research underpinnings to
                    mothers' pensions. While she judges them to have been wrong in supporting legislation based
                    on women's difference from men, she concludes that they were at least social justice
                    feminists (committed to women's equality with men) rather than maternalists (who believed
                    mothers had special claims on the state).</p>
            <p>Some of Goodwin's critiques seem ahistorical; e.g., she criticizes mothers'
                    pensions supporters because they required "the achievement of certain standards"
                    of mothering for women to qualify for maternal entitlement (p. 185); but, since those supporters
                    thought entitlement was justified by mothers' service to the state in producing good
                    citizens, standards were inevitable. The model institution for Progressives was the juvenile court,
                    in which professionals evaluated parenting in a confidently interventionist spirit; without that
                    spirit, the mothers' pensions law would never have been passed.</p>
            <p>Indiana, though quick to adopt the juvenile court, was the last state in the Midwest to pass a
                    mothers' pension law, which seems not to have been put into effect, despite the attention
                    of women's organizations in the state. Therein lies a tale?</p>

            <p>The brief, violent careers of midwestern bandits in the early 1930s continues to exert an apparently
                    irresistible attraction to amateur historians of crime. Jeffery King, a retired reference librarian
                    and freelance writer, is the latest to join this group. Like his predecessors, King has diligently
                    mined the original sources of the period, including pertinent FBI materials which record the
                    bureau's gradual involvement in the effort to end the careers of these bandits. The result
                    is certainly entertaining, as are most of the recent biographies of the outlaws, but like his fellow
                    sleuths King fails to provide us with an understanding of the criminals and their times.</p>
            <p>King begins his story very well, briefly describing several advantages the bandits enjoyed over their
                    erstwhile captors, including the woeful lack of police training and inadequate manpower and
                    equipment. He gives due attention to the consequences of the mobility that automobiles gave these
                    criminals, pointing out that new roads and enhanced speed enabled outlaws to escape the scenes of
                    their crimes very rapidly. King also describes the isolated world of Cookson Hills in rural <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName> where Floyd grew up and often hid during his violent career. Not yet fully integrated
                    into the state's economic and political networks, and resentful of outsiders, the residents
                    of Cook-son Hills provided a variety of criminals with safe refuge.</p>
            <p>Having set the stage for his drama, King fails to integrate these ideas into a fully developed
                    analysis of Floyd's career. While he occasionally notes the advantages outlaws enjoyed,
                    King does not explain systematically how they helped these bandits temporarily succeed. In fact, it
                    appears from King's narrative, as well as those of other recent biographers, that the
                    midsection of the nation had a loosely connected interstate urban criminal culture stretching from
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">St. Paul</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
               </placeName>, to Hot Springs, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>
                    </placeName>, and including <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas City</region>,
                            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Memphis</settlement>
               </placeName>, and several other cities where criminals could find such services
                    as fences, doctors, corrupt politicians and policemen, and safe houses. Despite his origins in rural <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName>, Floyd utilized this urban underworld throughout his career, and its existence does
                    much to explain not only his success, but that of several other bandits as well. King therefore
                    misses an opportunity not only to entertain us, but also to enhance our understanding of the outlaw
                    phenomenon in the early 1930s.</p>
            <p>King does, however, provide a careful, detailed narrative of Floyd's violent career. In
                    doing so, he implicitly challenges Michael Wallis's assertion (in <hi rend="i">Pretty Boy:
                        The Life and Times of Charles Arthur Floyd</hi>, 1992) that Floyd was not involved in the
                    infamous <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas City</region>
                    </placeName> Massacre. Utilizing FBI records, King carefully traces Floyd's journey to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas City</region>
                    </placeName> and the way in which he was recruited <pb n="316" id="VAA4025-095-3-120"/> for the
                    attempt to rescue Frank Nash. King's account of the massacre seems the more credible of the
                    two because he effectively cites specific FBI and other sources, while Wallis neglected to do so.
                    Settling such historiographical debates is a useful accomplishment, and King demonstrates that the
                    resolution of such disputes rests on the careful use of evidence.</p>
            <p>In sum, this highly readable narrative will provide devotees of social banditry with yet another
                    well-crafted biography of Floyd, but we still await the study that will make sense of the phenomenon
                    he exemplified.</p>

            <p>The best parts of this book are in the last chapter, which contains two case studies of environmental
                    public policymaking involving the Great Lakes area: one was a dispute about the relation between
                    eutrophication and phosphorus-containing laundry detergents and the other a controversy over the
                    effects of hot water from the cooling systems of nuclear and conventional power plants. In these two
                    studies, the author traces the public's increasing environmental interest, loss of faith in
                    existing state institutions, and evolving reform strategies in the face of scientific uncertainty,
                    business intransigence, and state-federal regulatory conflicts.</p>
            <p>The strengths of these two studies lie in their complexity and completeness. Federal players from
                    presidents to undersecretaries and state players from governors to citizens' advisory
                    boards jostle with scientists, journalists, and local neighborhood environmental groups in
                    determining the fate of the Great Lakes. The two studies fulfill their author's
                    self-proclaimed mission of analyzing the relation between state and federal policymaking during an
                    era of transition from a cooperative climate in which lax water quality standards were negotiated
                    between state regulators and businesses, to a more confrontational climate, in which stricter
                    federally-mandated water quality standards were imposed. In the end, however, the author
                    demonstrates with appropriate irony that states still set many water quality standards in
                    consultation with businesses and substitute voluntary and very slow compliance for strict legal
                    enforcement of pollution control laws.</p>
            <p>The rest of the book is less comprehensive, although packed with useful information. The local
                    histories used as examples of fundamental <pb n="317" id="VAA4025-095-3-121"/> principles are based
                    largely on government reports, politicians' papers, business journals, and newspaper
                    accounts. Perhaps because of his reliance on these sources, the author's important actors
                    are government officials, business leaders, and journalists. Citizen-activists and scientists appear

                    environmental regulation in those areas. The author focuses particularly on federal intervention in

                    Lakes water quality policy.</p>
            <p>The theoretical and conceptual heart of the book is largely derived from the work of Walter
                    Rosenbaum, George Hoberg, Joel Tarr, and other scholars of national water quality policies. The
                    author follows Samuel Hays in arguing that postwar affluence and increased leisure time allowed
                    citizens' increased attention to quality-of-life issues, including an appreciation of their
                    natural surroundings; a "sense of place" led midwestern inhabitants to seek to
                    protect their Great Lakes home. Discovering that "business corrupts politics," as
                    Richard McCormick has written, citizens turned to the courts and the federal government to force
                    states to protect the environment better. Public environmental concerns were both mirrored and
                    inflated by newspapers. The environmental agenda was welcomed by a Democratic party eager to address
                    citizens' quality-of-life concerns. Republicans, too, responded to indignation about the
                    business "capture" of the environmental regulatory apparatus (a phrase attributed
                    to James Q. Wilson), leading to the entertaining spectacle of Richard Nixon promoting stricter
                    business regulation.</p>
            <p>The book is confusing or seems incomplete in a few places. The national regulatory legislation, from
                    the 1899 Refuse Act to the 1972 Clean Water Act, is introduced topically, out of chronological
                    order; a table listing the various acts might have helped the reader sort out the many important
                    acts and amendments. Explanations of taconite "tailing fibers" and chloroorganic
                    pesticide persistence and mobility are weak, and overall the book would have benefited from more
                    attention to science and scientific debates. Kehoe refers to increasing amounts of effluent from
                    Great Lakes businesses entering municipal water treatment facilities during the 1960s and 1970s and
                    emphasizes cities' financial difficulties in undertaking necessary sewage treatment, but he
                    ignores discussions between sewage authorities and businesses about the quantity and quality of
                    manufacturing effluent entering municipal sewage streams.</p>
            <p>Despite these quibbles, however, overall the book succeeds at tracing a complicated story of the
                    Great Lakes states' regulatory aims <pb n="318" id="VAA4025-095-3-122"/> and apparatuses
                    and how they changed—and more importantly, did not change—over the 1960s and
                    1970s.</p>

            <p>Philip D. Morgan's new book forced me to revise my view that in today's world of
                    academic publications any monograph over 400 pages is probably too long. Not only is there nothing
                    in this dense study that is superfluous or dispensable, but it also brings back the almost forgotten
                    pleasure of graceful, jargonless prose and argumentation that never feels contrived. Morgan set out
                    to paint a full and comprehensive panorama of slave life in the eighteenth-century Chesapeake and
                    the Low Country, but unlike many panoramas, it is not painted in broad brushstrokes but in a
                    meticulous and systematic manner, rich in analytical detail and built upon a huge source base, which
                    includes much that is new to colonial American historiography.</p>
            <p>The first part of the book gives an extensive economic perspective on slavery in the two regions,
                    covering the different plantation systems, material life, and the organization of field and skilled
                    work of slaves. Since the economy defines daily existence in profound ways, this section provides a
                    solid basis for the more strictly social and cultural analysis that follows. Part II focuses on the
                    various types of encounters between Africans and Europeans: economic exchanges, violence, sex,
                    recreation, and religion. Particularly interesting is the richly documented examination of trade and
                    property ownership by slaves, showing how even in a repressive regime the relentless laws of the
                    market found avenues of expression. A separate section is devoted to patriarchalism, discussed here
                    as an ethos defining the relationships between master and slave. Notably, Morgan avoids the
                    pitfall—seen in some studies—of treating patriarchalism as primarily a
                    rationalization for the slave system; instead, he stresses that it was an "authentic, if
                    deeply flawed, worldview… not just a smokescreen for exploitation" (p. 275).</p>
            <p>Perhaps the most important and original contribution of this book is the extensive discussion in Part
                    III of the so far little-known interactions and social networks within the black community. These
                    include relations between Creoles and Africans, among Creoles, among <pb n="319" id="VAA4025-095-3-123"/> Africans, between blacks and Indians, and between the free blacks and
                    slaves. They reveal deep divisions and stratifications as well as a growing sense of common identity
                    transcending class lines. A distinct ethnic culture emerged, according to Morgan, when blacks
                    established solid networks of social relations in which the family became central. The two regions,
                    at the same time, retained their peculiar local characteristics as subcultures. For instance,
                    two-parent families were more common in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> than in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, where families were more often disrupted. Marked differences are also shown in
                    dialects, religious and magical practices, and music. The final section is devoted to culture in the
                    strict sense, the symbolic dimensions of slave life: language, play, and religion. Here one finds a
                    fascinating array of themes, including fashion consciousness, hairstyles, music, games, dancing,
                    funerals, and magical beliefs and practices derived from African heritage and preserved in slave
                    culture after Christianization.</p>
            <p>Except for a succinct prolegomenon introducing the basic conceptualizations, the book concentrates
                    entirely on the praxis of slave culture, the everyday life, the face-to-face relations (including
                    gestures!), the rare joys, and the tedium of life. Echoes of the work of E. P. Thompson and Eugene
                    D. Genovese are unmistakable, especially the latter's concept of slavery creating an
                    inseparable, organic relationship between blacks and whites, although Morgan sees it less in terms
                    of class rule than in terms of cultural interactions. Typically, there are no grand theories or
                    models of slaves' <hi rend="i">mentalité</hi> here; the author takes great care
                    to present a balanced view of a subject that has in the past elicited so much controversy. He
                    rejects extreme claims such as that the Africans experienced a "spiritual
                    holocaust," that they routinely practiced "African religion" (p. 6581, or
                    that white culture was widely penetrated and changed by African culture. True to the promise of the
                    title, the design of the book is consistently contrapuntal. The two regional African-American
                    societies provide "commentaries upon one another" (p. xvi) that reveal the similar
                    and the different forces that shaped them: staple production, ecology and settlement patterns,
                    character and volume of slave supply, structure of slave populations, and planter lifestyles. The
                    tension between masters and slaves is another organizing pattern; the two groups are posed as
                    "opposite extremes of a magnetic field, poles apart and yet holding each other in
                    suspension, each defining the other" (p. 273). The spotlight on two regions gives the book
                    sufficient specificity and focus while the comparative approach allows the author to uncover much
                    about eighteenth-century American slave life in general.</p>
            <p>Morgan's admirable and largely successful quest for striking a balance between presenting
                    the humanity of the various encounters between slave and master and exposing the exploitation of the
                    former occasionally produces an unintended effect; because of the constant <pb n="320" id="VAA4025-095-3-124"/> and forceful emphasis on the truth that slavery was deeply flawed and
                    intrinsically contradictory, the reader may at times be under the impression that the then
                    widely-accepted institution was an anomaly of sorts. If cultural history is an effort at imagining
                    what it would be like to believe in precepts and values that we may not share today and to act upon
                    them, then such weaving of modern and earlier conceptual means of constituting reality is a bit
                    risky, as it would be to analyze the caste system in the culture of <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName> in terms of its contradictions with one's own different notion of equality.
                    One could note along the same lines that his argument that the loyalty of many bondsmen to their
                    masters represented a "tragic involvement of many slaves in their own oppression"
                    (p. 385) downplays both the lack of choices caused by the totalitarian nature of the slave system
                    and the ensuing cultural efforts to make existential sense of participation in it (vide the
                    phenomenon of "captive minds" in communist and Nazi systems). Perhaps the book
                    would have benefited from a little more appreciation for the rich theory of cultural anthropology
                    (incidentally, Bronislaw Malinowski, one of its founders, has his first name cited incorrectly as
                    Bernard, p. xxiii).</p>
            <p>One may disagree with this or that minor detail of the author's interpretation, but the
                    overall product is without doubt impressive for its careful and balanced discussion of the dynamics
                    of slave culture, the logical architecture of the book (Morgan even eschews a
                    separate—and by now sacred requirement in colonial studies—chapter on the
                    Revolutionary era), the vast scholarship absorbed by the author, the originality of so much new
                    source material, and the elegant explanation of the complexities of the subject. It will remain an
                    authoritative study for a long time to come.</p>

            <p>Pickett's charge is one of only a handful of historic episodes that almost every American
                    knows something about. Or, as Carol Reardon reminds us, we think we know something about that
                    glorious— and horrible—charge on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s final day. This provocative book works at various levels, adding important
                    contributions to what we know while also calling into question the true meaning of that knowledge.</p>
            <p>At its most fundamental level <hi rend="i">Pickett's Charge in History and Memory</hi> is a
                    conventional chronological narrative, summarizing the <pb n="321" id="VAA4025-095-3-125"/> evolving
                    popular conception of Pickett's charge. Reardon begins with a very brief sketch of the
                    dramatis personae as they stood poised for the attack that early afternoon. Major General George E.
                    Pickett commanded three brigades of Virginians from the Confederate First Corps. To their left on
                    Seminary Ridge were men of the Third Corps from <placeName>
                  <country reg="ncu">North
                        Carolina</country>, <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>, <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
                    </placeName>. Awaiting them behind fortifications on Cemetery Ridge were the Union's II
                    Corps. The eight chapters that follow consider different perspectives on the events that followed,
                    starting with the murky, fragmentary accounts by the participants themselves. Many points of
                    confusion and controversy emerged from these early descriptions, to be joined by other layers of
                    distortion introduced by subsequent waves of journalists, historians, novelists, and artists. But
                    the conflict at the core of the story centers on the identification of the charge with Pickett and
                    his Virginians. How much credit did the Third Corps deserve, and what explains their lack of public
                    recognition? And what of the gallant Union soldiers who turned back the assault? How has their
                    achievement been remembered? At a different level, this detailed account of the shifting
                    understanding of Pickett's charge merges with a broader discussion of the evolving place of
                    the Civil War in the national consciousness. As the nation underwent the slow process of
                    reconciliation and commemoration, Pickett's men became a culturally useful symbol for a
                    postwar America intent on acknowledging the Lost Cause without reopening old wounds.</p>
            <p>At the most theoretical levels Reardon uses this one episode as the focus for an extended discussion
                    of "two powerful forces [that] frame the way we recall past events: the objectivity of
                    history—the search for ‘truth’—and the subjectivity of
                    memory, which shapes perceptions of that ‘truth’" (p. 1). By
                    insisting on a dichotomy between history and memory, Reardon sometimes seems to be discounting the
                    role of the historian as arbiter among competing accounts. On other occasions she appears more
                    willing to take a side, indicating for instance that the non-Virginians are victims of
                    memory's distortions. Moreover, Reardon seems to draw no clear distinction between an
                    assemblage of "facts" and something else that we might call
                    "history," which includes (inherently subjective) judgments about the significance
                    of certain events. The initial eyewitness accounts by soldiers and reporters routinely garbled many
                    details while omitting others, but is it fair to dismiss these versions as mere subjective memory
                    rather than considering that these participants may have been quite reliable in recording those
                    aspects of their history—emotions, sensations, results-that they deemed most historically
                    significant?</p>

            <p>It has been over thirty years since the last book-length biographical study of Thaddeus Stevens
                    appeared. During those years historical scholarship has revised many interpretations of Civil War
                    history. It is only fitting, therefore, that the life of one of the most important figures of that
                    era, and perhaps the most important political figure of the Reconstruction period, the
                    "great commoner," should also be re-examined. Hans L. Trefousse's
                    detailed biography, <hi rend="i">Thaddeus Stevens: Nineteenth-Century Egalitarian</hi>, surpasses
                    previous biographies, offering a balanced yet admiring perspective on the public life of this
                    important leader in the nineteenth-century struggle for black equality.</p>
            <p>The bulk of Trefousse's biography is focused, as one would expect, on Stevens's
                    activities during the crisis of union. However, fully one-third of the volume examines his budding
                    political career in the 1830s through the 1850s' offering students of the period important
                    material on the origins and development of his political beliefs as well as his political practices.
                    Stevens's earliest crusades were involved not with the slavery issue but instead with
                    public school reform, tariffs, and antimasonry. In fact, early in his career he represented
                    slaveowners attempting to regain possession of runaway slaves. Even on these early issues, however,
                    Stevens was, in Trefousse's analysis, "a radical," (p. 137) something he
                    remained his entire life.</p>
            <p>Stevens's national fame did not come until the 1850s, when he became an uncompromising
                    critic of the South and her "peculiar institution." His distaste for slavery was
                    not new and, indeed, had revealed itself as early as the 1830s. Notable about Stevens's
                    antislavery beliefs was that they were informed by a real desire for equal rights for African
                    Americans and were not simply a free-soil attack on slavery's effects on white labor. Much
                    of Trefousse's discussion of Stevens's activities during the war and after is
                    familiar: he analyzes Stevens's political battles with other Republicans; his demand for
                    abolition; his insistence upon punishment for rebel leadership and confiscation of Confederate
                    property; and, of course, his significant work as a leader in the reconstruction process and the
                    struggle for equal rights for black Americans.</p>
            <p>Trefousse offers several noteworthy contributions in his analysis of Stevens's politics.
                    Although Trefousse recognizes Stevens's singular significance in the politics of the
                    period, he also makes clear that Stevens's power in shaping reconstruction policy has been
                    overstated by previous scholars. Although Stevens was probably the most powerful political figure in
                    the nation in the years immediately following the war, he was at the head of an often uneasy
                    alliance and <pb n="323" id="VAA4025-095-3-127"/> was by no means the "dictator"
                    of reconstruction policies, as he has so often been represented (p. xi).</p>
            <p>One drawback in Trefousse's study is that the reader does not get a full sense of why
                    Stevens took the political positions that he did. Although Trefousse argues that Stevens's
                    "increasing commitment to antislavery and radical uplift is not hard to explain"
                    (p. 46), it never is fully explained. Trefousse makes reference to Stevens's rethinking the
                    issue after he represented slaveowners, but why he reexamined his beliefs is not developed. Indeed,
                    the book would have been strengthened by a fuller exploration of Stevens's motivation in a
                    variety of areas, including his antislavery beliefs and hostility to the South, as well as his
                    progressive belief in complete equality (far ahead of most of his contemporaries).</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, Trefousse has authored a solid account of this important Civil War era political
                    figure. Stevens was decades ahead of contemporaries in his struggle for an interracial democracy,
                    and Trefousse convincingly argues that Stevens's "legacy made possible racial
                    progress in the twentieth century" (p. 245).</p>

                        Industry.</hi> Edited by Shelton Stromquist and Marvin Bergman. (<placeName>

            <p>It is difficult to use the phrase "the jungle" without invoking Upton
                    Sinclair's classic novel; indeed, the editors of Unionizing the Jungles begin by noting the
                    persistence of this "compelling metaphor for life and work in the nation's
                    meatpacking industry" (p. 1). The metaphor, though, does not do justice to the complexity
                    of the history of packinghouse workers. The essays in this volume move toward bringing their
                    experience into the mainstream of American working-class history.</p>
            <p>The origins of this book lie in a "scholarly conversation" on the history of the
                    meatpacking industry that was sponsored by the Center for Recent <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> History (CRUSH), in which nine scholars presented their research and discussed it with
                    other scholars and labor activists. The resulting volume includes an editors' introduction
                    and essays by those who presented their work.</p>
            <p>Essay collections face many pitfalls, including uneven quality of individual contributions, lack of
                    coherence, and inadequate contextualization. The editors and contributors have largely avoided <pb n="324" id="VAA4025-095-3-128"/> these, presenting essays that complement each other, represent
                    solid research, and are consistently placed within larger themes in American working-class history.
                    These virtues reflect the conference's success in identifying central themes in the history
                    of packinghouse workers, including the degree to which the industry's labor relations were
                    exceptional; the question of worker agency in union-building; the role of race, ethnicity, and
                    gender in workforce formation and unionization; the United Packinghouse Workers of
                    America's (UPWA) history of social and political activism after World War II; and the
                    implications of this history for working-class history and for those interested in the current state
                    of the labor movement.</p>
            <p>Paul Street's essay on Swift and Company's welfare capitalism after World War I
                    argues that this program represented more than management manipulation: it incorporated the core
                    demands workers put forward during their wartime upsurge in organization and activism. Swift workers
                    found ways to manipulate welfare capitalism and use it to define the terms on which they would
                    embrace company "loyalty." When the Depression undermined Swift's ability
                    to maintain its programs, CIO organizers found a powerful organizing tool in the expectations
                    welfare capitalism had helped legitimize.</p>
            <p>Peter Rachleffs essay on the Independent Union of All Workers (IUAW) goes to the heart of the debate
                    over the potential of what Staughton Lynd and others have called "community-based
                    unionism" as an alternative to the national, bureaucratic, industrial unionism of the CIO.
                    Centered in the packing plants of Austin and <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Albert
                        Lea</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
               </placeName>, the IUAW
                    organized "wall to wall" within communities, linking workers regardless of
                    occupation and emphasizing participation and democracy. Outside the workplace, it created a
                    union-based culture, with publications, organizations, classes, and social activities linking
                    members and their families. The IUAW enjoyed a brief but dramatic life before disappearing under the
                    onslaught of national unions and organizing committees in the late 1930s.</p>
            <p>Several essays focus on the UPWA, which survived the CIO's Cold War era purges with its
                    values of racial equality and social democracy intact. Rick Halpern explores race and radicalism in
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> stockyards, documenting an alliance between black and white workers that was crucial to
                    the success of the Packinghouse Workers Organizing Committee and to the UPWA. Roger Horowitz finds
                    the UPWA's civil rights activism rooted in its tradition of shopfloor unionism. Wilson J.
                    Warren demonstrates how rank-and file anti-communism and racial prejudice undermined the
                    UPWA's commitment to social democratic programs. Bruce Fehn presents a local case study of
                    the UPWA's commitment to racial equality. Dennis Deslippe describes the union's
                    response to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, finding that leaders and male rank-and-filers
                    resisted full implementation of gender equality because of a combination of union <pb n="325" id="VAA4025-095-3-129"/> traditions and concern over the shrinking number of jobs in the
                    industry. Deborah Fink documents, from a participant's perspective, the persistence of
                    gender inequity on the packinghouse floor.</p>
            <p>Mark A. Grey ends the volume by looking at Storm Lake, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>. Long a unionized meatpacking center, Storm Lake saw its packing plant close down in
                    1981. It soon was reopened by <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> Beef Packers, which brought it and the city into the new order in meatpacking: nonunion
                    workers, lower pay, fewer benefits, high turnover, and a less-skilled workforce with a large
                    immigrant presence.</p>
            <p>This collection contributes much to our knowledge of the history of packinghouse workers; it should
                    prove valuable to labor historians, while also adding to our understanding of an important element
                    of midwestern history. The successes (and failures) of the UPWA that are documented here, moreover,
                    offer important lessons for those who hope to re-energize the labor movement.</p>

                    </placeName> Western Biography series. As such, it sticks closely to its central theme: to
                    understand Barry Goldwater one must understand Goldwater's roots in and lifelong attachment
                    to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="azu">Arizona</region>
                    </placeName>, both in its physical and political aspects. Thus we read of the family history of the

            <p>Throughout the book, but particularly in the two last chapters, Iverson makes much of the tensions in
                    Goldwater's <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="azu">Arizona</region>
                    </placeName> career. Like so many Westerners before him, Goldwater, in person and politics, was a
                    rugged individualist and an opponent of intrusive and expansive government; but he also was a fierce
                    advocate for federal aid for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="azu">Arizona</region>
                    </placeName> development, both in the water projects upon which he believed <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="azu">Arizona</region>
                    </placeName>'s growth depended, and in the state's aviation, highway, and military
                    construction. At the end of his life, Goldwater came to recognize the mixed blessings of this
                    development, for it had transformed his beloved state in his own lifetime from a remote and
                    beautiful backwater of America to an economic powerhouse full of high tech industries and sprawling
                    retirement cities, awash in <pb n="326" id="VAA4025-095-3-130"/> tourism and dominated by the urban
                    politics of metropolitan Phoenix and Tucson. <placeName>

                    </placeName>, of course, still has many wild and empty spaces, but Iverson's extended
                    treatment of Goldwater's complex reaction to the development of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="azu">Arizona</region>
                    </placeName> for which he had campaigned so long is the highlight of the book and its most original
                    contribution. This ambivalent view of the blessings of western development has been with us at least
                    since the days of Daniel <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Boone</region>
                    </placeName> and James Fenimore Cooper.</p>
            <p>Surprisingly, considering the focus of the book, there is little treatment of Goldwater's
                    activities as family man (Goldwater's first wife and mother of his four children, Margaret
                    "Peggy" Johnson, was from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>

                    </placeName> Senate in 1952. Perhaps space constraints precluded this, yet there are pages on what
                    seem like digressions about Hopi-Navajo conflicts (a specialty of Iverson's) and the
                    origins of <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="azu">Arizona</region>
                        </placeName> Highways</hi>, as well as nine pages of preface. More understandably, while
                    Goldwater's national campaigns are covered appropriately, as is his contribution to the
                    development of modern American conservativism and the Republican party, there is little about
                    Goldwater's actual life in the Senate or his legislative career, except for his masterful
                    work on the Defense Reorganization Act of 1986.</p>
            <p>Iverson goes out of his way to note that his own politics are not Goldwater's, but, with a
                    few irritating exceptions, he is remarkably fair to Goldwater, the conservative icon. Here we see a
                    Goldwater far from the reactionary stereotype so viciously, and successfully, manufactured by
                    Goldwater's enemies within the Repblican party and by Lyndon Johnson and his followers,
                    particularly Bill Moyers. Here we see the Goldwater who devoted himself all his life, as a matter of
                    principle, to civic service. Here we also see a Goldwater who daringly raised some important
                    political issues that today leaders of both parties recognize as legitimate concerns, such as the
                    need to balance budgets, to restrain the spending of the national government, to reform the system
                    of old age assistance, and to restore a sense of the importance of individual responsibility and
                    personal liberty in a free society.</p>
            <p>As personal memories of Goldwater fade, this short, useful book is well suited to introduce Goldwater
                    to a general audience and to convey to them something of the character of the man who early inspired
