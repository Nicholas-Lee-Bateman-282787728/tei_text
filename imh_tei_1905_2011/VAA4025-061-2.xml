            <p>Indiana's first constitution was drafted at Corydon during June of 1816. The framing of a
                    constitution was a basic step in Indiana's transition from a territory of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> to membership in the Union as the nineteenth state. The essential steps, in the order
                    of their occurrence, were: adoption of a memorial by the Indiana territorial General Assembly
                    seeking congressional approval for statehood, enactment by Congress of an enabling act authorizing
                    the drafting of a state constitution and the organization of a state government, the actual writing
                    of a constitution by delegates elected to a convention for this express purpose, the inauguration of
                    a state government, and formal admission by Congress. Although communication and transportation
                    facilities were quite limited, these important steps were completed in a remarkably short time.
                    Governor Thomas Posey approved the memorial for statehood on December 11, 1815; President James <placeName>

                    the second or representative stage of government was established for the entire region, but in 1800
                    the western and larger portion of this area was detached from the parent territory and returned to
                    the nonrepresentative stage. This new Indiana Territory entered the second stage of territorial
                    government five years later. Talk of statehood for Indiana had occurred earlier, but no major effort
                    developed until 1811. Late in that year the territorial legislature formally petitioned Congress
                    seeking authorization for Indiana to frame a constitution and become a state.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> A
                    few months later a House committee recommended approval of the request whenever Indiana's
                    population reached at least 35,000 as ascertained by a territorial census.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Such
                    a census, taken in the spring of 1815, indicated an aggregate population of nearly 64,000, a total
                    well in excess of the 60,000 minimum number required for statehood by the Northwest Ordinance.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Meanwhile, the creation of separate territories for <placeName>

                    </placeName> (1809) had reduced Indiana to approximately its present area, save for important

            </p>
            <p>The second and successful petition for statehood was adopted by the Indiana territorial legislature
                    during the period of rapid growth in western population following the War of 1812. This
                    memorial–approved December 11, 1815– noted that Indiana's population
                    already exceeded the minimum required for statehood. It asked congressional authorization for the
                    election of delegates to a constitutional convention and suggested how the proposed forty-two
                    delegates might be apportioned among the thirteen organized counties of the territory. It also asked
                    that the convention have the option of deciding whether it would "be expedient or
                    inexpedient, to go into a State Government…." The memorial sought generous
                    grants of federal land and revenue therefrom. The closing portion of the memorial affirmed the
                    attachment of the people of the territory to the fundamental principles prescribed by Congress for
                    governments established from the Old <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The Indiana appeal for statehood was soon laid before Congress. On December 28, only seventeen days
                    after its passage by the territorial legislature, it was presented in the House and referred to a
                    select committee chaired by Jonathan Jennings, who was in his fourth term as Indiana's
                    territorial delegate to Congress. Several days later it was presented to the Senate, where it was
                    also referred to a select committee. On January 5 Delegate Jennings submitted for his committee a
                    favorable report concerning the statehood memorial. A bill for an enabling act authorizing statehood
                    accompanied the report. This act passed the House on March 30 by a vote of 108 to 3. It cleared the
                    Senate on April 13, and was approved by the President six days later.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Less than
                    four months had elapsed since Congress had received the petition.</p>
            <p>The Indiana Enabling Act<hi rend="sup">8</hi> called for a constitutional convention at Corydon,
                    commencing June 10, 1816. Delegates to the convention were to be elected on May 13. Their
                    apportionment among the thirteen organized counties was as proposed in the territorial memorial,
                    except that <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison County</region>
                    </placeName> was given one additional delegate. Upon convening, the delegates were to decide whether
                    to draft a constitution and enter statehood or to authorize a subsequent convention for this
                    purpose. The enabling act explicitly stated that the new state must have a republican form of
                    government as well as one not repugnant to the articles of compact of the Northwest Ordinance. These
                    articles, declared by the ordinance to be "unalterable, unless by common consent"
                    of "the Original States and the people and States" in the Northwest Territory,
                    guaranteed federal title to the land of the region; declared the navigable tributaries of and

                    candidates had not developed and political parties were as yet unborn. Candidates either announced
                    themselves or were informally proposed by other individuals–at times without the
                    candidate's knowledge. Voters could cast their ballots for individuals who had not been

                    private correspondence–termed the step premature. Jennings and his friends constituted
                    the most powerful political element within the territory, and statehood offered them a promising
                    opportunity to become fathers of a new commonwealth. Posey, nearing the end of his three-year term

                    Wabash counties. The charge that statehood would substantially increase the cost of government to
                    Indiana residents was the principal argument against it. The slavery issue was discussed, but the

            <p>The delegates to the Corydon convention were an able and representative selection of Indiana
                    citizens. None of them was a native of the state whose constitution he helped write, but nearly all
                    residents of Indiana had arrived in the previous two decades, most of them after 1810. Of the
                    forty-three delegates, about twenty-five were natives of southern slave states. Among these were
                    perhaps a dozen from <placeName>

                    good character, substantial common sense, and much practical knowledge. Since the Indians still held
                    title to virtually the entire central and northern parts Indiana, almost all the delegates were
                    residents of the southern portion of the future state. The delegates had had much political
                    experience in legislative bodies as well as in a variety of local offices. Without exception they
                    appear to have been disciples of Jeffersonian Eepublicanism. Factional lines were loosely drawn, but
                    supporters of Jennings were more numerous than were the supporters of the Harrison-Posey element.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

            <p>Exactly four weeks after the delegates were elected they convened at Corydon on Monday, June 10. They
                    met in the recently completed territorial capitol, but tradition has it that some committee meetings
                    and possibly some of the convention sessions were held in the shade of a nearby elm. During the
                    first day nearly all the delegates appeared, Jennings was elected president of the convention, and
                    William Hendricks, who was not a delegate, was elected secretary. Committees on elections, ways and
                    means, and rules and regulations were appointed. The day closed with submission of a resolution that
                    "it is expedient, at this time, to proceed to form a constitution and state
                    government," but its consideration was <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The Constitution of 1816 was an excellent document. Clearly and concisely written, it closely
                    followed established political concepts and practices. Staunchly committed to the principle of
                    republican or representative government, it reflected a liberal and mildly democratic interpretation
                    of Jef-fersonian Republicanism. According to John D. Barnhart: "The process of writing
                    … was not the simple method of copying the constitutional law of another state, but was a
                    method of selection. Apparently the members of the convention had before them copies of the
                    constitutions of the nation and the various states. As a general rule, they did not draw entire
                    articles from a single constitution but seem to have searched through these documents to find the
                    sections which embodied the provisions they considered preferable for the government of the new
                    state. Occasionally they wrote a new section when a suitable one was not found in the older
                        documents."<hi rend="sup">18</hi> The bill of rights was carefully drawn and gave much
                    emphasis to safeguarding individuals rights and freedoms. Governmental powers were distributed among
                    the legislative, executive, and judicial departments, but the legislative branch was given much the
                    dominant role. Local government–county, township, and town–was recognized as
                    important, though details concerning it were left largely in the hands of the General Assembly.

                    constitution established educational goals which were advanced for that day, but they were beyond
                    the ability of the pioneers to attain them. While the General Assembly was made very powerful and
                    was to meet annually, remaining in session as long as it thought necessary, frequent elections and
                    short terms for legislators and key state officials were designed to maintain popular control of
                    government. Furthermore, the requirement that a constitutional referendum must be submitted every
                    twelfth year guaranteed each generation two opportunities to make changes in the constitution.
                    Widespread and sustained criticism of the Constitution of 1816 did not develop until the
                    1840's when it resulted from the impact of Jacksonian Democracy and from fiscal problems
                    caused by the breakdown of the state-sponsored system of internal improvements. The Constitution of
                    1816 was never amended; a new one replaced it in 1851.</p>
            <p>The transition to statehood was completed in the several months after the adjournment of the Corydon
                    convention. As directed by the delegates, the convention president, Jonathan Jennings, issued writs
                    to the sheriffs of the various counties calling for the first election under the constitution to be
                    held on August 5.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> The new constitution became effective without a popular
                    referendum, but the election of Jennings as governor by a margin of more than five to four over
                    Posey affords considerable–and perhaps the best available–evidence that it was
                    approved by a majority of the voters. The first state legislature convened on November 4, and three
                    days later Jennings was inaugurated as governor. At the August election Hendricks had been chosen as
                    the state's first representative in Congress. Early in November the General Assembly
                    selected James Noble, a member of the convention, and Waller Taylor to represent Indiana in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Senate. Shortly thereafter the legislature chose three electors for the pending
                    presidential election. The General Assembly also elected various judges and certain state officials,
                    revised territorial laws, and enacted new statutes before its adjournment on January 3, 1817.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

                    completed, the right of Indiana's three presidential electors to have their ballots count
                    for the election of a president and vice president was questioned, but their participation was
                    approved in February, 1817. Not until the following month, however, did Congress formally make its

                    authority appertaining to the office of governor, until another be duly qualified, or the governor
                    absent or impeached, shall return or be acquitted.</p>
            <p>18th. Whenever the government shall be administered by the lieutenant-governor, or he shall be unable
                    to attend as speaker of the senate, the senate shall elect one of their own members as speaker for

            <p>19th. The lieutenant-governor, while he acts as speaker to the senate, shall receive for his services
                    the same compensation which shall for the same period be allowed to the speaker of the house of
                    representatives, and no more; and during the time he administers the government as governor, shall
                    receive the same compensation which the governor would have received, and been entitled to, had he
                    been employed in the duties of his office.</p>
            <p>20th. The speaker pro-tempore of the senate, during the time he administers the government, shall
                    receive, in like manner, the same compensation which the governor would have received, had he been
                    employed in the duties of his office.</p>
            <p>21st. If the lieutenant-governor shall be called upon to administer the government, and shall, while
                    in such administration, resign, die, or be absent from the state, during the recess of the general
                    assembly, it shall be the duty of the secretary, for the time being to convene the senate for the
                    purpose of choosing a speaker.</p>
            <p>22d. A secretary shall be chosen by joint ballot of both houses of the legislature, and commissioned
                    by the governor <pb n="116" id="VAA4025-061-2-044"/> for four years, or until a new secretary be
                    chosen and qualified, if he shall so long behave himself well. He shall keep a fair register, and
                    attest all the official acts and proceedings of the governor, and shall, when required, lay the
                    same, and all papers, minutes, and vouchers, relative thereto, before either house of the
                    legislature, and shall perform such other duties as may be enjoined him by law.</p>
            <p>23d. Every bill which shall have passed both houses of the general assembly, shall be presented to
                    the governor; if he approve, he shall sign it; but if not, he shall return it, with his objections,
                    to the house in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the objections at large upon their
                    journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such reconsideration, a majority of all the members
                    elected to that house shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent, with the objections, to the
                    other house, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by a majority of all the
                    members elected to that house, it shall be a law: But in such cases, the votes of both houses shall
                    be determined by yeas and nays, and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall
                    be entered on the journal of each house respectively. If any bill shall not be returned by the
                    governor within ten days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, it shall be a
                    law, in like manner, as if he had signed unless the general adjournment prevent its return; in which
                    case it shall be a law, unless sent back within three days after their next meeting.</p>
            <p>24th. Every order, resolution, or vote, to which the concurrence of both houses may be necessary,
                    except on a question of adjournment, shall be presented to the governor, and before it shall take
                    effect, be approved by him; or being disapproved, shall be repassed by a majority of all the members
                    elected to both houses, according to the rules and limitations prescribed in case of a bill.</p>
            <p>And on motion,</p>
            <p>The same was referred to a committee of the whole convention, and made the order of the day for
                    Tuesday next.</p>

                    respective counties, any two of whom shall form a quorum, shall constitute the circuit court; and
                    shall have a common law and chancery jurisdiction, and also complete criminal jurisdiction, in all
                    such cases, and in such manner as shall be directed by law: <hi rend="i">Provided,</hi> That nothing

                    presidents, as the exigencies of the state may require.</p>
            <p>Sec. 4th. The judges of the supreme, the circuit, and other inferior courts, shall hold their offices

                    appointed by the governor, by and with the advice and consent of the senate; and the associate

                    first have obtained from one or more of the judges of the supreme court, or from one or more of the
                    presidents of the circuit courts, a certificate that he is well qualified to execute the duties of
                    the office of clerk of the circuit court: <hi rend="i">Provided,</hi> That nothing herein contained
                    shall prevent the circuit court, in any county, from appointing a clerk pro tern, until a qualified
                    clerk may be duly elected. All clerks shall be removeable by their respective courts for breach of
                    good behaviour, or for incapacity to discharge the duties of the office, subject to an appeal from
                    the circuit to the supreme court, as in other cases; and in all cases of complaint for the purpose
                    of removing a clerk, the court shall judge of the facts as well as the law.</p>

                    prosecutions shall be carried on in the name and by the authority of the state of Indiana; and all
                    indictments shall conclude "against the peace and dignity of the same."</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>

                    m is the regular measure of all book work, and the only guard against imposition of large margins
                    and wide lines; but what amounts to the same, is $21 a sheet for every five hundred
                    copies; the sheet to make 16 pages of good workmanlike octavo printing–the paper separate
                    as before. These are the common fair terms of such work all over this state. I will stipulate for
                    the delivery of 16 pages every two weeks, if furnished in time with copy; and could make them every
                    week, but will not say positively in so short a time. I must expect, that the convention, should
                    they sanction the contract, will recommend the fact to the early and effectual attention of the

            <p>Mr. Parke, from the select committee appointed on the article relative to the judiciary department of

            <p>Sec. 1. The judiciary power of this state, both as to matters of law and equity, shall be vested in
                    one supreme court, in circuit courts, and in such other inferior courts as the legislature may from
                    time to time direct and establish.</p>
            <p>Sec. 2. The supreme court shall consist of three judges, any two of whom shall form a quorum, and
                    shall have appellate jurisdiction only, which shall be co-extensive with the limits of the state,

                    time be prescribed by law.</p>
            <p>Sec. 3. The circuit courts shall each consist of a president, and two associate judges. The state
                    shall be divided by law into three circuits, for each of which a president shall be appointed, who,
                    during his continuance in office, shall reside therein, the president and associate judges in their
                    respective circuits, shall have common law and chaneery <pb n="132" id="VAA4025-061-2-060"/>
                    jurisdiction, as also complete criminal jurisdiction, in all such cases, and in such manner, as may
                    be prescribed by law. The president alone, in the absence of the associate judges, shall be
                    competent to hold a court, as also the two associate judges, in the absence of the president, shall
                    be competent to hold a court, except in capital cases, and cases in chancery: <hi rend="i">Provided,</hi> That nothing herein contained shall prevent the legislature from increasing the
                    number of circuits and presidents, as the exigencies of the state may from time to time require.</p>
            <p>Sec. 4. The judges of the supreme court, the circuit, and other inferior courts, shall hold their
                    offices during the term of seven years, if they shall so long behave well, and shall, at stated
                    times, receive for their services, a compensation, which shall not be diminished during their
                    continuance in office.</p>
            <p>Sec. 5. The judges of the supreme court shall, by virtue of their offices, be conservators of the
                    peace throughout the state; as also the presidents of the circuit courts, in their respective
                    circuits, and the associate judges, in their respective counties.</p>
            <p>Sec. 6. The supreme court shall hold its sessions at the seat of government, at such times as shall
                    be prescribed by law; and the circuit courts shall be held in the respective counties, as may be
                    directed by law.</p>
            <p>Sec. 7. The judges of the supreme court shall be appointed by the governor, by and with the advice
                    and consent of the senate. The presidents of the circuit courts shall be appointed by joint ballot
                    of both branches of the legislature; and the associate judges of the circuit courts shall be elected
                    by the qualified electors in their respective counties.</p>
            <p>Sec. 8. The supreme court shall appoint its own clerk; and the clerks of the circuit courts, in the
                    several counties, shall be elected by the qualified electors in the several counties; but no person
                    shall be eligible to the office of clerk of the circuit court, in any county, unless he shall first
                    have obtained from one or more of the judges of the supreme court, or from one or more of the
                    presidents of the circuit courts, a certificate, that he is qualified to execute the duties of the
                    office of clerk of the circuit court: <hi rend="i">Provided,</hi> That nothing herein contained
                    shall prevent the circuit court, in each county, from appointing a clerk <hi rend="i">pro tern,</hi>
                    until a qualified clerk may be duly elected: <hi rend="i">And provided also,</hi> That the said
                    clerks respectively, when qualified and elected, shall hold their offices seven years, and no
                    longer, unless re-appointed.</p>
            <pb n="133" id="VAA4025-061-2-061"/>
            <p>Sec. 9. All clerks shall be removeable by impeachment, as in other cases.</p>
            <p>Sec. 10. When any vacancies happen in any of the courts, occasioned by the death, resignation, or
                    removal from office, of any judge of the supreme or circuit courts, or any of the clerks of the said
                    courts, a successor shall be appointed in the same manner as herein before prescribed, who shall
                    hold his office for the period which his predecessor had to serve, and no longer, unless
                    re-appointed.</p>
            <p>Sec. 11. The style of all process shall be, "The state of Indiana." All
                    prosecutions shall be carried on in the name and by the authority of the state of Indiana; and all
                    indictments shall conclude, against the peace and dignity of the same.</p>

                    long behave well–whose powers and duties shall from time to time be regulated and defined

            <p>The said article was further amended, by adding thereto, a ninth section, as follows: –
                    "No new county shall be established by the general assembly, which shall reduce the county

            <p>Sec. 1. Knowledge and learning generally diffused through a community, being essential to the
                    preservation of a free government, and spreading the opportunities and advantages of education
                    through the various parts of the country being highly conducive to this end, it shall be the duty of
                    the general assembly to provide by law, for the improvement of such lands as are or hereafter may be
                    granted by the <placeName>

                    </placeName> to this state, for the use of schools, and to apply any funds which may be raised from
                    such lands, or from any other quarter, to the accomplishment of the grand object for which they are
                    or may be intended. But no lands granted for the use of schools, shall be sold by the authority of
                    this state, prior to the year and the monies which may be raised out of the sale of any such lands,
                    or otherwise obtained, for the purposes aforesaid, shall b and remain a fund, for the exclusive
                    purpose <pb n="143" id="VAA4025-061-2-071"/> of promoting the interest of literature and the
                    sciences, and for the support of seminaries and public schools. The general assembly shall, from
                    time to time, pass such laws as shall be calculated to encourage intellectual, scientifical, and
                    agricultural, improvement, by allowing rewards and immunities for the promotion and improvement of
                    arts, sciences, commerce, manufactures, and natural history; and to countenance and encourage the
                    principles of humanity, honesty, industry, and morality.</p>
            <p>Sec. 2. It shall be the duty of the general assembly, as soon as circumstances will permit, to
                    provide by law for a general system of education, ascending in a regular gradation, from township
                    schools to a state university, wherein tuition shall be gratis, and equally open to all.</p>
            <p>Sec. 3. And for the promotion of such salutary end, the money which shall be paid as an equivalent by
                    persons exempt from militia duty, shall be exclusively, and in equal proportion, applied to the
                    support of county seminaries; also, all fines assessed for any breach of the penal laws, shall be
                    applied to the said seminaries, in the counties wherein they shall be assessed.</p>
            <p>Sec. 4. It shall be the duty of the general assembly, as soon as circumstances will permit, to form a
                    penal code, founded on the principle of reformation, and not of vindictive justice; and also to
                    provide one or more farms, to be an assylum for those persons, who by reason of age, infirmity, or
                    other misfortunes, may have a claim on the aid and beneficence of society, on such principles, that
                    such persons may therein find employment, and every reasonable comfort, and lose by their
                    usefulness, the degrading sense of dependence.</p>
            <p>Sec. 5. The general assembly shall cause at least ten per cent to be reserved out of the proceeds of
                    the sales of town lots, in the seat of justice of each county, for the use of a public library, for
                    such county; and at the same session, they shall incorporate a library company, under such rules and

            <p>Among the more rewarding historical documents are those which reveal the youth who is father of the
                    man. Claude G. Bowers, editor, historian, ambassador, was a Hoosier schoolboy of seventeen in the
                    early fall of 1896 when he boldly opened correspondence with Dr. William Everett<hi rend="sup">1</hi> of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Quincy</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
               </placeName>. Dr. Everett, prickly, cultivated son of the famous
                    Edward Everett,<hi rend="sup">2</hi> had achieved considerable distinction in his own right as a
                    scholar, orator, schoolmaster of Adams Academy in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quincy</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and Mugwump congressman in the early 1890's. He had enormously impressed
                    young Bowers when he came to <placeName>

                    Democratic Convention.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Having visited Everett during his stay in the city, the
                    precocious Bowers now invited him to contribute to a literary undertaking of the <placeName>

                    unlikely friendship between Bowers and the fifty-eight-year-old Everett flowered briefly from the

                    reading took him roving through the masters of the centuries. Irish oratory, English poetry, and
                    history of all kinds were his favorite study. His notion of starting a literary magazine of
                    cosmopolitan scope must have seemed to him a natural extension of his budding tastes and hopes.</p>
            <p>Bowers' letters to Everett, written between September, 1896, and November, 1897, reflect the
                    surging intellectual emancipation of a boy approaching manhood. At first he was careful and
                    ingratiating in his deference to the New <placeName>

                    stilted style, and excessive sobriety. "The incorrectness and inelegance of my diction was
                    probably due to a limited vocabulary, and an indiscriminating selection which I know was absolutely
                    inexcusable," Bowers acknowledged in his third letter. "But … [your]
                    letter has surely wrought a revolution in me–one which I am quite certain will eventually
                    help me vastly."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> As part of his broad program of self-improvement

            <p>In time a change came over Bowers' end of the correspondence. An emerging confidence in his
                    own judgments, a warm, welling Hoosier chauvinism, a perceptible glimmer of class consciousness
                    marked his later letters. Asked by the acerbic Everett whether he ever laughed, Bowers gaily replied
                    that he "thought it best to maintain a very serious and rigid deportment in all
                    communications with a man from <placeName>

                    Scott (a favorite with Everett) and expressed preference for the
                    "philosophic-realistic" novel, particularly Hugo's <hi rend="i">Les
                        Miserables.</hi> He told of the visit of the leonine western poet, Joaquin Miller, who lectured

                    </placeName> in behalf of Bowers' magazine project. Miller reminded him of Walt Whitman,
                    and Bowers confessed a puzzled admiration for the elemental imagination of <hi rend="i">Leaves of
                            Grass.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
               </hi> Taking up another subject of earlier letters, the question
                    of how best to conduct a school debating society, Bowers described a fresh plan to form a large
                    discussion club composed mostly of young laboring men, whose views on political and social issues he
                    hoped would provide a bracing contrast to the orthodoxy of the classroom.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps most intriguing is the light shed on Bowers' youthful vision of history, and the
                    duty of its practitioners. In a letter of January 30, 1897, he spelled out his view at some

                                    American boy feel alarmed at the prospects? I have been told in the schools that we

            <p>Bowers' final two letters to Everett merit full transcription as a fitting climax and
                    termination of the incongruous correspondence. His unabashed love of region, the growing militance
                    of his young radicalism, his cool self-assertion increasingly dominate his mood, despite occasional
                    plunges into juvenile rhetoric and mawkish sentiment. Bowers has obviously freed himself from the
                    leading strings of his austere Yankee mentor. More remarkably, in these letters he clearly
                    anticipates his future career as Jeffersonian historian, semiofficial party ideologist of Democratic
                    liberals, and champion of Spanish Republicanism. The schoolboy was coming of age.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Friend:-</salute>
                        <p>Of course I was delighted to learn that during the last few months you had not
                                    entirely forgotten me. I had an idea that your long silence was due to a lack of
                                    time–and of course I could not hold you responsible for that. With me,
                                    this summer has been gliding smoothly along in marked contrast to the political
                                    excitment of last summer. And although I am working in the Library and reading
                                    considerable during spare moments I am not, as you evidently fear mergeing into a
                                    sour and solemn book-worm, who looks upon pleasure and exercise with a sort of
                                    contempt. Judgeing from my limited observation, it is probably true that we of
                                    Indiana are not much given to extensive pleasure trips. But during the warm summer
                                    months, I am very fond of wandering aimlessly along the dusty Hoosier road-ways
                                    through the region of the rich farm lands which have made of Ind. such a fruitful
                                    garden. We are not very rich in the grand elements of Nature–no
                                    mountains, few hills, and, save in northern Ind. one seldom meets a lake. But I love
                                    the homely beauty of our simple landscape–the waving fields of grain, the
                                    green sward of pasture lands streaching afar off to the cool retreat of splendid
                                    forests, and every now and then, a large inviting farmhouse seting away back from
                                    the roadside and surrounded by a few forest giants. Our farmers as a rule are easy
                                    going and contented men but thrifty and intelligent. Most of them as you may know
                                    came here many years ago from <placeName>

                                    generosity and hospitality, and the wayside rambler can always count on royal
                                    treatment along the route. But as I graduate next February, I am now arranging a
                                    more extensive journey. Begining with next March I hope to carry out a long
                                    cherished desire to visit the south, or that portion of it bordering along the

                        <p>My but your reply to my note on Danton made me feel like some guilty thing."
                                    I think you misunderstand me. According to "Danton in the
                                    Revolution" he was a tenderhearted and lovable man in the midst of human
                                    wolves. Loving the common people for humanity's sake, he was willing to do
                                    and dare anything in their service. The whirl of barbarism could no more be checked
                                    by his influence, than could the waves of the sea be made to stand still at the
                                    command of Canute the Dane. It certainly can not be urged that the revolution ought
                                    never to have begun in the first place for did not the blood of the Terror wash away
                                    the sins and corruptions of generations of barbarious rule? The butchery once begun
                                    Danton's <hi rend="i">will</hi> failed him although he abhorred the course
                                    and despised the wretches with whom he was associated. At length a reaction set
                                    in—Dantons <hi rend="i">will</hi> came to the rescue,–he
                                    spoke–and died. He may have set liberty back 25 years but that is a
                                    matter of foresight, and can not be charged up against the heart. However, now that
                                    I have your opinion I will investigate further.</p>

                                 <hi rend="sup">17</hi> In his letter of March 13, 1897, Bowers had
                                            written: "I have recently been reading a biography of Danton the
                                            much-cursed leader of the Parisian mob, and have come to the conclusion that
                                            of all the great characters of history, there are but few names, that can
                                            out-shine in love for humanity, and in ultimate benefit to humanity the name
                                            of Geo F [J] Danton. Judgeing from his public actions, I should think that
                                            he was a great-minded, golden-hearted man–a victim of
                                            circumstances. I think that if some Danton should rise up in Russia today
                                            and purge her misery with the blood of some of her tyrants, she, in common

                                    the Andrews dismissal is incomprehensible. Oh, say the authorities, we
                                    can't expect further endowments with such a man as Andrews at the head of

                                    beleives. Dr. Andrews does not teach his doctrine in the class room. He was merely
                                    exercising his right of free speech before the world. His dismissal is a stab at
                                    liberty. It cannot but intimidate others in like positions. It will make cowards of

                                    money by it, seems the way most boys look at things. These boys are to be the future
                                    ruling generation. When I consider the fact that the wealthy–that is of

                                    my blood boil. Now don't imagine that I am runing a mad race with Tillman,
                                    or am trying to put Ignatius Donnelly to shame. It is all too true.
                                    Whew–I mean of course that the tendency is true. I am reading Shakespeare
                                    this summer. For Goodness sake now, <hi rend="i">was</hi> Hamlet realily mad. I
                                    decided not. I then read a great many authorities. Some say he is, some that he is
                                    not and all argue like trained lawyers. I came to the conclusion that I was nearer
                                    mad than Hamlet after having waded through the numerous arguments. One man even
                                    asserts that Hamlet is a woman! Merciful Heaven! What next. They will end with the
                                    discovery that Hamlet wore bloomers I suppose. Well I have written much nonsense no
                                    doubt as I always do. But I <hi rend="i">may</hi> improve some day. I am very sorry

                        <p>This is an ideal evening to write a letter. A cold rain is falling out-side, and the
                                    wind howls around the corner of the house, while just before me is an open grate,
                                    before which, stretched out at full length, lies an overfed cat–a
                                    favorite of mine. Now what more <hi rend="i">could</hi> one ask for solid comfort?</p>
                        <p>I hardly know how you received the impression that I have finished at the High
                                    School, as I do not graduate until February. But your advise as to college
                                    education, and on the use and abuse of money will not be lost. I am not among those
                                    that consider money and money-making the supreme thing in life. My ambition does not
                                    lie in that direction. In fact, I may be all wrong, but I have only contempt for the
                                    man who measures eternity by the clink of gold. All I ask is comfortable
                                    circumstances in life–an elegant home–a magnificient
                                    library–and I will be content from the financial veiw-point. As to
                                    college–I have reserved the next five years of my life to the students
                                    lamp. During that period of preparation I shall make a speciality of
                                    History–or that part of it which deals with the development of ideas, the
                                    growth of government, and the triumphant march of political and religious liberty. I
                                    shall put much of my time on <placeName>

                                    </placeName>, Bentham and Comte. Political Economy will command a good share of my
                                    time, and while I must study Adam Smith and Mill, I will turn my attention cheifly
                                    to the modern school so ably represented in this country by Richard T. Ely. I want
                                    an Economy which considers man an important element in its makeup. That Economy
                                    which merely writes down facts, right or wrong, and presents no ideas for the
                                    betterment of conditions is as cold and heartless as the fossil that it is. Then I
                                    have joted down for study Plato's Republic, Aristotles Ethics, Butlers

                        <p>I am now trying to read Vanity Fair and it is real drudgery for me. I can't
                                    see in what way it is the greatest product in English fiction. The style seems
                                    commonplace. The thought is not at all profound or else too much so. It only seems
                                    to me the childish mutterings of a bitter man, on human nature. You tell me that my
                                    admiration for "Les Miserables" is morbid. I cant see the reason.
                                    The style is elegant, the language eloquent, the thought noble and the sentiment
                                    pure. It teaches me that beneath the rags there beats a heart. I am now begining to
                                    study politics–what shall I read. I don't care a continental for
                                    this hereditary politics. I must determine out of my own mind. It seems to me,
                                    judging from limited observation, that while the two great political parties swerve
                                    slightly now and then upon contemporary questions, they do as a whole, most
                                    accurately represent the two mighty tendencies of political history. Is not the
                                    republican party as much the crystalezation of Hamiltonian logic as is the dem.
                                    party the reflection of Jeffersonian principles. And is'n't it
                                    true, that <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, clear-minded, conservative,–despised the common people and
                                    leaned towards an aristocratic government?–While Jefferson, loving the
                                    masses, beleived in the weakest government compatible with organized [society], and
                                    looked with distrust on concentrated power? If my judgement is clear, <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                                    </placeName> represented the aristocratic idea-: Jefferson the democratic idea. To
                                    me, Federalism, Whigism and republicanism are nothing other than Hamiltonianism.
                                    While ante-Federalism and democracy just as clearly reflect Jeffersonian precepts.
                                    Certainly H. and J. did represent the two great schools of political thought that
                                    always have and ever will strive for the mastery. I beleive just now in J. I respect

                                    innocently asked how "Bowers can speak for the stage, when he <hi rend="i">looks down</hi> upon it."</p>
                        <p>I have been reading Chaucer and Spenser of late. Spenser is melodious and imaginative
                                    enough but ye Gods, how I do dispise allegory. I am so unfortunate as to dislike
                                    Bunyan, and Kiplings jungle stories, which of necessity I attempted to read are
                                    absolutely unbearable dispite the satire on the poor nature of man. I much prefer
                                    Chaucer to Spenser. The old patriarch of English song, has such a charming insight
                                    into nature and man! One meets his characters at every move. How shall I learn to
                                    love Bunyan and Spenser? It is the fad you know.<hi rend="sup">⋆</hi> And
                                    now about my feeling–why eliminate emotion from my nature and I am all
                                    gone. My great disappointment has been my failure to find a friend near at hand to
                                    whom I could pour out all my thoughts and feeling, and hear his, in return. A
                                    friends hearthstone seems to me the one oasis in the sands of existence. People
                                    complain of the lost charms of their childhood. I have a pet theory that the springs
                                    of perpetual youth are to be found within each human breast. The friends of my
                                    stick-horse period–how changed! In those days we were so unselfish. We
                                    shared joys and sorrows. We were all feeling, and our feelings commingling made
                                    every hour a delight. As we grow older we begin to throw water over the warmth of
                                    affection, and too often, I think indifference puts out the flame entirely. <hi rend="i">Tom.</hi> Hendricks was a great Hoosier.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> We all

                                    school. It was in November–three years ago. It was raining
                                    outside–a cold dismal rain, and the sky was dark and heavy. You
                                    can't imagine my gloom. She came like the revelation of a star on a black
                                    and stormy night. Yet the memory of her smile is a perpetual benediction. I hate
                                    this conventionality which declairs that affection was born for the night. In a
                                    beautiful churchyard on a hill sleeps the most affectionate-the sweetest man, I ever
                                    knew. He loved all living things. Yet the coldness of this northern nature hurt his
                                    tender heart. He was demonstrative–open, frank, and loving. After his
                                    death, all droped a tear and paid a tribute, and laid a flower upon his lonely
                                    grave. But he never knew they loved him, and among them he was as a delicate flower
                                    in the midst of snow, going sadly, yet smilingly through life feeling as Byron must

            <p>In the death of Professor Emeritus Albert L. Kohlmeier on December 28, 1964, Indiana University lost
                    one of the most versatile, learned, and humane of its faculty members. Dr. Kohlmeier was born at
                    Mackey in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, on March 24, 1883. As a boy he studied at a one-room country school and later
                    rode horseback to attend <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oakland City</settlement>
                    </placeName> High School seven miles from his home. After graduating from this high school he
                    enrolled at Indiana University where he earned the A.B. degree in 1908. Three years later he
                    received the A.M. degree in history from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> University, and in 1920 the Ph.D. degree in history from the same institution.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Dr. Kohlmeier began his teaching career in a one-room school in southern Indiana. He soon
                    became chairman of the history department at New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> High School, and shortly thereafter he was made principal of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oakland City</settlement>
                    </placeName> High School. Undoubtedly these experiences reinforced one of his abiding
                    characteristics–his appreciation and respect for mankind. He brought to his academic
                    career a deep affection for the people from whom he sprang, and his understanding of and generous
                    attitude toward others expanded and ripened into a sympathy for young people and a concern about
                    them as individuals. These qualities were the foundation of his devoted service as one Indiana
                    University's greatest teachers. In his teaching he distinguished himself in the fields of
                    American colonial history, American diplomatic history, and American historiography.</p>
            <p>Professor Kohmeier became an instructor in history at Indiana University in 1911, and remained with
                    his Alma Mater the rest of his life. He became a full professor in 1920, served as head of the
                    history department from 1926 until 1948, and retired from active service in 1953, at which time he
                    was made emeritus. Even then his teaching career was not ended for he later taught part-time at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Extension Center. Under Professor Kohlmeier's leadership the Department of
                    History grew in stature and became one of the University's strongest departments. Its
                    graduate program was large, but interest in and responsibility for the preparation of <list type="footnotes">

                            resolution adopted by the Faculty Council of Indiana University.</item>

                    <pb n="172" id="VAA4025-061-2-100"/> undergraduates, especially those planning to teach, was never
                    overlooked.</p>
            <p>Professor Kohlmeier's service to the University was manifest in many ways other than that
                    given through the history department. He served on numerous committees, especially those concerned
                    with basic university policies; he represented the University at functions both on and off the
                    campus; he was counselor, academic and personal, to students and colleagues alike; he helped
                    interpret the University to the citizens generally; and he felt a personal responsibility to
                    represent the University at its best in his own personal life. His commitment and loyalty to Indiana
                    University were deep and abiding. His criticisms of university policies, more frequent than many
                    realized, were expressed in committee sessions, personal conferences, and away from the limelight.</p>
            <p>Professor Kohlmeier's scholarship was both broad and deep. Many graduate students thought,
                    at times not without justification, that he knew some areas of study outside his specialization as
                    well as or even better than many men who taught those fields. He read widely, reflected carefully
                    upon what he read, and spoke less, not more, than he knew. Despite an unusually heavy schedule, he
                    wrote book reviews, articles, and a heavily documented study entitled <hi rend="i">The Old
                        Northivest as the Keystone of the Arch of the American Federal Union</hi> (1938).</p>
            <p>He was a long-time member of the American Historical Association, the Mississippi Valley Historical
                    Association, and the Indiana Historical Society.</p>
            <p>Professor Kohlmeier also reserved time and effort for his home, his church, and his friends. In 1910
                    he married Lucie Mayhall and their happiness was life-long. His devotion to the First Presbyterian
                    Church of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> was grounded in humility. The warmth of his personal friendships reached men from all
                    walks of life. He was equally at home with farmers and neighbors, colleagues at the University, and
                    leaders of state. Conservative in his views, he was unusually tolerant and understanding. Possessed
                    of infinite common sense, he lived among men as one of them. Professor Kohlmeier constantly served
                    Indiana University from 1911 until his death in 1964. He generously gave his best to his Alma Mater,
                    repaying it many times over for its contribution to him.</p>

            <p>Walking through the halls of Shortridge High School today, one observes the names of many pillars of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> education: for instance, the Charity Dye Library with its George W. Hufford collection
                    of books written by former students, the Rhoda Selleck Art Gallery, and a plaque dedicated to Laura
                    Donnan, founder of the Shortridge Senate. These educators were also pillars in the intellectual life
                    of Claude G. Bowers, statesman, politician, diplomat, historian, and graduate of Shortridge, then
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> High School. The intellectual excitement generated in Bowers through his high school
                    years has been preserved for a new generation of students through his high school diaries. These
                    diaries cover Bowers' life, activities, and thought through two periods: July, 1895,
                    through August, 1896; and September, 1897, through January, 1899, one year after his graduation from
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> High School.</p>
            <p>Bowers must have also brought to his teachers an intellectual excitement stemming from his intense
                    interest in literature, history, and politics—a concern with plumbing the depths of his
                    studies that is too rarely found in the modern high school student. That his academic interests did
                    not curtail his spirit of fun is evident from a succession of evenings in November, 1897, just
                    before his nineteenth birthday. On these nights he engaged in dissecting Vanity Fair, visited a
                    Spooners Club ("50 kisses, 3 girls on lap, 25 embraces. Ye Gods! and still we
                    live." [p. 110]), carried on at a class dinner, discussed Carlyle, and the fifth night
                    attended Macbeth, in which <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Helena</settlement>
                    </placeName> Modjeska performed at English's Opera House.</p>
            <p>The editors have, of course, been limited by Bowers' own material. While they have entitled
                    the book <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the "Gay Nineties," and purported it to be a recognition of the
                    centennial anniversary of Shortridge, Bowers himself gave <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the high school only the briefest attention. Other than describing the
                    "air" of the city through its residents, newspapers, and theatrical events, Bowers
                    wrote little about the city itself. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Irvington</settlement>
                    </placeName> he described as "classic": "we sped out through the
                    beautiful country all bathed and mellowed by the moon-light-past wood and meadow, past palatial
                    homes ..." (p. 178). There is little evidence of the physical expanse, economic or
                    industrial situation, or population growth of the capital city. Some of this information Professor <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> supplies in the Introduction and Miss Thornbrough in the footnotes.</p>
            <p>While meetings of the senate, oratorical contests, school clubs, and some silly goings-on of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> High School are described in detail, there is little in Bowers' own material
                    to suggest the academic flavor of the school, his courses, or even the personalities known to have
                        <pb n="174" id="VAA4025-061-2-102"/> influenced him so much. The title of the book may be
                    misleading, for Bowers' own thought is centered on problems of national interest and on
                    techniques of oratorical analysis and skill, using <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and his high school experiences as a background and a springboard rather than as a
                    boundary.</p>
            <p>The book does carry a lively cast of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> characters, mentioned by Bowers and brought to life, importance, and relevance through
                    the footnotes. True dedication to the work of future historians is evident in the fine detail
                    researched by the editors-from comparing Bowers' sometimes confusing references to
                    supplying further information, such as the score of a baseball game that Bowers mentions. This
                    detail may be overworked upon occasion and is sometimes uneven: references to Florence and William
                    Atkins, for instance, tell us their birth and death dates, occupations, and spouses; neither Bowers
                    nor the editors connect them as siblings. It will be useful for future analysts, however, to have
                    this mine of information that Miss Thornbrough and Professor <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> have provided.</p>
            <p>Significant discussion of issues of the day, such as the silver question, the possibility of war, the
                    problems of capital and labor, may be found throughout the work. People of the day, such as Booker
                    T. Washington, Eugene V. Debs, Albert J. Beveridge, and Sarah Bernhardt fill the book. Amid people
                    and issues, however, it is the evolution of Bowers' thought and style that is most
                    interesting. For the young, the chief value of these diaries lies in their clear picture of
                    Bowers' development as an analytical thinker and powerful speaker. For the old, the worth
                    of the work lies in its pleasing memory of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> at her literary height, when stars from over the world could bring the "cold <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> audience" to its feet. And for all, the book may serve as a source of those
                    ideas and influences that would catapult this Hoosier boy into national usefulness and fame.</p>

            <p>Maurice Thompson died in his adopted home city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName> in February, 1901, shortly after the publication of his last and only really successful
                    novel, Alice of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Old Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Now we have the first full-length book of any kind about Thompson, which fact alone
                    would make it most welcome. Actually, Thompson has been lucky in his biographer-critic and a long
                    neglect has been partially rectified. A native of Indiana and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName> might object that the background and biography are unevenly developed. The family
                    history, like the story of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery County</region>
                    </placeName> politics and railroad building, is sketchy. But "The Man" Thompson
                    comes out very clearly in the opening chapter. He was a product of a rigidly conservative, isolated,
                    almost nomadic Primitive Baptist background, modified by a taste of small-plantation <pb n="175" id="VAA4025-061-2-103"/> life in antebellum <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>. Sensitive, lively, and ambitious, Thompson had certain severe physical and
                    intellectual limitations which led to emotional instability and drove him to seek success and
                    acceptance in genteel middle-class society. He tried railroad engineering, the law, politics,
                    geology, ornithology, toxophily, and writing of all kinds-fiction, poetry, and criticism in the
                    broadest sense. In most of his endeavors, his achievement was simply modest. But the success he
                    found as a writer was in many ways more than modest. This literary success in his own time is the
                    aspect of Thompson's career that Professor Wheeler emphasizes. No neglected or slighted
                    genius is in evidence.</p>
            <p>Thompson's books–largely poems, novels, and studies of nature and archery-are not
                    negligible, but his literary biography is based primarily on the great mass of his uncollected
                    contributions to magazines, especially his extensive social and literary commentary. This criticism
                    is a "locus classicus of the Genteel Tradition as it developed in the Midwest" (p.
                    138) against the forces of realism, naturalism, science, and materialism-to Thompson the terrifying
                    signs of demoralization and decay in American culture. Here Thompson reveals both the conflicts of
                    his inner experience and the basic commitments of the milieu he spoke for and strove to please.
                    Defective in learning and in power of disinterested analysis, Thompson was often hopelessly
                    contradictory and stubborn. Occasionally his ill-disciplined style developed a dramatic intensity,
                    but more often it was characterized by high emotional heat expressed with "fatal
                    glibness." Nevertheless, his sincere courage and eloquence were applauded by thousands of
                    his contemporaries, not only in Indiana, but wherever there were true believers in the heroism and
                    optimism of "American Christian civilization" in the nineteenth century. Part of
                    what makes Thompson look so "wrong" today is the result of radical shifts in taste
                    and opinion which took place in the two or three decades after his death.</p>
            <p>Professor Wheeler's arrangement is logical enough, but it creates a falling action because
                    Thompson's "creative" work is much less significant than his criticism.
                    The discussion of Thompson's poetry is dominated by a full quotation and lengthy discussion
                    of "A Voodoo Prophecy," revealing Thompson's complex emotional reaction
                    to the Negro question. The many poems on patriotic, classical, and domestic themes are rightly
                    dismissed as undistinguished. However, in the nature poetry, representing half the bulk of some 170
                    poems, the freshness which attracted Howells, Longfellow, and Gilder can still be felt.
                    Unfortunately, not much of his occasional dramatic power or freshness got into Thompson's
                    novels and sketches. In the dialect of rustic, minor characters, and in the autobiographical A
                    Banker of Bankersville, Thompson approached the realism he abhorred as a critic. But his plots were
                    contrived and unconvincing and his major characters hopelessly sentimentalized and idealized. The
                    effects we would like to admire seem condescending or accidental.</p>
            <p>Reviewing this book makes one wish there could be more attempts to do justice to figures like
                    Thompson. Our sympathies go out to the scholar. As a literary artist, Thompson is very nearly a dud.
                    The scholar must feel that he could spend his precious time better. But as <pb n="176" id="VAA4025-061-2-104"/> a human phenomenon, individual and social, Thompson is at once
                    intensely interesting and maddeningly complex. Furthermore, an attempt to understand him can become
                    a painful probing of ourselves as heirs of nineteenth-century America. The attempt is distinctly
                    worth the effort.</p>

            <p>Matthew Elliott was born in Ulster, and in 1761 he came to America. In 1763 he served under Colonel
                    Henry Bouquet in raising the Indian siege of Fort Pitt. He became reasonably successful as a trader
                    in the Shawnee country and gained the confidence of the Indians.</p>

                    </placeName> found Elliott, like many Americans, pulled in two directions. Although he later claimed
                    that he had been a Loyalist from the beginning, it was not until the spring of 1778 that he fled
                    from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> to join the British at <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Elliott was along as an Indian leader and scout. In June, 1780, he led some of the
                    Indians who participated in Henry Bird's successful British invasion of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. In August, 1782, he took part in the Battle of Blue Licks, the worst disaster suffered
                    by Kentuckians during the Revolution.</p>
            <p>In the period between the wars Elliott, as assistant agent of Indian affairs at British-held <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>, helped to furnish provisions for the tribes which repulsed American military
                    expeditions under Josiah Harmar and Arthur St. Clair. The defeat of the Indians by Anthony Wayne in
                    August, 1794, was a factor in bringing about the British agreement to evacuate American soil.</p>
            <p>In 1796 Elliott was appointed by Lord Dorchester to the position of superintendent of Indian affairs
                    at Amherstburg, which soon became the British Indian department's most important post in
                    Upper <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Although a dispute with the army brought about his dismissal in 1798, his popularity
                    was so great that he soon was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Upper <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>. Here this illiterate frontiersman served creditably for many years.</p>
            <p>By 1807 deteriorating relations between Great Britain and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> pointed to the importance to the British of having on the Canadian frontier officials
                    who had the confidence of the Indians. In 1808 Matthew Elliott was restored to the superintendency
                    at Amherstburg. He was handicapped by the British government's desire to have the Indians
                    living at peace but ready for war, but Elliott did his work well. Although he was past seventy years
                    of age, his contribution as a leader of Indians in the early stages of the War of 1812 was
                    comparable to that which he had rendered in the American Revolution. His activity, however, was cut
                    short by illness, and death came to the old warrior on May 7, 1814.</p>
            <p>Although Professor Horsman received the major portion of his education in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, his objectivity has not been affected. Both British <pb n="177" id="VAA4025-061-2-105"/> Indian policy and that of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> are treated fairly, and the mistakes and weaknesses of Matthew Elliott are readily
                    admitted. The footnotes and a bibliographical note indicate thorough research in both Canadian and
                    American sources. Although the book is marred by an occasional typographical error, the author,
                    whose literary style is excellent, seems to have achieved his objective: to rescue Matthew Elliott
                    from semi-oblivion.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Three Worlds of Captain John Smith.</hi> By Philip L. Barbour. (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1964. Pp. xix, 553. Notes, maps, illustrations,
                    bibliography, index. $7.50.)</head>
            <p>Philip L. Barbour's The Three Worlds of Captain John Smith comes close to being the
                    definitive work on the remarkable career of a controversial man. The abundance of details, the
                    meticulous scholarship, and the full description of the life of Smith compensate in part for the
                    rather cumbersome style and the weak characterization of the central figure. It would be difficult
                    to point to a significant event or an important relationship in Smith's life that the
                    author omitted. This encyclopedic approach of names, dates, genealogies, and marriage alliances does
                    detract from the enjoyment of the volume as a biography. Smith, the man of action, is lost in the
                    morass of factual evidence.</p>
            <p>The "first world" is that of Smith as a soldier of fortune fighting the Turks in
                    Central Europe. This sets the stage for his later life and is an important segment in the structure
                    of the biography. John Smith, of humble origins and limited formal education, was determined to
                    succeed and to advance his position in society, and he early chose the life of an adventurer as the
                    means of improving himself. Smith's one immediate reward was that he received the rank of
                    "captain" and the title of "gentleman" by virtue of his military
                    and dueling skills. When Transylvanian Prince Zsigmond granted him the coat of arms of
                    "Three Turks Heads," Captain John Smith, Gentleman, achieved the status that would
                    lead in a few years to his membership on the Virginia Council and finally to the presidency of the
                    colony.</p>
            <p>The "second world" of Smith, that of colonist, is a carefully drawn picture of a
                    latter-day Elizabethan who devoted his talents and energies to self-advancement and to the promotion
                    of British colonization. The author answers the perplexing questions of why Smith emerged as a
                    leader in Virginia and how he kept the colony intact. Smith's pragmatic approach is in
                    sharp contrast to the naivete of the other leaders. He appears to stand alone in his awareness of
                    the needs of the colonists, his understanding and application of techniques of survival, and his
                    cleverness in dealing with the Indians. Above all, he was dedicated to colonization, and his
                    practical and realistic policies made him a natural leader and a stabilizing force in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>'s early history. The confusion and dissension that beset the colony following
                    Smith's return to <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> attest to his unique abilities.</p>
            <pb n="178" id="VAA4025-061-2-106"/>
            <p>The "third world" of Captain John Smith, his activities as a promoter of
                    colonization, is the most significant contribution the book makes to the voluminous writings about
                    this legendary figure. Barbour presents details of Smith's efforts in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> to colonize New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, a facet of his life usually overlooked or underplayed in the story of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Puritan</settlement>
                    </placeName> migration. Smith wanted to promote, to participate in, and to benefit from colonization
                    ventures. But lacking in funds and position (his titles of captain and gentleman were of little
                    value to him in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>), he did not participate directly in the settlement of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> nor did he benefit financially from it. Never did he receive one acre of land in either
                    Virginia or New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Smith was successful, however, as a promoter through his various writings-histories, descriptive
                    narratives, and promotional tracts-and his maps of the New World. This volume is a significant
                    addition to American historiography with its careful analysis of Smith's methods of
                    composing, compiling, and copying and its excellent evaluation of the accuracy and reliability of
                    his works. Barbour rightly points out that Smith's detailed maps and the ethnological
                    information about the Indians of Virginia deserve recognition and praise.</p>
            <p>To write a biography of such a colorful and complex figure is a difficult task, and to place the man
                    in the context of his times adds to the problem. Barbour has done an admirable job. He has carefully
                    analyzed and organized a vast body of material, and he is fair, unsentimental, and sympathetic in
                    his treatment of his subject. Though the dynamic personality of Captain John Smith does not spring
                    to life, it is evident from this fine book that first and last he was a man of his times and an
                    important promoter of colonization.</p>

            <p>Bernhard Knollenberg offers a refreshingly different approach to the early life of George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Unlike numerous other biographers, he endeavors to present no more and no less than
                    the available evidence warrants. In his Foreword the author states the rigid standards of
                    scholarship which have been his guide. First, he relies only upon existing contemporary sources and
                    does not try to overcome any lack of evidence by resorting to "dubious reminiscences and
                    conjectures." Second, he is as critical of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s own statements as he is of other evidence, and if there is reason to suspect
                    that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> "lied or was mistaken," this is taken into consideration. Third, he
                    refrains from "undue glorification" of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> in order to present him as accurately as possible and to avoid being unjust to the
                    reputations of others. Fourth, he treats topically many aspects of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s life that would be lost in a strictly chronological account.</p>
            <p>As a result of this approach the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> that emerges from Knollenberg's pages is not the adulated hero to whom we are
                    frequently accustomed. He is rather a real person in whom personal ambitions are combined with a
                    sense of social responsibility, a man complete with <pb n="179" id="VAA4025-061-2-107"/> the mixture
                    of virtues and shortcomings inherent in human nature. It is not Knollenberg's intention to
                    detract from the greatness of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but only to portray his many-sided personality as accurately as the limited
                    contemporary evidence will permit. Adherence to his own standards prevents Knollenberg from
                    presenting a full-length portrait complete in every detail. However, the topical approach to such
                    aspects of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s life as his role as a family man, a planter and businessman, a speculator in
                    western lands, and a young politician gives the work a sense of unity and balance that would have
                    been impossible if the author's framework had been limited to chronology.</p>
            <p>Knollenberg is concerned with the evolution of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s character and abilities, and he has admirably succeeded in preventing his
                    judgments from being unduly influenced by the reputation which <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> deservedly won in his later life. For example, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s early military ability is put in proper perspective. Of the encounter with
                    the French in 1754 the author concludes that "perhaps the killing of Jumonville and his men
                    may be condoned on the ground of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s youth and inexperience," but to glorify this episode as a brilliant
                    and significant victory, as some historians have done, "is preposterous" (p. 20).
                    Knollenberg is convinced that there was little in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s early military experience which foreshadowed the devotion to duty which
                    characterized him as commander-in-chief during the Revolution.</p>

               <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s interest in western land grew from his military service.
                    Knollenberg's account of this, which reveals some of the least admirable aspects of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s character, is the most valuable original contribution made by this work.</p>
            <p>Knollenberg attempts to show changes in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s character as the breach between the colonies and Great Britain widened. He
                    wishes, as he states in his Foreword, to demonstrate that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> emerged as "one of the great penmen of the Revolution," comparable to
                    James Otis, Benjamin <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>, John Dickinson, Thomas Jefferson, Samuel Adams, John Adams, and Thomas Paine. The
                    author quotes at length from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s letters to demonstrate this, but he fails to show that these had the
                    widespread influence which would seem to be a necessary condition to justify adding <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s name to the noble company of "penmen" that he has listed.</p>
            <p>As this work concludes, the reader is not certain why <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>

            <p>Every student of the Civil War must, at some time, have puzzled over and through the diary of Adam
                    Gurowski. Its outspoken and vitriolic statements on the issues and conduct of the war, its damaging
                    and near-libelous comments on the quality of the nation's leadership, and its high conceit
                    and self-righteous tone clearly have marked it as the production of an unusual and even sensational
                    individual. That such was indeed the case has now been demonstrated. In a study that originated at
                    the University of Illinois under the late James G. Randall, Professor Fischer, of Oklahoma State
                    University, has "recounted for the first time the Civil War actions and opinions of Count
                    Adam Gurowski" (p. vii). The author's purpose "is to understand the Count
                    as he revealed himself during the war years and to make pattern of the multitude of opinions on men
                    and issues found in the jungle of his writings" (p. viii). This proved to be no small task,
                    for Gurowski was a prolific writer-not only as a diarist, but as a letter writer and an author of
                    books. There seems to be little if anything on which Gurowski did not have an opinion. This study is
                    based, then, to a very high degree on Gurowski's own statements. Their
                    "pattern" appears in a series of topical chapters, detailing Gurowski's
                    opinions on and attitudes toward Radical Republicanism, <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
               </placeName>'s
                    cabinet, northern military leadership, international relations, and slavery. Two chapters deal with
                    a libel suit brought against Gurowski for statements made in his published diary.</p>
            <p>Count Adam Gurowski (for he was a Polish nobleman) was every bit as bizarre and eccentric as his
                    diary indicates. His penchant for causes, to which he attached himself with a whole-hearted
                    devotion, resulted in an erratic and frequently contradictory career. He was rude, crude, and
                    unmindful of the feelings of others; he was quick to take offense and, always armed, brandished his
                    pistol at the slightest provocation. On one occasion, he described himself, rather aptly, as a
                    savage animal by nature. Early in his life, Gurowski dedicated himself to the cause of freeing his
                    native <placeName>
                        <country reg="pl">Poland</country>
                    </placeName> from the Russian yoke, only to abandon the Polish freedom movement in favor of a
                    Russian-led Panslavism. Disenchanted with the Russians, he fled to Prussia and eventually to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, which he came to regard as the incarnation of liberty. In the 1850's, he took
                    up the cause of the abolitionists and soon became identified with the Radical Republicans.</p>
            <p>The author claims much for Gurowski as a Radical Republican. No man, he maintains, saw the
                    demarcation between Conservative and Radical Republicanism more clearly than Gurowski. His views on
                    the Radical movement "were unusually clear" (p. 91) and there was much wisdom in
                    his opinions. His diary was, and remains, "the Jacobin bible" (p. 196). An
                    "objective" abolitionist, he tempered his zeal with an intellectual and scholarly
                    approach (p. 226). Yet, precisely what influence did Gurowski exercise? The answer is not clear. If
                    he did play a constructive role in Civil War Republican politics, or even in the <pb n="181" id="VAA4025-061-2-109"/> formulation of Radical policies, it is not delineated here. That <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> was impressed with Gurowski (after a fashion) is evident, for he feared that the Pole
                    might assassinate him. Beyond this, it is not certain that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> even read some of the many letters Gurowski addressed to him. The conclusion is
                    inescapable that Gurowski was, above all, a colossal nuisance; whatever value his actions might have
                    had was a nuisance value. As a self-appointed theoretician and spokesman for the Radical cause, he
                    broke with other Radical leaders who could not accept uncritically his views or abide his obnoxious
                    character (Sumner and Chase, for example). Gurowski seems to have been his own worst enemy,
                    depriving himself of whatever constructive influence he might have had by his unrestrained outbursts
                    of invective and by his erratic behavior. Even the author concedes at one point that "no
                    man was less intelligible" (p. 257). As a gadfly, Gurowski's sting was harmless;
                    indeed, even his nuisance value might be questioned.</p>
            <p>Professor Fischer deserves our credit, however, for carefully summarizing the thought and career of
                    this unusual personality. This book, in manuscript, was awarded in 1963 the $5,000
                    Literary Award of the War Library and Museum and the Pennsylvania Commandery of the Military Order

            <p>Variety, complexity, and diversity have been keynotes in the lexicon of recent studies of the
                    progressive era, and this slender volume is no exception. Other historians have pointed out that
                    businessmen were of mixed views on reform issues, and that lower class urbanites shared in some of
                    the supposedly middle class progressive values; we now learn that reform thinking displayed no
                    monolithic ideology, but rather a "tremendous variety" (p. 109). Evidence to
                    support this view consists of brief and interesting studies of five individuals and one
                    organization: Jane Addams, Samuel Gompers, Albert J. Beveridge, Edgar Gardner Murphy, Robert M. La
                    Follette and the Civic Federation of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. All enjoyed national prominence save Murphy, who fought for child labor regulation and
                    improved race relations in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
                    </placeName>. From this sampling the author concludes that reformers had widely divergent views on
                    the nature of man and society, on the desirability of social change, on the issue of liberty versus
                    equality, and on the proper functions of government.</p>
            <p>Levine is troubled by the inaccuracy and general abuse of the word progressive, so he has chosen to
                    describe his subjects as "non-Populist" reformers. This diversionary tactic is
                    unsatisfactory, for it replaces an admittedly imprecise label with a catchall which is even vaguer.
                    His reluctance to identify Gompers as a progressive is understandable, but there are equally strong
                    grounds for denying that the labor leader was even a reformer. Perhaps some day historians will
                    shrug their shoulders <pb n="182" id="VAA4025-061-2-110"/> in despair and agree upon the novel
                    expedient of calling a progressive a progressive.</p>
            <p>The question arises as to how representative a sampling of six items can be. The book's
                    title might just as appropriately encompass a ten-volume compendium as it does 149 pages. Would the
                    effect in such a case be to suggest even greater variety, or might a visible pattern and some
                    uniformity result? No one can question Levine's contention that different reformers held
                    different views, but by confining his portrait to a few patently disparate figures, the author may
                    be giving a false impression. Acknowledging differences, can we not also detect groupings or
                    patterns? If Jane Addams had little other than <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> in common with the Civic Federation, did not each of them illustrate certain reform
                    values and aims common to the period in general? The founder of Hull House focused her attention
                    upon urban ills and social justice, typifying the interests of that group of lower class reformers
                    described by J. Joseph Huthmacher. The Civic Federation, on the other hand, is a good example of one
                    other reform thread of the period: the continuing interest, notably among businessmen, in
                    "good government." Granting Levine's point that reform thought was not
                    monolithic, we must take care not to assume that its composition was as unstructured as dust. If, as
                    he concludes on page 117, "the American intellectual landscape is neither desert nor
                    monotonous plain," we still ought to be able to identify some topographical pattern in its
                    various "hills, valleys, hidden caves, deserts and seas."</p>

            <p>Perhaps a more accurate title for this book would be: "Presidential Use of Mass Media to
                    Influence Public Opinion and Create a Presidential Image." While the author does not
                    entirely neglect the substantive issues and the histrionic and literary arts (there is an
                    interesting account of how FDR achieved "the eternal simplicities" of expression),
                    the decided emphasis is on public relations techniques. For instance, about as much space is devoted
                    to Calvin Coolidge, under whom some significant mass media techniques were developed, as is given
                    Woodrow Wilson, who personally thrilled the world and had an enormous impact on opinion everywhere.</p>
            <p>The mass communications practices used by the Presidents are analyzed, and the history of their
                    development from Theodore Roosevelt to Lyndon Johnson traced. Among other things, these include the
                    presidential press conference in all its variations; the utilization of radio and television; the
                    activities of the presidential press secretary (with emphasis on "Steve" Early and
                    James C. Hagerty); the operations of ghost writers; the expansion of the presidential staff and its
                    increasing concentration on public relations; the ways of coordinating, timing, and distributing in
                    an even flow the prodigious amounts of news which <pb n="183" id="VAA4025-061-2-111"/> come from the
                    White House and the executive departments; the employment of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> Avenue advertising firms; the analysis of feedbacks, the White House mail, and the
                    opinion polls.</p>
            <p>Professor Cornwell argues that the President's responsibilities today are greater than his
                    constitutional powers to meet them, that his most important single instrument is the molding of
                    opinion, and that a President of this era who does not learn how to use effectively the enormous and
                    proliferating mass media techniques at his disposal is not doing his job.</p>
            <p>A study of this kind has long been overdue. Now Professor Cornwell has done it, in a book which
                    reveals wide and painstaking research and is systematic and analytical, and at the same time is
                    written in a lively style replete with colorful incidents and anecodotes and devoid of technical
                    jargon. For this reason the book will have interest for the general reader as well as great value
                    for political scientists, politicians, administrators, journalists, and advertising and public
                    relations people.</p>
            <p>Historians will discover not only much material hitherto unpublished, but also examples of how this
                    generation is rewriting history in terms of its own experience. A new "school" of
                    historical interpretation is emerging from the technicalized society, one which is finding skill-or
                    a lack of it-in the use of mass media techniques a key to an understanding of historical outcomes.
                    For instance, Professor Cornwell attributes Wilson's defeat in the League of Nations fight
                    not to the causes usually assigned but to Wilson's failure to confront and solve the public
                    relations problem he faced (p. 56). Again, the author suggests that Hoover's misfortunes
                    were due not so much to the depression, though this was a factor, as to his inability to cope with
                    the mass communications side of his job (p. 99).</p>
            <p>Some of the appraisals of Kennedy now appearing claim he will go down as a great President because of
                    his "breakthrough to modernity" in the use of the mass media. However, it seems
                    significant that those two "loners" and virtuosos, Wilson and FDR, brilliantly led
                    public opinion and Congress to memorable legislative achievements during their first two years in
                    office, whereas Kennedy-despite his video personality, his collegial use of staff, and advice from
                    those sophisticated in the ways of opinion polls, Trendex ratings, and market research-failed to
                    make much of a dent in the legislative log jam which had been accumulating for over a decade.</p>

            <p>This is the first serious treatment of the relations of the "Radio Priest" with the
                    New Deal. In his search for sources the author received no cooperation from the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> Archdiocese; as a result, many of his judgments are tentative. But he has read
                    Coughlin's speeches and <pb n="184" id="VAA4025-061-2-112"/> writings and has used to good
                    purpose material at the Roosevelt Library in Hyde Park. Since TulFs purpose is not biography,
                    Coughlin's personality remains somewhat enigmatic. The book is nonetheless adequately
                    written, concise, and balanced in judgment.</p>
            <p>Tull's focus is on the period from 1931, when Coughlin successfully defied the efforts of
                    CBS to moderate his attacks upon the Hoover administration, to 1942, when the church and the
                    government combined to silence him. The author suggests that Coughlin's original purpose in
                    taking to the air was the simple one of building up his parish and that his later forays into
                    political questions were efforts to introduce to America the social teachings of Rerum Novarwm.
                    Coughlin's break with the New Deal, Tull continues, was partly the result of
                    Coughlin's conviction that Roosevelt was moving too slowly toward social justice, and not
                    (as Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., has suggested) an effort to enlarge his radio audience. Tull also notes
                    Roosevelt's shrewd use of Coughlin. Apparently disliking Coughlin from the start, the
                    President nonetheless wrote him friendly letters and tacitly accepted his support so long as it
                    helped Roosevelt's cause. Tull concludes that Coughlin, despite his talk of a corporate
                    state, his anti-Semitism, and his authoritarian tendencies, was too "erratic" to
                    be called a Fascist. These judgments are persuasively argued.</p>
            <p>The author also emphasizes that Coughlin's economic theories were ill-considered and that
                    his actions after 1935 were increasingly negative and destructive. Coughlin's revengeful
                    and unrealistic course in the 1936 campaign receives especially critical treatment, and the author
                    makes no effort to conceal or explain away Coughlin's anti-Semitism. He shows also that the
                    church hierarchy considered Coughlin obnoxious as early as 1935, but was powerless to stop him until
                    Bishop Gallagher, his immediate superior, died in 1937. Tull's point of view is objective,
                    his tone restrained, his conclusions unflattering to his subject.</p>
            <p>A mild tendency to overwrite (there are too many "bitter battles") and an
                    inexplicable brevity in documentation (we are not given, for instance, the location of letters in
                    the Roosevelt Library files) detract slightly from the book. Otherwise, this is a useful study.
                    Tull's focus is clear; his style unambiguous; his research adequate within the means at his
                    disposal.</p>

                    portrayed, the real significance of naval power on the Lakes is stressed, and the results of the War

                    Map, indexes.) This booklet offers impressive evidence of the significant development of the
                    Archives of DePauw University and Indiana Methodism established in 1951 under the joint sponsorship
                    of the University and the three conferences of Indiana Methodism. The bibliography is divided into
                    two major sections, each with a separate index. Part I, Printed Materials, has 811 entries grouped
                    under such headings as biography, church history, church organization, regional histories, hymnody,
                    missions, Wesleyana. The last entry in this section, "Histories of Individual
                    Churches," includes on pages 23-28 a list of more than six hundred churches for which there
                    are manuscript or printed histories or other records of a historical nature in the Archives. Part
                    II, Manuscripts, has 455 entries, including church and conference records and miscellaneous papers
                    and the collections of individuals. A number of the individual collections are quite large. For
                    example, in the final entry, Clyde E. Wildman, former president of DePauw, it is noted that
                    forty-five document cases are required for the material it contains. This bibliography is a useful
                    guide for those interested in the history and development of Indiana Methodism and of DePauw
                    University; it should also be of value to scholars doing research in related fields.</p>

                    history of colonial America includes considerable material relevant to the development of the
                    American Middle West during the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries. Several chapters
                    offer substantial information about the genesis of New <placeName>

                    the development of the backcountry of the English colonies, including the settlement of the Old
                    West. Additional chapters relate the rivalry of the English and French over Indian alliances, the
                    fur trade, and vast areas west of the Appalachians. Attention is also given to the French and Indian
                    Wars, the American Revolution in the West, and various Indian wars and campaigns in the Appalachian
                    hinterland.</p>

                    $2.45.) Professor Clark notes in his Preface that "American frontiersmen
                    transported westward with them an appreciable amount of cultural baggage. Sometimes there was little
                    sophistication and refinement in this baggage, but even the little bit was important."
                    According to Clark, this cultural background was gradually modified in the West. "Here was
                    developed a new American society and a distinctive native personality which showed to what extent
                    human life underwent changes of manners and humors" (p. 17). Clark combines a liberal
                    sampling of the humor and folklore of the region west of the Appalachians with a running commentary
                    about the social, cultural, political, and economic conditions that prevailed. Much use is made of
                    travel accounts, contemporary books, and newspapers as sources of information. <hi rend="i">The
                        Rampaging Frontier</hi> is not a comprehensive and balanced account and is short on systematic

                    Paperbound, $1.95.) This volume places its focus and emphasis on the seven debates held
                    between August 21 and October 15, 1858, but it includes also the "acceptance"
                    speeches of the two principals. These two speeches and the eleven-page Introduction contribute to
                    understanding and evaluating the significance of this foremost American "forensic
                    duel." The text of the debates indicates that they were directed to immediate issues and
                    goals rather than to future objectives, that the two contestants were not far apart on some of the
                    issues, and that they raised still-relevant questions about the responsibilities of citizens to
                    their government. This reprint is based on the printed edition of the debates published in 1860
                    rather than on the verbatim accounts published in 1858 in the <placeName>

                    Originally published in 1881, <hi rend="i">A Century of Dishonor</hi> appeared at about the time
                    warfare between Americans and the aborigines was ending. Although Indian Commissioner G. W.
                    Manypenny's <hi rend="i">Our Indian Wards</hi> (1879) had already set forth long-time
                    abuses in American treatment of the Indians and the urgent need for reform, Mrs. Jackson's
                        <hi rend="i">A Century of Dishonor</hi> caught the ear and touched the heart of the American
                    public far more than did Manypenny's restrained and informative study. Mrs. Jackson wrote
                    in much the same tone, mood, and vein as did the muckrakers a generation later. For instance,
                    "It makes little difference … where one opens the record of the history of the
                    Indians; every page and every year has its dark stain. The story of one tribe is the story of all,
                    varied only by differences of time and place; but neither time nor place makes any difference in the
                    main facts. Colorado is as greedy and unjust in 1880 as was <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>

                    practice" (pp. 337-38). Actually Mrs. Jackson offered very little that was
                    new–her sources regarding abuses came largely from documents and reports of the war and
                    interior departments. In general, she left unanswered the fundamental questions about desirable
                    Indian policies.</p>

                    purpose, organization, and methods of teaching. Its four major divisions deal with new perspectives

                    teaching of world history. The last of these divisions could just as easily be addressed to teachers

                    </placeName> in the winter of 1803-1804, probably improved and made more defensive in 1810-1811, and
                    dismantled in 1813-1814. Eventually, it is hoped, reconstruction of the Fort will be made.</p>
            <p>The Society is searching for the plan of the proposed fort or garrison which was sent to the
                    secretary of war by Cornelius Lyman, probably in November 1803, with covering letter. The reply of
                    the secretary of war, December 6, 1803 (War Department Letter Book, National Archives), mentions
                    receipt of a letter from Lyman "enclosing the proposed plan of the buildings and the works

            <p>The Society would also like to obtain manuscripts or other descriptions of the Fort and life there
                    which might be in letters written by soldiers stationed there during the years 1803-1814. Several
                    regiments or detachments saw service there during this period, including officers and men from at
                    least the First, Seventh, and Fourth U. S. Infantry. Among the officers were Nathan Heald, Cornelius
                    Lyman, Ambrose Whitlock, Thornton Posey, Jesse Jennings, Jacob W. Albright, Zachary Taylor, John P.
                    Boyd, Thomas H. Richardson, and Dr. Samuel McKee. Also of interest are plans of what might be
