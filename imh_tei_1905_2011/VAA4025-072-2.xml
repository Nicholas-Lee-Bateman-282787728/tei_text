            <p>The Know Nothing party in the Old Northwest has been seen more as a party of sectional compromise
                    than as a party of ethnic and religious divisiveness. Historians have argued for years that the
                    anti-Catholic, antiforeign party was, in the states west of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, principally a haven for conservative Union loving Whigs who became Know Nothings
                    because they wished to avoid Republican radicalism on the slavery question but who could not bear
                    the thought of joining forces with their lifelong enemies in the Democracy. Historians have
                    belittled the party's voter appeal and have pictured it as a hopelessly senile movement
                    which embodied little or no sincere animosity toward the Midwest's small Catholic and
                    foreign born population.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                        that the Know Nothing movement in Indiana's western neighbor was
                        "issueless" because opposition "to the foreign immigrant in the West
                        would have proved suicidal to its development" (p. 12). It was, therefore, the haven of
                        Union loving conservatives. The standard history of Know Nothingism, Ray Allen
                        Billington's book, <hi rend="i">The Protestant Crusade, 1800–1860: A Study
                            of the Origins of American Nativism</hi> (<placeName>

                        </placeName>, 1964), adopted the same interpretation for the whole Midwest. After 1854
                        conservatives were "left stranded with no party allegiance, for many of them refused to
                        support either the proslavery Democratic party or the antislavery Republican party….
                        They drifted naturally into the Know-Nothing party, which was not only neutral on the vital
                        issue of slavery but loudly promised to preserve the union" (pp. 390–91).
                        Billington wrote before the discovery of midwestern race prejudice by writers like Voegeli,
                        Litwack, and Berwanger and <hi rend="i">did</hi> say at one point that the
                        "anti-Catholic sentiment which did exist in the northwest was almost certainly
                        sincere" because the "people of this section wanted no compromise on
                        slavery" (p. 395). In 1940 Henry J. Carman's and Reinhard H. Luthin's

            <p>Of late, the history of the Know Nothing party has undergone extensive revision, all of which points
                    toward a much greater inherent vitality in the movement than historians used to think. Scholars now
                    shy away from the "Civil War synthesis" which attempted to relate all political
                    issues <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>concluding flatly that "in the majority of states invaded by the movement the
                            issue served as a mere cloak for issues of far greater moment" (p. 213). Allan
                            Nevins made the same mistake in <hi rend="i">Ordeal of the Union: A House Dividing,
                                1852–1857</hi> (<placeName>

                            useful exculpatory tool in the hands of skillful biographers of statesmen who had dallied
                            with the party. Thus Albert D. Kirwan's <hi rend="i">John J. Crittenden: The

                            </placeName> statesman on these grounds: "In the border states …
                            Know-Nothings were influenced more by fear of sectional conflict over slavery than by
                            eagerness for its protection or by an aversion to Catholics…. The Know-Nothing
                            party offered them an alternative, a delay of violent civil war. They sought to preserve the
                            Union by pushing aside the slavery issue" (p. 297). Thus Crittenden joined the
                            "healthy, respectable element" in the party. For a different view of

            <p>Michael F. Holt has studied the Know Nothing party's meteoric history more thoroughly than
                    any other recent student. He pictures the Know Nothings as sincere zealots responding directly to
                    sensational issues involving immigration and the Catholic church. Most important, of course, was the
                    influx of Catholic immigrants from famine stricken <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName> and from <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> in the late 1840s. When their five year naturalization periods expired and the <placeName>

                    </placeName> law agitation made them fear they would lose their beer, these immigrants came to the
                    polis in droves, voting—as tradition has dictated—for the Democratic party.
                    Know Nothingism in the eastern states, Holt says, was a direct, bigoted response to this new
                        presence.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

                            seriously challenge the generally accepted interpretation of the movement. Carl Fremont
                            Brand's article, "The History of the Know Nothing Party in
                            Indiana," <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History,</hi> XVIII (March, June,
                            September, 1922), 47–81, 177–206, 266–306, presented a
                            bland summary of the movement's rise and fall Brand largely avoided speculation on
                            the motivations of the party's adherents because he had no access to the private
                            papers of the leaders. Sister M. Evangeline Thomas' book, <hi rend="i">Nativism in
                                the Old Northwest, 1850–1860</hi> (<placeName>

                            </placeName>, 1936), was sensitive to American anti-Catholicism, but her regional focus
                            slighted Indiana's experience. Logan Esarey's treatment of the movement in
                                <hi rend="i">A History of Indiana from 1850 to the Present</hi> (Reprint, 2 vols. in

                            </placeName>, 1970), II, 619–21, was too brief to attempt any major
                            interpretation of the movement. John D. Barnhardt's and Donald F.
                            Carmony's <hi rend="i">Indiana: From Frontier to Industrial Commonwealth</hi> (4

                            </placeName>, 1954), II, 141–52, is rather tentative, stressing as a cause of the
                            party's growth the rise of Catholic population at first (p. 141) but then arguing
                            that it "secured substantial political significance only because of the resurgence
                            of the agitation over slavery" (p. 142). On the whole they belittle the vitality
                            and significance of the Know Nothing party in Indiana. For Holt's view, see Michael

            <p>Holt argues that many native Protestants sensed a crisis, but the established political parties, Whig
                    and Democrat, did not respond to the issue quickly. Seeking a new party responsive to the popular
                    will and sensitive to this social crisis, impatient reformers created the Know Knowing party. It did

                    which had supported Millard Fillmore in Indiana in 1856 hardly existed north of the National Road;
                    and it stressed through its major speaker, Richard W. Thompson, a stand on sectional issues so
                    prosouthern that many thought him secretly in the pay of the Democrats. The People's party
                    took the name "Republican" in 1858 and refused further concessions to nativists.
                    The Know Nothing party disappeared by 1859, but some remnants went into the Constitutional Union

                    midwestern Know Nothingism was most often the refuge of Union loving moderates rather than of
                    malignant and aggressive bigots. Thompson was born in <placeName>

            <p>Thompson's answer by 1855 was to join the Know Nothing party. According to Charles
                    Roll's biography of Thompson this was a move to a party "quite generally regarded
                    as the successor to the Whig party," and it revealed a consistent Unionist conservatism in
                    Thompson's political thought. He had always been one of those Whigs who sought to calm
                    sectional animosities. As a congressman in 1849 he had voted against a proposal to prohibit slavery
                    in the <placeName>

                    constitutional power to abolish slavery in the District; Thompson feared the threat to the Union
                    that lay in irritating the South over such issues. Roll interpreted Thompson's Know
                    Nothingism as a respectable extension of this spirit of conservatism on sectional issues:</p>

            <p>However one interprets Know Nothingism, any conclusion as to why its adherents joined the movement
                    must be arrived at indirectly. The party operated in secret. In Indiana, the Know Nothing's
                    activities were so clandestine that one party leader, Godlove S. Orth, wrote the proper names in his
                    correspondence in code. Another prominent Indiana Know Nothing, Schuyler Colfax, falsely denied that
                    he was a party member in 1854 and hid his attendance as a delegate to the party's national
                    council meeting in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>

                    </placeName> newspaper. Thompson's correspondence during the period of his Know Nothing
                    affiliation is sketchy and unin-formative. Thus the case which some historians have made for the
                    respectability of his Know Nothing affiliation rests, not on candid assertions in private letters
                    that the anti-Catholic party was a refuge from sectional controversy, but on his record as a
                    Unionist before and after the 1850s and on the circumstances of national party politics.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

            <p>Thompson probably did not bring the sort of impatient reforming zeal to the Know Nothing party that
                    Holt describes. He did not desert the Whigs out of impatience; he accurately judged the party
                    incapable of winning an election after 1852 and was politically homeless when the Know Nothing party
                    emerged. Whether his presence in that party was reluctant—whether he joined its despite
                    its anti-Catholic and antiforeign platforms or because of them—that is the tough
                    question.</p>

            <p>There are no studies which focus specifically on the careers of Know Nothing party members after the
                    1850s. As a test of sincerity of anti-Catholic and antiforeign convictions, such a study would
                    surely be as conclusive as studies of foreign and Catholic population growth and the emergence and
                    decline of other parties. It is a test, at any rate, which calls into question Roll's
                    attempt to fit Thompson's career into the model provided by the older studies of Know
                    Nothingism in the states of the Old Northwest. True enough, Thompson's correspondence in
                    the 1850s reveals little to prove or disprove an anti-Catholic basis for his politics. But Thompson
                    did nothing in his later career as Republican politician and orator, as secretary of the navy in
                    Rutherford B. Hayes' Cabinet, or as revered Indiana man of letters that was inconsistent
                    with a sincere anti-Catholic and antiforeign sentiment. He did much that was pointedly anti-Catholic
                    and antiforeign. In short, the events of Thompson's later career are utterly consistent
                    with a belief that he joined the Know Nothing party at least in part because he feared and genuinely

                    appropriated to the support of any secretarian school." His Seventh Annual Message to
                    Congress in December of 1875 called for "a constitutional amendment …
                    prohibiting the granting of any school-funds, or school-taxes, or any part thereof, either by
                    legislative, municipal, or other authority, for the benefit or in aid, directly or indirectly, of

            </p>
            <p>The issue was anti-Catholic and explosive. It was anti-Catholic for two reasons. First, American
                    Catholics had recently launched a campaign to divide local school funds so that their parochial
                    schools could gain support from the taxes paid by Catholic citizens. Second, it was anti-Catholic
                    rather than constitutionally impartial because public schools included Bible reading in the
                    curriculum, and the King James rather than the Douay Bible was used. In fact, therefore, the common
                    schools were Protestant rather than religiously neutral.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The explosive nature of the issue was nowhere better exemplified than in Hayes' home state
                    in 1875. Catholic moves to prove the King James Bible a sectarian book, remove it from the public
                    schools, and divide local school funds put <placeName>

                    nomination for governor was Judge Alonzo Taft. In 1870, however, he had written a minority opinion
                    in a lawsuit in which he upheld the right of the <placeName>

                    opinion. Hayes' diary recorded the fact succinctly: "The leading other candidate

                    Republicans interpreted the bill as a prelude to a Catholic assault on the public schools. Hayes
                    began the gubernatorial canvass with one idea uppermost: "<hi rend="i">to rebuke the

                        appeal.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> On July 10, 1875, he wrote a political associate: "We
                    must not let the Catholic question drop out of sight. If they do not speak of it, we must attack
                    them for their silence. If they discuss it, or refer to it, they can't help getting into
                    trouble. We can't, I think, do better than to stick to the texts, <hi rend="i">honest

                    shunned the Know Nothings, he had seen them at work in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1854. Commenting on an election victory at that time, he wrote his uncle:
                    "How people do hate Catholics, and what a happiness it was to thousands to have a chance to
                    show it in what seemed a lawful and patriotic manner."<hi rend="sup">31</hi> Hayes never
                    forgot the lesson and kept it in mind when he ran for the presidency in 1876.</p>
            <p>Hayes was not alone in thinking that the Catholic issue would help the Republican party in 1876.
                    James G. Blaine, as a part of his own bid for the Republican presidential nomination early that
                    year, had introduced a proposal to amend the Constitution in order to prohibit the use of public
                    money for religious purposes. In August, after Hayes' nomination, Republicans dutifully

                    Democrats, who claimed that Blaine had hoped to use the issue to gain the nomination and that the

            </p>
            <p>Hayes himself certainly desired maximum exposure for the public school question. On the day the

                    me again call your attention to Blaine's proposed Constitution Amendment to protect the

                    in every speech. Talk to our Southern friends about it. My correspondence from the South indicates
                    that it may be of value there also."<hi rend="sup">33</hi> Hayes became increasingly aware
                    that the "people <hi rend="i">do dread</hi> a victory for the united South" and
                    stressed the sectional issue accordingly, but he continued to emphasize the Catholic question to the
                    end: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            interference with political affairs, and especially with the schools. This last point is
                            influential, particularly with non-Catholic foreigners. It has not, I suspect, been

            <p>The tone of the canvass may have influenced Hayes' Cabinet selections. At least,
                    Thompson's stand on the Catholic issue appears to have been no liability to his candidacy
                    for a Cabinet post. Almost all students of the Hayes administration agree that Thompson was the
                    president's worst Cabinet selection. It was certainly the most nakedly political one.
                    Expertise did not recommend Thompson; he came from a landlocked state and knew nothing of naval

                    Indiana's Senator Oliver P. Morton and that Morton's choice of Thompson was
                    dictated by his fear of Benjamin Harrison, whose name had been mentioned for a Cabinet post.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> Thompson, who was sixty-seven years old, was much less a threat than the
                    promising Harrison; Morton wanted no Republican presidential contender from Indiana on the horizon
                    besides himself. Moreover, Morton was in Thompson's debt. Thompson had not challenged
                    Morton for the Republican senatorial nomination in 1876 and had even given a nominating speech for
                    Morton at the Republican convention.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> Still, Morton undoubtedly had other

                    internal improvements and especially in railroads. He also held conservative views on the race

                            abstract (p. 6). He approached endorsing the biblical argument for slavery on page 7 of the
                            pamphlet: "In this form it existed in the days of Moses, and yet there is not one

            <p>Thompson shared Hayes' anxiety over the question of the use of the Bible in the public
                    schools, as his manuscript entitled "An Examination into the Relationship which the State
                    bears to our Common School System and its responsibilities, obligations, and duties in reference to
                    it" shows. Writing during or just before 1876, Thompson defined the primary purpose of the
                    common school system to be the socialization and not the intellectual stimulation of students:
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>it is the duty of the state to see that they are so trained and educated as to fully
                            understand all the complex machinery of our government, so that if hereafter another
                            impartial De Tocqueville shall visit this country he may transmit to Europe the intelligence
                            that there is not one man amongst us who, on the score of intelligence, is not worthy of
                            American citizenship. Of course, I do not here mean education in its enlarged sense, but
                            that which is necessary to fit them for intelligent action upon all public affairs.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>
                  </p>
                    </quote> To discharge its duty properly the state had to compel every person to receive a common
                    school education or its equivalent. Hayes always claimed to be warding off a sectarian assault on
                    the public schools, and his posture was defensive. Thompson's recommendations were stronger
                    in tone. Asserting that the child must be educated "in the duties of American
                    citizenship," Thompson sharply denied any man the "right to stunt and dwarf the
                    intellect of his child, or to prevent him from acquiring intelligence enough to discharge all his
                    duties to Society and the State …." And, Thompson went on, "if he
                    defiantly asserts such right it is the duty of the State to provide by law that he shall subordinate
                    his own selfish interests to the public welfare."<hi rend="sup">44</hi> Thompson's
                    conception of the "duties of American citizenship" was not at all secular. He
                    declared that "to my mind it is clearly the duty of the State, imposed by the ordinance of
                    1787, &amp; by the spirit of our institutions, to provide that our children shall be educated as
                    Christians &amp; not as Pagans, that is that they shall be taught the kind of religion which the
                    fathers meant which inculcates a sense of duty to God as the creator, and the virtue &amp;

            <p>Election year 1876 witnessed an especially prodigious output on the Catholic question for Thompson,
                    for it was the year his book <hi rend="i">The Papacy and the Civil Power</hi> was published.
                    Thompson attempted some moderation in tone in the book by distinguishing between clergy and laity to
                    the advantage of the latter and devoting some 500 of the book's 750 pages to a fairly
                    detailed explication of European church history. Lyman Abbott found the book "strong
                    without being rancid—a rare thing in anti-Catholic literature."<hi rend="sup">47</hi> Thompson meant the book, however, not for "the educated classes, who have the
                    means of making like inquiries for themselves," but "for <hi rend="i">the
                    people.</hi>" Though many could remember "when there were very few Roman Catholics

                    decade of the 1860s had made them one sixth of the population. A similar rate of increase, Thompson
                    warned, would have them outnumbering the Protestants by 1904. He did not fear risking the
                    "animosity and anathemas of such as pay for the protection our institutions give them by
                    Jesuitical plottings to establish a ‘Holy Empire’ upon their ruins"

            <p>To be sure, Thompson admitted, the vast Catholic laity were still loyal to the <placeName>

                    </placeName>. A "large" number of priests had "sympathized with all the
                    measures which were designed to break up the Union and destroy our institutions" during the
                    Civil War. Their ends remained the same still, as the pope's 1864 Syllabus of Errors and
                    the 1870 declaration of papal infallibility revealed. The former condemned essentials of the
                    American Constitution: free speech, freedom of the press, and religious freedom. The latter,
                    according to Thompson, meant that those views must be appropriated by the American clergy and
                        laity.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to Thompson, the recent developments in papal policy represented an attack on the American
                    Constitution. This was not because "religion, in the Protestant sense, is established by
                    law" in America, but because Protestantism, which "recognizes no system of faith
                    and worship to the exclusion of others," had given America the fundamental principle of
                    religious toleration. America, he claimed, was so careful to protect this principle that it
                    "confides the public schools to men of every faith, and of none. It maintains
                    ‘unChristian,’ or, as they choose to call them, ‘godless
                    schools.’" Thompson was being less than candid. If there were
                    "unChristian" public schools in America, he did not approve of them. His
                    manuscript on the relation of the state to the common schools had urged that it was the imperative
                    duty of the state to provide religious instruction. In truth, it was not the constitutional purity
                    but the religious identity of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> that Thompson was intent upon maintaining. He even defended the description of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> as "a Protestant country."<hi rend="sup">50</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thompson's ability to recommend specific measures to counter the Catholic menace was
                    constantly impeded by his public pose; he was supposed to be saving American religious tolerance
                    from Catholic intolerance. Whenever he formulated a specific policy (as on the public school
                    question), Thompson involved himself in inconsistencies. Thus <hi rend="i">The Papacy and the Civil
                        Power</hi> confined itself largely to a lengthy retelling of the Protestant version of history
                    and to vague threats: "Let us begin in time to guard our national heritage, and, while we

                    principles of our Government, we can so shield them from the assaults of foreign imperialism, that
                    the blows aimed at them by their assailant will rebound upon their own heads." Short of
                    prescribing a specific program, however, the following threat must have had as clear a meaning to
                    Catholics as the "House Divided" doctrine had had for the antebellum South:
                    "if these principles [embodied in Pope Pius IX's encyclical and Syllabus of Errors
                    of 1864] should prevail here, our institutions would necessarily fall. The two can not exist
                    together. They are in open and direct antagonism with the fundamental theory of our Government, and
                    of all popular government everywhere."<hi rend="sup">51</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thompson always identified the Catholic menace as a political rather than a religious problem, that
                    is, as an assault upon the American Constitution rather than upon the religion of the Protestant
                    majority. The state and not the church, therefore, possessed the proper means of defense. With this
                    argument Thompson preserved his fidelity to religious toleration. He did not attack any religious
                    doctrines (having to do with the sacraments, for example); he attacked only
                    "politico-religious" doctrines dictating Catholic interference in the
                        government.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thompson concentrated on papal claims to temporal power, especially as outlined in the 1864 Syllabus
                    of Errors and the 1870 decree of infallibility. These not only violated traditional American notions
                    of separation of church and state, but, he intimated, identified Catholicism with monarchism.
                    Thompson admitted that the accusation "that the pope desires to absorb in his own hands <hi rend="i">all</hi> the powers of civil government elsewhere than in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rome</settlement>
                    </placeName>" was probably too broad. Yet only thirty-two pages later, he said that Pope
                    Pius IX was "endeavoring to break down the lines of separation between all the nations, and
                    to resolve the world into one great ‘Christian commonwealth’—a
                    grand ‘holy empire’—subject to his single will, and bowing before
                    his single sceptre!" To Thompson's mind the eightieth article of the
                    Syllabus of Errors, which stated the pope's hostility to progress, liberalism, and modern
                    civilization, seemed be aimed directly at the <placeName>

            <p>Thompson associated Catholicism with monarchism by means of a familiar historical myth. As in his

                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>

                        <country>New England</country>
                    </placeName> Society, Thompson found lessons for America even in English history because
                    "we trace the birth of our popular institutions back to the great uprising of the
                    people" in the English Reformation. "The native Britons," he asserted,
                    "had their own form of Christianity, existing apart from their Druidical worship, which, in
                    whatsoever way it was acquired, they believed to be of apostolic origin." This meant
                    definitely that "the monk Augustine" did not bring Christianity to Britain in 597
                    (as Catholics claimed) and that the apostle Paul <hi rend="i">may</hi> have brought it much earlier
                    (and in a much purer form).<hi rend="sup">54</hi> From this point on, the story was more complex
                    than it had been in the <placeName>
                        <country>New England</country>
                    </placeName> Society address. The Saxons, who conquered the native Britons, were pagans, but they
                    were a source of political virtue, for "they were not then governed without their own
                    consent, even by their kings." There was "no evidence that they ever interfered
                    with" the religion "of the native Britons until after their kings yielded to the
                    influence of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rome</settlement>
                    </placeName>!" Thompson suggested that the Saxons influenced the Britons with
                    their "Teutonic" political genius for liberty, and the Britons influenced the
                    pagan Saxons with their pure Christianity. So powerful was this progressive amalgam that eventually
                    the pope could no longer trust the Saxons to rule and had to encourage the <placeName>

            <p>There is no direct proof that Thompson's anti-Catholicism had any effect on Hayes'
                    selection of Thompson as secretary of the navy, or even that Hayes knew of it. Hayes'

            <p>The Indiana senator had played a part in the debate on Blaine's proposed amendment. When one
                    senator had protested that the danger the amendment was supposed to meet was nonexistent, Morton had
                    thundered: "Well, Mr. President, in my judgment there is danger. That cloud is looming
                    above the horizon; it is larger than it was a few years ago." When even "one
                    State" supported "denominational schools" with public funds, it
                    endangered "the perpetuity of the nation," Morton had claimed. Accused of trying
                    to create a new issue as a substitute for the race issue, Morton had replied that the amendment was
                    drawn "for the purpose of meeting a strong feeling throughout the nation, for the purpose
                    of allaying a great fear."<hi rend="sup">57</hi>

                    certainly would not have deemed Thompson's anti-Catholicism a liability, for it meshed
                    perfectly with the recent thrust of the Republican party and the personal political stances of both
                    men. And at least one Catholic critic did not overlook the fact that Thompson's book

                    on foreigners for seamen. Naval reformers had been trying to make the service more attractive to
                    native Americans for at least fifty years. John Quincy Adams' secretary of the navy, Samuel
                    Southard, had recommended as early as 1825 that even naturalized immigrants be excluded from naval
                    service. In 1837 Congress tried to solve the problem by passing a bill providing for the recruitment
                    of naval apprentices, eighteen years of age, who they hoped would be native Americans. Enlisting
                    only with their parents' consent, these boys would serve as apprentices until they reached
                    twenty-one years of age, at which time, it was hoped, they would reenlist to become the crews of
                    America's men of war. By and large, the plan failed. Recruited from the large cities on the
                    coast, the apprentices were themselves frequently of foreign birth or parentage and usually failed
                    to become dependable sailors.<hi rend="sup">59</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thompson brought renewed administrative energy to the old program. Although his immediate predecessor
                    in the office began the new effort at the behest of Congress, Thompson emphasized the apprentice
                    program in all of his annual reports. He tried to remedy the proven fault of the older program by
                    initiating a program of enlistments in the country's interior. He seemed to take a special

                    anti-Catholic in the apprentice program, and one historian of naval reform specifically denies that
                    the apprentice movement was akin to political nativism ashore: "Unlike the later Native
                    American political movement in the country, the concern of the naval reformers over the foreigners
                    was not connected with religion. It was more a matter of national pride and of wondering how

                    nothing specifically religious in Thompson's statement; he may have had nothing more than
                    tobacco and grog in mind. However, Thompson had invited naval chaplains to submit recommendations
                    for the service in 1878, and one, Chaplain W. O. Holway, had advised him to create a head of the
                    Chaplain Corps "to assist in [among other things] the scheme of training boys for the naval
                    service." Whether Thompson followed up on the recommendation or contemplated religious
                    instruction for the apprentices is unknown, but he did believe that the state was obliged to give
                    religious training to America's youth. Had such a program been instituted, it would have
                    provided Protestant training; until 1888 there were no Roman Catholic chaplains in the <placeName>

            <p>None of Thompson's actions described thus far was unrelated to politics. Know Nothingism was
                    itself a party movement. The subjects of Thompson's speeches and writings in the 1870s were
                    the stock in trade of midwestern Republican politicians; <hi rend="i">The Papacy and the Civil
                    Power</hi> even appeared in an election year. There is no direct proof that Thompson's
                    career as secretary of the navy involved actions aimed specifically at Catholics. But his writings
                    of the 1890s provide substantial evidence that Thompson was a sincere anti-Catholic and that
                    therefore at least one midwestern Know Nothing found the party's anti-Catholicism as
                    congenial as its nationalism. By then he was over eighty years old. He had claimed as early as the
                    1850s and 1860s to have given up political ambitions. His claim seems premature in light of his
                    actions in 1876, but surely he no longer lusted after public office by the 1890s. He no longer
                    needed to think of the electorate or the party when he made public utterances. He could then, if he
                    had not done so before, speak his own mind.</p>

                        required; after that date the navy merely recommended it. Catholics complained of having to
                        attend Protestant services. When Thompson inspected Captain S. B. Luce's training ship
                        in 1879, Luce "pointed to the large number of Bibles it contained, and said he stated
                        with regret that they had not been generally used, most of them never having left the
                        shelves." See "The Great Naval Function," clipping from the <hi rend="i">Army and Navy Herald,</hi> October 19, 1879, in the Thompson Collection (Hayes

            <p>The result was an outpouring of anti-Catholic literature that exceeded even his product in the
                    turmoil of the 1870s, when the Syllabus of Errors, the declaration of papal infallibility, attacks
                    on the use of the Bible in the public schools, attempts to provide Catholic priests in public
                    institutions where only Protestants had been available before, and attempts to divide public school
                    funds had seemed to indicate a Catholic plot to capture America. In 1894 Thompson still feared a
                    conspiracy, and in that year he published a new book, <hi rend="i">The Footprints of the
                    Jesuits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The book began as an attack on the Jesuits, showing that the order had been condemned even by some
                    popes, hinting that the Jesuits might have poisoned Pope Clement XIII because he was about to
                    dissolve the order, condemning their insincere "Jesuitical" methods of
                    infiltrating other organizations, and accusing them of commitment to monarchism. In the end <hi rend="i">The Footprints of the Jesuits</hi> was a repetition of familiar themes, flowering into
                    an attack on the Catholic church in general because the reigning Pope Leo XIII was Jesuit trained.
                    In particular, it sounded the alarm for the public schools. The Jesuits' favorite <hi rend="i">modus operandi,</hi> said Thompson, was "to obtain the sole direction of
                    education," to hold the young "down to the low standard of passive and
                    ‘uninquiring obedience,’" and thus to "fit them to become
                    subservient slaves of monarchial and papal power."<hi rend="sup">62</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By 1898 Thompson, practically ninety years old, had produced yet another manuscript for an
                    anti-Catholic book. Entitled "Christianity and Imperialism," the manuscript
                    consisted of almost three hundred pages written in a hand grown shaky with age. Political ambition
                    now certainly played no role, as Thompson himself asserted: "I have reached the period of
                    life when all the ambition I ever possessed has died away,—leaving nothing in my heart or
                    mind upon which either envy, hatred, or malice, can feed." He repeated his willingness to
                    live with people who believed in the real presence of Christ's body at the eucharist, as
                    long as they did not owe allegiance to a foreign power or demand that the state interfere with the
                    religious practices of others. He warned Americans about the dangers to the public schools but
                    devoted the bulk of the book to refutations of Catholic assertions that <list type="footnotes">

            <p>It would be wrong to conclude from the evidence in Thompson's case alone that previous
                    evaluations of midwestern Know Nothingism were wrong. Nothing in this article proves, even in
                    Thompson's single case, that the major appeal of the Know Nothing party in the 1850s was
                    its anti-Catholic platform. On the other hand evidence is as conclusive as history could demand that
                    Thompson was a life long anti-Catholic. It is safe to say, at the very least, that the anti-Catholic
                    platform of the Know Nothing party was no hindrance to Thompson's joining the movement. It
                    also seems safe to say that Thompson's relationship with the Know Nothing party has been
                    wrongly interpreted in the past.</p>
            <p>Roll knew that Thompson wrote <hi rend="i">The Papacy and the Civil Power</hi> and <hi rend="i">The
                        Footprints of the Jesuits</hi> when he wrote Thompson's biography. Yet so powerful was
                    the reigning interpretation of the midwestern Know Nothing movement that he attempted to force
                    Thompson into it despite evidence to the contrary revealed by his own research. Instead of
                    attempting to belittle the phenomenon of anti-Catholic Know Nothingism, perhaps historians should
                    begin to take note of its vote getting power and the persistence of its message later in the
                    century. In light of historians' interest in the attempts to revive Whiggery in the 1870s,
                    Thompson's career may suggest even that there was an attempt to revive Know Nothingism in
                    the same period.<hi rend="sup">64</hi> At least it can be said that Know Nothingism never died in

            <p>In America the evolution debate has been interpreted as a conflict between supporters and opponents
                    of Darwinism. In this context experimental science and liberal theology confronted teleological
                    natural science and fundamentalist religion. While this explanation has been useful for
                    understanding the general outlines of the conflict, it obscures and simplifies the variety and
                    diversity within evolutionary thought as well as its religious significance. Darwinism, grounded on
                    the belief that species evolved through a process of natural selection or survival of the fittest,
                    was not the only evolutionary theory; and neither evolution nor Darwinism were fixed and static.
                    They proved to be pliable and amorphous concepts having different meanings within different cultural
                    and intellectual traditions.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                    </placeName> that Moore entered in the fall of 1859 must have contrasted dramatically with his
                    expectations. The university was the center of complex changes rapidly transforming the character of
                    science in America from an amateur avocation to a specialized profession. In scientific education
                    specialized training and research methods were replacing the traditional gentlemanly study of
                    natural philosophy and natural history. At <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> Agassiz was collecting and classifying specimens to complete his massive Museum of
                    Comparative Anatomy which he had established as a national research institution. At the same time he
                    was actively cultivating a role for science and scientists in national affairs. Asa Gray labored in
                    a rapidly expanding herbarium that was the center for plant classification in North America.
                    Jeffries Wyman had earned an international reputation for his research in embryology and comparative
                        anatomy.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

                    that species were immutable and uniquely created by God. Gray, in direct correspondence with Charles
                    Darwin, spoke for the origin of species by descent with modification based on material laws. Others,
                    including Wyman, cautiously weighed the scientific evidence but made no firm commitment to either

                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Moore carefully and cautiously pursued his scientific education within this climate of
                    controversy. Older than most of his fellow students and isolated by his <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> manners, Moore was suspicious of the general intellectual atmosphere at the university.
                    Shortly after arriving, he remarked on the "careless state of mind" prevalent
                    around him.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Later he noted that he was surrounded by those who lightly valued
                    the teachings and doctrines of the divine record. He prayed that he be unshaken by the opinions of
                    others, "however learned or talented[,] who deny that Jesus Christ was <hi rend="i">true
                        God</hi> and <hi rend="i">perfect man.</hi>"<hi rend="sup">8</hi> But Moore maintained
                    his faith that scientific truth and religious truth could not conflict. The controversy did not
                    intimidate him; he remained cautious, but his intellectual honesty and desire for knowledge
                    compelled him to consider all scientific ideas, however dangerous.</p>
            <p>Even if he had tried, Moore could hardly have avoided contact with the new evolutionary science. He
                    was in close contact with all the principal participants of the debate; he was enrolled in
                    Agassiz's geology and zoology classes, attended botany lectures by Gray, and studied
                    comparative anatomy and embryology with Wyman. The question of the origin of species and biological
                    evolution occupied a major portion of these classes. Moore's notebook and diary indicate
                    that he faithfully studied the ideas of each teacher and tried to understand their significance for

                    was preoccupied with the theological implications of the new doctrine. For Agassiz the animal world
                    was a manifestation of the thoughts of the Creator and these thoughts were perfect and immutable.
                    Any apparent change in species was not a physical transmutation; rather, it was an intellectual
                    connection which existed in the mind of God. He felt that the development hypothesis denied the
                    existence of God's plan because the blind chance of material forces could not cause the
                    design evident in nature. At the same time the absence of design implied the absence of a Designer
                    or Creator; thus the development theory was atheistic and unacceptable. Agassiz challenged defenders
                    of evolution to demonstrate how and why the plan of the perfect Creator could or should be changed
                    once it had been expressed in its perfection.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The geologist's scientific ideas strongly influenced Moore and offered him the kind of
                    interpretation he sought. He shared Agassiz's conviction that the mind of God could be read
                    in nature. In particular Moore was impressed by Agassiz's theory of prophetic types, which
                    proposed that certain animals or "prophetic types" carried traits that became
                    distinct in later geological periods—types which could be used to account for any
                    evidence of a physical connection between species. Rather than providing a physical link between
                    species, prophetic types "foreshadowed" the development of new types in the
                    future. They provided clues to the character of later species and offered solid evidence that the
                    design of nature was known in advance of its execution. In addition to reinforcing Moore's
                    general approach to nature and providing him with specific ideas, Agassiz also taught the <placeName>

                    was atheistic. Gray found no theological objection to the view that God enacted his design through
                    material causes and material laws: for the botanist God established laws and oversaw their material
                    action in order to implement his preconceived and preordained plan of creation. While this
                    interpretation appears more compatible with Moore's belief in an active and omnipresent
                    God, Moore apparently felt that Gray's defense of the new doctrine was inadequate. Moore
                    could not assent to a God that was merely a law giver and, in the end, Gray's God remained
                    as remote and abstract as that of Agassiz. Gray's interpretation was marred by the same
                    strong predeterminism as that of his colleague. Moore's notes and diary seem to suggest
                    that the theological implications of the evolution debate at <placeName>

                    most important to him. Moore noted a pre-Darwinian attack on the developmental hypothesis by Hugh
                    Miller, the Scottish "lyrical geologist," and Agassiz's friend.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> In <hi rend="i">Foot-prints of the Creator</hi> Miller responded to <hi rend="i">The Vestiges of the National History of Creation,</hi> an early defense of evolution
                    published anonymously in 1844. In contrast to the theological issues debated by Gray and Agassiz,
                    Miller directed his primary concern to the moral and ethical implications of evolution. He argued
                    that the question of design was irrelevant for deciding scientific issues—a belief in a
                    First Cause was compatible with any theory of nature, including evolution—and pointed to
                    more important issues: that evolutionary theory denied the immortality of the soul and life after
                    death. Without these beliefs Christian morals and ethics were meaningless. The developmental
                    hypothesis denied the resurrection and man's hope for salvation. The hypothesis was not
                    necessarily atheistic, but Miller asserted that "a belief in the existence of God is of as
                    little <hi rend="i">ethical</hi> value as a belief in the existence of the great

                    "inner light," man's soul, the life eternal, and Jesus Christ as Saviour
                    and Redeemer. It appeared that until he clarified the practical meaning of evolution for these
                    beliefs, he could make no firm commitment to the theory.</p>

                    the religious meaning of evolution, and he was prepared to examine the new idea with fairness and
                    honesty. In 1861, armed with his new knowledge and its difficulties, Moore returned to Earlham

            <p>Moore continued to struggle with the meaning of evolution throughout his life. Unable to ignore the
                    mounting favorable evidence, he was increasingly swayed toward the evolutionary interpretation. But
                    while his faith in the unity of truth convinced him that evolution could not conflict with his
                    religious beliefs, the religious significance of evolution continued to puzzle him. In the end,
                    Moore devised an interpretation quite different from that of Gray or Agassiz; but it was more than
                    fifteen years before he publicly presented a completed statement of his position.</p>

                    for a natural history museum modeled on that of Agassiz. Although his research did not directly
                    relate to problems of evolution, his interest in paleontology brought him in continuing contact with

                            scientific accomplishment was the recovery and reconstruction of the skeleton of the giant

                    schemes to try to reconcile" them. If science seemed to conflict with scripture, he noted
                    that the best policy was to "wait and these differences will adjust
                        themselves."<hi rend="sup">25</hi>

            <p>But evolution was a sensitive topic in a religious community. Apparently not all Quakers had
                    Moore's faith or patience. Moore soon gained a reputation as a Darwinist and evolutionist
                    among his fellow Quakers. As the leading spokesman for science and a community leader, he was under
                    continual pressure to explain the new doctrine and its religious meaning to the general public.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> They would have <list type="footnotes">

                    Moore to find a reassuring interpretation of the new scientific ideas.</p>
            <p>Moore was not alone in his search for alternative explanations of evolution. Like Moore a large
                    number of Agassiz's former students were convinced by the scientific evidence for
                    evolution. These students formed the nucleus of a group which explained evolution using the
                    principles developed by the early nineteenth century evolutionist, Jean Baptiste de Lamarck. Like
                    Darwin these neo-Lamarckians stressed the role of environment in the formation of new species. But
                    for them variations in species occurred through the activity and effort of the organism in its
                    environment. For neo-Lamarckians the change in animal characteristics induced by an
                    organism's own effort and will was retained and transmitted in reproduction; offspring
                    retained the acquired characteristics of their parents. The giraffe was a frequently cited and
                    dramatic illustration of this process. It purportedly acquired a long neck as a consequence of the
                    continual effort of stretching its neck to eat from high branches. For the neo-Lamarckians natural
                    selection played a minor role; species varied as a consequence of their own effort through the use
                    of their inherent internal powers and the subsequent transmission of acquired characteristics.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

                    concluded that life was determined by geographic and climatic conditions but that geological proof

                    incipient species and praised Agassiz's idea of prophetic types. Moore's only

                    implicit neo-Lamarckianism. In response to a discussion of the relationship between eating habits
                    and variation in species, Moore noted that Hawaiian chiefs had become almost a different race from
                    the common people. This note suggests that he believed species could vary themselves as a
                    consequence of their environmental conditions, in this case what they ate.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

            <p>Moore had direct contact with the neo-Lamarckians through E. D. Cope, their acknowledged leader, who,
                    like Moore, was a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> and sensitive to the same issues that troubled Moore. Moore was particularly influenced
                    by a lecture that Cope delivered at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> Institute in 1874 titled "Consciousness in Evolution." Cope found a
                    meaning for the evidence of design in nature quite different from that of Agassiz and Gray. Since
                    animal structures evolved as a consequence of the effort or use exerted by the animal, Cope argued
                    that the design displayed in nature was an expression of the intelligence possessed by the animal
                    itself. Evidence of design demonstrated that animal evolution was a continual process of the
                    extension and development of consciousness or mind in individual organisms. Whenever consciousness
                    had developed in a species, the species had evolved to a higher form. When consciousness gave way to
                    habit and inaction, the evolution stopped. For Cope intelligence was located in the individual
                    species and design was an expression of individual intelligence. At the same time the increasing
                    complexity of design evident in nature demonstrated the continual development of individual
                    consciousness or mind.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

            <p>For someone attempting to discover the Christian meaning of biological evolution the neo-Lamarckian
                    explanation offered a number of interesting possibilities. The neo-Lamarckians reintroduced the
                    importance of individual consciousness and the role of individual effort into the evolutionary
                    process. This consciousness could be interpreted as the working of a kind of "inner
                    light" in each individual and as evidence of God working through the individual. The
                    emphasis on the effort of the individual organism in the neo-Lamarckian explanation was compatible
                    with an emphasis on the moral and spiritual effort of individuals and their responsibility for moral
                    effort. The need for individual effort in development meant that the course of evolution was not
                    predetermined or preordained. Similarly, the evolution of consciousness and the continual
                    development of mind introduced an immaterial, spiritual aspect to the evolutionary process. This
                    opened the possibility that man might develop or evolve spiritually as an individual and as a
                    species.</p>
            <p>Shortly after reading Cope, Moore explored these possibilities. He presented his long awaited
                    interpretation of the meaning of evolution in a public lecture titled "Coming Events Cast
                    Their Shadow Before."<hi rend="sup">31</hi> This lecture was built around
                    Agassiz's idea of prophetic types and foreshadowing. From the evidence of prophetic types
                    Moore deduced a great law of foreshadowing. He explained that the geological formation of the earth
                    foreshadowed the course of the development of plant and animal life as well as the course of
                    man's development and the development of human civilization. The clearest example of
                    foreshadowing, Moore suggested, was in animal structures. For example, the brain and the spinal
                    structure of early fishes were prophets of the physical characteristics of man. Man was a perfect
                    fulfillment of these early prophecies; he had the most perfect brain and the most perfect hands and
                    he was perfectly upright. Man was most ideally adapted to the physical conditions of the present and
                    this occurred through the physical process of adaptation.</p>

                        It appears that "Coming Events" was part of this series. Other lecture notes
                        in his papers which closely follow the text of this lecture are dated as late as 1889.</item>

            <p>Then, drawing on neo-Lamarckian ideas Moore gave this physical evolution concrete religious and
                    ethical meaning. The evidence of the evolution of consciousness meant that man might evolve
                    spiritually. Man was like a prophetic type, foreshadowing future spiritual life and the development
                    of the soul. Although the scientific record seemed to indicate that man would not survive as a
                    species, it also suggested a spiritual evolution of consciousness beyond physical life, or a life
                    after death. The importance of effort in evolution also suggested to Moore the existence of an after
                    life. He cited evidence that the wants and desires of all animals in earlier ages had been
                    fulfilled. While animal wants were physical, man's highest wants were spiritual and the
                    strongest was a desire for eternal life. The evidence seemed to indicate to Moore that just as the
                    giraffe was not disappointed in its efforts to reach the highest branches, man would not be
                    disappointed in his spiritual desires. For man, spiritual effort in this life determined the nature
                    of spiritual life in the future. This affirmed the importance of morality and spiritual
                    responsibility here on earth. Moore noted that this was in accord with the scripture: the Old
                    Testament had foreshadowed the coming of Christ and His perfect life foreshadowed and promised a
                    life in the future.</p>
            <p>"Coming Events Cast Their Shadow Before" exemplifies what evolution meant to an

                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In it Moore successfully proved to himself and his community that there need be no
                    conflict between scientific ideas and religious beliefs. With imagination and integrity Moore
                    transformed Darwinsim into a form that had meaning within his cultural and religious tradition. As a
                    result he not only maintained an important role for science in a religious community but also
                    provided his fellow Quakers with strategies and weapons for dealing with the complex and challenging
                    developments in American culture symbolized by the debate and eventual acceptance of evolutionary
                    theory. Beginning with Moore faith in the essential unity of all knowledge and truth has been the
                    foundation of a strong scientific tradition at Earlham College.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>

            <p>During the past two decades historians have added new dimensions to their evaluations of
                    progressivism. No longer viewed simply as the defensive response of middle class reformers to the
                    increasing power of the business community, progressivism emerges instead as a collection of
                    ambiguous and conflicting reform movements often initiated and controlled by the very forces
                    ostensibly targeted for reform, as a reassertion of moral traditions and democratic values which
                    frequently embraced racial prejudice and imperialism, and an effort to protect individual initiative
                    from corporate encroachment which often fostered business consolidation and the expansion of
                    government bureaucracy.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>The career of Albert J. Beveridge of Indiana is symptomatic of the twisting and contradictory
                    currents characteristic of the progressive era. Beginning his national senatorial career in 1899 as
                    a militant expansionist and nationalist, Beveridge rose to prominence between the Spanish-American
                    War and the end of the Philippine insurrection in 1902 as an advocate of America's budding
                    empire. An orator of extraordinary skill, he advocated both moral mission and economic <list type="footnotes">

            </p>
            <p>By the early years of Theodore Roosevelt's administration, however, Beveridge began to
                    augment his expansive nationalism with the politically promising role of Senate insurgent. His
                    reform activities between 1903 and 1912, aimed at promoting social equilibrium by easing abuses
                    which threatened to incite social unrest, read like a litany of progressive causes. Beveridge
                    actively supported a department of commerce and a bureau of corporations, a lower tariff and a
                    neutral tariff commission, federal railroad regulation, a national meat inspection bill, income and
                    inheritance taxes, a federal child labor bill, and direct primaries.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Breaking with President William Howard Taft over the Payne-Aldrich tariff of 1909, Beveridge lost his
                    Senate seat in 1910 and turned with increasing eagerness to support Theodore Roosevelt's
                    return to presidential politics. Despite his reluctance to leave the Republican party, Beveridge
                    joined Roosevelt in the Progressive party crusade of 1912. The former senator's keynote
                    address at the party's national convention, in which he attacked covert corporate
                    corruption and outmoded notions of individualism, represented the high point in the moral-religious
                    rhetoric generated by the Progressive party. It is this aspect of Beveridge's career, from
                    insurgent to Progressive, that has captured most historical attention. Defeated as Progressive
                    candidate for governor of Indiana in 1912, Beveridge largely withdrew from politics to devote
                    himself to the multivolume biography of John Marshall which ultimately earned him the Pulitzer
                        Prize.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the years which followed the demise of the Progressive party Beveridge altered his views on
                    domestic politics. Concerned by 1917 over the proliferation of centralized federal authority and
                    bureaucracy which he felt had overstepped the limited goal of safeguarding basic social justice,
                    Beveridge reversed field on virtually all his reform and Progressive <list type="footnotes">

                    ardent Progressive to a militant reactionary." Beveridge attacked all government controls
                    over corporations, defended the open shop and the suppression of strikers, denounced income and
                    inheritance taxes, and even endorsed the high tariff. His popularity as a Chamber of Commerce
                    speaker rose perceptibly.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beveridge remained, however, a consistent expansionist and nationalist, emerging early in the First
                    World War as an opponent of the internationalist minded League to Enforce Peace. Bitterly denouncing

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in any international organization, Beveridge became by 1918 a leading speaker in the
                    organized efforts to revise drastically or defeat totally Woodrow Wilson's League of
                    Nations proposal. Beveridge's position, the logical extension of his militant
                    interventionism of 1899, demanded that the <placeName>

                    </placeName> avoid any constriction of its freedom of action in world politics. Always an
                    expansionist, never an isolationist, Beveridge feared that the League of Nations would entangle the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in European politics and restrict the pursuit of American political and economic self
                    interest, particularly in Latin America and Asia.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>This least known phase of Beveridge's career is clearly documented in his correspondence

                    </placeName>. The two men had met during Beveridge's first years in the Senate and had
                    corresponded as early as 1899; but it was after 1916, following Beveridge's purchase of a

                    In 1904 Roosevelt named him director of the Republican literary bureau for the presidential
                    campaign. Coolidge's successful efforts in coordinating press and publicity matters and his
                    ability to work with both reform and conservative elements to create party unity eventually earned
                    him an appointment as assistant secretary of the treasury. Coolidge left <placeName>

                    </placeName> to become treasurer and director of the United Shoe Machinery Company. In that capacity
                    he developed a far reaching plan for enhancing employee welfare while in turn obviating the need for
                    unionization and corrective legislation. In 1914 his reputation in employer-employee relations
                    earned him the chairmanship of the Welfare Work Department of the conservative, business oriented
                    National Civic Federation. As early as 1911, when the United Shoe Machinery Company was prosecuted
                    under the Sherman Antitrust Act, Coolidge began to write with increasing anxiety about the expanding
                    scope of federal power over business. During World War I Coolidge served on the three member Federal
                    Shipbuilding Wage Adjustment Board, only to resign in 1918 after denouncing federal intervention in
                    employer-employee relations.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By 1917 Beveridge and Coolidge agreed on the question of limiting federal power over business
                    freedom. But it was on the issue of unfettered American initiative in international affairs, as
                    challenged first by the efforts of the League to Enforce Peace and finally by Woodrow
                    Wilson's League Covenant, that the two men discovered ideological accord and began
                    practical cooperation. Their correspondence provides new insights into this phase of
                    Beveridge's career and is particularly significant since it has been largely overlooked

            <p>It should be stressed that Beveridge and Coolidge had deep mutual confidence and affection. Their
                    letters are candid, personal, and often witty. In one note, for example, Beveridge twitted Coolidge
                    on his business associations by labeling him, in Rooseveltian rhetoric, "a great malefactor
                    of wealth."<hi rend="sup">12</hi> Beveridge often confided personal views to Coolidge,
                    turned to him for advice on various topics, and sought help in revising speeches and articles. In
                    addition to their increasingly similar political views, the two men shared a common experience as
                    biographers. Coolidge had published a lengthy biography of Senator Orville
                    ∗∗∗H. Platt in 1910 and one of Ulysses S. Grant in 1917, while
                    Beveridge finished his first two volumes of the life of John Marshall in 1916 and 1919. Beveridge
                    admired Coolidge's work, openly expressing the hope that the Grant volume would inspire him
                    to complete the final two Marshall volumes.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

                    <pb n="143" id="VAA4025-072-2-053"/> for some twenty years, Beveridge and Coolidge distrusted
                    Lodge's receptivity to the general principle of a league of nations. They therefore
                    cooperated with the more isolationist oriented William E. Borah and Hiram W. Johnson, who also
                    totally opposed American participation in a league. In spite of Beveridge's preoccupation
                    with his biographical work, Coolidge drew him into anti-League activity with increasing success. By
                    1919 Coolidge had become a national organizer and president of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> branch of the League for the Preservation of American Independence, an effort to
                    counter the work of the League to Enforce Peace.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beveridge and Coolidge were convinced that only an early organized appeal to the American people
                    could frustrate the plans of the president, whom Coolidge contemptuously labeled "the
                    Lord's Annointed."<hi rend="sup">15</hi> In January, 1918, Coolidge sent an urgent
                    telegram to Beveridge informing him that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>

                    </placeName> Opera House. Coolidge urged the former senator to make the keynote address,
                    "which will be a rousing call to the patriotism of the college men of the
                        country."<hi rend="sup">16</hi> In a letter to Coolidge, Beveridge responded with a
                    concise statement of opposition to any league scheme. Expressing his anxiety about constant speaking

                    nationalistic attack on the League proponents. Linking the League to Enforce Peace to
                    "non-American war objects and … camouflage," Beveridge asserted: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>The goal of Beveridge's inward nationalism of 1918 was consistent with that of his outward
                    nationalism of 1898: to prevent the imposition of any limitations on American economic and political
                    penetration abroad. Denouncing "emotional, ‘inspirational'
                    stuff," Beveridge insisted: "I am not built on the Billy Sunday evangelistic
                    lines." Expressing equal distaste for the anti-German "blood-horror-hate"
                    line as well as for the monotonous "
                    ‘parliament-of-man,-federation-of-the-world’ " theme, Beveridge
                    reserved his most vitriolic contempt for "Mr. Wilson's idea of bankrupting the
                    country &amp; killing hundreds of thousands of our best young men in order to remake the map of
                    the Balkans &amp; settle the question of digging irrigating ditches in Asia Minor." In
                    a line reminiscent of his 1899 Senate oratory on American international destiny, Beveridge declared:
                    "Nine hundred &amp; ninety nine parts out of a thousand of my thought &amp;
                    interest is of &amp; in the American Nation—its upbuilding, protection &amp; well
                        being."<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

                    </placeName>, Beveridge left the final decision in Coolidge's hands: "I will do as

                    carry it out."<hi rend="sup">19</hi> Ultimately, the fact that Coolidge was out of town
                    when Beveridge's letter arrived led to the selection of another speaker. Later that year,

            <p>The identity of views between the two men on the issue of the League is evident in
                    Coolidge's enthusiastic response to Beveridge's January 31 letter. Coolidge
                    declared: "I think myself that everyone is becoming nauseated with the talk about a war for
                    Democracy, when everyone knows in his heart that there is no earthly reason for our being in this

            </p>
            <p>Over the next months Beveridge consistently picked up this nationalist theme, stressing it in a tough
                    attack on the League to Enforce Peace in a Memorial Day address. Coolidge applauded the speech, a
                    copy of which Beveridge had sent him. "I have been waiting," he wrote,
                    "for someone with a voice that carries to puncture that balloon which is inflated with
                    poison gas. When are we going to get clear of this fog of sanctimony and pretense in <placeName>

            <p>By the fall of 1918, with the war clearly nearing an end, Beveridge became convinced that his
                    patriotic duty required him to expose the impending threat to American security posed by
                    Wilson's League plan. In a volley of letters to Roosevelt, publisher George Harvey, Lodge,
                    and others, Beveridge argued that as a matter of practical politics the nationalist versus
                    internationalist debate had handed the Republican party a winning issue for 1920.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> As president of the Middlesex Club, <placeName>

                    practical Republican politics sure to appeal to the club members with his well developed nationalist
                    fervor. "I have thought about this long and carefully," Beveridge told <list type="footnotes">

            </p>
            <p>Beveridge foresaw in the League issue a series of effective Republican campaign attacks. The League,
                    he charged, would lead to "a community of economic interests" threatening American
                    economic sovereignty; the League "would take out of our hands … such purely
                    American questions as the interpretation and application of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName> Doctrine; our Mexican policy; the management of our canal; our course with reference to <placeName>

                    </placeName> and the Phillipines [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>]." Beveridge further argued that
                    control over immigration laws, "the ultimate test of any Nation's
                    sovereignty," would be at the mercy of the League; even the constitutional power granted to
                    Congress to declare war would have to be repealed, since the majority of the League had to retain
                    the power to commit the entire body "to prevent aggression … or
                    ‘secure justice’ anywhere on earth." What issues, Beveridge exulted,

            <p>Turning to historical examples Beveridge insisted that even in the past a league would have stunted
                    American survival and expansion. He argued that during the Civil War virtually all members of such a
                    league would have supported the South's right to "self-determination" in
                    order to mask the desire to split and weaken the <placeName>

                    </placeName> would have been denounced as "war[s] of ‘aggression' on

            <p>To meet Wilson's challenge Beveridge called for an appeal not to isolationism but rather to
                    the "American National spirit… [and] the sentimental influence of
                    tradition." With the above historical arguments augmenting this strategy Beveridge foresaw
                    a steady erosion of League support. But the task would be arduous, demanding skill and courage, and
                    Beveridge summoned Coolidge to take it up: "This letter is for your own personal
                    consideration exclusively. I do not want to butt in to the councils of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> Republicans." But Beveridge added: the League issue which "appeals to
                    the sentiment as well as the reason of the people," could give the Republicans a new
                    rationale for existence beyond the mere pull of office—namely, the defense of vital
                    American principles. "I think that what our party needs now more than anything
                    else," he wrote, "is a general staff to plan for the immediate and the distant
                    future." Beveridge then advised: "Fortune seems to have given you the opportunity
                    to be the chief of the first section of such a general staff. For the sake of the party, for the
                    sake of the country, I pray that you will avail yourself of it."<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Coolidge responded positively, and the Middlesex Club resolutions, demanding a "lasting
                    peace which leaves America the master of her destiny," reflected the influence of
                    Beveridge's exhortations.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> Within weeks the two men had immersed
                    themselves fully in the anti-League struggle. By late October Beveridge had accepted
                    Coolidge's urging to undertake an anti-League speaking tour through <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nhu">New Hampshire</region>
                    </placeName>. Coolidge coordinated the tour, consulting with Lodge, Johnson, and other members of
                    the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Beveridge revised his speeches in accordance with
                    Coolidge's suggestions and declared his complete confidence in Coolidge's judgment
                    on projected speaking engagements: "You will know what to do. Whatever you do …
                    will be O.K. with me."<hi rend="sup">30</hi> By December Coolidge even convinced Beveridge
                    to oppose publicly "as a serious mistake" any efforts to create machinery to
                    enforce the decrees of the Hague Court; such a move could <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Coolidge's regular correspondence with Lodge provided Beveridge with a vehicle for
                    influencing the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> senator's speeches urging reservations to the League Covenant
                    —which Wilson regarded as an essential part of the peace treaty. When the treaty came
                    before the Senate, Lodge opposed its ratification unless "reservations" or
                    amendments were added to the League Covenant exempting the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName> Doctrine and other tenets of American foreign policy from any League interference or
                    control. Beveridge hoped that Lodge would find his arguments against the League helpful; but, wary
                    of Lodge's willingness to endorse the abstract concept of a league of nations, suggested as
                    an alternative that "one of our men like Borah or Sherman" could use the material
                    "with effect."<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the early months of 1919, when the battle lines on the League hardened at home as the
                    president negotiated in Europe, Beveridge resisted some of Coolidge's speaking proposals in
                    order to concentrate on his writing.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> By July, however, Beveridge succumbed to
                    pressures for an extensive swing through the Midwest. The events surrounding this tour have been
                    touched on by Beveridge's biographers, but Coolidge's primary role as coordinator
                    has been completely overlooked.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was to Coolidge, a fellow biographer, that Beveridge spilled out his anxiety over the pressures to
                    complete the fourth Marshall volume: "I am profoundly troubled. As you know, I am not only
                    anxious but eager to make this speaking trip. If the production of the book involved only myself I
                    would postpone it … and go like a shot. But it is a matter of contract involving an

                    risk the consequences …." As an alternative, Beveridge proposed that the trip be
                    postponed until September, when the fight would be "in full swing."<hi rend="sup">35</hi> Coolidge contacted the anti-League members of Lodge's committee and wired

                    first informed Coolidge of his intention to abandon the tour: "Race riot increasing. Men

            <p>Despite their mutual sense of satisfaction and triumph, Beveridge and Coolidge were aware that the
                    fight had only progressed through the first round. Beveridge warned Coolidge to keep up his
                    vigilance: "the Leaguers will try to browbeat or honeyfuggle or bully or soft soap or
                    frighten our men into … some sort of a ‘compromise’. They must not
                    succeed. We must not let them turn our victory into a defeat."<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
                    Although obviously touched by Beveridge's praise, Coolidge agreed that the climactic
                    struggle lay ahead. Describing an anti-League rally at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Faneuil Hall the previous week, Coolidge insisted that the Lodge
                    reservations to the treaty, designed to prevent League interference in the formulation of American
                    foreign policy, marked the limits of compromise: "These professional League of Nations
                    Apostles seem to have it in their nut that the trouble is all with the Senate …. The only
                    thing that blocks the way to the ratification of the Treaty," Coolidge bellowed,
                    "… is Wilson himself. It is reduced now to a question of his own pigheadedness

                    Beveridge an urgent request to keep the heat on Lodge and "stop the compromise
                        talk."<hi rend="sup">46</hi> Beveridge complied. "As you requested, I wired
                    Lodge as follows: ‘… your reservations utmost that can be conceded. Even your
                    reservations may not prevent President from making disastrous foreign committments [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>].’ "<hi rend="sup">47</hi> Coolidge approved of Beveridge's
                    actions, describing the telegram to Lodge as "tactful and at the same time explicit and
                    unequivocal." But Coolidge confessed that his fears had not been relieved: "I
                    don't like the tone of the despatches and I don't get very encouraging information
                    on the phone. The spirit of concession seems to be in the air and there is something like
                    precipitancy in trying to get the infernal Treaty ratified."<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The final Senate defeat of the peace treaty on March 19, 1920, convinced even these doubters that
                    they had successfully defended "every real American ideal." With a sense of relief
                    Beveridge and Coolidge turned their attention to the upcoming Republican national convention and
                    speculation on its presidential nominee. Yet even the convention created some anxiety for Coolidge,
                    who predicted that the nomination of Herbert Hoover could lead a Republican endorsement of a
                    compromise close to Wilson's position.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>

            <p>The Beveridge-Coolidge correspondence is significant from a number of perspectives. It opens to
                    historians a relationship previously neglected in assessing Beveridge's life. In detailing
                    Beveridge's practical and ideological commitment to the struggle against the League of
                    Nations, the correspondence clarifies both the post-Progressive party phase of Beveridge's
                    career and reveals the consistency of his nationalist and expansionist views. The letters help
                    create a more balanced view of Beveridge's career, bringing into sharper focus the
                    significant chapter in his political life which followed his defeat in 1910 and the brief
                    Progressive party episode between 1912 and 1914.</p>
            <p>In the final years of their correspondence, until Coolidge's death in 1925, the two men
                    sharpened their shared hostility to such issues as the expansion of federal authority, the
                    regulation of private enterprise, corporate taxation, and the union shop. By the mid-1920s the
                    Albert J. Beveridge of 1912 was no more than a dim memory.<hi rend="sup">50</hi>

            <p>A visitor to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the 1840s might well have carried with him a letter of introduction to Calvin
                    Fletcher, one of the city's most important businessmen. Presenting the letter to Fletcher
                    at the office of Fletcher and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName>, collection agents, or perhaps at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> branch of the State Bank (of which Fletcher was president after the end of May, 1844),
                    the stranger might have been invited to dinner with the Fletcher family. On that occasion he would
                    have broken bread with the <hi rend="i">paterfamilias</hi> and Sarah, his wife, perhaps as many as
                    eight of their eleven children (one or more of the older boys being away at school and the youngest
                    in the nursery), at least two young bound girls who lived as members of the family, and any number
                    of visiting relatives. The table would have been laden with food from the Fletcher farms in the
                    environs of the city, the crackling fire replenished with logs from the farms' woodlots.
                    Dinner over, the host would have taken the visitor to call on other businessmen, or he might have
                    invited his guest to accompany him to a church or temperance meeting.</p>
            <p>It is this pleasant life, with its underlying anxieties, to be sure, that Fletcher chronicles in the
                    third published volume of his diary. The first volume (1817–1838) largely concerned
                    Calvin's and Sarah's struggle to establish themselves in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>; the second volume (1838–1843) covered years of economic depression;
                    finally, in this volume, the Fletchers come to enjoy the satisfactions of relative affluence
                    —albeit the diarist often failed to recognize his blessings.</p>
            <p>Although Fletcher occasionally referred in his diary to national or international events, his focus
                    was on local matters. At the end of December, 1846, he recorded the dissolution of his eleven year
                    partnership with Ovid <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the two men having brought their collection agency to a close. But by that time
                    Fletcher was deeply absorbed in the affairs of the State Bank, and through the middle 1840s he
                    continued to expand his farms and to speculate in cattle and hogs. He described his many business
                    trips in Indiana and to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>

                    <pb n="160" id="VAA4025-072-2-070"/> by horseback, buggy, steamboat, and railroad in fortunate
                    detail. Thus his diary remains of interest to economic and business historians. Fletcher's
                    concern with local schools and his many references to the experiences of his sons who attended <placeName>

               </placeName>, provide sidelights on education in the period.
                    Comments on illness in the family and community, the practice of medicine, farm tenancy, and free
                    blacks in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> all add value to the diary.</p>
            <p>Fletcher was an introspective person who constantly measured his conduct against his ideal of what a
                    just man should be, and always found himself wanting. The modern reader might give him better marks.
                    Industrious to a fault, Fletcher was up betimes to spend an hour or more reading improving
                    literature before he began the day's work. He labored hard—at home, in his
                    office, at the bank, on his farms, in the community—and he had a loving regard for his
                    wife and children. Not of an age that that recognized a generation gap, he often tortured himself
                    with the suspicion that his sons failed to appreciate him, but he never relaxed his efforts in their
                    behalf. It is difficult to believe that he could have done much more, though he might have been more
                    gracious in the doing.</p>
            <p>A word should be added about Sarah Fletcher. On October 19, 1846, at the age of forty-five, she gave
                    birth to her ninth son, her eleventh and last child, and thus brought to an end twenty-three years
                    of childbearing. (All the children were to live into adulthood, surely an unusual family record for
                    the time.) Through it all, and around bouts of illness, Sarah continued to oversee the housekeeping,
                    to work hard in the home and on the farms, to fill her role as the wife of an influential community
                    leader. On the subjects of Sarah, her daughters, other female relatives, and the bound girls
                    Fletcher's diary is a not to be overlooked source of women's history.</p>
            <p>The editors have brought to the preparation of this volume the same careful scholarship and attention
                    to detail that distinguishes the earlier volumes.</p>

            <p>This study of ethnicity and mobility in nineteenth century <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> is the first book length example of the "new" urban history to use an
                    Indiana setting. Like many earlier community studies—from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Milwaukee to Omaha—Dean R. Esslinger's book focuses on the
                    common people—the usually inarticulate Americans who left little or no literary evidence.
                    His major sources for studying <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s immigrants are not letters, diaries, or newspapers but rather the federal
                    manuscript census returns for the years 1850–1880, which provide data on occupation,
                    property, age, residence, and ethnicity for nearly every resident. Use of census data for historical
                    research is not novel (more than a quarter of a century ago Elfrieda Lang worked through some of the
                    same returns that Esslinger used), but within the last two decades historians have begun to ask new
                    questions of these data and, with the aid of computer techniques, have developed new methods to
                    answer these questions.</p>
            <p>
               <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> grew rapidly in the years 1850–1880 as it changed from a small commercial
                    town to a booming industrial city with nearly half its population composed of first and second
                    generation immigrants. Esslinger analyzes relationships between the processes of urbanization,
                    industrialization, and immigration, especially as these relationships were reflected in the mobility
                    of immigrants. Beginning with a short overview chapter on the city, the author presents a chapter on
                    geographical mobility, showing the rapid population turnover in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>; on residential mobility, describing increased residential clustering by ethnic group
                    and by type of work after 1870; and on occupational mobility, assessing the opportunity for
                    immigrants to move up the social ladder. A chapter on patterns of immigrant social and political
                    leadership compares different ethnic groups, emphasizing the strength of German and English
                    leadership, largely as a consequence of their earlier arrival and their willingness to enter into
                    voluntary associations.</p>
            <p>Esslinger's major conclusion is that while <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> was a relatively open community in 1850 compared to older <pb n="162" id="VAA4025-072-2-072"/> eastern cities, industrialization and urbanization after 1850 increased
                    social and residential divisions and restrictions and decreased prospects of assimilation for later
                    arriving ethnic groups, especially Polish Americans. This conclusion is by no means new, but
                    Esslinger has made significant scholarly contributions in providing quantitative support and in
                    elaborating the intricacies of these far reaching changes in a small midwestern city. His work will
                    surely be of interest to the many scholars studying mobility and ethnicity in other communities,
                    although they might wish that Esslinger had not bound himself so exclusively to the four midcentury
                    census returns. Readers interested in the general development of Indiana and the Midwest will also
                    profit from Esslinger's work. The writing style is clear and concise; the quantitative
                    techniques used can be readily understood; and the subject is interesting and of utmost
                    significance. Indeed, there have been few books published in the last decade that tell readers more
                    about life in nineteenth century Indiana.</p>

            <p>Edward Kantowicz, currently an assistant professor at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Carleton</settlement>

                    aspirations of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Polish American population. The book follows other modern studies on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s ethnic groups by John Alswang (<hi rend="i">A House for All Peoples,</hi>
                    1971) and Humbert Nelli (<hi rend="i">The Italians in <placeName>

                        </placeName>,</hi> 1970); but in some ways it is more focused, and it takes advantage of the
                    insights gained by the authors of the earlier works. Since the Polish American element is perhaps
                    the largest identifiable ethnic segment in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> area, Kantowicz's information and critical judgments carry major significance.
                    These findings are not only important for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> but also for the national scene. Polish Americans have been as often spurned by
                    historians as they have been <pb n="164" id="VAA4025-072-2-074"/> ignored by political scientists.
                    Kantowicz proves that to overlook <hi rend="i">Polonja Amerykanska</hi>—the Polish
                    community in America—is to miss an important political and cultural force.</p>
            <p>Kantowicz divides his treatment into five sections; each in turn encompasses several chapters. He
                    traces the migration of Poles to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, explains the emergence of Polish American political power, relates the dynamics of the
                    Polish American vote to national elections, examines the relationship of Polish Americans to
                    twentieth century machine politics, and concludes by assessing the successes and failures of Polish
                    Americans in terms of their own goals and aspirations. The primary advantage of this approach is
                    that it allows Kantowicz to study ethnic politics from the inside rather than viewing it as one of
                    many forces acting in a situation. Although the author makes little effort to adduce much more than
                    simple percentages from his voting statistics, his presentation is clear Kantowicz's major
                    shortcoming is his failure to use sophisticated statistical methods.</p>
            <p>The book will be of value to scholars of varied interests. Kantowicz's proof of the
                    persistence of a Democratic machine in the Polish American community is important. His assessment
                    and evidence of how a minority group's very strength may frustrate the efforts of its
                    leaders to achieve substantial recognition is an important application of ideas that have not been
                    adequately explored in the past. Other readers will appreciate Kantowicz's careful
                    delineation of the factionalism cloaked behind the monolith of newspapers that English readers could
                    not understand, of a language without a Latin base, and of a population whose leaders seemed
                    strangely inarticulate.</p>
            <p>Kantowicz writes without heroes or villains. He sympathizes with the goals of <hi rend="i">Polonja
                        Amerykanska,</hi> but he is neither filiopietistic nor maudlin. As a result the book will go a
                    long way toward helping Polish Americans understand themselves and explaining them to others in the
                    scholarly community. Students of politics, urbanization, ethnicity, and the Middle West will find
                    this an extremely useful work.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the author has been poorly served by his publisher, and this is astonishing because it
                    is the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Press. There are typographical errors of the crudest kind; a variable right hand margin
                    for quotations makes for difficult reading; and the decision to use a double <pb n="165" id="VAA4025-072-2-075"/> column format with a variable right hand margin for the introductory
                    portions of each section seems inappropriate for a scholarly work. The notes have been gathered at
                    the end of the text. This is not a bad practice, except in this case when the author provides
                    thoughtful and suggestive criticisms of the scholarly literature. Kantowicz's decision to
                    free his narrative from scholarly dialogue may mislead lazy readers; they may assume that he is
                    unaware of the implications of his perceptive comments. A sound, significant, scholarly work
                    deserves more care from a distinguished press.</p>

            <p>By any standard of measurement lumbering was one of the most important industries in nineteenth
                    century America. Yet for some reason often commented upon but never explained, it has long been a
                    neglected topic of scholarship. Recently, however, interest in the topic has begun to grow. Although
                    no full study of the industry exists, a number of articles and monographs on lumbermen, lumber
                    companies, and lumbering regions have appeared. <hi rend="i">Downriver: Orrin H. Ingram and The
                        Empire Lumber Company</hi> is a valuable addition to this literature.</p>
            <p>Charles E. Twining has written a first rate business biography. Making good use of a fine collection
                    of business and personal papers, he fully describes the lumbering career of Orrin H. Ingram from a
                    millhand in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> State to the leader of the Chippewa Valley lumbermen and business associate of the
                    Weyerhaeuser syndicate. Ingram's story is not unique, but he is important as a
                    representative of the more successful lumberman of the nineteenth century. Born in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Southwick</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, in 1830, Ingram wanted to be a mechanic but backed into lumbering and rose rapidly
                    through the ranks. He chafed to put his mechanical and managerial talents to use in his own firm,
                    and finally in 1857 Dole, Ingram and Kennedy was established at <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Despite severe shortages of both investment and <pb n="166" id="VAA4025-072-2-076"/>
                    working capital so typical of frontier lumbering enterprises, the firm prospered under
                    Ingram's not always uncontested leadership, growing from a small manufacturing concern that
                    concentrated on a quality product to a fully integrated high volume corporation, the Empire Lumber
                    Company. Twining documents this growth carefully, emphasizing Ingram's and his
                    partners' key decisions and the ability of these entrepreneurs to respond creatively to
                    changing situations. By the time the downriver lumbermen invaded the Chippewa Valley, Ingram and
                    Empire were in a strong position. Although they could not banish the interlopers, they could survive
                    and prosper in an altered environment until the supply of pine was exhausted.</p>
            <p>As its title implies, <hi rend="i">Downriver</hi> emphasizes the marketing function of lumbering. For
                    Empire and all <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName> manufacturers, marketing grew from the
                    haphazard rafting of lumber from town to town to more complex business arrangements including the
                    ownership of chains of wholesale and retail yards. Twining briefly examines the pattern of
                    timberland ownership in the Chippewa Valley and makes clear that Ingram never speculated in
                    pinelands. He entered into land ownership only reluctantly and not until the speculators began
                    wholesale buying after the Civil War. Two other functions of the industry, manufacturing and
                    logging, are discussed less fully. This will disappoint anyone interested in the technical side of
                    the business. It would have been interesting to know, for example, the details of log purchasing in
                    the antebellum period or the specifics of technological adaptation in the manufacturing sequence. A
                    second and more serious weakness is the lack of local setting, particularly before the Civil War.
                    Without this comparative perspective, this reader at times forgot that Ingram and Empire did not
                    operate in a vacuum.</p>
            <p>Despite these qualifications <hi rend="i">Downriver</hi> is an important book for those interested in
                    lumber, regional, and business history. With the exception of the appendix, which could have been
                    expanded, this book is well conceived, gracefully written, and handsomely produced.</p>

            <p>The subtitle of the book, <hi rend="i">The Political Acculturation of the <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>

                    </placeName>, primarily from Russia in the 1870s, to escape compulsory military service in their
                    home country, the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> Mennonites formed a religious and cultural island on the American farming frontier.
                    Their isolation was both deliberate and inescapable. From the time of their origins during the
                    Protestant Reformation, Mennonites believed that the proper relationship between the kingdom of
                    Christ and the kingdom of this world "was decisive and thorough separation."
                    Politically this meant that those in the kingdom of Christ "must renounce the sword, the
                    taking of oaths, and the holding of political office" (p. 10). The partial accommodation of
                    these Mennonites to American democracy after centuries of isolation, particularly through
                    participation in the political affairs of the community, the state, and the nation, is the subject
                    of this book.</p>
            <p>Juhnke examines voting (and nonvoting) patterns, distribution of the Mennonite vote among the
                    parties, office holding by Mennonites, and political statements by editors of and contributors to
                    Mennonite religio newspapers. But the predominant theme is the painful frustration of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> Mennonites who wanted to be good and respectable citizens but who at the same time
                    sought to maintain their radical doctrine of the two kingdoms, particularly as it expressed itself
                    in nonparticipation in war.</p>
            <p>The author's research is extensive and thorough. His commendable foray into quantitative
                    history provides needed corrective information as to how Mennonites voted, although the evidence for
                        <hi rend="i">why</hi> they voted as they did seems quite fragmentary. Considering that
                    Mennonites did not follow their leaders in matters political (pp. 69–70, 93), it would be
                    most <pb n="168" id="VAA4025-072-2-078"/> interesting to know what those farmers said about
                    political affairs while socializing during wheat harvest or after church on a Sunday; but those
                    conversations are lost to us. One could wish that Juhnke had made a greater effort to relate
                    political adjustments of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> Mennonites to other aspects of acculturation and to compare this group with Mennonite
                    societies which had been in this country much longer, but to have done so would have violated the
                    author's self imposed limits.</p>
            <p>Emerging somewhat from his objective stance Juhnke concludes that "the tragedy of the
                    Mennonites was … that they so desperately wanted to be good American citizens and could
                    not fulfill the requirements without violating their consciences or abandoning the tradition of
                    their forebears" (p. 156). But this "Mennonite in America, a pacifist and a
                    citizen," and a 1970 candidate for the <placeName>

                    </placeName> House of Representatives who espouses "liberal Mennonite Christian
                    values" (p. ix) never states how he proposes to solve the political dilemma of the
                    Mennonites. Like a good historian, he leaves this question unanswered.</p>

            <p>Frank H. Epp is a well known Canadian Mennonite scholar, author, and leader. In the prologue to this
                    work T. D. Regehr summarizes with genuine insight the objective of the author: to "tell the
                    Canadian Mennonite story accurately, within its European, North American, and Canadian
                    contexts" (p. 17). Rare indeed is the in group author who succeeds in attaining such an
                    objective to the degree to which Epp does.</p>
            <p>Modern research has done much to clarify the complex nature of the sixteenth century Protestant
                    Reformation, in particular the many facets of the radical reformation—a series of
                    movements centering especially in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName>, central <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, and the Netherlands. The revolutionary fringe of these movements was soon eliminated
                    by the power of the states involved, and from the main bodies of the peaceful <pb n="169" id="VAA4025-072-2-079"/> Anabaptist movements came the Mennonites (1525), the Hutterites (1528),
                    and the Amish (1693). In North America the struggle to be a separated people led to further
                    fragmentation (Old Order Mennonites, Conservatives, Old Colony, Sommerfelders, etc.). Those who
                    immigrated between the 1680s and the American Revolutionary War (mostly of Swiss origin) constitute
                    the largest body in North America (100,000 baptized members), while those who sojourned for several
                    generations in <placeName>
                        <country>Russia</country>
                    </placeName> (mostly of Dutch origin) are known as General Conference Mennonites (60,000 in North
                    America). Their general conference was created in 1860, while the larger body had no general
                    conference until 1898. The Amish and the Hutterites each have a baptized membership of about 25,000.
                    The Mennonite Brethren originated in <placeName>
                        <country>Russia</country>
                    </placeName> as a revivalist group and number about 35,000 in North America. The total for all
                    bodies of Mennonites in North America is 210,000 baptized members in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and 90,000 in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>: the unbaptized children would add possibly one fourth to these figures which include
                    all Anabaptist related groups except the Hutterites. No Mennonite author has succeeded as well as
                    Epp in writing with understanding and sympathy of all groups.</p>
            <p>The book thoroughly discusses the Russian background of many of the Canadian Mennonites. It also
                    portrays the struggles of the Mennonites as they sought to maintain their faith, way of life, and
                    culture while at the same time adopting much of the modern life style of their new homeland. A small
                    minority have left <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> to settle in <placeName>
                        <country>Mexico</country>
                    </placeName> and Paraguay where they can remain German in culture and avoid acculturation through
                    the public schools of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>. Fortunately for this "separated" people, <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> now has an official multicultural policy and program and encourages bilingualism. But
                    the struggles were intense for the Mennonites, especially during and following World War I.</p>
            <p>One of the most attractive features of the book is the beautiful English style of writing. The book
                    gives evidence of wide reading and thorough research combined with sound interpretation. The author
                    writes as a convinced Mennonite, yet as one whose eyes are open to the foibles and occasional
                    shortsightedness of his subjects. The book has many charts, tables, and artist's sketches
                    (rather than photographs). Typography is attractive, and mistakes are rare. The reasonable <pb n="170" id="VAA4025-072-2-080"/> price is due to subsidies from the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> Council and other sources. Photographs of fifty representative leaders, and of an equal
                    number of meetinghouses, would have added to the popular appeal of the book.</p>

            <p>Laurence Lafore's <hi rend="i">American Classic</hi> is a narrative and photographic tour of
                    houses and buildings in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Iowa City</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>, which was founded in 1839 as the first capital of the state. Through text and pictures
                    he seeks to demonstrate the value of architecture as a means of learning "about our past,
                    present, and future, about our ancestors, ourselves, and our heirs" (p. 5). Using
                    architecture as a measure of values, attitudes, and beliefs, Lafore traces the progression of styles
                    found in houses and public buildings from the classical simplicity of Plum Grove to the modern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> State Bank and Trust Building, a drive in bank that is "an artistic triumph
                    not at all inappropriate to a society where automobiles and interest rates count so
                    heavily" (p. 95). The founders of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Iowa City</settlement>
                    </placeName> drew their inspiration from classic models; later residents chose others; and in our
                    time, technology and functionalism provide the predominate models. Any street, Lafore concludes,
                    with its mixture of classic, Gothic, Italianate, Victorian, and modern architecture, is "a
                    picture album of the family of man" (p. 95).</p>
            <p>A novelist as well as historian, Lafore writes in a sprightly and engaging manner which, when he
                    feels particularly close to a house or architectural style, becomes almost poetic. In discussing
                    trademarks of the Gilded Age, he writes: "Bay windows … recurred in profusion,
                    like the petals of an opening flower" (p. 47). Careful selection of words for their
                    descriptive qualities, as when he speaks of buildings as "the genes of a
                    community" (p. 5) is an attractive quality of the work. The author's penchant for
                    just the right word and the creation of the well turned phrase occasionally produces surprising
                    constructions. In describing the <pb n="171" id="VAA4025-072-2-081"/> idiosyncratic design of
                    Ardenia, he writes: "There is nothing like it anywhere in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Iowa City</settlement>
                    </placeName>, or elsewhere for the matter of that" (p. 74).</p>
            <p>Successful as Lafore is in describing architectural styles and identifying values and attitudes that
                    lay behind them, his work lacks consistency in its architectural characterization and
                    identification. In describing a house built in 1846 or a little earlier, Lafore notes that
                    "the very low-pitched roof is novel" and suggests it may be the result of the
                    hazards of high winds in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> (p. 33). However, the houses to which he refers more likely reflect the low pitched
                    roof feature of Federal and Greek Revival styles. Both styles were popular earlier in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and Indiana and were doubtless carried west by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Iowa City</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s early settlers. Lafore does not even use the term Federal until late in the
                    work and only then in a passing reference to a "Federal past" (p. 72). The
                    magnificant Old Capitol he merely identifies as "in the classic style" (p. 35)
                    without any indication that a distinction exists between the Greek and Roman phases of that style or
                    that the Old Capitol is an exquisite example of the former. Lafore's failure to identify
                    precisely architectural styles, which is the major weakness of the study, may be explained by his
                    desire to write more for the layman than for the student. The virtue of Lafore's essay and
                    the aspect that gives it its lasting value is its emphasis on the continuous evolution of tastes,
                    beliefs, and knowledge as measured through architecture. The study should serve as an inspiration to
                    others of what can be done in their own communities and state. In Indiana, for example, one thinks
                    most readily of <placeName>

            <p>When Lyman Butterfield opened the third (of five scheduled) Library of Congress symposium on
                    leadership in the American Revolution he posed the following question: are <pb n="172" id="VAA4025-072-2-082"/> the founding fathers "victims of a childish romanticism about
                    the past and an equally groundless cynicism about the present" (p. 4). The answers to be
                    found in the five papers that were presented were predictably varied and sometimes lacking in focus.
                    But the reflections of Alfred Kelly, Marcus Cunliffe, Gordon Wood, Don Higginbotham, and Bruce
                    Mazlish are worth having. And, thanks to the Cafritz Foundation, the book is available at a very
                    modest price.</p>
            <p>The dimensions of leadership are not easily measured. Kelly's response to the question takes
                    the form of an examination of the emergence of the optimistic ethical view he believes the founding
                    fathers had of the world they sought to change. Cunliffe attempts an assessment of the congressional
                    leadership during the Revolution, reminding us of its problems as well as limits. Higginbotham
                    considers the quality of the American military leadership, noting the European context, the American
                    emulation of their enemy's military habits, and the absence of American military writers to
                    match the political. Wood, in a notable synthesis, "The Democratization, went unmet.
                    Instead the people succumbed to deceit and of leadership. Finally, in an uneven but provocative
                    essay on "The Psychological Dimension," Mazlish attempts some very different
                    measurements indeed.</p>
            <p>No composite group portrait is possible, but a few brush strokes seem justified. The essays suggest a
                    leadership that knew its origins and valued continuity. The founding fathers were no demigods but
                    did marry ideas to power. As Wood observes, they could not maintain the marriage, and indeed they
                    helped create the changes that eventually led to their undoing. They led, formed, and liberated
                    public opinion as a new political force. They could not control it. Expectations that the people,
                    once freed of English influence, would remain faithful to the natural aristocracy who led the
                    Revolution, went unmet. Instead the people succumbed to deceit and the flattery of demagogues, and
                    America has never been the same. (Perhaps it is worth nothing that when Wood was gloomily
                    contemplating the persistent decline in the intellectual quality of American political life the
                    House Judiciary Committee was beginning hearings on impeachment of Richard Nixon.)</p>
            <p>Leadership in the American Revolution sometimes lacked brilliance but not stamina. Higginbotham finds
                    limited military <pb n="173" id="VAA4025-072-2-083"/> talent and professionalism but suggests the
                    American taste for survival led to ultimate victory. It was a leadership that, in the view of
                    Mazlish, lacked charisma and the traits of revolutionary asceticism found elsewhere. But, he
                    suggests, neither were vital to a revolution which was not national (as with <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> in 1789) and had no feudal system to overthrow. Mazlish acknowledges the
                    colonists' fear of corruption, a fear he believes led to restraints on the leadership
                    rather than (as in <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>) the lavish grants of power to those believed incorruptible.</p>
            <p>But there are additional insights to leadership to be gleaned from the psychohistorian. Why was <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> so cold and remote? Perhaps he was rejected by his mother, who also discouraged his
                    military ambitions; and so he moved from rejection by his mother to rejection by the British army,
                    followed eventually by his rejection of his mother country and a new military career. Obviously
                    Mazlish does not argue that <placeName>

                    psychological terms. But he does raise important questions, which if developed with a firmer grasp
                    on historical realities and the Revolutionaries' self perception, can enlarge our
                    understanding.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Slavery and the Churches in Early America, 1619–1819.</hi> By Lester B.
                    Scherer. (Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1975. Pp. 163. Notes, index.
                    $5.95.)</head>
            <p>In this book Scherer explores the relationship between the organized religious traditions of early
                    America and the developing institution of chattel slavery. He confines his examination to the two
                    hundred years following the arrival of the first black slaves in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. His volume proceeds in chronological fashion, separating the period into three parts
                    with divisions at 1700 and 1763. Scherer directs his attention successively to the changing nature
                    of slavery during the colonial, provincial, and revolutionary-early national eras and to the
                    evolving attitudes of various religious communities in the same periods. He concludes that during
                    these years the churches of the land for the most part uncritically accepted the dehumanizing
                    institution of slavery.</p>
            <pb n="174" id="VAA4025-072-2-084"/>
            <p>There are few surprises in Scherer's study, and for good reason. He has drawn extensively
                    upon the standard literature in the field including the prize winning works by David Brion Davis and
                    Winthrop D. Jordan. The result is a readable but far from exhaustive treatment of the interaction of
                    religion and society on the issue of slavery. One of his most interesting
                    suggestions—though not well documented—is that the Great Awakening had at best
                    only a slight impact upon the Christianization of blacks in America, contrary to the usual depiction
                    of the revival as a major impetus toward conversion of the slaves. Unfortunately Scherer bases his
                    judgment principally upon reflections by the revivalists George Whitefield and Samuel Davies. One
                    might wish for other corroborative evidence such as that derivable from local congregational
                    records. The strength of this book lies in its clear presentation of the manner in which the
                    churches came more and more to accept the cultural assumptions supporting slavery. With the primary
                    exception of the dissent expressed in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> societies and occasionally in other communities, the churches with one voice sanctioned
                    the developing social and economic order. The preachers worked out theological rationalizations for
                    slavery, and the slave owners in turn utilized the religious formulations as devices for social
                    control. In this way the churches contributed to the establishment of a system which exploited the
                    "faith in America's whiteness" and the "fear of
                    blackness" (p. 120).</p>
            <p>Scherer's volume is helpful because it summarizes a wide range of literature in a short
                    compass. In the process it also quietly indicts the religious traditions of early America for their
                    part in the unplanned conspiracy which deprived Africans of their freedom and burdened American
                    society with a legacy of racial attitudes and institutions.</p>

            <p>The high standards established in the two preceding volumes of Folk's correspondence are
                    maintained in volume <pb n="175" id="VAA4025-072-2-085"/> III. Annotations are sparse, but, in most
                    instances, the editors have ably provided explanatory comments where they are needed. As Polk
                    continued his rise to power within the ranks of the Democracy, the amount of his correspondence
                    naturally increased. The editors have been forced to be more selective about which letters to
                    include. After examining almost one thousand letters, 506 were published <hi rend="i">in toto,</hi>
                    and 184 were summarized.</p>
            <p>The years 1835–1836 were tumultuous ones for Polk. Elected speaker of the House of
                    Representatives in December, 1835, Polk presided at a time when the Democratic party was threatened
                    by factionalism. This was especially true in his home state. The presidential compaign of 1836
                    splintered the Jacksonian party in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>. Polk and his political allies were forced to contend with a formidable opposition led
                    by Hugh L. White.</p>
            <p>The letters reveal the origins of the movement on the part of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> congressional delegation to nominate White as Jackson's successor. Although
                    urged repeatedly to support White's candidacy, Polk steadfastly refused. In one significant
                    letter Polk discussed the opposition's efforts to break the administration ranks by running
                    White. Polk explained how the attempt to woo White away from his allegiance to the Jacksonians had
                    been slowly intensified. Correctly assessing the Whigs' so called regional strategy Polk
                    predicted that they would try to throw the election into the House, "where the money of the
                    Bank and the patronage of the Government might be used to purchase and corrupt votes, and perhaps be
                    enabled to elect the opposition candidate against the popular will" (p. 45). These two
                    themes— that the election might go to the House and that the Bank of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> might use bribery to influence the outcome—appear throughout the
                    correspondence.</p>
            <p>Oddly, in light of the national furor created by abolitionism, surprisingly few references to it
                    exist in Polk's correspondence. With that massive obtuseness which he sometimes displayed,
                    Polk dismissed abolitionism as a "wholly political" (p. 430) scheme on the part of
                    the opposition. One immediately recalls that delightfully fuzzy section of his <hi rend="i">Diary</hi> when, in writing about the Wilmot Proviso, Polk claimed that he could see no connection
                    between making peace with Mexico and the issue of slavery.</p>
            <pb n="176" id="VAA4025-072-2-086"/>
            <p>‘Other letters in the volume cover a wide variety of topics. Some discuss the forced
                    migration of the southeastern Indian tribes as well as the beginning of the Seminole War. A few
                    correspondents refer to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> Revolution. Perhaps the paucity of letters on the Texan war indicates their realization
                    that any mention of Davy Crockett, even in death, would irritate Polk, who had detested Crockett. Of
                    course, many letters concern a myriad of political appointments.</p>
            <p>Readers interested in Indiana history will have their curiosity aroused by a letter of April 12,
                    1836, from Polk to Charlotte Baynton. In a footnote following it, the editors identify this brief,
                    noncommital correspondence as a response to Baynton's "claim to a large tract of
                    land frequently referred to as the ‘state of Indiana’" (p. 578).
                    Although the editors direct readers to a letter from Baynton to Polk, it does not appear anywhere in
                    the volume.</p>
            <p>A number of minor editorial errors such as this do occur, but they do not detract from the overall
                    effort which is superb. Students of the Age of Jackson are deeply indebted to the work of Professor
                    Weaver and his associates in providing these documents in printed form.</p>

                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> relating to women and children; as a prominent supporter of the suffrage campaign in

                    business committee and the executive committee of the National American Woman's Suffrage
                    Association (NAWSA) for fifteen years. Fuller shows how <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>'s talents as business manager, mediator, and skillful speaker enabled her to
                    function successfully in all these positions.</p>
            <p>Using the Laura Clay Papers as his primary source, Fuller points out the early influences which made <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> a feminist. Her mother, Mary Jane Clay, efficiently managed their <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> estate during the long, frequent absences of her father, Cassius Clay. Her father, a
                    well known abolitionist and politician, served as the American ambassador in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Petersburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> from 1861 to 1869. When his rather stormy marriage ended in divorce in 1878, Laura and
                    her sisters grasped immediately the unequal status of their sex as they witnessed how economic
                    rights were denied to their mother. Although Mary Jane Clay had built the White Hall mansion and
                    improved and managed the estate successfully, she possessed no legal rights to the property.</p>
            <p>
               <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>'s mother believed that her children should be educated, and in 1863 she sent
                    Laura to the Sayre Female Institute in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName> where she received an academic education. At school <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> wrote in her diary: "I am a woman, but I think I have a mind superior to that
                    of many boys of my age, and equal to that of many more" (p. 8). A devout Episcopalian, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> then added a sentence omitted by Fuller: "Therefore when we get to heaven we
                    will be equal." Fortunately, however, she did not wait for heaven. As a "practical
                    farmer" of the three hundred acres given to her by her father in 1873 she developed an
                    independent income. With these resources <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>

                    </placeName> from which a brother had been graduated.</p>
            <p>Although successful in her year at the University of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>, <region type="county">Clay</region>
               </placeName> left her studies and
                    turned to reform and the woman's suffrage movement. She always believed that suffrage
                    should be granted by the states partly because the race issue complicated the movement in the South.
                    Considering her abolitionist background she was a moderate in her views concerning blacks. Partly as
                    a matter of expediency she believed that the southern states should grant suffrage only to literate
                    women "irrespective of the color line" (p. 55). It was her conviction about states
                    rights which led her to <pb n="178" id="VAA4025-072-2-088"/> break with NAWSA over its support of
                    the Anthony constitutional amendment. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> feared that the enforcing clause of the amendment would open the door to federal
                    intervention in state affairs.</p>
            <p>In the final chapter Fuller points out that <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> had always viewed the fight for woman's rights as a many sided struggle. As an
                    Episcopalian she worked for church laity rights for women. She also urged the admission of women to
                    southern colleges. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> played a role in the Democratic party and actively campaigned for Alfred E.
                    Smith's presidency. Finally, when eighty-six she defended the concept of equal pay for
                    equal work at the University of <placeName>

            <p>The author succeeds in showing the importance and motives of Laura Clay to the woman's

            <p>One of history's lessons is that warriors sometimes have exerted great influence upon their

                    editor's introduction, five authors examine the actions, philosophies, and organizations of
                    veterans of the First World War in Britain, the <placeName>

            <p>Dealing with the British scene, Stephen R. Ward focuses on several organizations, the largest of
                    which was the British Legion which resulted from an amalgamation in 1921 of four earlier groups. He
                    infers that, following a time of militance in 1919 that won them limited governmental benefits,
                    British exservicemen generally slumped into apathy and opted for assimilation into civilian society.</p>

                    </placeName>, especially those belonging to the American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars.
                    Veterans' organizations gained congressional approval for a bonus in 1924 and later <pb n="179" id="VAA4025-072-2-089"/> a law providing for early payment of it; but, as Lisio
                    indicates, the power of veterans organizations to influence legislation can be exaggerated. Although
                    Lisio observes that the legion's national defense programs met with defeat, he neglects to
                    mention its role in the early successful campaign for the Veterans Bureau. Also, the
                    legion's founders would be taken aback by the assertion that their organization was formed
                    by General John J. Pershing. If any one individual above others deserves credit for creating the
                    legion, it was Colonel Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. Perhaps the chief strength of Lisio's
                    writing lies in his depiction of President Herbert Hoover as being more kindly disposed to former
                    soldiers than has been generally believed.</p>
            <p>In <placeName>

                    </placeName> a number of veterans' groups existed. Robert Soucy, an authority on French
                    fascism, gives considerable attention to Henri Barbusse's small Association
                    Républicaine des Anciens Combattants which was oriented to communist causes. The gravest
                    domestic threat to the Third Republic emanated from the right, however; and Soucy devotes much of
                    his essay to the famous right wing Parisian riots of February 6, 1934. The fascist leagues were the
                    driving force behind that uprising, he says, and through them surged strong charges of
                    veterans' mystique.</p>
            <p>The value of Michael A. Ledeen's essay lies in its illumination of the Italian veterans
                    usually neglected by historians—those opposing Mussolini's fascism. In an essay
                    at times difficult to follow, Ledeen discusses the split in the veterans' organization, the
                    Arditi. This resulted in some exservicemen gravitating into the Duce's camp, others
                    pursuing far left causes under Argo Secondari, and still others rallying to the banner of the
                    antifascist Gabriele D'Annunzio.</p>
            <p>James M. Diehl traces the transformation of rightist military organizations into political combat
                    leagues dedicated to overthrowing the Weimar Republic of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>. He infers that they and certain veterans' groups, by constantly undermining
                    the Weimar government, contributed to the emergence of the Third Reich.</p>
            <p>This learned book merits perusal by anyone interested in veterans' affairs or in the
                    question of how wartime esprit de corps among fighting men can carry over into their civilian lives.</p>

            <p>Charles A. Beard, who carved out a distinguished career as one of America's leading
                    historians through a prolific outpouring of creative and often controversial writings, almost
                    destroyed his professional reputation near the end of his life by the publication of two books
                    bitterly attacking Franklin D. Roosevelt's foreign policy and especially his role in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>' entry into World War II. The author of this study attempts to show that the
                    anti-Roosevelt polemics represented a natural, if somewhat intemperate, culmination of a lifetime of
                    thinking and writing by the famous historian. Utilizing unpublished materials such as the surviving
                    fragments of Beard's correspondence as well as the vast bibliography of publications
                    written by and about him, Kennedy has drawn a credible portrait of a concerned scholar who during a
                    long and active career developed a logical and generally consistent understanding of American
                    civilization—one which embraced domestic social and economic reforms together with a
                    severely isolationist stance in foreign affairs.</p>
            <p>This broad survey of Beard's life and work reveals not only that his theory of
                    "continental Americanism" was in large part an extension of the economic
                    interpretation of history which he espoused for so long, but that its development was also
                    influenced by such factors as the general disenchantment with Wilsonian internationalism after World
                    War I, revisionist scholarship on the war guilt question, the impact of the Great Depression, the
                    rise of fascism in Europe, and the disclosures of the Nye committee concerning the arms traffic.
                    Perhaps Kennedy does not sufficiently stress Beard's iconoclastic temper and activist
                    philosophy which led him to employ his historical writings as weapons in a struggle to affect
                    American thinking on important issues, particularly in the area of foreign policy. But he indicates
                    clearly how Beard's historical studies as well as his observations of the world produced
                    strong convictions which he did not hesitate to express unequivocally in his books. One of these
                    convictions, that an overbalance of presidential power <hi rend="i">vis-a-vis</hi> Congress in the
                    making of foreign policy was a threat to constitutional government, seems to make Beard a harbinger
                        <pb n="181" id="VAA4025-072-2-091"/> of much present day thinking about the "imperial
                    presidency." In this serious study of Beard's ideas on foreign policy Kennedy has
                    succeeded in showing the contemporary relevance of a great historian.</p>

            <p>Contrary to accepted belief, Dwight D. Eisenhower did not make futile and bungling efforts to reshape
                    the political philosophy of his party while he was president. Rather, as the title of this well
                    written study suggests, he basically agreed with the philosophy of his party on domestic policies
                    and, while he piloted the Republicans to a relatively united internationalist stance in foreign
                    affairs, there emerged during the first two years of his administration a "return and
                    re-affirmation of traditional Republicanism" (p. 237).</p>
            <p>Using quantitative techniques, Reichard divides the issues of legislative history into four
                    areas—foreign policy, fiscal and economic policy, welfare policy, and power and resource
                    development—to ascertain the extent of Republican agreement on the Eisenhower programs.
                    After defining the principal issues that Eisenhower either presented or endorsed, he then examines
                    the roll call votes to determine the opposition or support by Republicans and Democrats,
                    individually and collectively, in the Eighty-third Congress. He demonstrates rather conclusively
                    that, although the Republicans controlled this Congress by a bare majority, Eisenhower obtained
                    enactment of most of his programs by aggressively acquiring the support of his party leaders, the
                    vast majority of Republican congressmen, and many southern and border state Democrats who agreed
                    with traditional Republican philosophy. Reichard further demolishes two contradictory myths: that
                    Eisenhower was disinterested and incompetent in politics, and thus was an ineffective party leader,
                    and that he reshaped his party's thinking in foreign and domestic policies.</p>
            <pb n="182" id="VAA4025-072-2-092"/>
            <p>The research is thorough, both in primary and secondary sources, and the judgments are sound. One
                    might argue that Reichard offers insufficient evidence for the implication that Eisenhower, rather
                    than Sherman Adams, effectively used patronage to control party members (p. 226). Also, it is
                    regrettable that the author did not analyze the issue of Joseph McCarthy and McCarthyism. Surely
                    this had a decisive impact upon the Republican party and also serves as an illustration of
                    Eisenhower's acute political tactics and philosophy of leadership. These cavils aside, this
                    is an important book that should do much to dispel the image of the thirty-fourth president as a
                    politically inept general directed and controlled by personalities far stronger than he. One cannot
                    help hoping that Reichard will make a similar study of the Democratically controlled Eighty-fourth
                    Congress, where the leadership roles were reversed, and thus explain Eisenhower's continued
                    political success in his first administration.</p>

                    </placeName>: Quadrangle Books, Inc., 1975. Illustrations, appendixes, index. $12.50).
                    This is a big book on a big subject. Smelser does not utilize biographers' traditional
                    sources, for athletes do not have the writing habits and sense of their own historical importance
                    that result in great manuscript collections. Instead, the author relies on the press, interviews,
                    and correspondence with people who knew George Herman Ruth. A Notre Dame professor with an enjoyable
                    sense of humor, the biographer draws also on his own broad knowledge of sports—including
                    the physical and mechanical aspects—and of psychology and on intellectual habits produced
                    by his study of history.</p>
            <p>In a detailed, complex, and fascinating book, Smelser demonstrates that the Babe deserves nearly six
                    hundred pages. A player who could pitch, field, and run the bases as well as hit with power, Ruth
                    was perhaps the greatest performer of his time. Surely the most outstanding player when the game
                    moved to the peak of its popularity, he was a revolutionary who contributed more than anyone else to
                    the development of baseball as a heavy hitting sport. Ruth was also tremendously popular.
                    "No other person outside of public life," Smelser suggests at the end,
                    "so stirred our imaginations or so captured our affections" (p. 560).</p>
            <p>Marked by efforts to explain as well as describe, the book suggests that serious study of the history
                    of sports deserves to become a larger enterprise. <hi rend="i">Richard S. Kirken-dall, Indiana

                    </placeName> Press, 1973. Pp. xvii, 367. Notes, sources cited, index. $11.95.) The
                    distinguished legal historian James Willard Hurst has written widely on the relationships between
                    law and economic development. This scholarly account of the operation of law upon money is divided
                    into two parts: "Functions of Law and Functions of Money," showing the interplay
                    of the two; and "Allocations of Control over the System of Money," which treats
                    national and state government <pb n="185" id="VAA4025-072-2-095"/> authority over money, the
                    regulation and roles of private banks, and the division of responsibility among branches and
                    agencies of the federal government. The book will be of most value to specialists in legal and
                    economic history. <hi rend="i">James H. Madison, Indiana University, <placeName>
