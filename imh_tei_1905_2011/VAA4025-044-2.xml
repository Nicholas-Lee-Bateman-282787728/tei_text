                    accomplished without bloodshed. At York, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu listened to the proclamation and
                    saw the event welcomed with "ringing of bells, bonfires, and illuminations; the mob crying,

                    oppose the elector made king, especially if the latter could employ British gold and ships to pull
                    his Hanoverian chestnuts out of Europe's Baltic fires. The chief stumbling block for George
                    was the Act of Settlement, the very thing to which he owed his accession to the English throne. That
                    piece of legislation specifically and categorically stated "that in case the Crown and
                    imperial dignity of this realm shall hereafter come to any person not being a native of this kingdom

                    be necessary for George to win his English subjects over to an anti-Swedish policy if the greed of
                    the elector-king were to be satiated. The attitudes of the English towards Sweden and her enemies
                    would have to be carefully studied by the Hanoverian advisers who had accompanied George to <placeName>

            <p>It was true that the British of all classes had little love for the Swedes. In fact their feelings
                    towards their Scandinavian neighbors often bordered on contempt. Insular self-satisfaction and
                    provincialism, however, characterized the eighteenth-century Englishman in his relationship to all
                        foreigners,<hi rend="sup">4</hi> and there were many in Britain who were ever ready to remind
                    the German king that he had not sprung from English soil. On the other hand, the inhabitants of
                    George's new kingdom could not be classed as isolationists, for many watched events on the
                    continent closely, and gloried in the fact that William and Anne had been arbiters of Europe. A
                    goodly sprinkling of Whig leaders was interested in reviving the favored diplomatic position that <placeName>

            <p>The ideas and the sentiments of the English regarding northern and northeastern Europe were fixed and
                    definite, but as is so often the case, they were based upon a relatively small amount of
                    information. Two books on <placeName>
                        <country reg="dk">Denmark</country>
                    </placeName> and Sweden crystallized English thought regarding those two countries for almost the
                    entire eighteenth century. Written in 1694 by former envoys to <placeName>
                        <country reg="dk">Denmark</country>
                    </placeName> and Sweden, the <hi rend="i">Account of <placeName>

               </hi> by Robert, Lord Molesworth, and the <hi rend="i">Account of Sueden</hi> by
                    John Robinson wielded a tremendous influence. The former publication went through three editions in
                    an equal number of months.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> It was published anonymously, the author fearing the
                    wrath of the future Queen Anne, whose husband George was a Danish prince. Neither the work by
                    Molesworth nor the one by Robinson presented a completely accurate picture, but as is so often true
                    in history, what people erroneously think to be true, is at a given time apt to be more influential
                    upon the subsequent course of events than is the truth itself.</p>
            <p>Danish and Swedish absolutism received a severe castigation at the hands of the British press.
                    Molesworth, Robinson, and other writers on northern European affairs failed to realize that the
                    tyranny of the crown was easier for the majority cf people to bear than was the oppressive yoke of
                    the nobility.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> For example William Benson in A Letter to Sir <hi rend="i">J</hi>
                    — <hi rend="i">B</hi> — (1711) considered Count Johann Patkul, one of the
                    worst exponents of a theory held by the nobles in Swedish Livonia that they should be completely
                    unfettered in their dealing with the peasantry, as <hi rend="i">"Brave Patkul</hi> (that

                    deplored. Governmental interference and the policies of the monarchs were considered to be the sole
                    causes of Scandinavian poverty rather than the long series of exhaustive wars, which had carried in
                    their wake the usual aftermath of hard times. The result was that the men in <placeName>

            <p>Whig sensibilities were further infuriated because the representative bodies in Scandinavia, the

                    </placeName> had been eradicated in northern Europe. No wonder that the indignant Molesworth warned
                    his countrymen that "Slavery, like a sickly Constitution, grows in time so habitual that it
                    seems No burden nor Disease; it creates a kind of Laziness and idle Despondency, which puts Men

                    low-churchmen and to almost all dissenters. The Scandinavian practice of quartering soldiers upon
                    the population was contrary to the Petition of Right and the Declaration of Right, documents dear to

            <p>Robinson has left many descriptions of the Swedish people, some of which still exist in part as

                    example, the Swedish people had vigorous constitutions, which accounted for their excellency as
                    soldiers, and fitted them more for camp life than for intellectual pursuits. The cold climate of the
                    North froze the minds of the Swedish people in such a manner that they were seldom found
                    "endued with any eminent share of Vivacity or Pregnancy of Wit." They were
                    "Grave even to Formality; Sober, more out of necessity, than Principles of
                        temperance."<hi rend="sup">13</hi> These caricatures <list type="footnotes">

                    in the eighteenth century as it is in the twentieth. Muscovite restrictions on travel to and from
                    Russia gave Englishmen little opportunity to gain information about the Muscovites and their
                        customs.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> It was not until 1692 after the advent of Peter the Great to the
                    throne that the "iron curtain" was lifted. Daniel Defoe, that pamphleteer
                    par-excellence, claimed that the freeing of Russia's intellectual shackles was one of
                    Peter's greatest accomplishments.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>

                    paid St. Petersburg one of the finest tributes that could be made any city by an eighteenth-century
                    Englishman; namely, that it began "to look like our Portsmouth."<hi rend="sup">24</hi> Defoe, however, sounded a note of warning, which more and more Englishmen took to heart as
                    the Great Northern War progressed and as Russian victories made the balance of power in the North
                    more onesided. As Defoe cautioned, the vast and incredible advancement of the Russians "may
                    serve to remind us, how we once taught the French to build ships, till they are grown able to teach
                    us how to use them."<hi rend="sup">25</hi>

                    1709. It achieved major proportions after 1716. The brutality of the Russian soldiers in occupied
                    territory and the arbitrary government of Peter did little to allay British fears and sensibilities.

                    aided in the siege of Stralsund. That act did not satisfy his allies who had rightfully expected
                    more substantial aid. It also exposed him to criticism at home from the Tories, who in foreign

            <p>The arguments of the opposition were well summed up by a pamphlet written by Gyllenborg, which was
                    run in the <hi rend="i">Post Boy.</hi> In it, the Swedish minister flatly stated that <placeName>

                    </placeName> was bound by treaty to help Sweden in the Great Northern War and not to aid her
                    enemies. In so far as the seizure of ships was concerned, Gyllenborg reminded the English that they
                    had followed a similar procedure during the war of the Spanish Succession, when all Swedish ships
                    bound for <placeName>

                    </placeName> had been stopped by the Royal navy. Charles had not yet received any compensation for

                    </placeName> was demanding immediate reparation for the damages that she had suffered in the Baltic.
                    Moreover, it was pointed out— and with some justification—that many ships that
                    had been stopped en route to Russia had been destined for service in the navy of Peter the Great.
                    The somewhat valid charges that Charles was harboring Jacobites was passed off as a myth by the
                    Swedish diplomat, who aptly informed the money-conscious British that the cost of the Baltic
                    squadron far exceeded any shipping losses that the English had suffered. Gyllenborg rightfully
                    asserted that the main reason for the fleet being sent to the Baltic was to force Charles to accede
                    to the illegal seizure by <placeName>

            <p>The sudden decision of Peter in September, 1716, to call off the Scania invasion led to considerable
                    speculation by the English pamphleteers and newsletter writers. Daniel Defoe in the October issue of
                        <hi rend="i">Mercurius Politicus</hi> correctly analyzed the military situation and claimed that
                    Swedish armed strength and the lateness of the season may have deterred Peter from consummating

            <p>The quick change of the Baltic situation resulting from the postponement of the attack upon Scania
                    also confused certain ministers in the government. A split in the ministry began to develop between
                    those men who would go all the way with George in his foreign policy and those who were of the
                    opinion that British interests must not be sacrificed for those of <placeName>

                    Russian power in the Baltic be eliminated in one fell swoop. Townshend, who was the secretary of
                    state, opposed such a move because he feared that it would ruin Britain's source of naval
                    stores and thereby eventually expose <placeName>

                    in some high places. In other quarters, there was dissatisfaction with the entire Baltic policy of
                    the sovereign.</p>
            <p>On September 23, 1716, Townshend wrote Stanhope a letter which was intended only for the General. In
                    it the secretary of state expressed the hope that the Norris squadron would come back to <placeName>

                    </placeName> as soon as possible, and that the king would engage Russia neither actively nor openly.
                    Furthermore, Townshend charged: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    the end of the year Townshend was eased out of his office of secretary of state and replaced by the
                    scheming Stanhope. Walpole's position was precarious. Notwithstanding, the two cousins had
                    at their command a considerable following in the parliament. If a sufficient number of Tories sided
                    with them when it came to voting supplies, it would be difficult for George to obtain funds to
                    outfit and to maintain a Baltic squadron, without which the elector of <placeName>

                    necessary so the government might rewin British public opinion to favor the sending of fleet units
                    to the Baltic in 1717. The movements of the Swedish minister Gyllenborg supplied George with the
                    propaganda ammunition he badly needed.</p>
            <p>As British intelligence had discovered, Gyllenborg in <placeName>

                    </placeName> and Baron Georg von Görtz, Charles XII's minister at large on the
                    continent, had been negotiating with the adherents of the Pretender. The gist of the conversations
                    revolved around a substantial loan that was to be given to Sweden by the Jacobites in return for an
                    invasion of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>

                    were interested only in obtaining money by fair means or foul, or whether they did actually
                    contemplate the use of force to unseat George is a moot point that has been argued pro and con by
                    Swedish and English historians. There can be no doubt that Charles had ample cause to act against
                    George, but he lacked the military resources required for such a large scale undertaking as the
                    invasion of <placeName>

                    argument with the fact that even one of Charles's own soldiers had to admit the brutality
                    of his king. The British pamphleteer pictured Charles as a "ravenous Beast of
                    Prey," and warned his countrymen what they might expect if and when Charles ever attemped

            <p>The story of Patkul was not the only offering that Defoe left on the altar of Mars. In <hi rend="i">The Plot Discovered</hi> (1717) and in <hi rend="i">What if the Swedes should Come</hi> (1717),
                    the venom of his pen rendered George yeoman service. The former contribution is especially violent
                    in its language. It was an answer to a defense of Gyllenborg entitled <hi rend="i">Fair Payment no
                        Spunge</hi>, a pamphlet which Defoe branded as "vile" and

                    labeled the Swedes as knaves, fools, men as stupid as the barren rocks, libelers, and coxcombs.
                    Gyllenborg so far as Defoe was concerned was a "reptile" and a "loose
                    lying" one. It would almost seem that the author of Robinson Crusoe had an aversion to
                    fish, for the Swedish people were referred to as Codsheads and their ruler as a "Stockfish

                    did not know that the first news that Jackson received concerning the exposure of the plot was when
                    he read a story about it in a Konigsberg newspaper.<hi rend="sup">58</hi> Such information came too

                    February 25, 1717, John Morphew of the <hi rend="i">Post Boy</hi> was arrested for inserting a
                    paragraph in his journal wherein he speculated as to what might happen to Jackson. Morphew pointed
                    out that Gyllenborg had been treated harshly by the English for no valid reason, whereas Jackson had
                    "advised the Danes and Muscovites how and where to undertake Descents in <hi rend="i">Sweden; and that his Original Letters upon this Subject were intercepted, and are

                    stretch a point of fact when it suited its purpose. The government was further irritated by the

                    settlement of Utrecht.</p>

                    Gyllenborg had in all likelihood been approached by Jacobite agents and had perhaps listened to
                    them, but gave the lie to the rumors current in <placeName>

            <p>The writings of such men as Mist and Morphew could not cope with the flood of material that came from
                    the paid pens of government pamphleteers. Moreover, the Tory press had to be wary in order that its
                    members avoid imprisonment, for this was a period of English journalism when there was little
                    distinction between a pamphlet written in opposition to the government and a treasonous libel. Under
                    the circumstances, the opposition did well. In spite of the war scare that had been raised, George
                    won the motion to secure funds for the Baltic squadron only by four votes.<hi rend="sup">64</hi>

                    George received sanction from Sweden for his seizure of Breman and Verden. It was important to the

                    mutual sentiment regarding him. His victory in parliament had been won through an astute use of
                    propaganda and the paid press. The severance of diplomatic relations assured him of British naval
                    assistance in his attempts to achieve a pacification in the north which would be favorable to his
                    electoral designs. His English subjects had to a large extent underwritten his Hanoverian policy.</p>

            <p>The nineteenth century contemporaries of Samuel Richards accorded him first rank as a painter of
                    pictures and also gave him an unchallengeable place in their affections. For this gentle Hoosier
                    artist was talented and gifted both in working with inanimate canvas and in living with his fellows.
                    Rarely has an artist in a forty-year life-span achieved such gratifying professional recognition as
                    well as such satisfying human relationships.</p>
            <p>Samuel Richards, the eldest of four sons, began life in 1853 at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spencer</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in the home of an able lawyer father and a gifted, imaginative mother. These
                    four boys were left motherless at an early age but Sam always felt that he inherited his artistic
                    talent from his maternal parent. In the picturesque hills of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Owen County</region>
                    </placeName> and in the region that is familiar to us as McCormick's State Park, this lad
                    grew up and early reveled in the beauty about him as he tramped the river banks and the beautiful
                    wooded slopes. At school age, he was trying to transfer to paper, blackboard, or wooden slab with
                    charcoal, chalk, pencil, or penknife what he observed in nature as well as portraits of the people
                    he saw about him. The making of these early though crude sketches quickened the lad's
                    ardent desire to draw and paint and by the time he entered his teens, he had pledged himself
                    unreservedly to pursue an artist's career. Unlike most youths' aspirations to be a
                    fireman, a jockey, or a policeman, Sam's first ambition remained his life-long
                    determination despite parental disapproval and a seriously impaired physique.</p>
            <p>But his diversity of interests and his lack of funds led him, for a time, to explore his many
                    capacities. He wrote some adolescent verses which he sent on to Henry W. Longfellow and received

                    </placeName> countryside, its bucolic life tutored him in the vagaries and virtues of small-town
                    Hoosier folk. This early heritage he never forgot, for whether in Europe or America, he always
                    possessed the ability to establish a delightful companionship with common folk whom he genuinely
                    liked as well as a gracious comradeship with the intelligentsia whom he enjoyed. Actually, some of
                    these early experiences were so indelibly impressed upon him that he sought to convey them to
                    others, even when a small boy, by his remarkable gift of mimicry. He kept the lawyers and judge of
                    the county court in an uproar by his imitations of their foibles. But it was the religious
                    idiosyncracies of the local Methodists and Free Will Baptists who furnished him with an incomparable
                    collection of stories. Strangely enough, the local inhabitants were never antagonized by these
                    portrayals but always relished them as did his later companions whether in Munich or in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Denver</settlement>
                    </placeName>. For he was contemptuous neither of those he imitated nor of the frontier church under
                    whose roof he witnessed so many amazing episodes. For his fun-loving spirit and his gift of mimicry
                    as well as his contagious friendliness bound people to him wherever he lived. He was not only a
                    matchless raconteur—he was also a gentle and affectionate man who loved his fellowmen
                    even for their human weaknesses.</p>
            <p>To young Richards, Communion Sunday on the frontier was invariably an interesting phenomenon. He
                    noted that the good brethren and sisters approached the communion table with their pipes in their
                    mouths and only when actually partaking of the Holy Sacrament were they removed. As the <list type="footnotes">

                    during their revivals. But the close-communion Baptists did not invite him to partake of the
                    Lord's Supper—a slight he bitterly resented—so when in a conciliatory
                    manner they called on him to lead in closing prayer, he boldly called out, "I
                    can't work where I can't eat."<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            <p>Then too, there was Sister C. who was entirely unpredictable when she "got
                    religion." Richards explained that, "Nature had dealt rather niggardly with this
                    sister in the matter of mental endowment but she did not know it and never felt the
                    inconvenience." But on one occasion when the religious frenzy had reached an unusual peak,
                    she was not to be outdone by the "hallelujahs" of others but "in a spirit
                    of sacrifice and utter abandon, rushed forward and drawing the set of false teeth from her month,
                    deposited them on the altar."<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Another devout sister was heard by
                    Richards to offer this testimonial at prayer meeting: "For a long time I was vain and
                    frivolous and sinful enough to wear jewelry. Finally, I concluded that the ear rings I wore were
                    dragging my soul down to hell and so I took them right off and gave them to my sister."<hi rend="sup">6</hi>; Such youthful experiences not only supplied Richards with a repertory of
                    stories but also filled his observant mind with an invaluable collection of varied faces and

                    concerning the Old Masters and Europe's art galleries, his instruction in drawing and basic
                    art principles was inadequate. Moreover, his artistic idealism revolted against the portrait
                    painting in Indiana of the eighteen seventies. The photographer and not the artist played the
                    stellar role in the process. "By means of a negative in a solar camera, the face or figure
                    to be painted was thrown upon canvas, where, enlarged to life size, it was carefully traced with
                    pencil…. The tracings were covered with paint of various admixtures and blendings and
                    then 'finished up' with <hi rend="i">sittings</hi> to approximate…. the

                    revealed it had a canvas back, a painted front, and some similarity in feature to the face of the
                    original. Such hack work did not please this art-ist-in-the-making but between these distasteful
                    chores, he found time to draw and paint from life, study his few art books and read widely in the
                    broadening areas of history and biography.</p>
            <p>Late in 1872, he took a brief fling at formal education at Indiana University, but the weighty
                    emphasis on algebraic theorems and Latin declensions was displeasing to his artistic mind. In fact,
                    he found studying the faces and demeanor of his professors more interesting and profitable than
                    heeding their erudition. An unwise investment in <placeName>

                    dollars, the paying of which plagued him for several years.</p>
            <p>Richards was chafing at his inability to get artistic direction from experienced artists, so he wrote
                    to the sculptor, Hiram Powers, who then resided in <placeName>
                        <country reg="it">Italy</country>
                    </placeName> and asked his advice. At that time, Powers was probably the best-known American artist
                    abroad, and he generously took time to reply to this unknown Hoosier art student. He advised him
                    against going to Europe but urged his studying anatomy and training his eye and hand to copy just

                    </placeName>, Indiana, where he established a studio and remained for four years. His serious
                    pursuit of his art won the prompt approval of the city's elders while his genial charm and
                    amazing talent for mimicry captured immediately the younger crowd. The college fraternity of Phi
                    Delta Theta made him a member, and wherever he wait in his leisure lime, the delighted response to
                    his presence was evident. Romance did not pass him by. Shortly after his arrival, he was captivated
                    by the very considerable charms of Louise Parks, a brilliant and rather dashing daughter of a
                    prosperous but strait-laced Baptist minister. She had a mind as keen as her wit was bright and a
                    heart as ardent as her will was determined. Their mutual devotion was matched by their joint
                    determination to conquer parental opposition and to overcome poverty. The resourceful young lady
                    explained the artist's frequent call to her disapproving father by saying they were
                    "cultivating their minds" and studying the French Revolution. "When the
                    denouement became known, and the unsanctioned engagement was announced to the family, the good man
                    expressed his disgust by exclaiming: 'And you have been talking to me about the French
                    Revolution. This is what I call an <hi rend="i">American</hi> Revolution.' "<hi rend="sup">10</hi> As usually happens, however, the enthusiastic eagerness of youth overcame the
                    stern opposition of maturity and an adoring but apprehensive father married them in 1875. Life took
                    on a new lustre for Richards for now he had the companionship and devotion of a most attractive wife
                    who believed implicitly in his rising star and who resolved to find ways and means for his study
                    abroad. In 1876, their only son, Harlie, was born and his arrival added a new ecstasy to their

            <p>Richards having exhausted the portrait painting possibilities of the college town moved to Anderson,
                    Indiana, where his now admiring father-in-law had given them a home. Shortly after their arrival,
                    they were dealt a stunning blow by the sudden death of their year-old son who had never before been
                    ill. "Summer complaint," as the malady was then called, was the pitiless assassin.
                    One of the pallbearers on this sad occasion was a local newspaper man who had already formed a warm
                    friendship with the stricken father. It was the first time this sensitive journalist had acted as a
                    carrier of the dead, and he was much shaken by the experience and by the silent suffering of the
                    young parents. Unable to express his sympathy by word, he wrote some verses dedicated to the child
                    "loved and mourned by hearts so newly won."</p>

            <p>The embryo poet and artist, each struggling for a livelihood and seeking recognition for his art,
                    found mutual encouragement in their devoted friendship. Riley would say to his friend: "I
                    wonder who'll get there first, Richards, you or I." Each was always elated over
                    any recognition accorded the other. The artist sent for a set of wood carving tools so that he could
                    carve illustrations out of box wood for the poet's "Farmer Whipple,"
                    "Wash Lowry's Reminiscences," and other of his poems as they came out in
                    the <hi rend="i">Anderson Democrat.</hi> When Riley perpetrated his famous hoax regarding Edgar
                    Allen Poe, it was his good friend Richards who supplied the necessary chirography. Riley contended
                    that <hi rend="i">what</hi> a man wrote was not as important as the <hi rend="i">name</hi> over
                    which it was written; that once a reputation was established, the public was ready to accept
                    anything from the author. Richards, however, with his unwavering belief in the sincerity of
                    men— even of critics—thought merit alone counted and that the favorable
                    judgment of the critics had not only to be won but also held.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To establish his thesis, Riley carefully imitated Poe's style in a poem which he called
                    "Leonainie," and Richards after diligently studying lithographic facsimiles of
                    Poe's handwriting, painstakingly copied it on the fly leaf of an old <hi rend="i">Ains-worth Dictionary.</hi> This volume was supposedly found in the possesssion of an elderly
                    Hoosier whose grandfather had been the keeper of a <placeName>

                    tremendous success and the Eastern critics such as William Cullen Bryant and Edmund Clarence Stedman
                    testified to the authenticity of the verses and of the chirography. Eventually the secret was out,
                    Riley lost his job on the <hi rend="i">Anderson Democrat</hi> but not without considerable
                    notoriety, a part of which ultimately proved advantageous to his literary career. Nine years later
                    when writing to a friend concering the affair, Riley said of Richards, "He did his work
                    well, and was thus the author of the best part of the poem. He worked then as he works
                    now;—straight from the heart."<hi rend="sup">13</hi> After the

                    artist's early years in Munich, Riley wrote him enclosing a favorable review of his recent
                    book, and added "The Top Literati of America is just now storming me with letters of
                    congratulations. O, my man, our little old visionary speculations along the ragged river banks at
                    Anderson are going to materialize after all!"<hi rend="sup">14</hi>

            <p>In 1880, came the fruition of Richards' youthful planning. Financed by the prepayment of
                    orders for pictures to be furnished later and also by the aid of devoted father-in-law, he and his
                    wife set sail for Europe. Theodore C. Steele<hi rend="sup">15</hi> sailed on the same vessel and
                    these two Hoosiers studied together for a time at the Royal Academy of Munich. Richards planned to
                    remain two years but stayed eleven for there in the shadow of the world's best art
                    galleries and under the guidance of the ablest art teachers, he was artistically intoxicated by the
                    opportunities to learn. He immediately entered the still-life drawing class of the Academy of Munich
                    where he spent four years, though he could have entered the painting class at the end of two years.
                    But he believed no one could paint well unless his foundation was laid well. Pronounced the finest
                    draftsman among the six hundred students, he won a gold medal at the end of the drawing course.
                    Other recognition came to him by way of a letter from John Ruskin who had heard of his work and
                    asked that he might see his pictures. The artist sent some of his drawings to the famous English
                    critic for his inspection. In his reply, Ruskin complimented Richards on the sureness of his drawing
                    and on the patience it took to acquire such perfection in handling, but concluded in his
                    characteristically trenchant manner, "I never saw beastlier or uglier models." The
                    artist commented that, "The wrinkled old faces were perhaps not as pleasing as younger
                    ones, but gave me a better opportunity for fine work."<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

                    famous Spanish painter, Bartolorné E. Murillo, whom he greatly admired. Their workmanship
                    was of such a superior quality that he was offered large sums for them, but he disposed of them at a
                    very modest figure to his artist friends who also desired them and had esteemed them highly. This
                    consideration for his comrades, even at the expense of his slender purse, was a lifelong
                    characteristic of the man.</p>
            <p>Early in their stay in Munich, Richards and his wife were taken in by the Anglo-American colony which
                    was made up mainly of British and American artists, literati, and diplomats. In fact, Richards was
                    soon regarded as the wit of the group and on festal occasions such as the fourth of July, he was
                    often the central attraction. At one such function his sparkling wit and clever mimicry caused him
                    to be cast as the chief minstrel for an entertainment given at an artists' carnival. The
                    Prince Regent of Bavaria was present and was so carried away by the American funmakers that he asked
                    that the program be repeated for his personal benefit.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> Gifted in foreign
                    languages, Richards quickly mastered the Bavarian dialects and loved to surprise the peasants with
                    the richness of his brogue. When he wandered through the Bavarian Alps, he always wore the costume
                    of the Bavarian Tyrol and adopted the manners and customs of the natives when among them. He knew
                    many of their folk songs and "could jodel equal to any mountaineer Swiss or
                    Tyrolese." He loved these simple, picturesque people, who returned his affection, and he
                    always came back from a tour among them refreshed both in spirit and body.</p>
            <p>Despite the relaxation of the Bavarian countryside, the artist's hours in his studio were
                    necessarily long and arduous. By 1887, the dreaded disease which had probably gripped him
                    —even if lightly—since he was in his teens, established its deadly hold upon
                    him. Tuberculosis had already attacked his talented brother William as well as other members of his

                    devoted friend. His villa was next to that of the famous English art critic and historian, John
                    Addington Symonds, who was an invalid also. Strangely enough, this highly cultivated and brilliant
                    Oxonian and this one time obscure but talented Hoosier artist became intimate friends. The Italian
                    government had just accorded Symonds the coveted honor of opening the private papers of Michelangelo
                    on the four hundredth anniversary of his death—a privilege granted him because he was
                    considered the greatest living authority on the Italian Renaissance. As Symonds examined these
                    remarkable papers which he discussed with his artist neighbor, their companionship ripened and,
                    during these interesting sessions, Richards made a sketch of his English friend. When Symonds saw
                    it, he exclaimed: " 'You have seen and put in my face everything and more than I
                    would have had the world see."<hi rend="sup">23</hi> This arresting pen-and-ink head now

            <p>Symonds told Mrs. Richards of the following incident which revealed the influence her husband had on
                    this critic's thinking. One day while walking through a Florentine art gallery, the
                    Englishman noticed a group of American tourists admiring one of the masterpieces. A member of the
                    party was reading the estimate of the picture as given by the eminent critic, Symonds, who at the
                    moment was one of the attentive listeners. Finally, he joined the group and introduced himself. Then
                    he told them that as Americans they might be interested to know that his opinion of the picture had
                    been changed since the writing of the criticism because of the influence of a most acute and gifted
                    artist, their fellow countryman, Samuel Richards.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> In 1893, Symonds published
                    his definitive life of Michelangelo and in its preface, paid tribute again to the American artist.
                    He said: "My friend Mr. Samuel Richards, the distinguished American painter, assisted me
                    with technical and critical observations upon several intricate details of Michelangelo's
                    work, and, furthermore, enabled me to give the right solution of the action intended in the colossal

                    Previously, Symonds had said of Richards that he "is the most genuinely artistic genius I

            </p>
            <p>Richards was not only stimulated intellectually and artistically by his friendship with Symonds, but
                    the latter's twenty-five-year struggle with the same disease which gripped him increased
                    his sanguine outlook. The artist said, "'Symonds is my hope: he has lived to belie
                    physicians' prophecy; so will I.'"<hi rend="sup">27</hi> So he did, but
                    his borrowed time was a much briefer span for although Symonds preceded him in death by six months,
                    he was in his fifty-fourth year while Richards died at forty.</p>
            <p>One of Richards' best works was "The Hour of Prayer," which was painted in
                    Munich in 1887 and which won a gold medal at the Academy. It shows the kneeling figure of a
                    Capauchin monk at his evening devotions in the monastery chapel. An art critic notes that <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>It is precisely because the kneeeling monk has been painted with intelligence and sympathy
                            that the picture has awakened enthusiasm…. [It shows] the struggle between the
                            intellect and the soul in a man of a sanguine, nervous temperament who in a fit of
                            enthusiasm became a monk when young, and who now, in middle age, longs for the glorious
                            struggle of the world…. There is the evidence not of sin but of struggle, and
                            combat of the intellect with the soul, the desire of one to be freed from the domination of
                            the other and to plunge into the myriad interests that make up the life of the world. It is
                            a subtle conception, and it would warm the heart of Leibl [the greatest of the Munich
                            painters of that period] to see it, though it is a flight beyond his own powers.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

                    </placeName> almshouse after a twenty-five-year search for him from whom she was separated
                    accidentally. Meanwhile, she had become a sister of mercy who was caring for the ill during a
                    cholera epidemic in the midst of which she discoverred her lover among its victims. The accidental
                    meeting of these two in a sick room of a house for the poor is the motif of the painting. The canvas
                    is fourteen by ten feet and has in addition to the two central figures, two other sisters of mercy
                    and one patient. Many believed that Richards himself was the Gabriel of the picture.</p>
            <p>The artist described his painting of the picture as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>My first idea of "Evangeline" came to me late one evening, just as I had
                            finished reading the poem, some fourteen or fifteen years ago…. I tried then to
                            make a charcoal sketch, but failed… for lack of knowledge of the principles upon
                            which pictures are composed….</p>
                        <p>After completing my studies at the Academy of Munich… I was determined at last to
                            paint my picture and stake my all upon it…. I had painted many pictures previous
                            to this, which had given me confidence to attempt such a canvas.</p>
                        <p>After a long, anxious period during which I had worked by day with my brush and by night with
                            my brain, the picture was about finished… when suddenly, without warning, I was
                            taken with violent hemorrhage of the lungs. After some weeks I was carried to my studio in a
                            chair until I completed the few minor details. The result I leave to others, claiming only
                            in all sincerity to have made a conscientious effort to perpetuate a noble and pure
                            sentiment and an honesty of endeavor for sound technical execution, which, taken together,
                            is my ideal of art….</p>
                        <p>Without wishing to raise the question of "nationality" in art, believing as
                            I do that art in its highest form is universal, yet one must admit that every nation has
                            imprinted its individuality upon art in each country, from the Greek to the Modern French.
                            We have little or no art that can be called national in character. But the time is here when
                            every American should begin to hope that native artists, whether living abroad or at home,
                            would endeavor to begin the foundation at least of the art of the coming greatest nation in
                            the world.</p>
                        <p>To me, the life, traditions and legends of my native land teem with subjects as beautiful and
                            noble in thought as one could find upon earth, so I have worked and hoped to draw materials
                            from my own land for my life work…. The story of Evangeline gave me a congenial
                            motive from my own country and my next aim was its proper presentation….</p>
                        <p>I expected criticism on two or three points at least…. In the first place, the
                            picture is lighted from behind. The light is diffused through the curtained windows in the
                            back instead, of falling from the side or front, the subject being a romance from real life,
                            demanded picturesque and poetic effect, which I found far more strongly obtained <pb n="156" id="VAA4025-044-2-036"/> by letting the light come from behind. Another important reason
                            for this, it afforded me a legitimate way to shield Evangeline's age as compared
                            with Gabriel…. [who was] prematurely aged through hardships and disease, and now,
                            wasted by the plague and in dying condition…. To present the ideal Evangeline was
                            of far more moment to me than to satisfy "contentious
                            realism"…. <hi rend="i">My</hi> Evangeline I loved so well that I fain
                            would shield her… from the full glare of light which might reveal the lines of
                            age and suffering.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

            <p>During the two years that it took to complete the picture, Richards' studio was closed to
                    all except his wife and his models. After his collapse, only two weeks before the
                    painting's completion, the doctors said he could not live, but he whispered, "I
                    will show the doctors—I will live." Seeing his frenzied eagerness to complete
                    the picture, his physicians agreed after he had had a two months' rest that it would do him
                    less harm to be carried to his studio where sustained by eggnogs and stimulants, he was allowed to
                    paint for two hours daily. After six weeks of such tragically heroic effort, his painting was
                    finished, but he collapsed and was taken away to Davos, <placeName>

            <p>"Evangeline" was first exhibited alone in Munich in 1889 and, while customarily
                    such a showing lasted only a month, crowds flocked to see it for three months. It was an immediate
                    success both with the public and with the critics and was exhibited at the <placeName>

                    of Art History and Cricitism called it, "the greatest picture of American art which I have

            <p>When Richards returned to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in 1891, "Evangeline" was purchased by the Honorable Bela Hubbard, a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> connoisseur of art, and was presented to the local museum. This Hoosier
                    artist—for he was always proud of his Hoosier birth as well as his American
                    heritage—felt some regret that his most famous picture did not find its permanent home in
                    his native state. During a showing of the painting in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the artist was unobtrusively moving about the museum and enjoying some of the
                    originals of the old masters. He met by chance a rather pompous gentleman just returned from Europe
                    who considered himself an authority on art and who patronizingly remarked to Richards, "I
                    am delighted… to find so many copies of the Old Masters here in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>."</p>
            <p>"Oh, I beg your pardon," answered Richards, "but these are
                    genuine."</p>
            <p>"Oh not at all, impossible, you know for I have seen the original of this and this and
                    this," and he pointed to the grand Murillo and others in rapid succession and named various
                    galleries as the places of their abode.</p>
            <p>"And you saw the original of this, too," innocently inquired Richards as he
                    indicated "Evangeline."</p>
            <p>"Oh yes, yes, indeed; but I cannot recall just where now, you know. Very admirable copy
                    though, very."<hi rend="sup">33</hi> Richards modestly concealed his own identity and
                    thoroughly enjoyed the incident, as did his friends later when he related the story to them in his
                    inimitable way.</p>
            <p>In his painting, Richards said he always planned the general design of his picture and then looked
                    about him for subjects suitable for models. He painted his faces and figures from sittings, but
                    relied on his own imagination for idealizing the expressions of some of the countenances.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> On the other hand, while his charcoal and pen-and-ink heads were also made
                    from models, there was never any preliminary sketching of any kind for these portraits. He pointed
                    out that he had striven hard to avoid confining himself to one line of subjects. "This is
                    so easy," he said, "that it requires an effort to keep from falling into the habit
                    unconsciously. I have taken a new problem to solve each time and I believe my reputation <list type="footnotes">

                    wide variety of his artistic themes substantiate his statement.</p>
            <p>In analyzing Richards' artistic style, Edward Garezynski, an art critic, placed him in the
                    naturalistic school and indicated that like Leibl he comprehended <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>naturalism as realism plus sympathy and suggestiveness…. Richards in his technique
                            is absolutely original. He swallowed and digested all that Munich could teach him and added
                            to that fund of information very much that comes from his own brains and from the
                            intelligent study of the old masters, chiefly, I think, the second Flemish School and the
                            great Spaniards. The Italians have evidently impressed him but little, because of their
                            conventiality…. Nothing is more striking in his painting than the grand sobriety
                            of his tones, for he uses but few pigments, and these of a kind upon which time can work no

                    professors at the Royal Academy said that no other American had ever been to Munich who gave such

            <p>Richards lived nearly four years after the completion of his most famous work and painted several
                    additional pictures. One of these was, "Day Before the Wedding" which he painted
                    at Davos, <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName>. He regarded it as "technically more meritorious" than
                    "Evangeline." It portrayed a beautiful young maiden adorning her bridal costume
                    with orange blossoms while her thoughtful lover sat by and watched her appreciatively. Shortly
                    before his death, Richards sketched plans for a huge canvas which he designated as
                    "Lincoln's Last Call for Troops." It would have included about three
                    hundred figures and would have shown a regiment in the process of organizing.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>

                    later, he brought with him two trunks of their clothes. Since he arrived with feminine apparel and
                    unaccompanied by female companions, he was suspected of a first-class smuggling job and, therefore,
                    was arrested and thrown into jail.<hi rend="sup">41</hi> But his unfailing sense of humor enabled
                    him to laugh at this indignity even in his weakened condition, and he delighted his friends with a
                    hilarious account of the episode. As a matter of fact, his home-coming would have been a triumphal
                    tour had he had the health to participate in the gala events in his honor at different art centers
                    as well as enjoy the lavish hospitality of his old friends and of his new admirers.</p>

                    frustration as he declined these honors one by one. For courageously determined as was his struggle
                    to live, philosophically serene was his imperturable contemplation of death. He had achieved not
                    only mastery in the complex art of painting but also mastery in the even more complicated art of
                    living. This made his life both an inspiration and a benediction to those who knew him.</p>

                    friends—James Whitcomb Riley and Reverend Myron Reed—-spent the afternoon with
                    him. When they left in the gathering twilight after a delightful visit, he called out to them

            <head>Population of the Whitewater Valley, 1850-1860</head>

            <p>Sectional migration to the Whitewater Valley had decreased by 1850. It was no longer as important as
                    it had been the first part of the nineteenth century. Immigration from the Southern states and from
                    the Middle Atlantic states did not maintain its earlier rate and a slight increase in the number of
                    New Englanders was not large enough to affect the general situation.</p>
            <p>The first settlers of this region were from the Southern states, and the Southerners remained an
                    important group in the population in 1850. The original census returns for that year reveal that
                    there were 9,720 persons, or 16.1 per cent of the total population, living in the valley who had
                    been born in the Southern states. When one considers that many of the original Southern settlers had
                    died by this time and that many Hoosier children had been born to parents of Southern birth, it is
                    possible to obtain some idea of the importance of this element. With the exception of the North
                    Central states, this section contributed the largest number to the population of the valley in 1850.
                    Since there was a large percentage of Quakers who migrated from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName> to the valley, one might conclude that the largest body of Southerners came from that
                    state. Only <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne County</region>
                    </placeName>, however, was characterized by a high percentage of North Carolinians. Considering the
                    valley as a whole, it contained 2,696 persons who were born in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> with 2,666 ranked second. Virginians were scattered through all four counties, but the
                    largest number resided in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne County</region>
                    </placeName>. Other Southern states which contributed in strength were <placeName>

            <p>By 1860, it was quite evident that the migration from the Southern states had sharply declined. No
                    longer were there enough new immigrants arriving to replace those who had either lived out their
                    allotted span of years or moved on westward. Whereas, in 1850, Southerners accounted for sixteen and
                    one-tenth per cent of the population, in 1860, this figure had dropped to ten and five-tenths per
                    cent. Only 7,002 persons of Southern origin resided in the valley in 1860, yet this total was larger
                    than that of any other section except the North Central states. It is interesting to note that in
                    1860 persons born in <placeName>

                    </placeName> at this time. It would appear, therefore, that <placeName>

                    </placeName> had more power to attract people than any other county in the Whitewater Valley. It is
                    likely that her rapid industrialization was in no small way responsible. <placeName>

            <p>The Middle Atlantic states have played a not inconsiderable part in the settlement of the valley.

                    Through this middle region passed most of the people who had emigrated from Europe. An examination
                    of the census returns reveals that many children of foreign parents were born in one or the other of
                    these states, especially <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, where Germans often stopped for a while before migrating further westward. <placeName>

                    </placeName>, which were in a direct eastward line with Indiana, contributed the largest number of
                    people to the valley from this section.</p>
            <p>In 1850, there were 6,180 persons of Middle Atlantic origin living in the four counties or ten and
                    two-tenths per cent of the total population. Of this total, 4,105 were born in <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>. Nearly one-half of this group, chiefly Pennsylvanians, had gone to <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Wayne County</region>. <region type="county">Franklin
                    County</region>
               </placeName> contained the greatest number from <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName>. The census of 1860 shows a total of 5,436 persons who were born in the Middle Atlantic
                    states or a decrease of two per cent <pb n="165" id="VAA4025-044-2-045"/> since 1850. <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> still contributed the largest number, and <placeName>

                    </placeName> had again managed to attract the largest number of people of all three states.</p>

                    figures, but a curious fact comes to light when these figures are examined closely. Although the
                    Southern and Middle Atlantic states had experienced definite losses between 1850 and 1860, there
                    were actually more New Englanders in the valley in 1860 than in 1850. In 1850, there were 474
                    persons of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> origin and 529 ten years later. <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> contributed the largest number at both times. The 1850 census shows that a majority of
                    the people from New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> resided in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Franklin County</region>
                    </placeName>. It is interesting to note that in 1850 <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne County</region>
                    </placeName> had only 143 New Englanders, but in 1860, there were 321 or more than double the 1850
                    figure.</p>
            <p>Since the Whitewater Valley was in one of the North Central states, it is quite obvious that this
                    region would progressively contribute more inhabitants to the valley. By the year 1850, fifty-five
                    per cent of the inhabitants were born in Indiana. The only other North Central state which
                    contributed a significant percentage was <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Persons born in the latter state comprised ten and eight-tenths per cent of the total
                    population. <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>'s importance was due to the fact that she was just across the state boundary
                    line to the east and that she lay along the main route of travel to Indiana. Some of the early <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> settlers had lived in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> before coming to Indiana and many other people moved to Indiana after having resided in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> for a while. There were actually more former residents of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> in the valley in 1860 than in 1850. No other North Central state contributed much to
                    the population of the valley because most of the states lay farther west and migration was
                    proceeding in that direction. The year 1860 witnessed a further increase in the number and
                    percentage of Hoosiers in the valley. In that year sixty-nine and seven-tenths per cent of the
                    people were born in the North Central states and fifty-eight and five-tenths per cent in Indiana.</p>
            <p>Although sectional migration to the Whitewater Valley had almost stopped, foreign migration during
                    the 1850's definitely showed an upward trend. The majority of the immigrants were German
                    and Irish, but other nations sent small <pb n="166" id="VAA4025-044-2-046"/> quotas. The famine in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName> in the latter part of the forties had started an unprecedented emigration. Since the
                    evil conditions on board the "fever ships" had been eliminated by a British
                    statute of 1849-1850 and American statutes of 1847 and 1548, passage across the ocean was now less
                    rigorous for the Irish, These laws provided that more space should be allotted to each passenger,
                    that a sufficient amount of food be placed on board, and that cooking places be provided for the
                        passengers.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many Irishmen located in the valley to work on the canal when it was in the process of construction.
                    Although it is difficult to tell how many Irish there were in the valley at that time, the census of
                    1850 reveals that 704 were living in the four counties of the Whitewater Valley in the latter year.
                    This total, however, comprised only one and two-tenths per cent of the entire population. More than
                    one-third of this number resided in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Franklin County</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Ten years later the number of Irish had risen to 1,874 now two and eight-tenths per cent of the total
                    population. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne County</region>
                    </placeName> had more than one-half of the Irish and more than twice as many as any other county.
                    This would seem to bear out the practice of the Irish of migrating to the cities.</p>
            <p>The great German migration, which began in the thirties, was to continue in strength until the close
                    of the period covered by this study. Numerous causes for previous migrations may be attributed to
                    economic, political, and religiour factors, and these were still a vital force in causing the
                    emigration of the fifties. During the years 1847-1848 and 1852-1855, there were potato crop failures
                    in certain areas of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> and a rise in the price of rye and other foodstuffs. In the period from 1850 to 1853, a
                    vintage failure occurred in Württemberg. A political factor which gave the German a
                    motive for migration was the revolution of 1848, which caused large numbers of Germans, including
                    Carl Schurz, to flee from their native land. Two additional factors were involved, both of which
                    made travel less difficult. The first was the use of steamships, which necessarily shortened the
                    ocean voyage, and the second was the railroad, which now carried the German to his destination in
                    the interior of the <placeName>

                    number at this time. Ten years later, in 1860, there were 1,591 more Germans in the valley, bringing
                    the total to 4,065 or six and one-tenth per cent of the total population. While <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne County</region>
                    </placeName> boasted an increase of more than six hundred Germans during this particular period, <placeName>

                    </placeName> showed a still larger increase and thus retained the leadership in the number of
                    Germans. In the latter county, the Germans now accounted for twelve and four-tenths per cent of the
                    total population. Since <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> was predominantly an agricultural county, it would appear that the German was more
                    likely to be drawn to the country than to the city.</p>
            <p>The English did not migrate in large numbers to the Whitewater Valley. <placeName>

                    the valley was settled the English did not constitute an important direct factor in its settlement.

                    doubled.</p>
            <p>The number of foreign-born of other nations was insignificant in both 1850 and 1360, in neither case
                    forming more than five-tenths of one per cent of the entire population. In 1850, there were small
                    numbers of people from Africa, the British West Indies, <placeName>

                    fourteen and two-tenths per cent of the property. Ten years later those from the Middle Atlantic
                    region represented eight and two-tenths per cent of the total number of people and possessed twelve
                    and eight-tenths per cent of the real estate.</p>

            <p>An interesting situation presents itself when the Southern states are considered. Since most of the
                    valley was originally settled by Southerners, it is logical to assume that a large portion of the
                    real estate would be owned by them. This is borne out by the census figures. In 1850 people of
                    Southern origin, comprising sixteen and one-tenth per cent of the population, owned real property
                    valued at forty-three and nine-tenths per cent of the total evaluation of the valley. In. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne County</region>
                    </placeName>, they owned more than fifty per cent of the real estate. Ten years later, ten and
                    one-tenth per cent of the people were Southerners, and this group possessed thirty-four and
                    four-tenths per cent of the real property. It is likely that some of the property which had formerly
                    been listed as belonging to Southerners was now in the hands of their children who were born in
                    Indiana. It might be imagined that North Carolinians would own the greater part of the property
                    since they were the largest group from the South, but this is not the case. In both years Virginians
                    owned a larger amount than any other Southern group, although people from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName> were a close second. Persons from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                    </placeName> owned sizeable quantities of real estate. It should be pointed out that even though
                    Southerners owned a smaller percentage of the property in 1860, the total value of the property
                    owned by them increased by more than four million dollars.</p>
            <p>It would naturally be expected that the total amount of property owned by people born in Indiana
                    would increase since real estate usually passed to the children when the parents died. The census
                    figures show that Hoosiers were comparatively poor in real estate, probably because most of them
                    were young and had not yet accumulated a great amount of property. The census of 1850 reveals that
                    persons born in Indiana comprised fifty-five per cent of the population in 1850, yet owned only
                    twelve and one-tenth per cent of the total real estate. By 1860, Hoosiers made up fifty-eight and
                    five-tenths per cent of the total number of people, but they owned twenty-three and eight-tenths per
                    cent of the property. Persons born in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, who comprised ten and eight-tenths per cent of the population in both 1850 and 1860,
                    owned nine and three-tenths and eleven and three-tenths, respectively, in these two census years.</p>
            <p>Outside of the native Hoosiers, the foreigners were the poorest group. It must be remembered that
                    many foreign immigrants were practically destitute when they arrived in this <pb n="170" id="VAA4025-044-2-050"/> country. In 1850, they comprised six and two-tenths per cent of the
                    poulation and owned seven and one-tenth per cent of the real estate. The Germans were the poorest of
                    the three largest groups represented—the English, the Irish, and the Germans. The picture
                    was reversed, however, in 1860 for the</p>

            <p>Irish then possessed less property per person than any of the three. By this time, the foreign

                    during the fifties, many of whom had no property. The real estate owned by persons from these three

            <p>The Whitewater Valley was destined to witness an important event during this decade—the
                    introduction of the railroad. The canal had not proved to be very practical, especially when it was
                    known that it was easily damaged by floods. Elijah Coffin, speaking of a flood in 1853, said that
                    the canal was damaged so badly that it was somewhat doubtful if it would ever be repaired again.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> It was repaired, but by 1861 it was no longer considered useful. Finally in
                    1865, the Whitewater Valley Railroad was built along its towpath, which put it out of business.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The desire for railroads within the valley was quite a natural one since railroad-building had been
                    going on in the East for several years. The increased industrialization of the valley, together with
                    the limited usefulness of the canal, provided ample justification for the introduction of the
                    railroad. Many had preferred the building of railroads several years before, but this group lost out
                    to those in favor of a canal. Now they were to have their turn. As early as 1846, the <placeName>

            <p>In the field of religion it appears that the Methodists were the most successful denomination during
                    the first half century, if the number of churches can be used as a criterion. This sect possessed
                    sixty churches in 1860, with the largest number in <placeName>

                    years previously. The Baptists,. who were the earliest sect in the valley, had nineteen churches and

            <p>One development which occurred at the close of this period demonstrates unrest in the ranks of the
                    Quakers. In 1860, a group of young people met and formed a group known as the Young Friends, which
                    opposed the older, conservative element. One of the leaders was Charles F. Coffin. That this group
                    was destined to become important is seen from the following description of a meeting held October 7,
                    1860, and attended by one thousand persons. <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The old Meeting House, crowded with people, and dim with lighted lamps, was a weird, strange
                            sight. Never before was such a sight seen in a Friends' Meeting House. There was
                            even a pathetic attempt to sing a hymn; but even this unheard of procedure failed to check
                            the meeting. The conservative element was horrified, but the matter was in greater hands
                            than theirs and though they were outraged they were helpless.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

            <p>One week later the first regularly organized prayer meeting ever held among Indiana Friends was held
                    at the house of Charles F. Coffin. These meetings continued thereafter every Sunday night for nearly
                    seven years in Coffin's house. Since they were held in a private house, the Meeting could
                    exercise no control over them. Nevertheless, they encountered formidable opposition from the
                    conservative element. The Young Friends began proselyting and using revivalistic and evangelical
                    methods. This naturally led into the field of social work—in which the Young Friends were
                    to play a large part in the coming Civil War.</p>

            <p>The population of the Whitewater Valley showed a net increase of 6,069 persons during the decade
                    1850-1860; it rose from 60,432 to 66,501. Two of the counties—<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                    </placeName> and Union—showed almost no gain, but <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> increased by more than 4,000 and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> by more than 1,500. Both of the latter counties had received large numbers of
                    foreigners during this decade. It has been shown in previous articles that the Whitewater Valley was
                    essentially a young man's country. At this time a comparison will be made between. the ages
                    of the free white inhabitants in 1820 and the ages of those living in the valley in 1860. The
                    results will be a clear indication that the percentage of older persons was gradually rising. In
                    1820, forty-one per cent were under ten years of age, but in 1860, this figure was only twenty-nine
                    per cent; in 1820, fifty-six per cent were sixteen and under, and in 1860, forty-one per cent were
                    fifteen or under; in 1820, seventy-three per cent were twenty-six or under, in 1860, sixty-one per
                    cent were thirty or under; in 1820, ninety-two per cent were under forty-five, in 1860, ninety per
                    cent were fifty or under; in 1820, eight per cent were forty-five or over, and in 1860, ten per cent
                    were fifty or over. The heyday of the young, hardy pioneer was over. In fact, he was himself now in
                    his old age living in a society of older men.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixty years had brought momentous changes to the Whitewater Valley. The territory was at first a
                    relatively unexplored region inhabited by red men. At the close of this period, however, more than
                    sixty-six thousand people lived in the valley. The first settlers had only crude mills for sawing
                    lumber and grinding grain, but now the industrial revolution was in full swing. Every county had a
                    railroad and towns everywhere dotted the landscape. Numerous religious denominations existed in the
                    valley, several in great strength. The free common school had replaced the voluntary school, which
                    was the first type to exist. Migration from other states was no longer an important factor, but now
                    foreigners, especially Germans and Irish, had come in large numbers and were being assimilated by
                    the native-born population. Above all, a native-born population, composed of the children of older
                    settlers, now constituted more than half of the people of the valley.</p>

                            door and led us into the kitchen; it is the bedroom, the living-room—in short,
                            the only room of M. Garnier, who came forward to greet us with a spoon in one hand and a

                        <p>He does his own cooking, and is writing a book. I being a French soldier, he received me most
                            graciously. Without inviting us to stay for dinner, he killed two chickens, dressed them,
                            put them on to fricassee, doubled the amount of his beans, already cooking, prepared a
                            salad, and then asked us if we should like to join him. When the meal was over, I asked M.
                            Garnier if I might read a few pages of his work. The title is <hi rend="i">Emérides, ou Soirées de Socrate [Socratic Evenings].</hi> In it
                            he supposes that the genius of that philosopher reveals the future to him, providing an
                            infinity of examples in the lessons he unfolds to his disciples, who often raise objections
                            which are as specious as the answers are worthy of his wisdom. The work is entirely
                            philosophical. It can be seen that its very plan has permitted the author to treat of events
                            which have taken place in Europe before our eyes. It appeared to me that this book is well
                            thought out and admirably written; perhaps it can be criticized for some prolixity, but one
                            will note with pleasure that M. Garnier, although elderly, is not too fixed in his ideas: he
                            treates Henry the Fourth as fairly as he does Bonaparte.</p>
                        <p>The little fellow who opened the shop for us is M. Garnier's factotum; he is only
                            fourteen, and very small for his age, but full of good sense. His mother, Madame Audibert,
                            lives opposite M. Garnier. She is a native of Vendée, but in her thinking she is
                            prodigiously opposed to that of her compatriots. I know not what she did, or what was done
                            to her to poison so deeply a heart which seems otherwise full of feeling and tenderness. Her
                            children are well brought up; one of them is a tall, pretty girl recently arrived from <placeName>

                            to understand well enough. This family, and M. Garnier, are future inhabitants of the colony
                            which I must tell you about.</p>

                        <p>M. Meslier had strongly urged me to buy a share [in this land]. He had gone away, leaving his
                            authority as manager in the hands of M. Garnier, with wham I signed for a quarter of a
                            share, or 125 acres of land, and, in the city which they are going to build, a lot 25 feet
                            wide and 200 feet deep. For that I gave him the sum of 75 francs that each shareholder
                            advances to take care of the growing society's initial expenses. I am delighted

                        <settlement type="city">Troy</settlement>

                    conjectures. Thomas J. de la Hunt, having made such a conjecture, says "it is unknown to

                    </placeName>. Yet, strange to say, it was the publication of this little centenary histroy that
                    brought to light the information sought for so long. Two grateful clients of Judge Alexander Troy,
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Salisbury</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
               </placeName>, in appreciation of professional service he had
                    rendered them and as a token of their esteem for him, proposed that the county seat of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Perry County</region>
                    </placeName>, whither they had immigrated from <placeName>

                    </placeName>, be named after him—a proposal that was accepted by the other settlers.</p>
            <p>This fact came to light in the following manner: Years ago a young lady, Agatha Lindemann, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Troy</settlement>
                    </placeName>, became a member of the Community of the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth, Nazareth, <placeName>

                    Denise <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Troy</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Troy</settlement>
                    </placeName> because, so she told her, that town was named after her grandfather, Judge Alexander
                    Troy. Recently, on receiving a copy of the centenary history of her home parish and reading therein
                    about the lack of information concerning the naming of her home town, Sister Alberta wrote to the
                    author what Sister Denise had told her about it years ago. The author, in turn, obtained the details

                    distinguished service in the Confederate Army during the Civil War, was shot through the breast just
                    above the heart as he was leading his men in an attack upon a Federal position in 1865.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> When the victorious Federals were about to bury him, one of them detected a

                    contrary to all expectation, he began to recover. Still in a critical condition, he was transferred

                    only those whom they found to be members of their society. The Sisters, however, showed preference
                    only for cases of greater suffering, and that with constant kindliness. In his journal he states
                    that "it was not long that it began to dawn on me that the Sisters of Charity were putting
                    into actual practice the teaching of the Savior, which I had long regarded as guides for human

            <p>The following letters were written by Joseph Frederick Shelly to his wife, Pauline, from the time of
                    his enlistment as a recruit in Company B, 41st Regiment, 2nd Cavalry of Indiana, on October 22,
                    1862, until his death on November 29, 1863.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Mrs. Shelly remarried nine years
                    after his death, but the letters were carefully preserved throughout her lifetime and remained in

            <p>The original letters are in German script. Phrases in dialect interspersed with English often made
                    translating them difficult. Little is known about the writer. According to family tradition, he was
                    privileged to use the prefix "von" before his surname. At an early age he was
                    forced to leave his homeland because of political activities. He was an outstanding athlete, but his
                    ability to earn a livelihood was hampered by his lack of training in any specialized field. Army

                    as "farmer."<hi rend="sup">2</hi> The date of his marriage to Pauline Werdin, or
                    Werdein, is not certain. In 1862, his two children, Fred and Emma, to whom he refers, were about two
                    and four, respectively. Pauline was born in Berlin in 1840 and had come to <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Just when he was attached to the Forty-first Regiment of Indiana Volunteers, which was
                    the Second Indiana Cavalry Regiment, is not clear, but he was with it during the winter and spring

               </placeName>. In May and June, it was advanced to

                    </placeName>, which he described in his letter of June 14, 1863. In the fall, the regiment was
                    assigned to duty along the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Chattanooga</settlement>
                    </placeName> railroad. It was during this time that General William S. Rosecrans captured <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chattanooga</settlement>
                    </placeName> and suffered defeat at Chickamauga.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Like the Twenty-second Indiana Regiment,<hi rend="sup">4</hi> the Second Cavalry was apparently not
                    in the battle of Chickamauga. Shelly does not write much about the battles he was in, perhaps
                    because he did not want to worry his wife. Seemingly, his regiment had to fight its way northward to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chattanooga</settlement>
                    </placeName> where it joined Rosecrans' army after Chickamauga. After this defeat the

                    drowned in Caney Fork of <geogName>Cumberland River</geogName> while on duty ferrying.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Shelly, therefore, saw little fighting and his letters are chiefly interesting for the
                    light they cast on conditions among the men in camp and on guard duty away from the more stirring
                    scenes of the battles.</p>

                                    or anything else should happen to me, would help me. In case I should do that I
                                    would send you $38 more than now and $75 when I get final
                                    leave. I haven't told anybody in <placeName>

                                    </placeName> that I am going for another man. I told them I was drafted and I wish
                                    you would not tell differently. I hope this reaches you in good health and
                                    happiness…. Don't write till you hear from me, as I think I
                                    won't be here for long. As soon as I know my new address, I will write to

                                    people are separated for a little while, because it is the best way to find out how
                                    much they love each other. I think of you day and night….</p>

                        <p>I would have written long ago only I did not know what. I am still in the same
                                    situation as before I came home. We did not get into the other camp where they would
                                    have kept us a little stricter. Just now the news came that we will get our horses
                                    next Thursday and that we will go to the South next Monday. I haven't had
                                    any money since I am here and don't know when we shall get any. It
                                    doesn't make any difference to me, but if I had got any I would have sent
                                    you $8 or $10, but now you will have to wait as I do. It is
                                    very doubtful whether your letter would reach me as we go away next Monday and it
                                    might take 4 to 8 weeks till we join our regiment, as we have to ride our horses all
                                    the way….</p>

                        <p>We left <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                                    </placeName> a few days after I had written to you last week and have been here
                                    since. When we left, it was our intention to go by train to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, but could get no transport for our horses, as the railway carries only
                                    infantry and provisions which is enough to take care of. Therefore, we camped here
                                    after our arrival and plan to go on on our horses in two or three days. Just then
                                    the news came that our whole regiment had been captured which changed our plans.

                                    where we will be sent. Some of the officers think we will have to go back to <placeName>

                                    </placeName> to get more men, as we are only 153 men altogether. The weather is
                                    beautiful and warm, one can go around all day without a coat. I write this letter in

                        <p>I received your letter of the 18th all right, also the one you sent to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. We had a lot to do these last days. John Morgan<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
                                    was in these parts and woke us up a little. We hunted 4 days for him, or rather he
                                    hunted us, as each time we came near enough to see his soldiers they chased us back,
                                    because he had 6000 cavalry and we only 300, but our infantry finally made him
                                    retreat. The last we saw of him was yesterday noon about 36 miles from here when we
                                    made his last soldiers ride away in a hurry. We returned here last night about 10
                                    o'clock. How long we are going to stay here I don't know. I can
                                    tell you it is not such an easy matter to ride back and forth 4 days and nights with
                                    nothing but a few crackers and a little smoked bacon inside you. However, the most
                                    important thing is to stay alive and unhurt. The bullets often flew past my ears,
                                    but it was God's will that none hurt me. Also nothing has happened to Reck
                                    and Tim. I would like to tell you about everything more in detail, but am shaking
                                    all over so that I can hardly write. I think I will get over it when I have rested a
                                    little, or if I could get a good drink of whisky, but I don't know
                                    how….</p>

                        <p>New Year's is over and a jolly one it was for me! Hardly had I finished my
                                    letter to you when the bugles sounded to get the horses and stay on guard. I and
                                    three others had to go and stay on guard 6 miles south of Louisvil. It is called the
                                        <geogName>Salt River</geogName> Road, where we had to stay till 1
                                    o'clock in the night with nothing particular happening, but three men came
                                    from Elizabethtown who said that General G [?] approached Louisvil with 9000 men and
                                    that he was only 8 miles away from us now. We let them go into town where they
                                    brought the same news to General [Buell]<hi rend="sup">8</hi> who ordered all
                                    soldiers here to arms. When we came into town all the streets were filled with
                                    soldiers, about 25,000 men, we had to stay, too. Immediately, one company of cavalry
                                    was ordered to go and meet the enemy, and we had to wait for their return here. But
                                    when they returned they reported that they could not find the enemy. We stood around
                                    in the streets with out horses till 11 o'clock, after which we went back to
                                    our quarters. I tell you it is quite disagreeable to wait around in the cold a whole
                                    night and especially as we had been on our horses the 4 nights before that. I was so
                                    sleepy that I went to sleep standing up and twice fell down in the <list type="footnotes">

                                    disagreeable….</p>

                        <salute>Dear Pauline:-</salute>
                        <p>The last letter I wrote to you came from Louisvil, as you could see. Today I am
                                    already 2 weeks in Elisabethtown, Kty…. In case you have written, I will
                                    get your letters, as they are being forwarded to us from Louisvil, but as the River
                                    Road from here to Louisvil isn't finished yet, mail is most irregular and
                                    especially so as the weather was very bad the last days. We had snow here, 18-20
                                    inches deep, which, however, slowly disappears, but still the weather is bad, as it
                                    rains daily. As you can imagine, it is also very disagreeable, as almost daily we
                                    have to stand guard or picket or we have to ride 10 to 20 miles and always arrive
                                    home, if you can call our tent that, pretty wet all through and have to get up in
                                    the morning in those same wet clothes. You won't be surprised, therefore,
                                    that many of us get sick. I myself am not quite all right these last days, but I am
                                    always up and around. Yesterday, I was picketing and came back this morning. We
                                    usually picket outside for twenty-four hours, and this night I kept guard for a
                                    captain of the 84th <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                                    </placeName> Regiment, who had been wounded and died here yesterday. His wife is
                                    here and will take him back tomorrow…. If you don't write
                                    oftener I will look for another woman who might be willing to write oftener than you
                                    do.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Pauline:-</salute>
                        <p>When I arrived here yesterday, I received your letter of the 1st of this month. We
                                    left Elizabethtown and are back here to recruit our regiment and therefore we will
                                    remain here probably 2 or 3 weeks…. Manage well so you won't be
                                    out of money. You never know what may happen, as I don't know when I will
                                    get paid. I have come to believe that Uncle Sam is a bad paymaster. You talk about
                                    sending money to me. That is not necessary, —if I don't have
                                    any, I don't need any. I learned with sorrow that Colber, Shrefs and Jacob
                                    Fogel died…. You tell me about the beautiful warm weather you are having
                                    there. Here it is different; indeed, we have 10 inches of snow and it was very cold
                                    here the last few days. So, it is most disagreeable to sit all day on the
                                    horse's back, and nights, when we stop to sleep in the open, all we can do
                                    is light a fire, spread our blankets on the snow for night quarters. However, one
                                    gets used to everything, but many people perish because they cannot stand such a
                                    life. I am healthy and all I miss is my "bitters" [beer] with my
                                    meals and before I go to sleep…. In case John Butterfield has to return
                                    soon, and he should come to this place, he must visit me and please have him bring
                                    me a pair of high boots. What we get here isn't worth
                                anything….</p>

                        <salute>Dearest Pauline:-…</salute>
                        <p>We have quite a good life here, enough to eat and no work to do, good clothing and a
                                    warm tent, if we aren't too lazy to saw wood, so I am fairly pleased. All
                                    that it needs to crown our happiness would be enough beer and whisky, which we
                                    can't have. I have no news to tell you except that we discovered last week
                                    a soldier who turned out to be a girl. She had already been in service for 21 months
                                    and was twice wounded. Maybe she would have remained undiscovered for a long time,
                                    if she hadn't fainted. She was given a warm bath which gave the secret
                                    away. Most likely we will stay here for same time, I don't know how
                                    long…. I received a letter this morning from Daniel Reprogel at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. He wants me to send him $10 for feeding my colt during the
                                    winter…. Write soon. How happy I would be to see you and to see the
                                    children running around, but it is my own fault. What do they say about the war at
                                    home? Enough for today.</p>

                        <p>Your dear letter of the 1st of the month arrived yesterday, but no newspapers, which
                                    is all for the best as the officers wouldn't give them to me for which
                                    reason better not send any, unless the papers are wrapped up so well that nobody can
                                    guess what it is…. I can't keep from telling you to take good
                                    care of the children which, on the other hand, I know isn't necessary to
                                    tell you as you do the best you can…. I am so glad that there is one [man
                                    at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Michigan City</settlement>
                                    </placeName> who is not afraid of an Army government [Soldatenregierung] and who
                                    dares to oppose such a black hearted, bloodthirsty brute like Capp. I wish to God
                                    there were more men like O. P. Dunn…. I read in the newspapers that there
                                    is going to be a new draft and that people will oppose it, but it won't
                                    help anything, as there are always plenty of men who drive than to it. If it should
                                    happen to anybody in our family I would suggest rather to go without struggle and of
                                    their own free will. We hope to get paid in a few days….</p>

                        <p>Much loved one:- Your dear letter of the 15th of this month I received this morning
                                    and I sat down right away to answer it. I also wrote at once to Paul, telling him to
                                    send you the money for the horse. It is always a happy day to receive a letter from
                                    you, but I was especially [glad] to hear from you today on my name day<hi rend="sup">9</hi> that you are well…. With God's will we might
                                    celebrate your next birthday and my name day together at home in peace and quietness
                                    and may God grant us many more. There is nothing new to tell you. In a camp one day
                                    is just like the other, that is, eating, etc. I am out of money for quite a while
                                    now and the worst is that I have no tobacco. If we don't get paid pretty
                                    soon, what we all hope fervently, I will have to ask you for money, as it is almost
                                    impossible for me to be without tobacco….</p>

                        <p>Our situation changed quite a bit since I wrote you last which was on March 19th.
                                    Hardly had I mailed your letter when we got orders to leave <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> which we did the same night. We took some rebel prisoners. One of them
                                    was a colonel. After three days' riding during which time we were on our
                                    horses day and night or standing with the horses, we returned to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>

                                    days, but nothing happened then. The enemy had already left these parts. When we
                                    returned to our camp there was already an order waiting for us to go to <placeName>

                                    </placeName>, Kty. So we left the next morning and arrived there after three days.
                                    But there, also, was no enemy, so we got an order to get in front of General
                                    Rosecrans' army.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> We are now on the march to get
                                    there. We stay here just for a day to rest a little, tomorrow we will be on our way

                                    </placeName>, I filled 3 water pitchers full of whisky so a few of us had a nice
                                    Easter. The whisky I took from a saloon-keeper in a bar who had a barrelful, without
                                    anybody noticing it. Reck has been sick for quite a while now. I am fairly well, not
                                    even a cold…. I have to bury all hope of seeing you soon….</p>

                        <p>I haven't heard from you for almost a month now, your last letter was dated
                                    19 March…, As I told you in my last letter from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Glasgow</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, we left there the next !morning, arriving at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> on Saturday and camped quite near the town. On Sunday, however, we went
                                    4 miles south of the town into our camp. Since we have been here, I have been on
                                    duty scouting, picketing, and taking prisoners. The whole country around here is
                                    full of rebel scouts. I don't know how much longer we will stay here but I
                                    think it won't be long. I think it most likely that we will meet
                                    Rosecram' army very shortly. It is really sad to see this beautiful country
                                    here so ruined. There are no fences left at all. There is no corn and hay for the
                                    cattle and horses, but there are no horses left anyhow and the planters have no food
                                    for themselves. They cannot work and plant their acres. Only yesterday I talked to a
                                    farmer at whose house I was picketing. He told me he had no potatoes to plant and
                                    all winter long he lived on corn and a very little smoked meat. To buy foodstuff
                                    here from a farmer is almost impossible, as everything they had planted and also
                                    their cattle was stolen. They have therefore nothing to sell and everything is very
                                    expensive. I can't see how the people live at all. Everybody I meet
                                    wherever I go wished fervently for the end of this war. It is pretty warm <list type="footnotes">

                        <salute>Dear Pauline:-</salute>
                        <p>With the greatest of joy I received your letter of the 14th of this month, but with
                                    sorrow I read the news of the death of Butterfield. Oh, how much I would have loved
                                    to see the old [man once more. But it was not God's will and the state of
                                    Indiana lost one more god man. That George Hiber died I had heard already from his
                                    brother who is here in our regiment. I see that many people are sick at home and are
                                    dying. Oh, may God protect you and keep you in good health! You ask in your last
                                    letter to which brigade I belong. We don't belong to any yet, but soon
                                    will. Our commander is Colonel McCook.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> He commanded a brigade
                                    last year to which our regiment belonged and I understand he will do that again.
                                    Whether we are going to belong to that brigade I don't know, but most
                                    likely. He will probably want to keep his regiment near him. Our other commanders
                                    are Lt. Col. Rupert Stuart,<hi rend="sup">12</hi> but he isn't with us yet.
                                    He was taken prisoner last December, but is free again. He is highly thought of
                                    here. Our majors are Wager<hi rend="sup">13</hi> and Stuart, brother of Bob.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> We lost our first major, Hill,<hi rend="sup">15</hi> in <placeName>
                                        <country reg="le">Lebanon</country>
                                    </placeName>, where he died, on our way here. We spend our time scouting. Yesterday,
                                    we went to <geogName>Stone River</geogName>, where same rebels fired at us, but
                                    nobody was hit. We formed a line of battle, but they ran away and we
                                    weren't allowed to cross the river for fear they might lay a trap for us.
                                    But, enough of this. On the 20th, I sent a bag of clothes to you by
                                    express…. In the overcoat you will find my ring in a little

                                    not much to tell you as nothing new has happened. We were paid yesterday, that is,
                                    we got some money. I and Reck and Tim got paid for 3 months and 8 days, and received
                                    $42.90 of which I sent you $33. I gave it to the paymaster as
                                    all the others do. He sends it to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                                    </placeName> where a man who is employed by the state gets it and sends it express
                                    to you. He takes one cent from one dollar. To send it from here by express is too
                                    dangerous, as the express from here to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> does not give any guarantee and one has to take all the responsibility.
                                    The clothing I sent was at my own risk, but I thought I would do it anyhow as the
                                    weather is much too warm to take them along and the horses have enough to carry.
                                    Most likely you will receive the money this week. I sent it to your address, and, as
                                    they do not know you at the express office, you had better ask. When you pay for the
                                    land, be sure to get a good deed and stamp. I saw from your letter that you are
                                    wearing pieces of copper to show that you belong to the Copperheads Party. I think
                                    you had better leave copper and copperheads alone….</p>

                        <salute>Dear Pauline:-</salute>
                        <p>I received your dear letter with the news that you recevied the money last Sunday,
                                    but I did not write at once, as I had just sent a letter to you a few days ago. I am
                                    glad that you are all in good health. I also am quite well. It has become extremely
                                    uncertain, however, how long one is going to enjoy good health here. We had a battle
                                    last Thursday in which two men of our regiment were wounded. The arm of the one had
                                    to be amputated, the other was shot through the foot. We expect a major battle every
                                    minute. Our outer pickets are being driven back every night. When we go out during
                                    the day, Mr. Rebel shows us his back, but only until they get into the woods, where
                                    we can't follow them farther, as Rosecrans is not yet ready for a battle
                                    though they expect it daily in those cedarwoods from which we can chase them only
                                    with shells. Our artillery which we had last Thursday let them have a few rounds, so
                                    they ran away. As soon as we turned our backs to go back to camp, which was about 15
                                    miles away, they returned. During the night, they came as near as 3 miles. I got a
                                    letter from Paul where he tells me that he exchanged the colt for a couple of oxen.
                                    Tell me what Eberts does about the land, and whether Fred [Herrman, his
                                    brother-in-law] knows when the draft will be in Indiana and what the people say they
                                    will do when they get drafted…. The weather is very warm….</p>

                        <salute>Dear Pauline:-</salute>
                        <p>You owe me an answer to two letters I wrote to you, one about my overcoat. I sent to
                                    you by express and another letter where I sent you $33 through Mr.
                                    Goutwein. I am very anxious whether <pb n="190" id="VAA4025-044-2-070"/> you
                                    received it. Let me know, please, as soon as you get it. I feel fine here. I am as
                                    healthy as a man could wish to be, although we are very busy which makes quite a few
                                    in our regiment sick. There really is hardly a day when we haven't to go on
                                    a little excursion of 40 to 50 miles. Weller and his cavalry is at our front which
                                    keeps us rather busy to keep him off. Very often we take prisoners. We had a little
                                    battle last Sunday morning about 30 miles from here, near <placeName>
                                        <country reg="le">Lebanon</country>
                                    </placeName>, Tenn., where we chased them back and took 7 prisoners. Several fell,
                                    but I don't know how many. On Saturday we left camp at midnight and met the
                                    enemy in the early morning and returned at five in the evening. Yesterday we did not
                                    have to go out at all. Today we left at 4 in the morning and returned at 1
                                    o'clock in the afternoon. It is like that every day. This part of the
                                    country, the most beautiful one I ever saw, is entirely ruined. No fences to be seen
                                    anywhere, the fields are being used for roads. Last Tuesday we had a battle quite
                                    near to General Andrew Jackson's farm. I saw where he is buried, his
                                    gravestone very plain. I also saw his and George <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName>'s easy chair. The cedar and evergreen in this letter I picked
                                    from his grave. Give it to F. Hermann as a remembrance of a good
                                    Democrat…. Wellman, who once lived in <placeName>

                                    </placeName> and who came to visit you often, is now in our
                                regiment….</p>

                        <salute>Dear Pauline:-</salute>
                        <p>I got your dear letter of the 10th of this month on Saturday, when I was on picket at
                                        <geogName>Stone River</geogName>, 9 miles from here. I have been worried lately,
                                    as I did not get an answer for so long. Most likely you also received the money in
                                    the meantime. I wrote several times about picketing, which cavalry has to do to a
                                    great extent, and, as they have only the outer posts, one does not feel quite as
                                    safe as behind a plough. So I will explain to you as well as I can all about
                                    pickets. We leave camp in the morning at 6 and ride to a special place. A whole
                                    company always goes together. As we are guarding a river our posts are situated at
                                    such places where paths run through. There are no more bridges as they were burned.
                                    Arrived at our destination, the company is divided in as many groups as there are
                                    posts. Here we have three which are all 2 miles apart. At such a post one man stands
                                    guard one hour during the day when he is relieved by another man. During the night,
                                    however, he stands guard 3 to 4 hours. Last time I stood for a while behind an oak
                                    tree where I could watch what was going on on the other side of the river. During
                                    the day, everything was quiet and peaceful, and, as the weather here is very
                                    agreeable and warm, it was a pleasure. During the night, however, Mr. Rebel tried
                                    his hand. I stood guard from 8 to 11 o'clock. About 9, I heard somebody
                                    riding on the other side of the river. I went back and reported to the lieutenant
                                    who is our commander. Hardly was I back at my post, when one of those Mr.
                                    Southerners showed himself at the river, but a bullet from my carbine made him
                                    retreat quickly enough. Now, however, they knew where I stood and entertained me by
                                    flinging pieces of oak bark at my head which was their target. But after a little
                                    while, they went away and <pb n="191" id="VAA4025-044-2-071"/> left us in peace for
                                    the rest of the night. Next day at 9 o'clock we were relieved by another
                                    company. Such little skirmishes at our outposts happen very often, but only during
                                    the night, when they try to cross the river. Next Friday, our company will again be
                                    on picket. Our Colonel McCook left us this morning. He now commands a brigade.
                                    Whether we belong to it I don't yet know. Lt. Colonel Stuart is now our
                                    commander. One of our doctors told me yesterday that we have to leave here soon and
                                    very likely will be sent to the front to meet Rosecrans' army, but I hope
                                    that is not so. Stefan Reck is ill, he hasn't been well for some time, and
                                    I believe he will not be able to remain in the service much longer. Thank God, I am
                                    healthy and hope all of you are, too…. Did they put out flags in <placeName>

                        <salute>Beloved Panline:-</salute>
                        <p>After some gadding about we came to the headquarters of our big army. Our camp is
                                    about two miles south of the town and near the 4th Indiana Cavalry. I saw a lot of
                                    those I knew at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Michigan City</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. The 4th Indiana Cavalry Regiment belongs to our brigade, so we will be
                                    together most of the time. I saw Platt who isn't as round and fat as he was
                                    in the red Mill. The others look as they did at home. We are now quite at the front
                                    of the army and stand picket 6 miles south from here where we can see the rebel
                                    picket very well. We exchange newspapers with them almost daily and they with us. To

                                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> I have received only one letter from you…. We left
                                    Murfreesboro last Tuesday and arrived here the same evening. We are 16 miles west of
                                    Murfreesboro and 16 miles east of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>

                                    Indiana Cavalry is now always with us as it belongs to our brigade. Last Thursday we
                                    were on picket. Co. 13 of our regiment and 16 men of the 4th Cavalry were on one
                                    post. When we were about an hour at the place, the rebels attacked us. They came
                                    quite near before we even thought of an attack and certainly would <list type="footnotes">

                                    They came as near as a pistol shot to him before he noticed them and his shooting
                                    brought us on guard. They took 5 prisoners of the 4th Indiana Cavalry who were just
                                    then at the outpost. As these parts are very woody they can easily make prisoners of
                                    our guards at the posts, especially as the citizens can tell them where our guards
                                    are stationed, which we can't do. But we 40 men held them off for more than
                                    two hours. There must have been about 300 or 400 of their men. They tried very hard
                                    to make prisoners of us. As they finally saw that was not possible, they started to
                                    shell us. It was a lucky thing for us that many of their shells did not burst at
                                    all. One shell came down 25 feet from me, but didn't do any harm. Finally,
                                    we fell back and our artillery started to tease them, and they retreated with loss
                                    of several dead and wounded. About this time our cavalry went to the right and left
                                    trying to get behind them but did not succeed. They had a hard fight with them and
                                    our regiment lost two men and there were several wounded. One of the dead is Lt.

                                        <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, a fine, brave young man. His loss is very sad. I have heard very often
                                    that the rebels are bad soldiers and that they have poor rifles, but in the battles
                                    I have fought, I found the opposite. They fight like lions, and many of their rifles
                                    are better than ours. This time, their bullets flew over our heads. I am convinced
                                    ours did not go over to them. When the rebels attacked us in the morning, I had not
                                    time to eat my rations which were in my haversack and could not take the corn for my
                                    horse, having removed it from the saddle, so I had a long fasting day, as we were
                                    not relieved until next forenoon. I bought some cornbread for ten cents from a negro
                                    living in the neighborhood. It tasted quite good although there was neither salt nor
                                    anything else in it. They use only cornmeal and water and bake it. A stomach well
                                    filled up with it will hold out 48 hours. Yesterday noon we left our camp and
                                    visited Mr. Rebel who is about 10 miles away from here. However, when we approached
                                    them, their pickets took to their heels, but we were not allowed to attack their
                                    camp. As a rule when we make an excursion now, the whole brigade goes together as a
                                    regiment is not supposed to show themselves to the pickets alone. Today we are
                                    living in plenty, as we stole a number of sheep and cattle from them. Yesterday we
                                    marched through the most beautiful acres of wheat I have ever seen. They plant a lot
                                    and it was almost ready to harvest, but we ruined it pretty much. Very little corn
                                    is planted here. Enough about war. You probably wondered why I write so little about
                                    my home. That is not because I don't think of it, but because I am afraid
                                    to do so. Oh, you sweet home, how much do I long to see you, how happy <list type="footnotes">

                        <p>Just now I got your letter of the 12th of this month and feel much better. I waited
                                    for a letter every day for more than a week, but I see that you do not receive my
                                    letters regularly, therefore our mutual anxiety…. I saw Alden Day, Henry
                                    Dout and many others who are in the 87th Indiana Regiment which is stationed here,

                        <salute>Beloved Pauline:-</salute>
                        <p>I answered your last letter but I am very uncertain whether you got it. We had no
                                    opportunity to send letters so I gave mine to Platt, as he went to Murfreesboro. We
                                    have had quite a hard time since we left Triun and are really finding out what it
                                    means to be a soldier. The weather was very bad. For fifteen days we had rain every
                                    day during which time my clothing was never dry. The first three days the weather
                                    was quite good, only warm. Lately, we have had three battles and we were always the
                                    victors. We took <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Shelbyville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> where Bragg's<hi rend="sup">19</hi> headquarters were in one
                                    sabre charge. At that time we took a lot of prisoners. The rebels say they lost 1000
                                    men there, our losses were only 15. We are now stationed here. When we have eaten a
                                    place empty, we go a few miles farther and take everything there we can find. You
                                    can't imagine how bad it looks here and how hard it is for people to stand
                                    by and see everything taken from them. They do it without saying a word. It is
                                    impossible for me to go into a house, but what I find for myself and my horse in the
                                    fields I have to take, as we both have to live, especially my horse which I will and
                                    have to keep in good condition. There is nothing new to tell you as we
                                    can't find out what is going on. Our force is cavalry and a little
                                    artillery. We have 20,000 to 25,000 men and horses. You can therefore imagine that
                                    so many men and horses have to eat, and everything has to be stolen….</p>

                                    we could have crossed the river without trouble from him. I suppose we will stay
                                    here for a few days, but nobody knows for how long. We really have a hard time. Also
                                    the weather is quite warm. One perspires without moving much. We heard yesterday
                                    that Morgan had been taken prisoner with all his men and that Burgard

                                    do not believe what we hear. As I can't tell you anything new, and as our

                        <salute>Dear Pauline:-</salute>
                        <p>A little while ago, I received your letter of the 21st of this month. The same day we
                                    left this locality and moved from place to place where I couldn't write to
                                    you until we finally reached Winchester at 10 o'clock at night. We got our
                                    pay for four months that same night, of which I sent you $45 as before.
                                    We were provided with clothes and food, leaving again in the morning at 4
                                    o'clock. We have been here several days, and the reason I haven't
                                    written before is that I have not been feeling very well for some time and wanted to
                                    wait until I felt better. But it is very slow. I have no stamps. Please send 3 or 4
                                    in every letter you write to me. In case F. Herman has bad money or Southern, send
                                    it to me in letters, but don't put in too much so it won't make a
                                    big package. I can't use good money here as everything is too expensive.
                                    Bad money buys just as good…. Maybe you read in the <hi rend="i">

                                    of the enemy taking fallen [trees?] out of the fort. I was one of those 20, but the
                                    bullets did not come as thickly as the paper said. However, two hours before that a
                                    whole brigade could not do what we twenty men did. The reason was that Mr. Ohio
                                    couldn't get over there because they could not take the fire of the rebels.
                                    When we marched past them, many said, "You will return with very sad
                                    faces." We answered that we drove the rebels out of <placeName>

                                    first rode into the river my back got a little cold. So much about that, as the
                                    papers made such a big thing of it.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Pauline:-</salute>
                        <p>I got your letter of the 3rd of this month a few days ago at [Fayetteville?], just
                                    the evening before w∗e left that place. We went to Huntsville, <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
                                    </placeName>, where we had been before. It is really the most beautiful place I ever
                                    saw. The town is not big, but situated in a beautiful part of the country, beautiful
                                    houses and each house a garden. The streets are full of shade trees, also the
                                    gardens. Water is the best one can get. It is the summer resort of the rich
                                    planters, as you can imagine, a den of rebels. We stayed there only one day. We went
                                    after the Mannes and <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Charlestown</settlement>
                                    </placeName> regiments, and where they were scattered around, we left men there to
                                    round them up and to watch places and bridges. We are stationed at the foot of
                                    mountains and never before have we been in a more dangerous place. The surroundings
                                    are filled with bushwhackers, and one is quite sure to hear the bullets whistle if
                                    he goes half a mile from camp, just to let you know where they come from. But we
                                    often catch them whereas their procedure is a short one. General Rosecrans is really
                                    here. In a few days we will probably cross the <geogName>Tennessee River</geogName>
                                    to chase Mr. Bragg out of Chatanooga. That will mean hot times. However, the rebel
                                    army here can't make a stronghold against ours…. As you saw from
                                    my last letter, I sent you $45. Did you get it? You say you would like to
                                    keep house for yourself. That you can do without me, too. Most likely, there are
                                    enough houses to get in the city. Write soon. I am still not well, but not bad
                                    enough not to do my duty. It is a little hard for me at times, when there is a lot
                                    to do…. Crackers and coffee for breakfast and coffee and crackers for
                                    dinner. Tonight I will have pork! with that, as I slaughtered a pig….</p>

                        <salute>Dear Pauline:-</salute>
                        <p>Your letter reached me just an hour before we crossed the <geogName>Tennessee
                                    River</geogName> near Stevenson and now we are stationed in a camp about 30 miles
                                    southeast of that place. How long we will stay here, I don't know, but
                                    probably not longer than it takes for the whole army to cross the river. You might,
                                    before this letter reaches you, hear of a battle, because the rebels will likely try
                                    to drive us back, but our hope is in God and old Rose. Deserters say Jo
                                        [Johnston?]<hi rend="sup">25</hi> has quite a large army against us. The weather
                                    is very hot during the day and really cold at night. I am well again. Bitters is
                                    good for me….</p>

                        <salute>Dear Pauline:-</salute>
                        <p>Your letter of the 8th of this month I received three days ago, but I had no paper to
                                    answer you sooner. I see you had good luck with your potatoes, but you do not have
                                    to keep any for me, as I doubt very much if we shall see each other before the next
                                    potato harvest comes around. As long as I am here, Mr. Rebel plants potatoes for
                                    me…. We left Bridgeport the first of the month, the day I had written to
                                    you and met the rebel cavalry the next day. They had just burned a train of wagons,
                                    refreshing themselves with the whisky they had found there. Almost all of them were
                                    drunk, about 2000 men. We were only 1100 and 2 cannons. They had six, but we drove
                                    them back very quickly over the mountains, where their headquarters are under
                                    General Weller and 12,000 men and 15 cannons. However, many of them won't
                                    drink whisky any more. We remained one day till the rest of our cavalry joined us,
                                    after which we followed the enemy for twenty days until we drove them finally back
                                    over the <geogName>Tennessee River</geogName>. During this time we had food for only
                                    four days. We had to take food for ourselves and the horses from the farmers, pork
                                    and sweet potatoes, which was all right only our salt was gone and the farmers did
                                    not have this either. So we had to eat meat without salt. One can do anything when
                                    one is hungry. Often we did not have anything to eat for two or three days. We
                                    marched all the time, day and night. We had no more rest than four to five hours at
                                    a time. During the night, we had to slaughter pigs and dig potatoes. We lost about
                                    3500 to 4000 horses, which did not hold out, also about half of our men. I was
                                    sometimes so sleepy that I couldn't stay awake and sat for hours on my
                                    horse asleep. But my horse and I came happily through. He is still fat and brave.
                                    What will happen next we don't know. We are resting here, waiting for fresh
                                    horses….</p>

                                    tent, which I share with three others, I built a fireplace, and now we can sit
                                    around and spit tobacco into the fire. Most likely we will stay here awhile. I would
                                    like you to send me a pair of leather gloves and a pair of pants, as I would have to
                                    pay $4 here for gloves and I have to have some, as it gets pretty cold
                                    here. We are having very cold and rainy weather. You have to send them by mail. I
                                    can't get them through the express. The cost by mail is high but not as
                                    high as if I had to buy them here. If it rains, the water runs from the oilcloth
                                    which we wear over our shoulders down along the pants and into the boots filling
                                    them with water. Be good and send them as soon as possible, and for that I will
                                    store a kiss for you. I won't be unfaithful to you with a negro wench, as
                                    you mentioned in your last letter. Though I live in the negro country, I
                                    haven't changed my opinion of them, only strengthened it. They are not good
                                    for anything, unless driven to work, so you don't need to be afraid that I
                                    will fall in love with them, though it is the case with many soldiers. Yes, men who
                                    have.wives at home get entangled with these black things, who, when you pass them in
                                    summer at the opposite side to the wind, smell so strong that they spoil a white
                                    man's appetite for a week. Things are short here. There is only one
                                    railroad from the north where we get supplies, food, and clothing, and from the
                                    planters, there is. nothing more to be had. They haven't anything anymore
                                    for themselves. Men who had everything in abundance haven't even corn for
                                    bread. It is really sad to see everything in these parts ruined and eaten away. As
                                    you probably saw in the papers, there has been a great change in our army these last
                                    days. Everywhere are new generals, and we also get a new one for Michel. General

                        <p>This minute I received your letter and, as we leave here tomorrow, I hasten to answer
                                    it. I hear we go to Sparta, Tenn. It is near the <geogName>Cumberland
                                    River</geogName> and I hope we will have our winter quarters there. I see that you
                                    are sorry that I may not be back at home by next Spring. When I have served my time,
                                    I will come home, don't be afraid that the $400 which they offer
                                    us to stay will tempt me. Lincoln<hi rend="sup">27</hi> does not have enough money
                                    to keep me longer as a soldier than I am forced to stay. I am already looking
                                    forward to the day when I will again be my own master and not under the rule of
                                    drunken officers. If you could only know how I long to be with you, you
                                    wouldn't write such a letter to me. Should I return from the army happy and
                                    healthy, I will stay with the greatest of joy at home with my family, which is a
                                    little nearer to my heart than an abolition government, or fighting for a bunch of
                                    drunken officers, so they should get well paid. I hope you won't write such
                                    a letter again. I can't tell you for sure when our time is up. Some say in

                                    the night of the 21st to 22nd of this month, I had a dream which I can't
                                    get out of my mind, though, as you know, I do not believe in dreams. I saw Emma [his
                                    daughter] fall into the water and though I tried everything to save her, I could not
                                    get her out of the water. Please, be so good as to let me know whether anything
                                    happened to her or you. I did not get any letter from Stephen <placeName>

                                    </placeName>. I am sure he never wrote to me…. I would like to come home
                                    and make him render an account, but it is impossible to get leave. Anyhow, I have to
                                    hold out here, until my time is up. If God keeps me, I will say good-bye to the
                                    army. I told you in my last letter that I sent you $40. Probably you have
                                    not received it yet. I am, thank God, well and strong, yes, I am what I never was
                                    before in all my life, <hi rend="i">fat.</hi> But there is something I
                                    don't like at all, my hair is getting gray. When we arrived here, we and
                                    also the General thought this would be our last winter quarters, but this morning we
                                    got orders to march, that is, orders to be ready packed any minute. Where we shall
                                    go I don't know, but I heard that the rebel General Wheeler<hi rend="sup">28</hi> and his cavalry has returned again and crossed the <geogName>Tennessee

                    Illustrations, bibliography, and index. $3.00.)</head>
            <p>This is a novel approach to the Lincoln problem—a book about the men and women who wrote
                    about him. Their portraits (the plural is better) for posterity stand out in stronger light when we
                    look through their bifocals and see how and why they wrote. From a variety of sources but chiefly
                    from their own letters Thomas has constructed his book. With humor and understanding he has
                    portrayed the characters and personalities of that strangely assorted group who sought to discover
                    and reveal the true Abraham Lincoln to the American public. Zeal at least was a common trait, and
                    too often it swelled into intolerance and even vindictiveness toward fellow workers in the vineyard,
                    particularly in the generation that knew their subject at first hand.</p>
            <p>The fierce competitive spirit of the business world in these post-Civil War years had its counterpart
                    in the field of Lincoln research and writing. And even the profit motive was not missing from the
                    picture. Poor Herndon, who deserved far more than he ever received, wrote to Weik on one occasion as
                    follows: "The money line is my line &amp; not the glory line. I need the dollars. Glory
                    may go to thunder if I get the dimes &amp; this you ought to know." Henry Clay Whitney
                    hoped for "more than $500 a year" from his book but was badly
                    disappointed. The testy Nicolay complained to Miss Tarbell, when she began her Lincoln researches,
                    that she was invading his field and decreasing the value of his property. The controversies and
                    jealousies of the early biographers, the work of Nicolay and Hay (written under Robert
                    Lincoln's adamant censorship), and the triumph of the romantic, legendary Lincoln over
                    Herndon's earthy hero take up the first six chapters.</p>
            <p>The remaining seven, wherein the realists have their innings, cover the productions of Ida Tarbell,
                    Lord Charnwood, William E. Barton, Albert J. Beveridge, "The Academic
                    Processsion," and Carl Sandburg, with a final chapter called "The Emerging
                    Portrait." The author is rather unsympathetic toward the professional historians and is
                    inclined to <pb n="200" id="VAA4025-044-2-080"/> the view that Lincoln eludes their
                    "prosaic documentation." Sandburg, he believes, has come closest to capturing the
                    real Lincoln, though he lets the poet's reviewers speak for him.</p>
            <p>A bibliography is appended composed of manuscript sources and books and articles about both Lincoln
                    and his biographers. Perhaps the chief omissions are the more recent writings of professional
                    scholars on national aspects of Lincoln's career. This is explained apparently in Chapter
                    XI by the number of such productions.</p>
            <p>The character sketches, the descriptions of the physical appearances of the biographers (helped by
                    drawings by Romaine Proctor), and the accounts of their methods of research and writing make
                    entertaining reading. Paul Angle's <hi rend="i">The Lincoln Reader</hi> and this volume
                    together provide an excellent approach to the vexing Lincoln problem.</p>

            <p>The minuteness and intensity of the interest in Abraham Lincoln is demonstrated by the publication of
                    this small volume about a letter which some have felt was not a genuine Lincoln letter. It also
                    reveals the fascination which some privileged people find in history by studying the evidence on all
                    phases of one of its unsolved problems and by trying to reach a tenable conclusion about it. It is a
                    detective story about a famous American, a story which will repay many different types of readers
                    for their attention.</p>
            <p>The letter which has received so much attention was one which President Lincoln wrote to a widowed
                    mother who was thought to have lost five sons in the federal armies during the Civil War. It was a
                    beautifully worded condolence. The quality of the letter is not lessened by the discoveries that
                    only two of the sons were killed in action, that one was honorably discharged, and that two may have
                    been deserters.</p>
            <p>The author clears away the misstatements about the letter, presents the ascertainable facts about the
                    mother to whom the letter was written, and shows that Nicolay and Hay considered that it was bona
                    fide. He rejects the idea that John Hay wrote it for Lincoln as has been suggested. Furthermore, <pb n="201" id="VAA4025-044-2-081"/> he believes that Hay could not have composed the letter for
                    Lincoln but admits that he cannot prove the point conclusively. Fascimiles that have been
                    manufactured and sold he, together with John Hay, regards as forgeries.</p>
            <p>The book is an enjoyable piece of reading, which reveals a little of the depth of Lincoln's
                    character.</p>

               <hi rend="i">A Bibliography of George Ade, 1866-1944.</hi> By Dorothy Ritter Russo. (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana Historical Society, 1947, pp. xv, 314. Illustrations and index.)</head>
            <p>In the year of George Ade's death the Committee on Bibliography of the Indiana Historical
                    Society sponsored the publication of a bibliography of James Whitcomb Riley. Under the editorship of
                    Anthony J. Russo and Dorothy R. Russo, this volume appeared in handsome format and became
                    immediately not only a useful literary tool but a collector's item. Now, three years later,
                    Mrs. Russo has edited a bibliography of George Ade which in appearance and general value rivals its
                    predecessor.</p>
            <p>To be of maximum utility a bibliography must meet several requirements. It should be clearly
                    arranged, consistently presented, meticulously checked. Chronological order should be maintained
                    within each section, works about as well as works by the author should be accurately listed, and an
                    overall index should be included. It should go without saying that clear typography on good paper
                    stock adds to the merit of the completed volume.</p>
            <p>On almost all these counts Mrs. RUSSO'S volume is a superlative achievement. Physically
                    attractive, it is both detailed and comprehensive. A section of 154 pages is given over to
                    descriptions of George Ade first editions, and a section of 100 pages to the periodicals in which
                    Ade items first appeared. Other sections list reprint editions of Ade's works and enumerate
                    books and periodical articles containing discussions of Ade. Conventional bibliographical practice
                    probably justifies the omission of any biographical data, but one wonders if a short sketch of
                    Ade's life with important dates included would not augment the value of such a book as
                    this.</p>
            <p>To the reader who knows George Ade only as the man who discovered a new kind of fable or as the
                    writer of several comic operas which won considerable popularity almost half <pb n="202" id="VAA4025-044-2-082"/> a century ago, the number of Ade's published volumes will come
                    as a surprise. Hardly a year passed between 1894 and 1940 which did not see the appearance of one or
                    more Ade books. The editor has faithfully chronicled all these publications and has abstained from
                    distinguishing the few durable items from the many ephemeral works. The reprinting of Ade's
                    stories has not been followed as carefully, however, as the compilation of other sections of the
                    bibliography. Thus there is no mention of the appearance of "Effie Whittlesy" in
                        <hi rend="i">The Bedside Book of Famous American Stories</hi> compiled by Angus Burrell and
                    Bennett Cerf in 1936, nor of the inclusion by E. B. White and Katharine S. White or three Ade fables
                    in their <hi rend="i">Subtreasury of American Humor</hi> in 1941.</p>
            <p>The index too shows certain aberrations. In general it is full and adequate, but there is a strange
                    tendency to list some persons under their given names and again more fully under their last names.
                    Newton Booth Tarkington, listed under "N," has one item following, but
                    "Tarkington, Booth," has eight entries. John T. McCutcheon, listed under
                    "J," has two entries following, but "McCutcheon, John T." has
                    eighteen, including the first two. James Corbett, Joe Cannon, and John Ringling are all listed under
                    "J" as well as under their last names. "Crane, William H." is
                    followed by two entries, whereas "William H. Crane" gets only one. Such indexing
                    is probably neither harmful nor bothersome, but it does seem eccentric.</p>
            <p>The book suggests another remark in which the editor will probably concur. Ade merits more scholarly
                    attention than he has received. Only one full-length biography has so far appeared, and it is more
                    accolade than evaluation. There have been few serious studies of Ade in the periodicals even if one
                    adds John Abbott Clark's appreciation of the fables in the <hi rend="i">South Atlantic
                        Quarterly</hi> for October, 1947, which probably appeared too late for inclusion here. Ade is
                    not even mentioned in Lewis Leary's checklist of articles on American literature which
                    appeared in the periodicals from 1920 to 1945 (Durham, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, 1947). The Russo bibliography then, a monument to George Ade the man, indicates the
                    need for further investigation of Ade the writer.</p>

                    </placeName>. He formed his political principles as a follower of Henry Clay, and, once having
                    formed them, he did not desert them. He opposed the agitation of the slavery issue, but was too much
                    of a nationalist to permit the division of the Union. During the war he became a Republican because
                    the efforts of the old line Whigs to form a permanent Constitutional Union party had failed. As
                    commandant of Camp Dick Thompson near <placeName>

                    party year after year and occasionally held office in the legislature or in Congress. Desiring an
                    Indiana man in his cabinet, President Hayes named Thompson the secretary of the navy. The secretary
                    supported his chief on the issues of reconciliation with the South, the reform of the civil service,
                    and in his veto of measures attached to appropriation bills, but was not so insistent upon
                    "sound" currency. He gave the navy a conscientious businesslike administration.
                    Before the end of Hayes' presidency, he resigned from the cabinet to become the highly paid
                    secretary of the American committee for the French Panama Canal Company, in other words a
                    propagandist and lobbyist. After resigning in 1889, he lived on as the Grand Old Man of the Party

                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, has written a very acceptable biography. It seems to be well-documented with published
                    sources, contemporary newspapers, manuscript material left by Thompson, and some other miscellaneous
                    records. This must be ascertained from the preface and the footnotes as a bibliography is not
                    included in the work. The author is restrained and critical in his judgment. He thinks highly of
                    Dick Thompson, but does not picture him as "a statesman of the first rank." He
                    considers his correction with the Panama Canal Company unfortunate. He regards him as a conservative
                    and as a provincial, <pb n="204" id="VAA4025-044-2-084"/> but a man of culture, of ability, and of
                    principles. His career helps one to understand the development of Indiana.</p>
            <p>The book is written in a clear readable style, it is handsomely printed, and the editorial work and
                    proofreading have been carefully done. If the opening genealogy seems a little pointless and
                    confused, the remainder of the volume is free of these defects. It is a welcome addition to the
                    historical literature of Indiana.</p>

            <p>The proceedings of the executive division of the new state of Indiana were recorded for six years in
                    the book used by the secretary of the territory. They were recorded in chronological order. When a
                    new book was opened in 1823, the secretary began a topical arrangement of records. The second book
                    was filled by 1836. The records here reprinted are those contained in these two volumes. The
                    arrangement of the material is also determined by the methods used in making the original entries. A
                    little less than half of the pages of the records are devoted to the appointments and to acts
                    relating to individual counties. An index requires almost two hundred pages with two columns to the
                    page. The book gives ample evidence of the careful work of the editor.</p>
            <p>The minute information given about the operation of the state government will be of value to
                    historians and political scientists. The very large number of persons whose names are included and
                    the statements about the offices they held will be a mine of information for local historians and
                    genealogists.</p>

            <p>The General Assembly of Indiana in 1935 provided for a commission to ascertain and fix the route of

                    searched the field notes of the men who made the rectangular surveys before the federal government
                    sold the land. The report of the commission to the governor was used by Miss Thornbrough in
                    preparing this article. The appendix contains the information found in the surveyor's notes
                    and five detailed maps showing the route of the trace.</p>
            <p>The authors, after reprinting a table of distances given in Darby's <hi rend="i">Emigrant
                        Guide</hi>, followed by means of their writings various persons who traveled over the trace to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Among these are the Indian agent George Croghan, the Revolutionary General George
                    Rogers Clark, historian John Filson, General Josiah Harmar, and the Moravian missionary John
                    Heckewelder. Other chapters describe the carriage of the mail over the route, the purchase of Indian
                    lands along the trace, the work of the surveyors, the affect of the slowness of the mails upon the <placeName>

            <p>No serious slips or errors mar the pleasure of the reader in following the history of this famous
                    road. The use of the field notes of the suveyors and the writings of travelers effectively recreates
                    the old trace of territorial days as settlers came to take up land in southwestern Indiana. Had the
                    quotations taken from the various travel accounts been longer, the usefulness of the publication
                    might have been increased.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Great Northwest</hi>, the latest Knopf book on the history of the Far West, is
                    obviously meant to replace another such work—-George W. Fuller's <hi rend="i">A
                        History of the Pacific Northwest</hi>, published in 1931. The later book, however, though no
                    doubt indebted to its predecessor, is far from being a "rewrite" of the Fuller
                    book; it is new in plan and in spirit, and is informed by the latest historical scholarship in the
                    field with which it deals. Nor do the differences end here, for whereas Fuller has used conventional
                    headings and a subdued tone, Winther has adopted pungent titles and a nervous style. Still other
                    characteristics distinguish <hi rend="i">The Great Northwest</hi> from Fuller's book, not
                    the least important of which is <pb n="206" id="VAA4025-044-2-086"/> the more extensive treatment
                    Winther's book gives to the recent history of the Pacific Northwest. To the curious,
                    therefore, these two books will afford an interesting study in contrasts, for they reflect the
                    differing moods of two eras.</p>
            <p>To summarize the history of the Pacific Northwest in fewer than three hundred and fifty pages is a
                    task that might well give pause to any scholar, yet Winther has courageously attempted that very
                    thing. Long years of preparation are behind this undertaking, during which time the author, besides
                    establishing himself as an authority on the history of transportation in the Far West, acquired a
                    broad knowledge of the whole field of Far Western history by compiling a useful <hi rend="i">Guide</hi> to the periodical literature of the Trans-<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> West. That he should have been chosen to write the present book is, therefore, a matter
                    of no surprise. To say that he has done less than a perfect job amounts to saying no more than that,
                    given the magnitude of the task and the paucity of monographic studies on certain aspects of the
                    subject, no one could now write a compendious history of the Pacific Northwest that would be
                    entirely satisfactory. Despite its shortcomings, <hi rend="i">The Great Northwest</hi> has taken its
                    place as the leading book in its field.</p>
            <p>Winther has exploited to good advantage the scholarly books and articles on Pacific Northwest history
                    that have appeared since 1931. Recent studies of Northwest Indians, of <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName>, and of the early religious history of the Pacific Northwest, together with his own
                    studies of transportation and the studies of others in the economics, political, and cultural
                    development of that region, are reflected more or less adequately in the pages of his book. Although
                    he has incorporated much material on recent aspects of the history of the Pacific Northwest, the
                    later chapters of his book are perhaps the least satisfactory ones. They do not give the reader an,
                    altogether clear understanding of how the Pacific Northwest came to be what it is today. Perhaps it
                    is too soon to expect so much.</p>
            <p>After saying so much that is favorable about <hi rend="i">The Great Northwest</hi>, the reviewer
                    regrets that he must call attention to the fact that Winther did himself less than justice in making
                    the final revision of his manuscript. His book is marred by numerous errors of fact and by not a few
                    defects of style. His account of Lewis and Clark's movements west of the Divide is, to say
                    the least, ambiguous (p. 88); his specific mention <pb n="207" id="VAA4025-044-2-087"/> of Vernon L.
                    Parrington and Frederick M. Padleford as eminent scholars at the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> is hardly fair to J. Allen Smith, who is not so mentioned (p. 344); his reference to
                    the Pacific Northwest as "the last frontier" is inadmissable (p. 162); his belief
                    that the Northern Pacific Railroad runs "over Snoqualmie Pass" is ill-founded (p.
                    165); his calling Isaac I. Stevens "Congressman" rather than
                    "Delegate" is inexact (p. 166); his assertion that the Milwaukee Railroad is
                    "all-electric" west of Harlowtown is not true (p. 271); his statements that the
                    Congress "assumed the right" to lay down conditions for the admission of a
                    territory to statehood is not defensible, for the Constitution gives the Congress that right (p.
                    252); and, finally, his reference to Lewis B. Schwellenbach as a former Republican senator from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> will no doubt annoy President Truman (p. 324). Equally regrettable are certain defects
                    of style. These defects range from ambiguities, through faulty constructions, to downright wrong
                    uses of words. Typographical errors exist, but are not numerous (pp. 23, 56, 98, 126, 156, 244,
                    317). One suspects that the mordant wit of a compositor is responsible for the appearance in one
                    place of the name Alfred Powers as "Allied Powers" (p. 126).</p>
            <p>This book is attractively printed, beautifully illustrated, and handsomely bound. Its bibliography,
                    though far from being exhaustive, has been assembled, chapter by chapter, with a nice sense of
                    discrimination. One may regret, though, that helpful guides, such, for example, as Charles W.
                    Smith's <hi rend="i">Pacific Northwest Americana</hi>, were not included, and that Oliver
                    W. Nixon's <hi rend="i">How Marcus Whitman Saved <placeName>

                        </placeName>
               </hi> was included. But these slips are, after all, matters of no great consequence.
                    College students and even more mature readers will find that Winther's references will lead
                    then far along the way to a satisfactory understanding of Pacific Northwest history.</p>

                    government; 93 pages of written observations by the governments of Albania, Mexico,

                    </placeName>, which—though not members of the conference—were invited to
                    present their views; 19 pages of summaries of the oral discussions in the plenary sessions of the
                    conference, in the course of which the views of twenty of the twenty-one participating governments
                    are set forth; 193 pages of reports of various commissions; and 40 pages of recommendations of the
                    conference to the Council of Foreign Ministers on what the final treaty with <placeName>
                        <country reg="it">Italy</country>
                    </placeName> should include. The peace treaties with the other states are handled in a similar
                    manner.</p>
            <p>It might be thought that one who patiently plodded his way through all these pages would gain a full
                    and accurate knowledge of the genesis of the peace treaties. This, however, is not true, for the
                    volume does not include any documents on the discussions within the Council of Foreign Ministers
                    while the draft treaties were being prepared. In fact, this volume does not give the reader even the
                    actual terms of the treaties which the defeated powers accepted, for the peace conference merely
                    made recommendations to the Council of Foreign Ministers, which late in 1946 itself decided upon the
                    final terms. This lack of full information is the inevitable consequence of the limited scope of the
                    volume, which deals only with the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> Peace Conference. But it might be thought that the reader would at any rate gain at
                    least a full picture of what occurred at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> conference. Even this, however, is not true, for the documents were <hi rend="i">selected</hi> and parts of the story are sometimes missing. For instance, the proceedings of
                    the first plenary session of the conference, when the smaller states vainly attempted to revolt
                    against domination by the Big Four, are omitted. And of the discussions in the Commission on
                    Procedure, where the smaller states again sought to prevent domination by the Big Four, the only
                    document included is an address by Byrnes, which hardly gives the full picture.</p>
            <pb n="209" id="VAA4025-044-2-089"/>
            <p>Nevertheless, despite its limitations, the volume does provide a great deal of valuable information
                    regarding what occurred at the peace conference. To acquire this information, however, the reader
                    must pay a price in eye strain, for the documents presented are photographic reproductions of the
                    originals which were distributed in <placeName>

            <byline>Russell H. Anderson<hi rend="sup">∗</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>As an introduction to a discussion cf the genealogical department of the Western Reserve Historical
                    Society Library, some account of the Society and its collections may be of interest. It was founded
                    in 1867 and from that time to 1898 it occupied expanding quarters on the Public Square in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>. From 1898 to 1941 it was located at University Circle, 107th and Euclid. The Society
                    moved to its present quarters, two large Florentine style residences on East Boulevard, opposite
                    Wade Park, in 1939 and 1941. One of these seventy-room buildings houses the historical museum and
                    the other the library.</p>
            <p>From its founding to 1913, the Society continued as a kind of semi-professional organization but did
                    some collecting and publishing in a very creditable manner. On that date, the first full time
                    director, Wallace H. Cathcart, was appointed. His experience had been in the rare-book field, and he
                    had a collector's feeling for books. Much of the present collection is due to his work.
                    Elbert J. Benton, professor of history and dean of the Graduate School of Western Reserve
                    University, succeeded him and served as director until his death in March, 1946. The
                    writer's incumbency dates from January, 1947.</p>
            <p>The stated object of the Society was "to discover, procure, and preserve whatever relates to
                    the history, biography, genealogy, antiquity and statistics connected with the City of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the Western Reserve, and generally what relates to the history of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and the Great West." While the Society carries the name Western Reserve and is
                    charged from with concern over that area, it has never confined its activities to the Western
                    Reserve alone but has viewed quite seriously the last phrases giving its purposes, and has taken <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, the Northwest, and American history generally, especially the nineteenth century, and
                    American genealogy as its field. Strangely enough, one will find certain non-American <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="212" id="VAA4025-044-2-092"/> materials there—world exploration, Napoleana, and
                    English history for example—but these items have been windfalls generally, and much
                    energy is not being expended in those directions.</p>
            <p>The over-all resources of the library consist of about two hundred thousand books, perhaps one
                    hundred thousand pamphlets, some twenty thousand volumes of newspapers, about one thousand rolls of
                    microfilm, a fairly extensive collection of maps and atlases, and something like a million
                    manuscripts. To mention a few of the areas of subject matter, there is much material on both sides
                    of the Civil War, a more extensive Lincoln collection than one might expect, a good collection of
                    American travels, much railroad material, and a fairly good Indian section, besides a large body of
                    local history materials. In addition, there are the broader fields, such things as pictures, medals,
                    and by a large margin, the best collection of broken-bank currency in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>It is generally understood that the genealogical section of the Western Reserve Historcial Society
                    Library is the sixth in rank in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Probably it can be justly claimed to give unusual service. This section of the library
                    is in charge of Mrs. Emma Hawley, a professional genealogist of long experience.</p>
            <p>The materials in this section are on open shelves, which greatly facilitates genealogical work.
                    Besides the usual bibliographical aids such as catalogues and indexes, Mrs. Hawley is there to
                    advise patrons regarding the most likely sources and methods of procedure. Years of experience have
                    enabled her to direct the search into the most likely channels and to put her finger on a multitude
                    of facts of interest. The "usual library service," which is freely given, has been
                    extended to an unusual length. Obviously, it is not possible to do extended research on a free
                    reference basis.</p>
            <p>The area of greatest interest and activity for any genealogical library is always a wedge facing in
                    the direction from which the people in its area have come. In this case, the wedge extends from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> to the northeast and southeast and covers the states of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, especially <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>, <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>, <region type="state" reg="nju">New

               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. The apex reaches back into Indiana and northern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, but the activity in that direction usually relates to residents there whose ancestors
                    came through <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> on <pb n="213" id="VAA4025-044-2-093"/> the way west. Only occasionally does one find a
                    Clevelander who has drifted back eastward from this area. There is a minor interest in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Of particular interest in this work are the family histories. Of these the library has some thirteen
                    thousand. It is, of course, difficult to localize these since they cut across state and regional
                    lines. In consequence, however, of the intense interest in genealogy in New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, inspired by the aura of the Mayflower and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Concord, more of them concern this section than any other. This section is
                    constantly growing, largely by gifts, but the family history appetite of a genealogist is
                    insatiable.</p>
            <p>County histories have long been used by the general historian with some reserve, but they have proved
                    of great value to the genealogist. The coverage of county histories by states is as follows: <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, probably complete; <placeName>

                    </placeName>, good; <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, complete; <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName>, almost complete; <placeName>

                        <country reg="riu">Rhode Island</country>
                    </placeName>, fair; <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName>, good; <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, good; <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, fairly good; <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName>, good. The library, unfortunately, has only a moderate number of county histories of
                    Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Throughout there is a certain but varying amount of general and local history, which is useful. Of
                    this type of material the greatest amount naturally concerns the immediate homeland of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, especially the Western Reserve, and this is of the greatest use. All libraries, of
                    course, slant their classification and their shelving to fit their peculiar needs. This library does
                    the same and much of the local history materials are oriented with reference to their use in
                    genealogy.</p>
            <p>There are, of course, the bibliographical aids peculiar to genealogy, the indexes, lists, rosters,
                    etc. To list many of these, which every genealogical library might be expected to have, is much like
                    saying that Western Reserve has a dictionary and the <hi rend="i">World Almanac.</hi> And yet, if
                    one proposes to use the library, one may wish to be assured even regarding the stand-bys. Among

            <p>Since many Hoosiers might wish to trace their ancestry through a generation which lived in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, there may be an interest in something further on the local history material of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Among the most useful items in this field are the Census Records of 1850 for the State
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. This was the first <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Census to list the names, ages, and nativity of all persons. The usefulness of this
                    information is obvious and the microfilm record in twenty rolls is in frequent use by the
                    genealogist and the public. It may be well to add, for the <pb n="215" id="VAA4025-044-2-095"/>
                    benefit of those who are not familiar with this detail, that the Reference Division of the National
                    Archives in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> has the census records, so far as they exist for 1850, 1860, and 1870. One may inspect
                    any of them there—nearly all are in the original—or one may, by arrangement
                    with working genealogists there, have a search made of any county for a fee. Photostatic copies of
                    any of these pages may be had for a reasonable price.</p>
            <p>The library has many of the marriage records of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. These are being copied by counties by the D.A.R., and the work is to be continued.
                    These names are alphabetized by name of the husband and wife and typed for use. In addition the
                    library has many of the cemetery records, especially in the Western Reserve. Then there are the
                    county histories mentioned above and innumerable town histories, lodge and church records, poll
                    lists, land records, letters, and "other items too numerous to
                    mention"—as the sale bills put it.</p>
            <p>Just a word about English and Continental European genealogy. The library considers this outside of
                    its field and it has almost nothing for the continent. By agreement, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> Public Library, which ranks well among the scholarly public libraries, has built up a
                    collection of material invaluable to the English genealogist, i.e. archaeological and historical
                    publications, lineages, etc.—although they do not do genealogical work themselves. It
                    happens, by accident or earlier design, that the Western Reserve Historical Society Library has a
                    fair amount of English genealogical material of this kind. A list of some of these items, follows
                    which anyone is welcome to use, although the library would not presume to offer professional
                    assistance or bibliographical completeness in this field. Some two hundred and fifty volumes of
                    parish marriage registers; William Musgrave, <hi rend="i">Obituary prior to 1800</hi>, five volumes;
