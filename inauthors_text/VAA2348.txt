            	CHAPTER
                Constable Plum's son-in-law, who's a meter reader, never knew what liquor tasted
                    like till th' country went dry.
                An' optimist is a feller that still carries an opener on his key ring.
                Some fellers are like a hen, fer ther allus gittin' credit fer somethin' they
                    couldn' help doin'.
                Mrs. Tilford Moots' nephew starved t' death yesterday on a pre-war salary.
                
                Who remembers when it used t' please folks t' make 'em feel at home?
                Beauty is only Georgette waist deep.
                Some women are so anxious t' be different that they boast that they kin cook.
                Mail carrier Leslie Timberlake wuz entombed by fallin' army bacon t' day.
                Th' poorest economy we know of is a home-made sign.
                
                "It's almost impossible t' keep th' table up these days without
                    wearin' cotton stockin's," said Mrs. Lafe Bud t' day.
                Pinky Kerr has got so he kin take bay rum without th' shave.
                If an ole woman lived in a shoe t'day she'd go broke keeping th' property
                    up.
                "I've knowed actors t' walk back, but I never knowed 'em
                    t' walk out," says Pinky Kerr, who has traveled with several troupes.
                
                Th' fellers that struck at th' saw mill, Thursday, motored back t' work
                    this mornin'.
                Most o' th' girls that come out o' beauty shops look like they
                    hadn' been waited on.
                "Now's a dandy time t' git a divorce on failure t'
                    provide," said Mrs. Lafe Bud, t'day.
                Our idee of a trained nurse is one that comes when we push th' buzzer.
                
                Mrs. Lafe Bud has struck fer a ten per cent. increase on her weekly allowance an'
                    th' abolition o' breakfast.
                Some folks ought t' buy a movin' van an' cut windows in it an'
                    settle down.
                It used t' be "What?" "Huh?" "What'd
                    ye say?" but now its mostly "Beg pardon?"
                Our shoe dealers are advertisin' fer help t' gather th' harvest.
                Most o' th' worst trials o' life are out o' court.
                
                
                Some folks git further on promises than most of us do on money.
                
                Who remembers when th' worst thing you could call a feller wuz a horse thief?
                What's become o' th' feller that wuz afraid somebuddy would see him go in
                    a saloon an' afraid that everbuddy in town wouldn' see him come out?
                Th' kaiser is raisin' a beard which looks like he wuz gittin' ready
                    t' sneak back into Germany as an umbrella mender.
                A girl that's all right don't need a phony complexion in her business.
                
                Sometimes a marriage is such a failure that a feller 'll find himself payin' on his
                    weddin' clothes an his alimony out o' th' same weekly salary.
                Who remembers th' ole penny mackerel?
                Money never made a fool o' anybuddy; it only shows 'em up.
                Madame Neuralgi th' palmist, told Miss Tawney Apple that she'd marry a round,
                    florid promoter an' live with her mother.
                
                You kin git any woman's undivided attention by tellin' her about somebuddy
                    that's unhappy.
                Amy Moots an' her husband git along jest fine. He travels on th' road an'
                    she lives with her mother.
                "I believe I'll go t' church t'morrow unless it's a nice
                    day," said Tell Binkley, Saturday.
                Th' ole-fashioned feller that used t' hunt another job when he didn' make
                    enough t' suit him how has a son who walks out.
            
            
            
                MRS. TILFORD MOOTS REMINISCENCES.
                
                    "I Want You T' Look Like Other Women."
                
                Ther's been an awful change in house cleanin' since I wuz first married.
                    T'day you jest run over th' furniture with a oiled rag, shake a few rugs,
                    an' run th' vacuum back o' th' Victroly, an' the
                    job's done. I wish I had a nickel fer ever' time I carried a stove out t'
                    th' barn. I had a beautiful back when I wuz first married, but it begun t' sag  with my first house cleanin'. I heerd somethin'
                    crack th' first time I tried t' lift th' bureau an' kick
                    th' carpet out from under it, an' my back got round from then on. I used
                    t' shove th' furniture from one room t' another at house
                    cleanin' time. Then I'd pull th' carpet tacks an' take up
                    th' carpet an' hang it out t' beat. Then I'd take th'
                    straw off th' floor an' burn it. Then I'd shovel th' dirt out.
                    Then I'd scrub th' floor with soft soap. Th' funny thing about it all is
                    that when I look back I can't see my husband anywhere. I don't remember
                    o' him ever bein' around even when I carried th' stove out t'
                    th' barn. I cleaned all th' rooms th' same way. When I'd carry
                    th' stoves out t' th' barn I'd grease 'em t'
                    keep 'em from rustin'. In th' fall I'd polish 'em,
                    an' carry 'em back. I recall how I flushed with pride when my husband would look
                    at 'em admirin'ly an' say, 'Hello, you've bought some
                    new stoves'. Tackin' down carpets wuz a terrible job. What movin'  bureaus an' carryin' stoves didn' do
                    t' my form th' carpet stretcher did. Th' most villainous implement ever
                    introduced int' th' home wuz th' carpet stretcher. I'd rather
                    whitewash a dozen ceilin's than touch one. You couldn' have purty knees
                    an' put down a carpet. It took all th' sponginess out o' mine. It wuz a
                    pleasure t' wash lace curtains an' hook 'em on th'
                    stretchin' frames an' I never tired o' it, an' it wuz a little
                    pleasant diversion t' walk down t' th' livery stable an' git
                    th' bed ticks filled with straw an' carry 'em home. You'd allus
                    meet somebuddy you knew t' talk to. But puttin' down a carpet flattened your knees
                    an' threw ever' line in your body out o' gear. Ever' bed slat in
                    th' house used t' be scrubbed separately an' stood in th' sun
                    t' dry. I have allus loved t' paint th' barn, but I never felt safe
                    standin' on a rockin' chair an' hangin' a picture. My husband
                    must surely have been around when I used t' move th' organ, but t' save
                    my life  I can't remember it. Th' organ wuz as heavy
                    as a safe an' had no casters, an' ther wuz jest a certain way it would go
                    thro' th' hall door. Then I allus repapered th' wood box twice a year,
                    an' cleaned th' cistern. Believe me, when I got thro' scrubbin'
                    an' rubbin' an' climbin' an' crawlin'
                    an' tuggin' an' whitewashin' an' stretchin'
                    an' tackin' our home smelled like a clean towel. I recall so vividly how proud I
                    used t' feel when my husband would turn up as if by magic, an' say,
                    'Emmy, you're a great little girl. Here's some change; buy yourself a new
                    calico dress. I want you t' look like other women.'
            
            
            
            	CHAPTER
                What's become o' th' ole time shoulder braces covered with little pulleys
                    that squeaked ever' time you moved?
                Joe Mapes, who wuz arrested last week fer givin' away a quart o' liquor, has been
                    adjudged insane.
                Between those who today after 'em an' those who hate 'em th' rich
                    have a purty hard time.
                Miss Fawn Lippencut has a handsome new two-piece votin' suit.
                
                Constable Newt Plum broke three quarts out of a possible four in a runnin' gun fight with a
                    boot legger Saturday night.
                Who remembers when a feller wuz as proud of a new patch as he wuz a new suit?
                Meter reader Joe Lark is takin' th' gold cure.
                What's become o' th' feller that used t' git shaved jest
                    t' git a chance t' read the Police Gazette?
                
                
                Farmer Joe Sapp has a letter from his son sayin' he'll return if his father
                    'll cut down production.
                
                "Ole Burleson's th' limit," said Mrs. Lafe Bud, t'day,
                    when her husband handed her a letter he'd been carryin' fer a week.
                Th' hardest thing is t' git some one t' agree with you on a resemblance.
                Who remembers when women used t' step out o' ther skirts instead o' squirm
                    out o' them?
                "What I like about th' Ford is that you kin hear th' door slam with your
                    ears covered," said Miss Tawney Apple, yisterday.
                
                Some fellers are such gladhanders that they kin even make sudden adversity feel that ther glad
                    t' meet him.
                Some fellers seem t' shave jest t' use th' violet talcum.
                Ther's few things as short as th' popularity of a new resturint.
                Lafe Bud carries his own toothpicks 'cause so many places where he eats fergit t'
                    put 'em on th' table.
                Mrs. Tipton Bud received a can o' government beans t'day that'd been
                    opened by mistake.
                
                When a farmer an' his family move t' town ther new neighbors git t'gether
                    an' set a date fer them t' starve t' death.
                Ther's many a slip 'twixt th' suitcase an' th' lip.
                It's a good thing fer most of us that ther's no discrimination again'
                    those who say "discrimunate."
                A knocker allus starts in by sayin' he doesn' want t' knock.
                
                
                Our home-comin' celebration wuz th' biggest jollification we ever had. Who said no
                    booze, no enthuse?
                
                An idle tongue gits in its work.
                Lem Smiley, who never had a chance on earth, is now a mail clerk on a airplane.
                Next t' takin' your business worries home th' worst thing is
                    bringin' your domestic troubles downtown.
                "I don't know what a feller's goin' t' do, they give you
                    too much at a cafe an' not enough at th' restaurints," said Tell Binkley
                    t'day.
                
                Have you ever noticed how hard folks 'll work at somethin' mean?
                Tell Binkley starts on a fishin' trip at 4 o'clock in th' mornin'
                    an' he's hired a motorcyclist t' wake him up.
                Exbartender Joe Lease is presidin' at th' Alcazar pharmacy sody fountain
                    an' likes it real well 'cept he don't find as many umbrellas as he used
                    to.
                Nothin' ever shrinks when you count on it.
                
                Another argument 'gainst corsets is that a gypsy woman died at th' age o'
                    102 years at Meadville, Pa., last week.
                Speakin' o' th' hall o' mirrors, what's become
                    o' th' feller that used t' like t' watch himself git stewed?
                We know who wakes us up, but who wakes th' motorcyclist up?
                "Well, we still have women an' song, but who wants t' sing? said Lafe Bud
                    t'day.
            
            
            
                HASTY ARRESTS.
                
                    Tilford Moots
                
                Tilford Moots, one of our most prominent an' highly trusted citizens, ex-sheriff o'
                    th' county, long a leader o' th' dry forces, an' president
                    o' th' Good Citizens League, an' active in lodge work, wuz arrested by
                    Federal officers near midnight Thursday while tryin' t' load a sugar barrel on a
                    bicycle back o' th' livery stable. He wuz greatly surprised when placed under
                    arrest an' could not account fer th' fifty-eight quarts o' liquor
                    bein' in th' barrel. He said he had long intended t' lay in his
                    winter's sugar an' selected Thursday night 'cause it wuz cool
                    an' th' streets wuz not congested. Mr. Moots only smiled when asked if he had  any other statement t' make. Later he is said t'
                    have told close friends that at th' proper time it would be shown that th' Federal
                    officers had acted hastily.
                Hon. Finley Newcomb, pustmaster durin' both th' Cleveland administrations, a
                    director o' th' Bean Blossom Trust Company, organist in the local church,
                    an' ardent advocate o' Jug-Slav independence, wuz taken int' custody by
                    Federal officers as he alighted from a light car at th' edge o' town jest at dark
                    last night with two suit cases. Mr. Newcomb expressed great surprise when confronted by th'
                    officers an' stubbornly maintained that he wuz just returnin' from Niagary Falls.
                    Twenty-four quarts in all, partly gin, wuz confiscated. Later in a statement t' a friend he
                    said that he thought th' suit cases seemed unusually heavy, but that he concluded it wuz
                    owin' t' his tired condition an' gave th'  matter no further thought. Still later he only smiled when asked if he anticipated any
                    trouble in clearin' his good name.

                    an' prominent an' well-t'-do, an' one o' th'
                    most uncompromisin' Republicans o' which ther's any knowledge,
                    an' one o' th' most highly regarded men hereabouts, wuz arrested by
                    Federal officers at midnight Friday as he wuz leavin' his home by an outside cellar door.
                    He wuz perfectly dumbfounded when charged with violatin' th' liquor laws. This
                    mornin' th' liquor wuz removed from his cellar 
                    t' th' jail by th' Ike Soles Truckin' Co., th'
                    successful bidder. Mr. Angel furnished bond an' wuz released. He refused to discuss his
                    arrest further than t' say that it would be shown that a great mistake had been made
                    an' that he regretted th' loss of his liquor. Later he only smiled.
                Leslie Aiken, former missionary t' Siam, an' well known an'
                    pop'lar, an' well off an' prominent, an' well read an'
                    traveled, wuz surrounded in an abandoned smoke house on th' ole Moots farm at an early hour
                    t'day an' taken int' custody fer violatin' th' Federal
                    liquor laws. Mr. Aiken expressed great surprise upon bein' arrested. Five hundred
                    an' fifty-one quarts an' nineteen hundred half pints o' liquor wuz found
                    in th' smoke house. Mr. Aiken furnished cash bond an' presented each o'
                    th' officers with a quart o' bonded  liquor. He had
                    numerous callers later in th' day at his home an' t' one an' all
                    he expressed th' opinion that he would have no difficulty at all in provin' his
                    innocence an' showin' that th' whole affair wuz a frame up. Frequently
                    durin' his talk with friends he smiled, an' on one occasion he laughed aloud.

                Th' feller that takes his hat off an' scratches his head is sure t' git
                    left these fast times.

                BEAUTIFUL HOMELY WEDDIN'.
                
                    Miss Pearl Pash and Mr. Fern Moon Before Takin'.
                
                A beautiful homely weddin' wuz solemnized at th' farm o' Uncle Ezra Pash,
                    late Friday afternoon, when his niece, Miss Pearl Pash, wuz joined in holy wedlock with Mr. Fern
                    Moon. Miss Em Pash, sister o' th' bride, assisted, while Mr. Artie Small wuz by
                    fer th' best man. Th' mantle piece, built durin' th' reign
                    o' President  Grant, wuz banked with woodland flowers
                    an' th' decorations elicited th' most favorable comments. The bride wore
                    a heavy, brocaded watered silk dress which her mother wuz wedded in durin' th'
                    battle o' Signal Mountain, th' jet ornaments on th' same havin'
                    been brought across th' Allegheny mountains by rugged pioneers, as wuz also th'
                    heavy chiseled bracelet which adorned her shapely wrist. Altogether it wuz a happy
                    comminglin' o' romance an' history. Th' groom stood with his
                    cauliflower ear t' th' wall an' wore a beautiful, becomin'
                    two-piece suit of electric blue serge with two pairs o' trousers. He looked ever'
                    inch a man, while ther wuz no doubt about th' lovely bride at his side. Some trouble wuz
                    had findin' th' ring, but it finally turned up snugged away in th'
                    groom's buttoned hip pocket where he'd put it fer safety. Rev. Wiley Tanger spoke
                    th' words which increased Mr. Moon's responsibilities about seventy per cent. Dr.
                    Tanger said he hoped th' young groom  would shoulder his new
                    burdens as cheerfully as he had shouldered a musket when his country conscripted him t'
                    come t' its defense at Hattiesburg. He praised th' courage o'
                    th' groom in takin' a bride at a time when rents an' food were out
                    o' sight, an' in th' face o' th' fact that he wuz not
                    unionized. He added that it would require th' very strongest mutual attachment t'
                    tide over th' high cost of livin.' "I've watched th'
                    bride since childhood an' ther is not a lazy bone in her body," said Dr. Tanger.
                    Th' cake used fer th' weddin' supper contained th' whites
                    o' twenty-one eggs, breakin' all former weddin' cake records so fer as
                    known. Th' yolks o' th' same wuz utilized fer French toast which wuz much
                    relished by those whose good fortune it wuz t' be in on th' weddin'
                    supper. Many costly presents, including a slab o' bacon, wuz received by th' happy
                    couple. The bride is pop'lar an' fer some years she has been th'

                    th' groom. Mr. Moon is unsettled, but has a number o' things in view. He wuz
                    formerly employed in th' Acme brick yards, but th' army has broadneed him
                    an' he will probably organize. Th' happy pair departed fer th' East after
                    supper amid a shower o' rice, most o' which wuz salvaged. Both have a chain
                    o' relatives runnin' as fer east as Sharonville, Pennsylvania, an'
                    'll proceed by easy stages. They do not know where they'll be at home after ther
                    return, but expect t' work out some plan while absent.

                    up?
                We've certainly traveled some since "Th' Black Crook" used
                    t' play t' men only.
                What's become o' th' feller that didn' used t' wait till

                    an' know that th' bill won't run over 45 cents.

                You kin allus tell a feller that's married a cobweb chaser by th' way he brightens
                    up when you speak kindly t' him.
                Even when some fellers are sure they're right they hain't got ambition enough
                    t' go ahead.
                
                Elmer Moots has been missin' since Friday. He wuz heavily involved in a silk shirt
                    an' had been despondent o' late.
                Sometimes a vacation benefits a community more'n it does th' feller that took it.
                It seems like it's impossible fer a feller t' be an exemplary citizen without
                    toein' in when he walks.
                Who remembers when a girl's intellectual qualities wuz an asset?

                Joe Kite wuz in town t'day. He used t' be a pop'lar bootlegger, but he

                    school composition.

                    when he's already wedded t' three or four lodges.

                Have you ever noticed how much better some fellers' tires look than ther shoes?
                Knowin' when t' go on about your business after shakin' hands is a dandy
                    accomplishment.

                    an' then she kin concern herself with whatever she pleases.
                
                It must be awful t' marry fer money an' then not git it.
                A Victroly has replaced th' ole parlor album, an' it's not only fer more

                What's become o' th' professor with th' shiny worsted frock suit
                    that taught penmanship?
                My idea o' a heavy dinner is when th' wife tries t' make light, fluffy
                    noodles an' they don't fluff.
                
                Our idee o' a ideal wife is one that has as much confidence in her husband as she has in a
                    milliner.
                Some folks seem t' go t' th' photographers jest t' git a picture

                If opportunity looked in th' garage first it might save knockin'.
                Some fellers ought t' raise a droopin' mustache or see a dentist.

                Th' reason penny weighin' machines hain't raised th' prices on

                We used t' slick up on Saturday night, but now we're dolled up all th'

                We used t' write pustal cards, but now we wire on th' slightest provocation.

                T'day a feller don't think no more o'

                A feller used t' have a wild, reckless Saturday night on fifty cents, includin'
                    shave an' Floridy water, but t'day you don't git as much change back from
                    a dollar as you used t' git back from a dime.
                We used t' live at home, but t'day we only git our mail there.

                    eat freely an' pay fer it. Of course we've sold no lobsters in any of our cafes
                    since th' ban on liquor. The bar used t' git all th' breakfast business,
                    but now th' cafe is rapidly pickin' up. Ther used t' be a
                    pop'lar belief that all th' big business deals wuz pulled off around a bottle
                    o' Scotch or a beer table. Stuff an' nonsense. After a feller took a couple
                    o' drinks he'd often tell about puttin' 
                    over some big deal, but ther wuz nothin' in it. Ther wuz a time when a sharper would take
                    his victim t' a bar an' fill him up before he trimmed him, but that wuz years ago.
                    Fer years sharpers have been goin' right int' th' offices o'
                    some o' our biggest men an' fleecin' 'em without even
                    givin' 'em a cigar. Our bars are still intact, but we serve only near drinks. Our
                    ole customers still come in, but they don't set 'em up. Sometimes they'll
                    loaf a half hour over one glass o' buttermilk an' admire 'emselves in
                    th' mirror, but they have no news. We allus expect t' git considerable business as
                    long as we have our mirrors. Yisterday a party o' tired business men laughed an'
                    talked fer almost five minutes over one round o' pop. Ther comin' t' it.
                    Fellers that used t' take ther girls t' th' the-ater jest t' git
                    'em pickled in th' cafe after th' show don't come around any
                    more, but we expect t' make up that loss by puttin' a couple o' guitar
                    players  an' a tenor in our several cafes an'
                    doublin' th' price o' ever'thing. We've found out,
                    after careful study, that folks that make ther own liquor are often driven down town by hunger. As a
                    special inducement t' such as those we're permittin' dancin' in
                    our cafes. People must have diversion o' some sort outside ther homes since they
                    can't drink down town. Ther is great danger in switchin' from home made booze
                    t' soft drinks an' we try to guard agin it on account o' th'
                    muss it makes, therefore we allow no soft drinkin' amongst spiffed dancers. I do not know
                    how other lines o' business are affected by prohibition, but I know ther are many things a
                    feller'll not patronize unless he's lit up. Two shootin' galleries have
                    closed in th' past year t' my knowledge, an' Joe Lark, who used
                    t' conduct a cane rack, is now workin'. But ther seems t' be more money
                    than ever. "Peck's Bad Boy" has crowded Melodeon Hall three times  since we've closed our bar. Another thing I've
                    noticed since th' state went dry is that th' feller that used t' call up
                    his wife an' tell her he wouldn' be home on account of a business engagement, now
                    calls her up and tells her t' put some on ice as he's bringin' a friend
                    home t' dinner."
            
            
            
            	CHAPTER
                Th' time's comin' when a woman wont know whether she's
                    bein' chased fer her looks or her vote.
                One good thing about a farmerhe keeps still about how much he's makin'.
                Th' feller that's settin' in a the-ater hain't swearin'
                    or smokin' or chewin' or fightin' or drinkin' or
                    burglin'.
                It's hard enough t' settle down after you've been t' Niagary
                    Falls, but after you've been t' France it must be fierce.
                
                It seems like ever'thing's imitated these days but a good, upright citizen.
                Another awful waste o' time is worryin' about th' domestic affairs
                    o' stage folks.
                Miss Tawney Apple is takin' brewin' lessons.
                It's wonderful how neat an' tidy a couple o' fried eggs kin look after
                    comin' from a resturint kitchen.
                
                No one kin feel as helpless as th' owner o' a sick gold fish.
                Th' best thing we saw at th' state fair wuz an' ole woman eatin'
                    a fish sandwich with th' tail stickin' out.
                O' course it is none o' our business, but we'd jest like t' know
                    fer fun how much a cafe makes on a 25-cent baked p'tater.
                Next t' bein' told how t' vote th' thing that makes us
                    th' maddest is be-in' told when t' shop.
                
                Some folks wouldn' think o' livin' in a little town where
                    ever'buddy knows ever'buddy's business. They prefer th' city,
                    where ever'buddy's all right till ther arrested.
                'Bout th' only difference between a dollar a year man an' a school teacher
                    is that th' school teacher can't afford t' resign.
                A never failin' sign o' ole age is fergittin' ther's a circus in
                    town.
                Dignity is about as becomin' as goggles t' th' general run o'
                    people.
                
                Learn t' labor an' t' waitfer a raise.
                Another rather recent style o' optimist is th' feller that gits his head shaved
                    half way up an' expects t' git by.
                Th' most dejected thing we know of, next t' a February robin, is a state fair
                    visitor in a rain.
                Th' first thing most fellers do when they go t' a party is t' park ther
                    wives.
                
                Ther's a nose diver in ever' neighborhood.
                Ever' once in a while an' ole scout fergits that he's only thirty-five
                    an' reminesses about th' Alice Oates opery company.
                Constable Plum arrested a dangerous lookin' stranger this mornin' fer
                    tryin' t' cash a Ford.
                We're inclined t' think that many a feller misses his free lunch fer more than he
                    does his beer.
                
                Miss Fawn Lippincut says Steve Bud's over-seas mustache looks like he'd lost his
                    handkerchief.
                Ever'thing sets on its own bottom but a strawberry box.
                John Barleycorn still has a considerable number o' friends, but ther afraid t' be
                    seen with him.
                Nobuddy ever seems t' know enough t' keep th' first baby buggy.
                
                Don't make a mistake by stickin' around jest because somebuddy says,
                    "Don't be in a hurry."
                When th' ole time clerk used t' say, "Well, what kin I do you
                    fer?" we used t' think he wuz jest jokin'.
                Who remembers when a feller wuz accused o' goin' a fast clip 'cause he
                    wore lavender suspenders?
                Some folks are so fond o' th' the-ater that they even go after eatin'
                    onions.
                
                We'd hate t' be prominent an' have t' dress fer th'
                    camera ever' mornin'.
                Wouldn' this be some world if ever'-buddy wuz as great as th' big, black
                    imitation turtle shell spectacles make 'em look?
                If Washington never told a lie he must have been mighty noncommittal.
                "If anybuddy ever names a se-gar after me I'm goin' t' have
                    somethin' t' say about what goes in it," said Tell Binkley,
                    t'day, as he threw away a half-smoked General Tecumseh.
                
                When a travelin' man asked Emmy Pash, waitress at th' Little Gem resturrint,
                    t' open his boiled eggs, this mornin', she asked fer a vote o'
                    confidence.
                Rubber heels are gittin' so common that it's no longer safe t' talk
                    confidentially.
                Somehow you can't help feelin' that you're goin' t' git
                    th' worst o' it when your wife agrees with you.
                Th' trouble with most people is that they prepare for th' best instead o'
                    th' worst.
                
                Th' funny thing about a long lineup fer the-ater tickets is that if it wuzn' headed
                    fer a box office you'd never suspect that ther wuz $3 in th' crowd.
                Most any man would rather pay four prices fer a new hat fer his wife than have her meet him down town
                    in one she trimmed herself.
                Ther's somebuddy at ever' dinner party that eats all th' celery.
                It don't make much difference how much you read if you hain't got sense enough
                    t' know what t' believe.
                
                
                Hain't it wonderful how an actress kin git her picture taken half naked an' still
                    look modest an' demure?
                
                Pinky Kerr says that carryin' a tuba horn is wors'n havin' your wife with
                    you.
                Some workin' people are gittin' so efficient they figure on th'
                    depreciation o' ther overalls.
                Tell Binkley has been restless fer two days. He scents liquor, but can't locate it.
                Miss Myrt Pash is th' hog killin' guest o' friends in th'
                    country.
                
                Link Gage, fer many years prominent in checker circles, died t'day leavin' a
                    Ford-sized family.
                It seems like th' very folks that have licenses t' be stuck up don't use
                    'em.
                Mrs. Tipton Bud has a nephew that kin name all th' collars.
                What's become o' th' ole time sport that had two girls an' sat on
                    ther knees when he drove?
                
                We've often wondered about drum majorswho trains 'em, where they git th'
                    inclination an' what they expect t' gain by it?
                Another drawback t' bein' a square head is tryin' t' wear a straw
                    hat.
                Who remembers when you had t' take twenty bottles o' medicine t' git your
                    picture in th' paper?
                Cheer up, think how hard mother works fer jest board an' clothes.
                A movin' van driver must laugh when he sees eight circus horses pullin' a kangaroo.
                
                While it costs a whole lot o' money t' keep th' table up nobuddy ever seen
                    a rich grocer.
                Th' more good fer nothin' a woman's husband is th' oftener she
                    remarks that she could have married any man in town.
                Some fellers are so anxious t' be in on th' war that they boast that
                    they've got a sister-in-law who saved prune seeds.
                Min Pash gave her age away t'day by hummin' "After th'
                    Ball."
                
                It must be awful t' distinguish yourself in a world war an' then have some one
                    offer you a job in a sawmill.
                When a homely person does git t' th' front we know its through merit.
                "If you nick th' edges o' a round steak with a wire cutter it will hold
                    its shape," said Miss Fawn Lippincut t'day.
                Ther hain't a chance in th' world fer th' girl that wears oversize white
                    stockin's.
                
                Another patriot we don't hear anything about is th' feller who has been glad
                    t' break even an' hasn't kicked ever' day since th' war
                    begun.
                "I don't know why they call 'em th' weaker sex unless
                    it's because they can't lift as much," said Lafe Bud, t'day.
                Th' feller that gits ahead o' his story wouldn' be so bad if he stayed
                    ahead.
                Some folks are like the deadly buckeyethey look good, but they wouldn' do a thing
                    t' you.
                Avery Perkins, Class 4, Rural Rout 3, Stop 5, is teachin' at No. 6 school.
                
                "What's worsn' a clerk that don't know where what you want
                    is?" said Mrs. Tilford Moots, t'day.
                Jest' cause a couple's got a chummy roadster it' s no sign they git along.
                One o' th' commonest mistakes is thinkin' a hat'll do another
                    season.
                Mrs. Min Nugent has a boudoir cap, but no Ford.
                It's wonderful how few people you talk to about anything have given th' subject any
                    thought.
                
                Tipton Bud got his wife's mail Friday an' carried twelve pounds o' army
                    bacon around fer two days before he thought t' give it t' her.
                Next t' a second-hand Ford ther hain't nothin' that's grabbed up
                    as quick as a well-t'-do widder.
                Remember when we used t' run when a feller reached fer his hip pocket?
