                    two politically powerful organizations, the Anti-Saloon League and the Ku Klux
                    Klan, both exerted exceptional influence in <placeName><region type="state"

                    and corruption was widespread throughout state and local government. The ensuing
                    political turmoil included clashes within and between both political parties,
                    between wets and drys, within the Klan, and between the Klan and those who
                    opposed it. The trials of Klan leader D. C. Stephenson, two governors, a mayor,
                    other elected officials, and the superintendent of the IndianaAnti-Saloon League
                    (IASL) were local sensations that drew national attention, as well. These
                    issues, individuals, and organizations overlapped in significant ways, creating
                    a perfect storm of political turbulence in 1920s <placeName><region type="state"

                        >1</hi> This article considers Gilliom&apos;s place amidst the tensions of
                    the era by focusing on his relations with the IASL and its superintendent, Rev.
                    Edward S. Shumaker. In that relationship, we find a compelling example of the
                    challenge of advocating and upholding basic individual liberties during a time
                    of great public pressure to advance popular social or moral values. Although the
                    events that brought Gilliom and Shumaker into open conflict occurred eighty-five
                    years ago, they still illustrate well the political and legal dilemmas which can
                    arise whenever those in government attempt to limit individual freedoms in the
                    name of the common good of society.</p>
                <p>Arthur Luther Gilliom was born on a farm in a small Swiss community in

                    August 2, 1886, to Peter and Rachel (Lehman) Gilliom, the tenth of fourteen
                    children. Following several consecutive failed harvests, the family returned to

                    mother&apos;s family had originally settled. Just before his twenty-first
                    birthday, and much against his parents&apos; wishes, Gilliom left the farm
                    determined to pursue his education at a higher level than the instruction he had
                    received in a rural one-room schoolhouse. From 1907 to 1910 he attended the
                    small, Mennonite Church-supported Goshen College, working during the summers to
                    pay his own expenses. On completing the necessary courses at

                            >Goshen</settlement></placeName>, he made his way to

                    School, from which he graduated with an LLB degree on May 6, 1913. Admitted to

                    increasingly successful legal career that followed, Gilliom became active in the
                    Republican Party; he was much in demand as a campaign speaker and performed
                    organizational and committee work. In 1922, he was nominated for justice of the
                    peace but failed to be elected. The next year he successfully argued a case
                    before the Indiana Supreme Court regarding the constitutionality of an
                    automobile licensing law, saving millions of <list type="footnotes">

                <p>In 1924 Gilliom declared his candidacy for office of attorney general, joining
                    fellow Republicans Wilbur Ryman of <placeName><settlement type="city"
                            key="tgn_7014174" reg="Muncie">Muncie</settlement></placeName> (a
                    Klansman who was thought to have the support of party leaders James E. Watson
                    and Edward Jackson) and Edward M. White (who had the support of many from the
                    old Republican organization). At the time, the Hoosier Republican Party, long
                    plagued by factional rivalry, was further riven by a power struggle between two
                    factions of the Hoosier Klan: one led by David C. Stephenson, the other by
                    Walter E Bossert. Both Klan leaders had attached themselves to powerful
                    Republicans, with Stephenson supporting old guard Sen. James E. Watson and
                    Bossert aligning himself with the Harry S. New-James P. Goodrich-Will H. Hays
                    faction of the state party. Republicans disagreed over how to handle the
                    delicate and divisive Klan issue itself; while aspiring candidates realized that
                    Klan endorsement could aid their bids for office, party leaders were cognizant
                    of the negative repercussions likely to arise if anti-Klan voters perceived
                    Republicans as being too closely affiliated with the order. Watson, while
                    availing himself of Stephenson&apos;s support, always maintained that he was not
                    a Klansman and had no personal interest in the organization. Simultaneously
                    avoiding the alienation of both the Ku Klux Klan and anti-Klan voters was tricky
                    business, and taking a stand on the issue was something the Republicans sought
                    to avoid, eventually agreeing to omit any &quot;direct reference&quot; to the
                    Klan in the party platform. <hi rend="sup">3</hi></p>

                <p>Although Ryman&apos;s likelihood of winning the nomination had seemed, at first,
                    overwhelming, his obvious backing by both factions of the Klan and his known
                    affiliation with the order proved in the end to be detrimental. Watson and other
                    leaders made it clear that having a slate &quot;overloaded&quot; with known
                    Klansmen would risk alienating anti-Klan voters. Their tack divided the
                    Watson-Stephenson ranks and resulted in last-minute campaigning against
                        Ryman.<hi rend="sup">4</hi></p>
                <p>Gilliom&apos;s supporters, meanwhile, had strategically formed an alliance
                    between the large Thirteenth District and other northern <placeName><region

                    they struck a pre-vote deal with White&apos;s backers, agreeing that whichever
                    man received the lowest number of votes would withdraw and swing his support to
                    the other candidate in order to defeat Ryman. Ryman carried the first ballot at
                    the convention by a plurality of 602 votes, but lacked the majority of votes
                    needed to win. With Gilliom receiving only 478 votes to White&apos;s 270, White
                    withdrew and threw his support to Gilliom. In the next ballot, Gilliom defeated
                    Ryman by a narrow margin of 689 to 661 votes. No one was more astounded by the
                    upset than the candidate himself, whose previous activities (in 1922, he had

                <p>As Gilliom stepped toward the 1924 general election, Hoosiers (and Americans in
                    general) were grappling with the issue of Prohibition. The Anti-Saloon League
                    (ASL), founded in 1893 in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007706"
                            reg="Ohio">Ohio</region></placeName> with the single mission of
                    destroying the saloon and other liquor interests, had quickly grown from a
                    popular grassroots movement into an increasingly politically powerful nationwide
                        organization.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> According to ASL founder Rev. Howard H.
                    Russell, the league used &quot;focus and intimidation&quot; in the
                    administration of &quot;political retribution&quot; to the foes of Prohibition.
                    By recruiting Protestant ministers to support the group&apos;s efforts and
                    spread the message, the ASL gained an &quot;unrivaled opportunity&quot; to win
                    over multitudes of church attendees and to influence how they voted in
                        elections.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> In 1907, the ASL employed Edward S.
                    Shumaker, DePauw University graduate, ordained Methodist minister, and dedicated
                    prohibitionist, as the superintendent of the IASL.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> Over
                    time, Shumaker reorganized and galvanized the IASL into what would eventually be
                    described as &quot;the most powerful organization in the state,&quot; and an
                    instrumental agent in the passage of statewide Prohibition in early 1917.<hi
                        rend="sup">10</hi></p>
                <p>Shumaker and the IASL had thus been an influential and organized force in
                            <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                            >Indiana</region></placeName> for years when the Ku Klux Klan appeared
                    on the scene in the early 1920s. Writing in 1927, journalist R. L. Duffus
                    suggested that it may have been Shumaker and the IASL who had unwittingly paved
                    the way for Grand Dragon Stephenson and the Klan to gain mainstream acceptance
                    and influence within the state. For years, Duffus wrote, they had been
                    &quot;drilling their followers to take orders and to apply the single test of
                    wetness or dryness to candidates for public office. A large group of voters
                    became accustomed to act en masse and to disregard incidental questions of right
                    and wrong.&quot;<hi rend="sup">11</hi> When the Klan arrived in the Hoosier
                    state, it required little effort to duplicate the &quot;League&apos;s ideals,
                    mission and political tactics&quot; and to portray itself &quot;as the protector

                    attractive to them as well. As a result, hundreds of Protestant clergymen were

                    candidates, but also actual law enforcement, perhaps most notably in the form of
                    the Horse Thief Detective Association (HTDA), which offered Klan members a legal
                    cover for assuming police powers and carrying concealed weapons. In addition to
                    enforcing Prohibition laws, the HTDA (which consisted of an estimated
                    15,000-20,000 vigilante constables across the state) also raided gambling
                    joints, seized control of roads and re-routed traffic for Klan meetings, and
                    harassed couples in parked cars. The IASL, as historian Jason Lantzer has
                    written, &quot;approved of the Klan&apos;s HTDA liquor raids,&quot; which were
                    not occasional events and often occurred without probable cause or <list

                    Republican candidates swept the 1924 general election. Gilliom, riding
                    Republican coattails in spite of heavy Klan opposition, defeated his Democratic
                    opponent Harvey Harman.</p>
                <p>Gilliom&apos;s responsibilities in the new position were many. As one newspaper
                    noted prior to the 1924 elections, the attorney general&apos;s duty to defend
                    the Constitution (and the power of the courts to uphold it) and to protect the
                    rights of citizens made his position second only to the governor&apos;s in its
                    importance to the state.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> Gilliom was responsible for
                    prosecuting or defending all suits brought by or against the state and giving
                    his legal opinion to the governor or other state officers whenever requested to
                    do so. Additionally, he served as legal counsel for the Public Service
                    Commission; acted on behalf of the state of <placeName><region type="state"
                            key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> on
                    resolutions adopted by the state Highway Commission; and assisted the Securities
                    Commission, the Conservation Department, and the Industrial Board-among other
                    state agencies. He also had a myriad of other duties and responsibilities
                    involving the interests of the state.<hi rend="sup">20</hi></p>
                <p>Like all politicians, Gilliom possessed the strong ambition and desire necessary
                    to be elected to and hold public office. Speculation that his words and actions
                    were, at least in part, motivated by political ambition is not unreasonable,
                    especially considering his subsequent potential candidacy for governor and
                    actual run for the U.S. Senate in 1928. Gilliom&apos;s motivations, like those
                    of other politicians, were undoubtedly multifaceted. As attorney general,
                    Gilliom did follow consistent principles. <list type="footnotes">

                    relinquishing their constitutional rights and personal freedoms, and emphasized
                    the importance of representative government (at all levels), states&apos;
                    rights, and the concept of separation of church and state. His years in office
                    brought him into direct conflict with the Ku Klux Klan, the IASL, and the Rev.
                    Shumaker, as well as, on occasion, members of his own political party.<hi
                        rend="sup">21</hi> While acknowledging that special-interest minority groups
                    and their leaders were in many cases sincere in their convictions, he often
                    objected to the methods they used to attain their goals. Even as men like
                    Shumaker argued that &quot;personal liberty had to be sacrificed in order to
                    save people,&quot; Gilliom implored citizens not to surrender political power
                    and individual freedoms to such groups and their leaders. Doing so, he warned,
                    placed them on a slippery slope to centralized government and possibly
                        tyranny.<hi rend="sup">22</hi></p>
                <p>Gilliom&apos;s troubles with Shumaker commenced early in his term. Indiana
                    Supreme Court Justice Benjamin M. Willoughby, an anti-Klan candidate, had
                    defended his seat against Democrat George K. Denton in the 1924 election.
                    Shumaker, angered by Willoughby&apos;s earlier opinion establishing specific
                    requirements for search warrants in alcohol cases, was determined to see him
                    defeated at the polls, and backed Denton. While the initial tally showed that
                    Willoughby had won, a recount showed that Denton had won by several hundred
                    votes. Then-Secretary of State Ed Jackson refused to certify the second result
                    and the seat went to Willoughby. Denton&apos;s plan to contest the election
                    results failed when Gilliom gave his legal opinion that the state legislature
                    lacked the constitutional authority to overturn Jackson&apos;s decision. Denton
                    then took his complaint to court, where the judge dismissed the suit.<hi

                    Prohibition laws. Shortly after the election, he and the IASL drafted the Wright

                    Amendment. Among its provisions, it outlawed medicinal liquor, considered the
                    smell of alcohol in an empty bottle prima facie evidence of possession, and
                    treated possession of as little as a quart of alcohol prima facie evidence of
                    possession with intent to sell. The mere possession of alcohol carried severe
                    penalties, including fines of up to $500 and thirty days in jail. In addition,
                    prosecutors received a special fee of $25 for each conviction compared to $5 per
                    day for prosecuting murder cases. This bonus provision, &quot;written in
                    greed,&quot; as one critic contended, was included by the IASL under the theory
                    that their own attorneys would be able to serve as deputies to the attorney
                    general and thereby collect fees for hearing pleas of those arrested. However,
                    when Shumaker demanded that IASL attorneys be permitted to appear anywhere in
                    the state as prosecutors, Gilliom refused.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> Gilliom
                    responded to passage of the Wright Law with a letter sent to all of the
                    state&apos;s prosecuting attorneys encouraging them to &quot;vigorously&quot;
                    prosecute violations of the new law. He underscored that it was not the duty of
                    law enforcement to question the wisdom of the legislature in passing the bill,
                    only to enforce it. At the same time he emphasized the importance of equal
                    enforcement of all statutes, stressing that the attorney general&apos;s ability
                    to uphold alcohol convictions on appeal depended upon original prosecutions that
                    respected the constitutional rights of the accused.<hi rend="sup">27</hi></p>
                <p>Not surprisingly, passage of the new law flooded the courts with alcohol cases at
                    both the circuit and appellate levels; however, since the Klan-backed HTDA had
                    often violated other laws in making the arrests, <list type="footnotes">

                        >28</hi> The state supreme court, for its part, consistently overturned
                    cases involving an illegal entry or search and seizure on mere suspicion without
                    probable cause when it found that constitutional rights had been violated.<hi
                        rend="sup">29</hi> By the end of 1925, Gilliom stated that the courts and
                    police were being overloaded due to &quot;the ever-increasing tendency&quot; to
                    regulate the private lives and behavior of citizens by creating &quot;moral
                    standards and arbitrary conceptions of conduct, and by attempting to compel
                    obedience&quot; through law enforcement. Gilliom warned that such actions could
                    ultimately lead both to lower protection against real crime and &quot;a
                    terrifying enforcement of tyrannous laws which invade the sphere of private
                        conduct.&quot;<hi rend="sup">30</hi></p>
                <p>In early 1926, irritated by what he saw as lax enforcement of Prohibition laws,
                    Shumaker published his annual report for the IASL (later printed in the ASL
                    publication <hi rend="i">The American Issue: Indiana Edition</hi>, of which he
                    was editor, and circulated throughout the state in pamphlet form as well),
                    questioning the competency and efficiency of the Indiana Supreme Court, accusing
                    it of &quot;the splitting of judicial hairs,&quot; and stating that &quot;a
                    majority of the supreme court is at least liberal in its sentiment.&quot;<hi
                        rend="sup">31</hi> Shumaker singled out Willoughby, asserting that he was
                    &quot;bitterly hostile to prohibition [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>]&quot; and
                    declaring &quot;we trust the next election will give us a supreme court that

                    Judge Thomas B. Coulter, accusing the judge of &quot;not enforc[ing] the law
                    faithfully.&quot; Both friends and opponents of Coulter protested that he had in

                    <hi rend="i">Vincennes Commercial</hi> editor Thomas Adams echoed their defense
                    and opined that Shumaker should file expense accounts with the secretary of
                    state, in light of the large amounts of money he was collecting and spending for
                    political purposes, potentially in violation of the Corrupt Practices Act.<hi

                <p>For his part, Gilliom was enraged by Shumaker&apos;s newest attacks; he declared
                    that they referred not only to cases that had already been decided, but also,
                    indirectly, to many similar cases still pending in court. By using his
                    credibility and influence as a church pastor, Gilliom contended, Shumaker had
                    formed &quot;a powerful political organization&quot; for the purpose of
                    undermining the election of public officials, including judges, who did not rule
                    to his satisfaction on the numerous alcohol cases before the courts.<hi
                        rend="sup">36</hi> In a letter to each of the IASI&apos;s trustees, Gilliom
                    defended the actions of his office, declaring that &quot;inefficiency on the

                    Miles, attorney for the League, was denied the right to take part in a case
                    appealed to the supreme court . . . Because this court would not follow
                    intolerant bigotry and cast aside the law and the constitution in the

                    political organization collecting money for the support or defeat of candidates,
                    Gilliom cautioned, the IASL was required to file a report of its expenditures.
                    Gilliom had not singled the IASL out for compliance, he insisted; the
                    Association Against the Prohibition Amendment had received a similar warning and
                    had already sent notice of their intention to comply. Shumaker, in contrast,
                    replied that &quot;the political activity of the league is only an incidental
                    part of its program,&quot; and made it clear that he had no intention of
                    following the law.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> When reports of Gilliom&apos;s stand
                    became public, many prominent attorneys, judges, and others offered Gilliom
                    their encouragement and assistance in pursuing Shumaker for his statements.<hi

                <p>When the IASL&apos;s trustees refused to take responsibility for or retract the
                    statements, Gilliom charged Shumaker and two league attorneys, Jesse E. Martin
                    and Ethan A. Miles, with contempt of court.<hi rend="sup">41</hi> His petition
                    alleged that Shumaker&apos;s statements were &quot;false and contemptuous&quot;
                    and claimed that Shumaker &quot;has sought to establish and has in a measure
                    established a politico-ecclesiastical hegemony over civil government and now is
                    seeking to extend the same over the Supreme Court of Indiana for the purpose of
                    controlling the decisions of the court . . . in accordance with his own
                    censorious and arbitrary views.&quot; Gilliom accused Shumaker of using churches
                    to construct &quot;a powerful political organization&quot; for the purpose of
                    intimidating and controlling the elections of public officials (including
                    Indiana Supreme Court justices) and of making candidates for public office aware
                    that IASL endorsement depended on their adherence to his demands. The league
                    responded that &quot;it is the essential purpose of this league to inform the

                    While the IASL publicly supported Shumaker, its trustees privately demanded that
                    Shumaker&apos;s report be &quot;toned down,&quot; and that he delete the harsh
                    criticisms of the court prior to publication-advice that went unheeded.<hi
                        rend="sup">43</hi></p>
                <p>Shumaker claimed the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and press for his
                    defense; Gilliom intended to prove that he had used his position and access to
                    church pulpits to make &quot;false and malicious&quot; statements about the
                    supreme court justices. While First Amendment rights are guaranteed under the
                    Constitution, the court would have to decide whether those rights were absolute
                    or if people could be held responsible for the abuse of those rights in cases
                    involving libel and slander.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> Without suggesting what
                    action the court should take, the attorney general proposed that a special
                    committee of members of the state bar association be formed to apprise the court
                    of their professional views concerning the information contained in the petition
                    and to decide, based on that information, whether the contempt case should
                    proceed. The special committee, consisting of three Democrats and three
                    Republicans, delivered its non-binding opinion in July 1926. Five of the six
                    members recommended that Shumaker, as the report&apos;s lone author, be held in
                    contempt, while the two league attorneys were exonerated.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>
                    Following the special committee&apos;s decision, Shumaker secretly asked
                    Senators James Watson and Arthur Robinson, both of whom were up for re-election,
                    for their help in influencing the court&apos;s decision in the contempt case.
                    However, the details of these contacts would only become publicly known when the
                    story broke more than a year later.<hi rend="sup">46</hi></p>
                <p>The Shumaker case bore striking similarities to that of George R. Dale, the

                    guilty of criminal libel, a decision which was sustained by the Indiana Supreme
                    Court on the grounds that &quot;the truth of the article is not a matter of

                <p>While awaiting further action in his case, Shumaker continued to speak harshly
                    and publicly against the court, this time targeting Supreme Court Justice Julius
                    C. Travis, who was facing re-election.<hi rend="sup">51</hi> Gilliom responded
                    with a letter-writing campaign (purportedly in his capacity as lawyer and
                    private citizen, not as a public official) in which he called the public&apos;s
                    attention to Shumaker&apos;s effort to use the state&apos;s churches for
                    political purposes. Although the letters appeared just prior to the 1926
                    elections (when Gilliom was on the stump for other Republicans), they urged the
                    public to consider candidates on both tickets, all of whom possessed
                    qualifications needed for election to the court. While Gilliom received
                    supportive replies, including some from Democrats, Shumaker denounced the
                    letters as a &quot;political move&quot; and <list type="footnotes">

                    Gilliom&apos;s warning was not unfounded. In 1925, the Indianapolis Public
                    Safety Commission passed a resolution granting &quot;special police powers&quot;

                    the 1926 elections. For Gilliom, any action he took was likely to invite
                    criticism. By pushing for a speedy trial, he opened himself to charges that he
                    was out for revenge against Shumaker; delaying the trial risked appearing as a

                <p>Gilliom&apos;s next tangle with temperance forces centered on the issue of
                    medicinal alcohol. Around the country, the use of medicinal alcohol (an
                    exception to the Volstead Act) offered a legal method-and often guise-for
                    obtaining liquor. With a physician&apos;s prescription, an individual could have
                    access to a pint of whiskey every ten days, making it not only popular with
                    thirsty citizens, but also a lucrative business for doctors and drugstores
                    alike. Although the American Medical Association (AMA) had declared in 1917 that
                    there was &quot;no scientific value&quot; with respect to alcohol as medicine,
                    physicians were still unrestricted in their ability to prescribe it as they saw
                    fit. Some doctors still believed that it was useful as a treatment; others
                    employed it as a last resort in cases of extreme illness. The Volstead Act
                    required physicians to obtain permits in order to issue such prescriptions and
                    regulated the amount of alcohol they could prescribe-restrictions that doctors
                    viewed as governmental encroachment into the practice of medicine. In early 1922
                    the AMA did an about-face and once again approved alcohol as a legitimate
                    treatment for patients with certain diseases. This stance not only protested
                    government regulation of the practice of medicine, but also legitimized the
                    highly profitable business of issuing alcohol prescriptions. <placeName><region

                <p>In May 1927, in the midst of Shumaker&apos;s contempt case, Gilliom (himself a
                    lifelong total abstainer) suddenly announced his support of medicinal alcohol in
                    a sensational way. He publicly divulged that the previous year, when three of
                    his young sons had fallen ill with typhoid and pneumonia, their doctor had
                    suggested medicinal whiskey as a last <pb n="308" id="VAA4025-107-4-026"/>
                    resort. Following weeks of his sons&apos; suffering, including (for at least one
                    boy) unconsciousness, dangerously fluctuating body temperatures, and receiving
                    nourishment through feeding tubes, and after exhausting measures such as
                    administering oxygen and even blood transfusions, the attorney general took the
                    physician&apos;s advice and broke the law by procuring the whiskey-his three
                    sons lived.<hi rend="sup">60</hi> Gilliom had again procured prescription
                    whiskey, he revealed, when Governor Jackson approached him for help when the
                    governor&apos;s wife had a severe case of pneumonia. Gilliom&apos;s confession
                    appeared in an open letter to Jackson, outlining the occasions on which they
                    both had obtained medicinal alcohol and urging amendment of the Wright Law to
                    allow such uses in the future.<hi rend="sup">61</hi> Public reaction to the
                    bombshell was deeply divided, resulting in a flood of discussion, letters, and
                    editorials, some abusive and some praising the attorney general&apos;s
                        actions.<hi rend="sup">62</hi> Some critics even called for the attorney
                    general&apos;s arrest; however, no charges were pressed, perhaps because of an
                    1851 ruling by the Indiana Supreme Court that the law was not violated in the
                    case of alcohol provided for strictly medicinal purposes.<hi rend="sup"

                    avoid criticism; when pressed, he finally acknowledged breaking the law, but

                    Meredith Nicholson observed that many citizens, fearing the consequences,
                    hesitated to speak out as Gilliom had done. Nicholson found this reluctance to
                    voice an opinion &quot;ignoble and menacing,&quot; and lamented that &quot;we

                <p>What motivated Gilliom&apos;s public confession? The ASL publication, <hi
                        rend="i">The American Issue: Indiana Edition</hi>, immediately speculated
                    &quot;that Gilliom&apos;s stand sprang from the attorney general&apos;s
                    aspirations for higher office&quot; and reported that the AMA had come out
                    against medicinal alcohol-omitting the fact that the doctors&apos; group had
                    recently amended its position and also suggested some changes in the Volstead
                        Act.<hi rend="sup">68</hi> Gilliom&apos;s wife, when interviewed by a
                    reporter, insisted that the shocking letter and public stand taken by her
                    husband had originated from her, a quiet &quot;little home body&quot; who had
                    never tasted alcohol in her life.<hi rend="sup">69</hi> As a politician,
                    Gilliom&apos;s motivations for his daring declaration were most likely
                    multi-layered. While genuinely wanting to see Prohibition succeed, he also
                    believed that an even-handed approach was crucial for long-term achievement.
                    Undoubtedly, his announcement generated plenty of press coverage, debate, and
                    name recognition.<hi rend="sup">70</hi> By revealing his own experience and
                    voicing a more tolerant stance, he may have been appealing to moderate drys and

                    others were less sure of the success of this approach. Even Republicans who
                    wanted to see Gilliom elected governor had to acknowledge reluctantly that he
                    stood barely a chance in an election with the IASL, the Klan, and the HTDA
                    opposing him. In fact, some worried that he had offended radical drys to the
                    point of inciting a widespread backlash by the IASL against other Republicans,
                    and they wished Gilliom would subdue his comments.<hi rend="sup">71</hi></p>
                <p>Despite his initial assurances that the IASL would ignore Gilliom&apos;s letter,
                    Shumaker soon issued lengthy statements assailing the state&apos;s chief law
                    officer. He declared Gilliom&apos;s letter &quot;a great grandstand play,&quot;
                    chided Gilliom for giving out &quot;sob stuff to the effect that he did it to
                    save life,&quot; and insisted that the attorney general resign for his blatant
                    violation of the law.<hi rend="sup">72</hi> Ironically, it soon became public
                    that Shumaker had not only tried medicinal whiskey himself as a student at
                    DePauw University, but had also administered it to his first wife, Lena, some
                    twenty-seven years earlier when she was suffering from heart disease. Eugene
                    (&quot;Jep&quot;) Jepson Cadou exposed Shumaker&apos;s recent personal use of an
                    elixir, Busho tonic, which contained 23 percent alcohol, while other reports had

                    belief-without supporting testimony or evidence-had appealed his case to the
                    Indiana Supreme Court. The higher court overturned the conviction, ruling that a
                    search warrant could not be legally issued based on the subjective reasoning,
                    knowledge, or discretion of the person requesting it. Justice Travis&apos;s
                    opinion stated that all individuals were protected under the Constitution
                    &quot;without discrimination&quot; and that in the absence of probable cause,
                    the search warrant was illegal. Gilliom, who had unsuccessfully argued for the
                    state, acknowledged the court&apos;s sovereignty at a law enforcement conference
                    later that fall: &quot;I am not the supreme court of <placeName><region

                    those judges elected by the people of the state to occupy that bench and
                    constitute that court.&quot;<hi rend="sup">75</hi></p>
                <p>On August 4, 1927, the Indiana Supreme Court finally ruled on the contempt
                    charges against Shumaker and the two IASL attorneys, returning a guilty verdict
                    against Shumaker and Martin while acquitting Miles. The court noted that it did
                    not &quot;contend that judges are beyond fair and respectful criticism . . . but
                    a knowingly dishonest, false or libelous publication&quot; was another matter.
                    Shumaker, contending that those violating Prohibition law were not entitled to
                    constitutional protection, had essentially threatened the court with retribution
                    at the polls if it did not yield to this line of thought in other cases pending
                    before it. The court, in its response, accused Shumaker of
                    &quot;capitalizing&quot; on his position as a member of the clergy for the
                    purposes of impressing the public with the &quot;truthfulness and fairness of
                    his statements,&quot; of gaining &quot;admission to the pulpits of various
                    churches of the state which he use[d] to arouse&quot; the public to contribute
                    money to his cause, and of following up with intentionally false statements
                    designed to undermine the integrity of the court.<hi rend="sup">76</hi> Justice
                    Clarence R. Martin, who was not a member of the court when the action was first
                    filed by Gilliom in 1926, had preferred not to participate in the decision, but
                    was asked by his colleagues to sit in on the case because of his impartiality in

                    opportunity to prepare his dissenting opinion, he considered Shumaker&apos;s
                    remarks &quot;calmly and deliberately, in the light of the constitutional
                    guaranty of free speech and writing.&quot; He found all of Gilliom&apos;s
                    contentions against Shumaker &quot;unwarranted&quot; and deduced that the only
                    way the court arrived at a guilty verdict was by adopting them, unchallenged, in
                    the first place. He commented that the case was &quot;a most unusual
                    proceeding&quot; in that Gilliom appeared to have begun the proceedings without
                    the prodding of the court itself (as would be expected if the court were seeking
                    to protect its honor in the case of contemptuous action). He further noted that
                    Gilliom&apos;s actions were also not instigated by any of the litigants involved
                    in any of the pending cases. Lastly, he pointed out that it was unfortunate that
                    &quot;the judges whose decisions are criticized sit in judgment of the person
                    who made the criticism.&quot;<hi rend="sup">77</hi></p>
                <p>Shumaker was fined $250 and sentenced to sixty days at the state penal farm, a
                    decision he immediately appealed. Suddenly, the man who had pressured the courts
                    to remove the Fourth Amendment rights of others to advance his cause presented
                    himself as a defender of free speech, and even IASL attorney James Bingham had
                    to admit the irony of Shumaker seeking constitutional protection given his
                    stance that Prohibition violators were not equally entitled to the same.<hi
                        rend="sup">78</hi> Bingham&apos;s subsequent motions, designed to help
                    Shumaker avoid serving his jail sentence, included an impassioned plea to the
                    court that &quot;we are trying a minister of the Gospel.&quot; Gilliom countered
                    that Shumaker was not being prosecuted as a minister, but rather as someone who
                    had attempted to threaten the court and to influence its decisions.<hi

                    dissent had acknowledged the unusual circumstances of the attorney general
                    filing the contempt case without the court&apos;s own expected involvement,
                    Martin himself did not discuss the idea that, had the majority indeed been
                    intimidated by Shumaker, it would have been unlikely further to antagonize him
                    by requesting contempt proceedings on its own-especially prior to an
                        election.<hi rend="sup">81</hi></p>
                <p>Public opinion on the court&apos;s decision was divided, with the clergy,
                    newspapers, and law reviews all weighing in. The controversial decision inspired
                    a debate concerning free speech and contemptuous or libelous statements. Some
                    noted the danger of allowing the court, comprising elected officials, to hold
                    people in contempt for speaking out against its actions even if that criticism
                    was misleading or mistaken. Free and open debate of issues, they argued, would
                    undoubtedly lead to unsubstantiated or excessive statements, and elected
                    officials (including judges) should be prepared to regard such expression of
                    public opinion with tolerance. Others argued the constitutional right to free
                    speech was not absolute, and that those who abused it, as in the case of libel,
                    could be held responsible.<hi rend="sup">82</hi></p>
                <p>In September 1927, while he appealed his contempt case, Shumaker&apos;s secret
                    contact with Senators Watson and Robinson just prior to the 1926 election became
                    public. Shumaker had allegedly informed the senators that there would be
                    consequences for the Republican Party if he were to be convicted and jailed.
                    According to Shumaker, Watson had told him in a telephone conversation from the
                    home of Henry Lane Wilson (former ambassador to <placeName><country
                            key="tgn_7005560" reg="Mexico">Mexico</country></placeName>) that Watson
                    had approached the three justices who were unfavorable to Shumaker&apos;s case.
                    They had assured him that Shumaker would receive a fine but not jail time, and
                    that the case was being held up pending the elections. Shumaker then wrote a
                    letter to Watson outlining the details of the conversation in order to receive
                    written confirmation from the senator that his case had indeed been fixed.
                    Watson responded that Shumaker had misunderstood <list type="footnotes">

                    written letters to others in the state on Shumaker&apos;s behalf, he had not and
                    would not approach judges for leniency. His account was later verified by
                    Wilson, who had overheard the telephone conversation. Upon learning of the
                    situation, Robinson had allegedly encouraged Watson to work to keep Shumaker out
                    of jail.<hi rend="sup">83</hi> When this secret correspondence became public,
                    Shumaker was again summoned to court and was charged with trying to
                    &quot;corruptly influence a decision favorable to him in this cause.&quot;
                    Gilliom filed a motion to have Shumaker&apos;s original sentence increased for
                    his attempts to barter political influence and corrupt a decision of the state
                    supreme court.<hi rend="sup">84</hi> Gilliom&apos;s brief alleged that Shumaker
                    had offered the senators votes, which just prior to the elections were of
                    considerably more value to them than money, for their intervention in his
                        case.<hi rend="sup">85</hi> Watson asserted that Shumaker had told him that
                    &quot;the Anti-Saloon league [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] and Methodist church will
                    hold you responsible if this thing is not done.&quot;<hi rend="sup">86</hi>
                    Shumaker contradicted Watson&apos;s version, and denied having pressured Watson
                    to intervene in his case or having threatened political repercussions in the
                    event of a conviction. However, Robinson also said that he was &quot;under the
                    impression&quot; that the IASL would &quot;hold the Republican Party at least
                    partially responsible&quot; if there were a conviction, indicating that Shumaker
                    had at least made his point. Having heard this evidence and in spite of
                    Gilliom&apos;s best efforts to have Shumaker&apos;s sentence increased, the
                    court declined to do so.<hi rend="sup">87</hi>

                    Shortly thereafter, with the recovered Emma in attendance, the Adams County WCTU
                    passed a resolution condemning Gilliom&apos;s actions and calling for an
                    investigation and appropriate legal action.<hi rend="sup">89</hi> Many other
                    drys from the area where Gilliom had grown up, including Fred Rhorer, editor of
                    the <hi rend="i">Berne Witness</hi> and an IASL trustee, also pressed for
                    Gilliom&apos;s indictment. Gilliom fired back by calling Rhorer a hypocrite for
                    secretly using wine (a fact eventually confirmed by Rohrer, who also admitted
                    the occasional use of whiskey). Gilliom expressed disdain for the &quot;Biblical
                    hypocrisy . . . that is certain to defeat . . . prohibition unless it is
                        checked.&quot;<hi rend="sup">90</hi> Once again, Gilliom pointedly did not
                    resist prosecution or seek special protection from the law; in fact, he sent a

                    effort to increase it. The attorney general was unpopular with the Klan, the

                <p>In March 1928, Gilliom announced his decision to challenge Robinson for his
                    senatorial seat in that year&apos;s elections. Gilliom stated his position on
                    important issues such as the Republican protective tariff policy (for), farm
                    legislation (for permanent farm relief measures), waterway developments (for
                    development by national government to encourage cheap water transport), state
                    sovereignty (for), foreign relations (for freedom from foreign entanglements

                    &quot;vigorous&quot; and &quot;lawful&quot; enforcement of the Eighteenth

                    openly attacked both the IASL and the Klan. Gilliom suggested that he

                    the charges immediately; Shumaker and his attorneys insisted on delaying his
                    trial until after the primary elections.<hi rend="sup">109</hi></p>
                <p>Gilliom&apos;s election bid proved in vain. The primary election results were as
                    predicted, with Robinson clearly winning the Republican nomination for senator
                    with approximately 57 percent of the total vote. While the liberal votes were
                    split between Gilliom (approximately 27 percent) and Solon J. Carter (about 16
                    percent), it was obvious that Robinson would have won the election even if he
                    had had only one opponent.<hi rend="sup">110</hi> Following the primaries,
                    Gilliom again tried to have Shumaker&apos;s original sentence increased-this
                    time for the voter guide classification. Again, the court declined; however, the
                    court also denied Shumaker&apos;s request for a new hearing and reaffirmed the
                    original contempt charges.<hi rend="sup">111</hi> The only recourse left for
                    Shumaker to avoid prison was an appeal to the United States Supreme Court, an
                    option he chose not to pursue. Instead, he surrendered himself to police custody
                    at the <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2033387" reg="Putnamville"

                    arrived at the jail to find a pardon awaiting him from Governor Jackson-itself a
                    product of the urging of state Republican leaders fearful of the political
                    consequences of his incarceration. Gilliom immediately challenged the pardon on
                    the grounds that the governor lacked legal or constitutional authority to grant
                        it.<hi rend="sup">112</hi> Shumaker was ordered before the Indiana Supreme
                    Court in early December 1928 to show why he should not begin serving his
                    sentence-an action that some observers interpreted as providing the dry leader
                    with an opportunity to apologize to the justices. However, Shumaker remained
                    unremorseful; his attorneys&apos; brief charged that Gilliom had prosecuted

                <p>In court, Gilliom argued that Indiana&apos;s Constitution allowed a governor to
                    specifically pardon for criminal offenses (except treason and impeachment).
                    However, Shumaker&apos;s contempt charge, he continued, was not a criminal
                    offense under Indiana law (which would have allowed for a jury trial) but was
                    instead summary in nature; the court should enforce the sentence.
                    Shumaker&apos;s attorneys, on the other hand, argued that contempt was indeed a
                    criminal offense, and that limiting the governor&apos;s power to pardon could
                    lead to an abuse of power by the judicial branch. The court ruled (in the same
                    3-to-2 split as in the original decision) that contempt did not qualify as a
                    criminal offense, that the pardon was invalid, and that Shumaker should be
                    recommitted to prison. The opinion, written by Justice Travis, stated that the
                    power granted the governor was not unlimited or absolute, and that no person
                    from one of the three branches of government should exercise power over any of
                    the other branches &quot;except as expressly provided.&quot; Further, <list

                    wronged the general public) and that it therefore fell within &quot;the range of

                    15, 1928, he deposed former Grand Dragon Stephenson, posing 492 questions
                    related to various Klan activities. Some of Stephenson&apos;s responses echoed
                    Emmons&apos;s testimony, including the claim of close cooperation between the
                    IASL and the Klan. Stating that Reverend Shumaker of the IASL was the only
                    person by that surname that he knew, Stephenson alleged that the dry leader had
                    called at his <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924"

                    but also chided Miles for permanently labeling his own client a criminal in an
                    attempt to manipulate an outcome whereby Governor Jackson was entitled to grant

                    outcry, Shumaker&apos;s private strategy may have ultimately included
                    imprisonment. According to Emmons, Shumaker had asserted that it would be
                    advantageous for both the IASL and the Klan if he were sent to prison,
                    particularly for the league.<hi rend="sup">121</hi> Other Shumaker supporters

                    refused Gilliom&apos;s offer of continued assistance with the case and dismissed

                <p>Following his release from prison, Shumaker became ill and was admitted to the
                    Kellogg Sanitarium in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007520"
                            reg="Michigan">Michigan</region></placeName> for treatment. After his
                    lifelong opposition to alcohol and his public attacks on others for the use of
                    medicinal alcohol, he found himself subject to reports that, while hospitalized,
                    he had used a medicinal tonic containing 23 percent alcohol. Shumaker responded
                    that &quot;there is no whiskey in this tonic&quot; and that his treatment was
                    between him and his physician. Upon hearing that alcohol had indeed been used as
                    a &quot;preservative&quot; in the tonic, the dry leader wrote to the sanitarium:
                    &quot;you see by this letter head what my official position is. When our State
                    went dry, it prohibited the use of any intoxicating liquors for medicinal
                    purposes, except pure grain alcohol. I note that your remedy has 23 per cent
                    alcohol and it makes me feel a little queer to take it.&quot; While Shumaker
                    still had many supporters, his hypocrisy was not lost on everyone. As one
                            <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014071" reg="Milwaukee"
                            >Milwaukee</settlement></placeName> newspaper aptly pointed out, there also
                    was no whiskey &quot;in the light wines and beer that so many people think ought
                    to be permitted.&quot;<hi rend="sup">126</hi> Eventually, Shumaker returned home
                    to <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis"
                            >Indianapolis</settlement></placeName>, where he died on October 25,

                    and his supporters may have cast Shumaker as a martyr and champion of free
                    speech, his drawn-out legal battle and jail sentence also brought embarrassment
                    to the group. Along with other ASL officials around the country who were
                    prosecuted for various misdeeds, he brought negative attention to the
                    organization and contributed to the loss of the respect and influence it had

                <p>Just prior to leaving the office of attorney general at age 43, Gilliom announced
                    that he would join the <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924"

                    Pickens, Davidson, Gause, and Pickens.<hi rend="sup">129</hi> After re-entering
                    private practice he never ran for political office again, although he remained
                    an active member of the Republican Party and continued to speak out on issues he
                    considered important, maintaining the same stance on issues that he had espoused
                    while in office.<hi rend="sup">130</hi> Throughout his life, Gilliom emphasized
                    the necessity of preserving representative government in order to protect the
                    constitutional rights and liberties guaranteed to all citizens. He remained a
                    foe of highly organized special-interest minority groups such as the IASL and
                    the Klan, whose tactics he believed could end up robbing citizens of those
                    freedoms and rights. As Indiana&apos;s attorney general, with a duty to protect
                    the constitutional rights and freedoms of all Hoosiers (and to uphold the
                    courts&apos; ability to do so as well), he had taken this belief as a mandate to
                    challenge the people who sought to undermine those rights in an effort to
                    promote their own agendas. &quot;The official acts of the Attorney
                    General,&quot; Gilliom explained, &quot;will always be determined solely by what
                    the law is, not by what someone would like to see the law stated or not see it
                    stated. The Attorney General acts as a mirror and reflects the law without any
                    regard as to whom it may please or whom it may not please.&quot;<hi rend="sup"

                <p>During the decade leading up to the Civil War, conflicts over slavery challenged
                    citizens in northeast <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                            reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> to examine the most basic
                    principles of their democracy. While most hoped that the compromise measures of
                    1850 would silence the demands of slave states, they were pulled into an
                    escalating series of crises and finally, into civil war. The Fugitive Slave Law
                    of 1850, meant to appease the South, outraged northerners as it was enforced on
                    their free soil. Citizens across the political spectrum felt betrayed by the
                    Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 which allowed for the possibility of slavery in
                    western territories that the 1820 Missouri Compromise had promised to keep free
                    forever. Hoping for peace with the South, a majority of Hoosiers voted for James

                    Abraham Lincoln in the November 1860 election, were largely united in their
                    passion to preserve the national union. During the secession months of the 36th
                    Congress in December 1860 and the first months of 1861, ordinary citizens, like
                    their elected officials, passed through stages of panic, denial, and finally,
                    resolve.</p>
                <p>Among the leaders in this transformation was Hoosier lawyer, political organizer,
                    Republican congressman, and future Civil War officer Charles Case. Reflecting
                    the position generally described as &quot;radical Republican,&quot; Case
                    believed that the Declaration of Independence ensured freedom and basic rights
                    for all Americans, including African Americans. As Indiana&apos;s Tenth District
                    representative in the 35th and 36th Congresses, he stood firm against the
                    extension of slavery into western territories and steadfastly exposed the
                    corruption of the Buchanan administration. During the secession winter of
                    1860-1861, Case teamed with the radical faction of the Republican Party in
                    Congress, strongly arguing against concessions that he believed would betray the
                    nation&apos;s principles and weaken the national government. Amidst bitter
                    factionalism and disorder, Case defended the Republican Party, the preservation
                    of the Constitution, and president-elect Abraham Lincoln.<hi rend="sup"

                        unpopular to be called an anti-slavery man, my sentiments were never
                        concealed; and, sir, as to the inherent right or wrong of these questions, I
                        have not changed my opinions from that day to this.</quote> His reputation
                    grew as a result of his successful defense of a fugitive slave named Clarke in
                    1842. By the end of the decade, Case had followed his mentors into politics.
                    Acquisition of territories as a result of the Mexican War had created new fears
                    that slavery would expand west. Convinced that the existing political parties
                    were bowing to southern demands, in 1848 Case joined Giddings and other
                    defecting Ohio Whigs in organizing the Free Soil Party, whose platform
                    emphasized that prosperity was only available in the free social system of the
                    North. That summer, he served as a delegate to the national convention in

                    president. At about the same time, Case moved to Bryan in the northwest corner

                    Woodworth, a friend from student days, had started a medical practice in the

                    economic growth would also have appealed to the thirty-three-year-old attorney
                    with a wife and three young children to support. After the first railroad came
                    through in 1852, the town of some 5,000 citizens began to transition from a

                <p>At this early point in his career, Case practiced with two of the town&apos;s
                    leading lawyers, Joseph Edgerton and James Worden. Since settling in the town in
                    1843, Edgerton had promoted the development of canals and had already acquired
                    significant wealth as a land speculator. In 1850, he now turned his attention to
                    bringing railroads through the area and likely anticipated a growing legal
                    practice. Case and Edgerton advertised their &quot;special attention to Land
                    Agency, and the Selecting and Collecting of Debts in any part of

                    federal courts. Within a year, Case formed a partnership with James Worden, the
                    Allen County prosecutor. Like many other citizens in the West, Case also began a

                    citizens found the harsh provisions in the new slave law morally repulsive. The

                    citizens shared a widespread exhaustion among Hoosiers over race-related issues.
                    Like voters across the state, they overwhelmingly approved the 1850-1851 state
                    constitutional convention&apos;s controversial Article XIII, which prohibited
                    African Americans from moving into the state. Furthermore, blacks already living
                    in the state prior to November 1851 were required to sign a formal register as a
                    testimony of their earlier residence. Case was among the minority who objected
                    on principle. Years later in a speech in the House of Representatives, he
                    recalled the similarity of his vote on Article XIII with his vote on the
                    constitution proposed for <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007708"

                    He believed that African Americans had legal rights under the U.S. Constitution,

                <p>Widespread opposition to the Fugitive Slave Law was nevertheless evident during
                    the summer of 1851, when both Whig and Democratic candidates for the Tenth
                    Congressional District seat pledged to repeal the act if they were elected. Such
                    a direct promise was not surprising from Whig candidate Samuel Brenton, a
                    well-known minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, a denomination strongly
                    on record against slavery. Indicating a shift in popular opinion, Democratic
                    candidate Judge James W. Borden took a similar position. Even in traditionally

                    drawing first-time voters from &quot;the most secluded corners of
                    backwoods.&quot; When the votes were counted for the fourteen counties

                    formed territories of <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007254"

                    policy whereby voters would decide if slavery was to be allowed. While Douglas
                    and his supporters tried to assure the country that this policy would fairly
                    settle the slavery issue, northerners were convinced that the slave power had
                    won an astounding victory. The Missouri Compromise had been considered a sacred
                    trust. In <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013933" reg="Fort Wayne"

                    and the sealer of weights and measures, he was also a trusted public servant.
                    Burroughs seemed to have been best known about town, however, as a passionate
                    reformer who had organized early temperance societies. In 1846, he had led the

                    Moreover, Burroughs was believed to participate in the clandestine work of the
                    Underground Railroad. Any newspaper skills that he lacked, he found in the young
                    attorney Charles Case.<hi rend="sup">13</hi></p>

                    of 1854, Case brought issues relating to slavery and the Kansas-Nebraska Act
                    before his readers by reprinting stories from other newspapers. He also reported
                    in detail on local affairs, including the meetings organizing the new
                    People&apos;s political party. Following journalistic practices of the day, he
                    wrote from a strong personal bias. Case&apos;s report of a widely publicized
                    fugitive slave case, for example, conveyed a deep outrage over the increased

                    triumphed,&quot; he wrote. &quot;When within forty years past, was it otherwise?
                    When will it be otherwise, so long as such mockery of all justice as the
                    Fugitive Slave law, remains the law of the Land?&quot; Several weeks later, Case
                    pointed out the irony of celebrating freedom on the Fourth of July when more
                    than three million African Americans were legally enslaved. Case described the
                    groans &quot;into the ears of Freedom&apos;s God&quot; that told &quot;the story
                    of a nation&apos;s confessed Hypocrisy . . . . Strange progress have we made

                        >Wisconsin</region></placeName> as &quot;the first judicial blow to the
                    monstrous&quot; Fugitive Slave Law. The widely publicized case carried
                    significance on two levels. First, the Wisconsin Supreme Court had acquitted
                    prominent abolitionist attorney Sherman Booth of charges of promoting the escape
                    of a fugitive slave. What Case recognized as cause for even greater celebration
                    was the upholding of the defense argument regarding states&apos; rights.
                    Reversing the doctrine used by southerners to justify slavery, the court agreed
                    that northern states were not legally bound to sanction slavery. Because each
                    state had power over slavery, the Fugitive Slave Law was unconstitutional and
                    could not be enforced. Furthermore, the court had upheld the opinion on appeal.
                    &quot;Years hence,&quot; Case wrote of this landmark decision, &quot;the year
                    1854... shall furnish a bright page amidst its general darkness.&quot;<hi

                <p>By July 1854, Case found himself in the middle of local efforts to defeat the
                    pro-Kansas-Nebraska Democrats in the coming fall elections. On July 1, a large
                    opposition group made up of men from several political parties came together in
                    a mass meeting. Attendees appointed Case to a committee to choose officers, to
                    draw up resolutions, and then to argue for their approval. Reflecting on the
                    surprisingly large and enthusiastic crowd packed into the county courthouse,
                    Case wrote of their earnest attention to Brenton&apos;s remarks and &quot;the
                    hearty and oft repeated cheers, which greeted all the speakers.&quot; After each

                <p>According to the editor of <hi rend="i">The Times</hi>, Brenton&apos;s defeat in
                            <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013933" reg="Fort Wayne"
                            >Fort Wayne</settlement></placeName> was due to the importation of
                    out-of-district voters, a frequent form of election fraud. Other explanations
                    seem equally likely. Brenton and Case had both supported the recently passed
                    state prohibition law, which divided local voters, particularly the town&apos;s
                    German Americans. Many immigrant voters opposed slavery in western territories,
                    but restricting the manufacture and sale of alcohol ran counter to their
                    cultural traditions. Furthermore, German Americans distrusted the faction of
                    anti-immigration Know Nothings within the People&apos;s Party.<hi rend="sup"

                <p>At the end of July 1855, James P. Brown, a young man from <placeName><region

                    described as &quot;mulatto,&quot; was arrested under Article XIII of the revised
                    Indiana Constitution and brought before Allen County Circuit Court Judge James
                    Borden. Borden was a prominent Democrat who four years earlier had served as one
                    of the county&apos;s two representatives to the state constitutional convention.
                    Now, as judge of the Court of Common Pleas, Borden was tasked with enforcing the
                    provisions of the new state constitution. Case and Lindley Ninde, another
                    attorney known for his strong Free Soil views, volunteered to represent the
                        defendant.<hi rend="sup">20</hi></p>
                <p>Case argued that Brown did not meet the narrow definitions of &quot;negro, a full
                    blooded African&quot; or &quot;mulatto,&quot; a person half-black and
                    half-white, intended by Article XIII. Furthermore, he claimed that since there
                    was no proof of Brown&apos;s race, there was no justification for his arrest.
                    The prosecutor insisted on the meanings of &quot;negro&quot; and
                    &quot;mulatto&quot; as defined by <placeName><region type="state"

                    black laws. Under these laws, persons with as little as one-eighth
                    &quot;negro&quot; blood were denied basic civil rights such as testifying
                    against a white person, voting, or serving in the militia. In what was
                    considered a major departure from his political colleagues, <list

                <p>The detailed coverage in <hi rend="i">The Times</hi> was a barometer of public
                    opinion. Like many northerners, the newspaper&apos;s editor, John Dawson, had
                    conflicting attitudes about race. While he adamantly opposed the extension of
                    slavery, he attacked abolitionists as troublemakers and ridiculed their advocacy
                    of social equality. Nevertheless, he drew a strong line against the enforcement
                    of laws that threatened basic concepts of social justice. He praised Case as
                    &quot;a friend of humanity and liberty.&quot; He described Article XIII as an
                    &quot;atrocious&quot; law &quot;that would shame the tyranny of

                    wearing a black skin, when he has no power to make it white.&quot; Dawson also
                    praised the local African American community, noting &quot;their quiet, orderly,
                    yet anxious watching of the whole proceedings.&quot; Moreover, he stressed that
                    his views were shared by the wider community and noted that many of his readers
                    had expressed &quot;aid and sympathy. &quot;<hi rend="sup">22</hi></p>

                    on horseback formed Frémont Clubs; Case spoke at rallies with local bands and
                    glee clubs, and a large presence of women and children. Again and again, Case

                    by his inauguration in early March, Buchanan had put together an administration
                    that favored southern interests. Within days of the new president taking office,
                    the Supreme Court&apos;s <hi rend="i">Dred Scott</hi> decision polarized the
                    nation. Slaves were recognized as property no different from any other; free
                    African Americans had no rights recognized under the Constitution; and
                    slaveholders could now take slaves into all new territories. Northerners
                    justifiably feared that slavery would soon become a national institution. The
                    more immediate concern, however, was whether or not the Buchanan administration
                    would enforce Douglas&apos;s policy of popular sovereignty in <placeName><region

                <p>As Congress adjourned in March 1857, Indiana&apos;s Tenth District had added

                    died at the age of 47. By August, Case was deep into the political stream as the
                    Republican candidate in a special election called to decide Brenton&apos;s
                    former seat. His Democratic opponent was none other than his early law partner,
                    James L. Worden, now Allen County circuit court judge.</p>
                <p>Throughout his late summer and fall campaign, Case seemed to walk on thin ice. He
                    had won the Republican nomination at a special convention on the third vote with

                    In conformity with the 1856 Republican platform, he believed that the federal

                    past nine years, Jenkinson argued that Case&apos;s views were consistent with
                    those of the Democratic Party prior to the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Case had an
                    &quot;unsullied moral character,&quot; Jenkinson wrote, a &quot;commanding
                    ability,&quot; and &quot;above all a deep hold...on the hearts and affections of

                <p>In the late fall and early winter of 1857, President Buchanan committed what

                    reversed his policy that the full <placeName><region type="state"

                    the decision of the recent proslavery convention in Lecompton to ask voters to
                    approve slavery with a simple vote for or against. Approval would bring
                    immediate statehood. If voters rejected slavery, those slaves already in the
                    territory would be allowed to remain. Moreover, the constitution could not be
                    revoked until 1864. In his annual message to Congress on December 8, Buchanan
                    blamed the <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007254" reg="Kansas"

                    to peddle influence. One all-night filibuster that extended from February 5 into
                    the early hours of the next day disintegrated into a brawl that made national
                        headlines.<hi rend="sup">31</hi></p>
                <p>In the early evening of March 10, 1858, Case gained the House floor for the first
                    time. Hours before, Speaker James Orr had denied the hearing of a minority
                    report of a select committee looking into charges that then-president-elect
                    Buchanan had intervened during the Supreme Court&apos;s deliberations on the <hi
                        rend="i">Dred Scott</hi> case. The charges seemed to be supported by
                    comments that Buchanan had made regarding the case in his inaugural address-days
                    before the Court&apos;s decision was announced. Congressmen were angry, weary,
                    and impatient to adjourn. As Case gained the floor, he met objections not from
                    Democrats but from fellow Republicans. Galusha Grow of <placeName><region

                    point of order. Morgan, neither willing to back down nor to take his seat,
                    insisted on his position and after lengthy give-and-take, a roll call determined
                    that a quorum was not present. The House adjourned for the day, and Case had to
                    wait until the next day for his maiden speech.<hi rend="sup">32</hi></p>

                <p>When he rose to speak on March 11, Case delivered a lengthy address on the
                            <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007254" reg="Kansas"
                            >Kansas</region></placeName> problem. Case explained that he felt
                    compelled to respond to Democratic Rep. James Hughes&apos;s endorsement of the
                    Lecompton constitution and its &quot;startling statements and bitter
                    charges.&quot; His purpose was neither to restate positions already made nor to
                    discuss the institution of slavery, which he had long abhorred and condemned.
                    Instead, he intended to restrict his remarks to the &quot;rights of
                    freemen&quot; in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007254" reg="Kansas"
                            >Kansas</region></placeName>. While &quot;every sentence&quot; of the
                    president&apos;s message had been &quot;provocative&quot; and
                    &quot;acrimonious,&quot; Case argued that Buchanan&apos;s charge that free-state
                    settlers were rebels grated especially &quot;harshly on American ears.&quot; He
                    reminded the president and House members that these settlers were their kinsmen;
                    many were &quot;old-fashioned Democrats.&quot; Moreover, free-state settlers who
                    backed the Topeka constitution, like the American colonists who rose up against
                    the British, had the right to consent to &quot;fundamental laws&quot; that were
                    &quot;to be imposed upon them.&quot; Buchanan and his predecessor Pierce were
                    responsible for &quot;a catalogue of crime such as has disgraced no other
                    civilized land in the nineteenth century.&quot; Hoping that his words would
                    reach his constituents back home, Case warned that voters would remember
                    Buchanan&apos;s address and &quot;pronounce a verdict upon its author similar to
                    that long since pronounced by posterity on those who libeled the patriots of
                    revolutionary times.&quot;<hi rend="sup">33</hi></p>
                <p>On March 23, the Senate approved the admission of <placeName><region type="state"
                            key="tgn_7007254" reg="Kansas">Kansas</region></placeName> to the Union
                    under the Lecompton constitution. The fight then raged in the House. On the
                    first of April, the House dealt the administration a blow when it passed the
                    compromise Crittenden-Montgomery Bill. Under this bill, the entire Lecompton
                    constitution would be submitted to voters in a supervised election. If defeated,
                    a new constitutional convention would be called. Gridlock resulted, however,
                    when the Senate refused to agree to the new provisions. The administration
                    fought to save face with a bill proposed by Indiana Rep. William H. English, an
                    anti-Lecompton Democrat. The so-called English bill offered <placeName><region

                    for building schools; a vote for the bill, however, would still be an indirect
                    vote for the Lecompton constitution. By the end of April, the English bill
                    cleared <list type="footnotes">

                    vote of 112 to 103. Case, together with fellow Indiana Republicans Schuyler
                    Colfax, David Kilgore, John U. Pettit, and James Wilson voted with the minority
                    opposition. For the time being, the administration had won a bitter victory in
                    its misguided effort to solve the <placeName><region type="state"

                <p>By the time that the House recessed on June 11, members had been frequently
                    missing roll calls, evidently seeking respite from the weeks of contentious
                    debates and late night sessions. The sergeant at arms was assigned to arrest
                    absent members at the theatre, at dinner parties, or at their boarding houses.
                    On May 17, Case was one of dozens of members returned to the House floor and
                    interrogated by the speaker. Many of the congressmen, Case included, found the
                    situation amusing. Responding to the summons, he replied that he had had a
                    &quot;very good&quot; excuse. He had left almost an hour after debate had ended
                    to go home for his dinner. When he returned, the House doors were closed, and,
                    he added: &quot;A man has to eat in <placeName>

                    Constituents welcomed him home with a brass band procession through the downtown
                    streets. Across the district, he recounted his story of the passage of the
                    Crittenden-Montgomery Bill-&quot;when the people triumphed&quot; in the
                    House-and he described the stillness in the chamber as the &quot;unbought people
                    took their triumph in silence.&quot; He also related the contrasting &quot;most
                    boisterous uproar in the House and galleries&quot; when the administration
                    succeeded in passing the English bill. He left unsaid that Buchanan&apos;s
                    victory had again split the Democratic Party and thereby strengthened the

                    his effectiveness before large crowds. Local supporters credited him with
                    thoroughly demolishing &quot;every inch of ground&quot; old-line Democrats
                    claimed &quot;to stand upon.&quot; In the middle of October, as election day
                    approached, Case spoke of the dream northerners shared of social mobility in the

                    thought, vote for Charles Case for a seat in Congress.&quot; Like other radical
                    Republicans who personally supported abolition, Case, in his campaign speeches,
                    emphasized how free western territories would benefit whites. He pledged that he
                    was &quot;in favor of the Territories of the United States being kept free for
                    the use of white men . . . . If you are in favor of free white men occupying the

                <p>In February, as the House debated the admission of <placeName><region
                            type="state" key="tgn_7007708" reg="Oregon">Oregon</region></placeName>
                    to statehood, Case took what appeared to be an inconsistent position. Like many
                    fellow Republicans, he condemned provisions in the territorial constitution
                    which excluded African Americans from moving into the state and denied their
                    rights to criminal justice. Nevertheless, he believed that admission of
                            <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007708" reg="Oregon"
                            >Oregon</region></placeName> under such a constitution was preferable to
                    citizens remaining subject to the corrupt proslavery territorial legislature.
                    Because the denial of legal rights to African Americans was a &quot;clear
                    violation of the letter and spirit of the Federal Constitution,&quot; Case
                    argued, the territorial constitution would become meaningless. When

                            >Oregon</region></placeName> statehood was put to the vote, Case sided
                    with a small majority, separating from antislavery leaders Giddings, Lovejoy,
                    and Grow.<hi rend="sup">41</hi> In the closing weeks of the 35th Congress, Case
                    might have found some solace in being part of a strengthened opposition party.
                    With fellow Republicans, he had called attention to the administration&apos;s
                    &quot;notoriously lax&quot; enforcement of international slave trade laws. In
                    defending the rights of African Americans to education and legal justice, he had
                    appealed to the nation&apos;s conscience. He could look forward to being part of
                    the majority party in the next Congress. More than ever, however, Case and his
                    fellow Republicans looked ahead to a Republican presidential victory in 1860 as
                    the only means to curb slavery&apos;s expansion and bring about national
                    reconciliation. Voters in the swing states of <placeName><region type="state"

                    Republican and the popular choice for House speaker, with treason for having

                    the military arsenal at Harper&apos;s Ferry, southerners were in no mood to
                    yield ground. For two months, they blocked Sherman&apos;s election. Finally, on
                    February 1, after forty-four votes, House members chose New Jersey Rep. William
                    Pennington as speaker. Although elected as a Republican, Pennington won some

                    claimed that they were sickened by the shouting and jeering from spectators in

                    and conspiracy; they threatened to withdraw from the Union. Republicans, with
                    cause, felt personally endangered. They insisted on their intent not to
                    interfere with slavery where it already existed. At the same time, they led
                    initiatives to limit the broad reach of Buchanan&apos;s powers. Over vehement
                    opposition, the House approved resolutions introduced by John Covode,

                <p>During the next few months, Case and fellow Republicans courted German American
                    voters with extravagantly staged events that included bonfires, processions of
                    Wide Awakes with flaming torches, and German bands. On at least three occasions,
                    enthusiastic campaigners raised poles to symbolize &quot;the attachment of
                    hundreds to principles which heretofore they refused to endorse.&quot; The most
                    impressive pole, 204 feet 7 inches tall, was hoisted by local German Republicans
                    in front of Turner Hall on August 31. In addition to these festivities,
                    Republicans twice drew crowds of a thousand people, mostly German, to
                    Colerick&apos;s Hall to hear the acclaimed hero of the 1848 German revolution,
                    Carl Schurz of <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007922" reg="Wisconsin"

                    had supported Douglas over Lincoln by a roughly three-to-two margin, Lincoln had
                    won the state. &quot;Republicans Be Glad!&quot; editor Dawson proclaimed. He
                    cautiously added, &quot;But let Wisdom and Urbanity be the governing principle
                    in your gladness.&quot; The long Democratic hold over the White House and
                    Congress had been broken. By the time Case returned for the lame duck session of
                    Congress in early December, however, the country was rapidly descending into
                        disunion.<hi rend="sup">53</hi></p>
                <p>In the interim between Lincoln&apos;s election and the reconvening of Congress on
                    December 4, seven states in the Deep South began formal procedures to secede
                    from the Union. Longtime threats, considered ploys to strengthen the power of
                    slave states, became a reality. On the opening day of the House, Isaac Morris,
                    an anti-Lecompton Democrat from <placeName><region type="state"
                            key="tgn_7007251" reg="Illinois">Illinois</region></placeName>,
                    immediately called for a unanimous pledge of loyalty to the Union, insisting
                    that Lincoln&apos;s election did not justify secession. Virginia Democrat
                    Alexander R. Boteler moved to create a special committee of one representative
                    from each state to consider President Buchanan&apos;s recent message relating to
                    the nation&apos;s crisis. Soon one representative after another offered
                    resolutions hoping to slow the secession movement, promote negotiations, and
                    somehow conciliate the South.<hi rend="sup">54</hi></p>
                <p>Case broke away from his more moderate colleagues to pursue an unpopular stand
                    against compromise. In a lengthy letter dated December 7 to the <hi rend="i"
                        >Daily Times</hi>, Case defended his vote against the formation of the
                    so-called Committee of 33 that the majority of House members had supported. He
                    was convinced that decisions to secede were irrevocable, even if secession meant
                    &quot;self ruin&quot; and the end of slavery. <list type="footnotes">

                <p>Through December, Republicans took generally conciliatory positions as southern
                    representatives resigned from committee assignments and confirmed their
                    intentions to follow the will of their states&apos; secession conventions. On
                    December 18, bowing to mounting pressure, Sen. John J. Crittenden of

                            >Kentucky</region></placeName> introduced a series of Constitutional
                    amendments that stunned Republicans. The six measures included proposals to
                    extend slavery into territories south of the 36-degree 30-minute line and to
                    guarantee that Congress would never interfere with slavery where it currently
                    existed. Two days later, <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007712"

                    first state to formally separate from the Union; others soon followed in its
                    wake. By the middle of January 1861, the House Committee of 33, under Ohio
                    Republican Chairman Thomas Corwin, still hoping for some reconciliation,
                    proposed resolutions contained in the Crittenden Amendments along with a
                    resolution to admit <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007566"

                    Ironically, at the end of the month, the House announced that President Buchanan

                <p>During these weeks of crisis, Republicans seemed to lack a common policy. They
                    were leaderless and increasingly open to appeasing southern extremists; some
                    held on to the hope that southern Union supporters would block further secession
                    and perhaps bring the &quot;fire eaters&quot; back. Congressmen were continually
                    flooded with petitions in support of the Crittenden Amendments. At the end of

                    December, President-elect Lincoln remained mostly silent, his policies largely
                    enigmatic. As David Potter argues, however, when the very survival of the nation
                    was at stake, Lincoln asserted his opposition to compromise and thus shaped
                    Republican policy. By mid-January, as they considered the report from the
                    Committee of 33, House Republicans followed Lincoln&apos;s guidance and began a
                    steady effort to reaffirm their principles against the expansion of slavery<hi

                <p>Case helped build the &quot;backbone&quot; that encouraged more moderate
                    Republicans to resist compromise. In a February 8 speech, he laid out a rebuttal
                    of &quot;every inch of ground&quot; used as justification for secession. Case
                    reminded House members that twelve years earlier, in 1848, Whigs, Democrats, and
                    Free Soil men had shared the current Republican policy prohibiting slavery in
                    territories. &quot;Who, for that cause, then threatened to destroy the
                    Government? Who then thought it a sufficient reason for interfering with the
                    Union, that parties in the North were committed to the policy of making all the
                    Territories free?&quot; he asked. Case reviewed selections from the writings of
                    Thomas Jefferson and Henry Clay that expressed the &quot;doctrine of the
                    &apos;irrepressible conflict&quot;&apos; in words stronger than any
                    &quot;employed by any member of the Republican party.&quot; In point after
                    point, he emphasized that current arguments justifying secession were nothing
                    new. The real cause of southern secession was the election of a president
                    &quot;opposed to the extension of chattel slavery,&quot; as Case declared:

                <p>In the last days of the 36th Congress, the Committee of 33 called for a vote on a
                    series of resolutions designed to save the Union. Seven resolutions presented on
                    February 27 ranged from the repeal of personal liberty laws and the denial of
                    &quot;any authority outside the slave States to interfere with slavery,&quot; to
                    measures to grant southerners additional protection of slavery under the
                    Constitution and to punish &quot;attempts at lawless invasion of any

                    single Indiana Republican voting with the minority. The following day, a
                    separate vote was taken on the Constitutional amendment to prohibit Congress
                    from interfering with slavery where it already existed (Article XIII, the
                    so-called Corwin Amendment). Case, again voting with the minority in opposition,

                        <hi rend="i">Fort Wayne Gazette</hi> in February 1873. A Congressional aide
                    during the years of crises leading up to the war remembered Case as one of the
                    men &quot;who composed the original antislavery party,&quot; an abolitionist
                    &quot;who always bitterly opposed slavery, but equally opposed any violation of
                    the law.&quot; Antislavery men &quot;were few in number, but they were
                    dreadfully hard workers, and hung on to their principles and objects with
                    bulldog like tenacity, and they won in the end, after years of

                <p>Charles Case&apos;s political career reminds us today of the underlying causes of
                    the tragic war fought 150 years ago. In his efforts to establish a moral compass
                    in his district, his state, and his nation, he stood as one of the leaders of a
                    debate over race and social justice that <placeName><settlement type="city"

                    and the nation at large chose to ignore in the decades after the war.
                    Case&apos;s record deepens our appreciation of the long, difficult paths that
                    lead toward fulfillment of the promises of our free democracy.</p>

                <p>My first encounter with Herman Wells, in April 1977, was a job interview for the
                    position of houseman at the chancellor&apos;s residence. I was working my way
                    through college at Indiana University and was responding to a notice posted at
                    the student financial aid office. The receptionist in Owen Hall ushered me into
                    the expansive, high-ceilinged room, painted a pale blue, where the
                    septuagenarian chancellor sat working at a roomy desk. Tall bookcases lined
                    opposite walls; old paintings hung on the wall between. Every available surface
                    was cluttered with <hi rend="i">objets d&apos;art</hi> and gewgaws. A bank of
                    open windows let in the springtime air, faintly perfumed with blossoming trees
                    and flowers.</p>
                <p>I strode to greet him, my hand outstretched. Noticing my entrance, Wells
                    struggled to rise from his chair, but he could not quite make it. With a rueful
                    smile, he grabbed my proffered hand and pulled firmly, slowing easing his bulk
                    upright. As he stood before me, a few inches shorter than my six feet, I noticed
                    his large head, with wavy white hair and a small mustache, bright blue eyes
                    beneath bushy eyebrows, an <list type="footnotes">

                    tailor-made clothes. Fixing me with a relaxed and radiant smile, he introduced
                    himself and directed me to sit in the unusual three-cornered chair beside his
                    desk - a Colonial roundabout - providing me with a brief account of its
                    provenance.</p>
                <p>Wells proceeded to tell me about the history of the houseman tradition, which
                    dated to the beginning of his IU presidency in 1937, and explained the duties of
                    the position. Prompted by his questions, I told him about my studies in
                    psychology, my employment history, and growing up in <placeName><settlement
                            type="city" key="tgn_7013437" reg="Bloomington"
                        >Bloomington</settlement></placeName>. He was pleased to know that my
                    father, a public accountant, had obtained his business education at IU in the
                    1950s. As the interview came to a close, Wells remarked, with a twinkle in his
                    eye, that I would have to pass muster with the house staff, too, in order to
                    gain employment. When I stood up to take my leave, I extended my hand to the
                    seated chancellor. Wells once again grasped it firmly to lever himself out of
                    the chair, all the while telling me how pleased he was to meet me. He never
                    spoke about this small gesture of mutual aid, and it took me a long time to
                    realize that, with this ritual exchange, he was inviting me into the Wells
                    circle. It was also my introduction to what I would later call his total lack of
                    self-consciousness.</p>
                <p>That radical un-self-consciousness was part and parcel of Wells&apos;s unselfish
                    approach to life and provided the foundation for his extraordinary career of
                    public service. His life spanned nearly the entire twentieth century, from his
                    birth in 1902 to his death in 2000, and he was associated with Indiana
                    University for nearly eighty years, beginning with his first student days in
                    1921. Joining the faculty in 1930, he was selected as president in 1937,
                    spending decade after decade in faithful, innovative leadership. During his
                    twenty-five years as university executive, he brought IU from its position as a
                    decent, if provincial, institution to the front ranks of American research
                    universities. He oversaw a tremendous expansion of enrollment, recruited a
                    faculty of talent and enthusiasm, and transformed the physical plant into a
                    campus of surpassing beauty and cultural achievement. His accomplishments cannot
                    be easily summarized because he lent a hand to everyone concerned about the
                    university and its academic community, and everything from program development
                    and administrative operations to advocating the interests of IU on the local,
                    state, national, and global levels. He gave unstinting support to Alfred C.
                    Kinsey&apos;s right to conduct his research without institutional interference;
                    vigorously encouraged Wilfred C. Bain&apos;s efforts to include opera in his
                    quest to improve the School of Music; and found innovative ways to fund the
                    Russian and Eastern European Institute, <pb n="363" id="VAA4025-107-4-081"/>
                    under Robert F Byrnes, as the first among a host of international area studies
                    programs. In 1962, when Wells was promoted to the new post of university
                    chancellor, he served as IU&apos;s educational ambassador, long-range planner,
                    and chief fundraiser. His contributions to the welfare of the university were
                    widely known, and he became the acknowledged paterfamilias of the great IU clan.
                    A legend in his own lifetime, his elevation to iconic status caused Wells some
                    private consternation.</p>
                <p>I graduated in 1979 with my baccalaureate degree and finished my work as a Wells
                    houseman. The following year, Wells presented me with an inscribed copy of his
                    new autobiography, <hi rend="i">Being Lucky</hi>. I remember reading through it
                    with enthusiasm, and marveled at the scope and range of his extraordinary
                    career. I especially enjoyed learning about his parents and his undergraduate
                    days at IU. But I was disappointed. Somehow the narrative did not capture the
                    personality of the man that I had come to know - his remarkable empathy and
                    interpersonal skills, his lack of ego, his sly sense of humor. <hi rend="i"
                        >Being Lucky</hi> was a recounting, with a few vivid descriptions, of a life
                    of public service by a dignified and humble individual.<hi rend="sup">1</hi></p>
                <p>By many accounts, Wells was a great man, with a great career that transformed one
                    of America&apos;s heartland universities into a player in national and global
                    scholarship and service. In seeking to understand such individuals, we often
                    look for great beginnings, or at least for some clue as to what lies in wait for
                    fuller expression. Embarking on my biography of Wells in 1999, I sought to
                    explore how and why an individual comes to embody an institution. My research
                    led naturally into questions relating to his childhood, family environment, and
                    psychosocial development into adulthood. For sources of information and clues to
                    his personal evolution, I drew on my association with Wells as an employee and a
                    member of his elective family, on interviews and consultations with other people
                    who knew and observed Wells, and on the documentary record, which is sparse for
                    his early years. Complicating my interpretive pursuit was Wells&apos;s nearly
                    total silence, either orally or in writing, regarding his personal feelings,
                    interpersonal relationships, and emotional trials. Here was a truly public man
                    who maintained a sphinx-like silence about his private life.<hi rend="sup"

                <p>One of the few sources available was <hi rend="i">Being Lucky</hi>, which
                    presented a positive version of his early life in accordance with his persona as
                    a public servant. Based upon my personal acquaintance with Wells and my study of
                    individual psychology, I attempted to penetrate beyond the optimistic scrim of
                    his autobiography. I followed my hunches, combined them with information from
                    other sources, and pieced together significant episodes that shed light on the
                    development of this remarkable leader. I chose not to include such materials in
                    my biography, <hi rend="i">Herman B Wells: The Promise of the American
                        University</hi>, mainly because of the dearth of verifiable sources.<hi

                <p>What follows is an interpretation of Wells&apos;s early life, as he matured from
                    a pre-teen to a young adult. In contrast to the benign and mostly sunny portrait
                    in <hi rend="i">Being Lucky</hi>, Wells faced a number of important challenges
                    to his emerging identity and sense of self, which threw him back on his own
                    resources, time and again. During and after these private trials, Wells made
                    some crucial choices that had significant later consequences for his personal
                    development, both as an individual and in relation to others.</p>
                <p>Herman learned early on to help with the household chores, which were
                    considerable living on ten acres in rural <placeName><settlement type="city"

                    assist his mother Bernice, a housewife, with the shopping and gardening. His
                    father Granville worked as a banker; his masculine demeanor was reserved and
                    undemonstrative.</p>
                <p>In 1914, shortly after the <hi rend="i">Indianapolis Daily Times</hi> penetrated
                    the Jamestown-area market, Herman wanted to buy a newspaper route. Realizing
                    that it might conflict with the schedule for the Jamestown Boys Band, for which
                    Herman played alto horn, his father initially said &quot;no.&quot; Pestered by
                    his son, Granville eventually relented, figuring that it might provide a good
                    introduction to small-business management. To acquire the necessary capital,
                    Herman went to the bank with &quot;whose workings he was so familiar&quot;

                <p>Herman faced stiff competition for subscribers. The daily <hi rend="i">Times</hi>
                    was a direct competitor with the <hi rend="i">Indianapolis News</hi>, both with
                    statewide coverage. The <hi rend="i">News</hi>, referred to as &quot;The Great

                        >Indiana</region></placeName> newspaper. Since most local residents would
                    take only one daily paper (sometimes in addition to the weekly <hi rend="i"
                        >Jamestown Press</hi>), Herman had to persuade people to take the <hi

                        >News</hi>, convince them to switch.</p>
                <p>The stout twelve-year-old turned out to be a natural salesman. He touted the <hi
                        rend="i">Times</hi> so enthusiastically that he built up his route to more
                        <pb n="366" id="VAA4025-107-4-084"/> than one hundred customers. The money
                    he earned went into the toy bank bought by his parents shortly after his birth
                    for his college fund. His success as a carrier was proudly noted by his parents,
                    and was soon incorporated into family lore.<hi rend="sup">5</hi></p>
                <p>Herman enjoyed accompanying his father on occasional visits to the
                            <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2032388" reg="Jamestown"
                            >Jamestown</settlement></placeName> bank, meeting his father&apos;s
                    coworkers, and puttering around with simple jobs. As Herman grew and spent more
                    time out of the household orbit, Granville took a real interest in teaching him
                    about his work in banking and fiduciary management. When Herman was thirteen,
                    Granville started giving his son more responsibility. During school holidays, he
                    learned to operate the bank&apos;s mechanical Burroughs Posting Machine, devised
                    to automate bookkeeping procedures. The bulky piece of equipment was designed
                    for a standing adult, so Herman had to perch upon a wooden box to reach the
                    keyboard. He was justifiably proud of his newfound skill, which was a real
                    contribution to the bank&apos;s operation, and pleased that he made his father
                    proud. His father boasted later that Herman &quot;was practically raised in a
                        bank.&quot;<hi rend="sup">6</hi></p>
                <p>During adolescence, Herman&apos;s body grew taller and rounder. Not fond of
                    sports, he kept busy with school and work and other interests such as the civic
                    band. His mother suffered a serious attack of tuberculosis, a dread disease at
                    the time, but she recovered with no lasting effects. Family concern was
                    heightened because both Bernice and Granville had a brother and a sister who
                    died of the disease. This picture of Herman&apos;s pre-teen years comports with
                        <hi rend="i">Being Lucky</hi>&apos;s idealized account of his formation in
                    small-town Indiana.</p>
                <p>Granville, who had turned 40 in 1914, had achieved a measure of professional
                    success and financial stability, and he was universally admired for his
                    contributions to the local community. He had a dignified public persona, but at
                    home, he was often bedeviled by personal demons and suffered greatly from
                    melancholy moods. Herman later recalled: <quote rend="blockquote">He was cordial
                        and courteous to every person with whom he came into contact, and yet there
                        was about him a reticence and reserve that appeared to be a part of his
                        general seriousness. <list type="footnotes">

                    But Granville&apos;s punctiliousness had evolved into a consuming introspection,
                    and he ceaselessly worried about his responsibilities. A perfectionist, he felt
                    depressed when he was unable to meet his own high standards.<hi rend="sup"

                <p>In August 1914, things had gotten so bad that something needed to be done to
                    alleviate Granville&apos;s nervous exhaustion. On the morning of August 26,
                    Granville got on the train to <placeName><settlement type="city"

                    for a few days at the Martinsville Sanitarium. The facility was perhaps the most
                    famous among those that touted the healing properties of the artesian wells that
                    dotted the area. His departure only added to the serious worries that plagued
                    his mother, Jane Wells. Her headaches and depression had become unbearable, but
                    she continued her daily routines despite numbing anguish. One evening, she
                    prepared dinner, perhaps including some of her famous home-baked bread, and sat
                    down to eat with her husband Isaac and visiting grandson Wayne Gill,
                    Herman&apos;s seven-year-old cousin.</p>
                <p>After the meal, Isaac and Wayne left the room while Jane cleared away the plates
                    and put everything in order. Then she left the house, went to a nearby
                    outbuilding, and fashioned a leather noose made of a harness line. Attaching the
                    other end of the leather line to a rafter, she climbed a stepladder, put the
                    noose around her neck, and swung off. Less than a half-hour passed before Isaac
                    and Wayne discovered her lifeless body.</p>
                <p>In a brief article, the <hi rend="i">Jamestown Press</hi> reported that &quot;Ill

                    Martinsville Sanitarium. In her fifty-eight years, Jane Wells had buried a son
                    and a daughter, both victims of tuberculosis. In addition to Granville, she left
                    Earl, then a bachelor; daughter Roxie Revercomb; and three grandsons - Wayne
                    Gill, Gene Revercomb, and Herman Wells.<hi rend="sup">8</hi></p>

                <p>The three young cousins were close companions during summer visits to their
                    grandparents&apos; farm. Herman had recently turned twelve years old when his
                    grandmother died. Remembering her as a warm person, Herman later marveled about
                    the fact that she had made biscuits daily and bread regularly to please his
                    grandfather, who heaped scorn on &quot;punk,&quot; his term for commercial
                        bread.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> Due to his advancing years, Isaac eventually
                    lived for a time with Granville and Bernice. He was a fun-loving raconteur who
                    relished cigars and whiskey. Isaac spoke his mind and could be sarcastic when
                    confronted with small-mindedness. Herman adored him and took delight in his
                    contrary ways.<hi rend="sup">10</hi></p>
                <p>Although the documentary record is thin, one can surmise that the death of Jane
                    Wells generated significant changes in Herman&apos;s family environment. It
                    weighed heavily on Granville&apos;s mind, deepening his natural reserve and
                    heightening his propensity to depression. Socially stigmatized, suicide was
                    often viewed as a constitutional condition that ran in families. One can easily
                    infer that Granville considered this possibility and that Herman, young as he
                    was, might have gotten some inkling of this likely family taint. Perhaps Herman
                    pondered the starkly different approaches to life represented by Jane and Isaac
                    Wells.</p>
                <p>Granville was able to maintain his stoic and competent public persona, but
                    remained withdrawn and morose at home. Herman had to grow up quickly to cope
                    with his father&apos;s mood disorder. His mother Bernice relied increasingly on
                    her son as a confidant and ally in managing Granville, and he willingly did all
                    he could do to please his parents. Herman pleased his father immensely by
                    continuing to assist at the <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2032388"
                            reg="Jamestown">Jamestown</settlement></placeName> bank. He was a quick
                    study, with a knack for facts and figures. Small-town banks were a vital
                    institution in the economic life of rural America. They provided an array of
                    financial services to both individual customers and commercial clients, and
                    local bankers often dealt with matters of fiduciary delicacy and legal
                    substance. In addition to his cashier duties at the bank, Granville-who had read
                    law-was admitted to the <placeName><region type="county" key="tgn_1002188"
                            reg="Boone">Boone County</region></placeName> bar, which made him a more
                    valuable employee, especially in the transaction of contracts and trusts. Young

                    banking operations to the human issues of economic health and community
                    development.</p>
                <p>For Herman, keeping busy with productive work acquired a new urgency after his
                    grandmother&apos;s suicide and with his father&apos;s deepening depression. He
                    adapted to the uncomfortable situation, knowing that he was highly valued by his
                    parents. He worked harder -on his newspaper route, at the bank, on
                    schoolwork-and was able to keep anxiety at bay. As Herman matured, he was faced
                    with an essential tension between love for his father and the fear of being too
                    much like him. He developed heightened sensitivity to the feelings of others and
                    learned to guard the expression of his emotions.</p>
                <p>At the end of the summer of 1917, mumps, a common contagious viral disease that
                    infects the salivary glands, visited the Wells household. Both fifteen-year-old
                    Herman and his mother came down with it. A few months before, the family had
                    moved from the village of <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2032388"
                            reg="Jamestown">Jamestown</settlement></placeName> to the county seat of

                            >Lebanon</settlement></placeName> when his father had taken up duties as
                    deputy treasurer of <placeName><region type="county" key="tgn_1002188"
                            reg="Boone">Boone County</region></placeName>. Both Granville and
                    Bernice were cognizant of the advantages of the larger city, including an
                    excellent high school. Herman&apos;s entrance to Lebanon High School as a
                    sophomore was delayed for several weeks as he battled mumps and a troublesome
                    complication that affected some adolescent boys. In medical terminology, Wells
                    suffered from orchitis, an infection of the testes. Orchitis was a painful
                    condition, with scrotal swelling and extreme sensitivity to movement and touch.
                    It often impaired fertility, and, in some cases, led to sterility.<hi rend="sup"

                <p>Wells&apos;s parents worried about their son&apos;s future, and no doubt wondered
                    whether he could have children. Although no contemporary records have come to
                    light, we know that Herman had ample time to contemplate his future as he slowly
                    recuperated. Most young men of his age had begun thinking about romance and
                    interpersonal relationships. What would he find in high school, once he
                    recovered enough to actually start attending?</p>

                <p>With no access to Wells&apos;s thoughts, we can observe his behavior and look for
                    clues to see how he dealt with the consequences of this physiological anomaly.
                    Although on the large side, Herman was an attractive individual, well-groomed,
                    courteous, and with a pleasant smile. Socially adept, he made friends easily. He
                    was able to translate the knowledge gained working in his father&apos;s bank to
                    business affairs at school, and he served his class as treasurer for the
                    yearbook, newspaper, theatrical productions, and fund-raising schemes.</p>
                <p>Although Wells was voted &quot;Funniest&quot; and &quot;Best All-Around Boy&quot;
                    by his senior class peers, he did have to dodge cruel jabs at his size and
                    weight. In <hi rend="i">The Cedars</hi>, the yearbook of Lebanon High School,
                    many jokes were made at his expense. The caption of his senior picture mixed
                    satire with praise: &quot;Herman is known to the Hall of Fame for three
                    paramount reasons: first his minute size; second, his business head and
                    pecuniary wisdom; and third, his musical ability.&quot; The joke pages contained
                    a classified ad: &quot;Be an Athlete - reduce your weight by my new method of
                    reduction. Prof. H.B. Wells, Suite 706, Trust Co. Bldg., <placeName><settlement

                    smiling face was the object of good-natured ribbing: &quot;School Flower Garden

                    Like Herman Wells.&quot; In the yearbook, the name of every senior had a zany
                    limerick attached to it, save one that needed no further identification: <quote
                        rend="blockquote">Words would we waste if we told you this name;<lb/> It

                    drawing of an obese weightlifter with a sash across the chest reading
                    &quot;Herman the Fat Boy.&quot; One final example of the textual teasing
                    appeared in the want ads section: &quot;Wanted - someone to love a fat man -
                    Herman Wells.&quot; Wells left no record of his reaction to the persistent
                    teasing. Perhaps it was balanced out by his popularity, which was based on a
                    genuine respect for the young man and his many accomplishments.<hi rend="sup"

                <p>There is no evidence that Wells ever had a date, a romance, or any erotic
                    attachment in his three years of high school. Many years later, Wells explained
                    that he had simply been too busy: &quot;With my studies, extracurricular
                    activities, and several hours of outside work, I had little time for dating,
                    dances, or social functions other than those held at school.&quot; As he looked
                    back much later, he saw that he made a successful transition to permanent
                    bachelorhood. In high school, he learned how to balance his perceived
                    unsuitability for intimacy with a need for affiliation and attachment. He became
                    a friend to all, and a useful one to boot. Always smiling, he reaped praise and
                    goodwill and was valued for his financial skills and business sense.<hi

                <p>Herman&apos;s parents, both former elementary school teachers, expected him to go
                    to college. His father had attended the Normal School in <placeName><settlement

                        Haute</settlement></placeName> for a time but did not finish. In high
                    school, Herman had picked up the idea of going to business school, a recent
                    addition to the university curriculum, and decided to attend the University of
                    Illinois, home of the outstanding business school in the Midwest.</p>
                <p>Wells spent the summer after his high school graduation running a small bank in
                            <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2034132" reg="Whitestown"
                            >Whitestown</settlement></placeName>, a village of less than five
                    hundred located ten miles southeast of <placeName><settlement type="city"
                            key="tgn_2032587" reg="Lebanon">Lebanon</settlement></placeName>. The
                    bank had been formed in competition with an established local bank in an era
                    when few rules governed bank charters and when <placeName><region type="state"
                            key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> averaged
                    more than ten banks to a county - nearly 1,100 banks across the state serving
                    ninety-two counties. With agricultural mechanization and farm consolidation
                    leading to heavy loan demands on banks, and with high commodity prices fueling
                    continued growth, the summer of 1920 was a boom time for <placeName><region

                    able to save a substantial amount of money for college. He knew that although
                    his parents were supportive of college, they had slim means to help with
                        expenses.<hi rend="sup">14</hi></p>
                <p>In September, Wells went to <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013576"

                    residence, where he was treated like a family member. &quot;Even so,&quot; Wells
                    reported, &quot;I was wretchedly homesick.&quot; He did <list type="footnotes">

                <p>At midyear, Wells was invited to pledge a fraternity, but he had already decided
                    to leave <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007251" reg="Illinois"

                    IU, and that his IU associations would prove valuable to his future. But the IU
                    School of Commerce and Finance was still a fledgling operation, having started
                    in the fall of 1920. Wells finally convinced his father-another step toward
                    forming an independent life.<hi rend="sup">16</hi></p>

                    &quot;wonderfully stimulating, exciting spirit&quot; pervading the verdant
                    woodland campus. The student body was about half the size of <placeName><region

                    with gusto in undergraduate life.<hi rend="sup">17</hi></p>
                <p>In 1922, at the end of his sophomore year (his first in <placeName><settlement

                            >Whitestown</settlement></placeName> bank that had employed him
                    previously. The pay was generous-$200 a month, even more than the going rate for
                    college graduates. Wells was sorely tempted. It would mean giving up his vague
                    and unformed academic ambitions in favor of a respectable entry-level job in his
                    chosen field. His personal finances were tight, and a year-old nationwide
                    recession showed no signs of letting up. Although he had been captivated by
                            <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                            >Indiana</region></placeName>&apos;s spirit of place, he was willing to

                <p>Not surprisingly, his father was opposed to Herman taking the job, probably
                    worried that once his son got away from college, he would find <list

                    understood that taking the job would mean an open break with his father. He
                    remained the dutiful son, acceded to his father&apos;s wish, and stayed in
                    school.</p>
                <p>With his direction set, at least for the next two years, Wells immersed himself
                    in college life - attending classes and studying, living and having fun at the
                    Sigma Nu chapter house, hanging out at the Book Nook eatery, and, on Sunday,
                    going to the First Methodist Church. He continued to exercise his talent for
                    making and keeping friends. He also developed his skills in economics and
                    business, in the classroom and beyond. He became a moneylender to his friends,
                    charging them a small amount of interest for temporary loans. According to one
                    of his fraternity friends, Wells bought a big armoire for his room at the
                    chapter house and did a brisk business storing tuxedos under lock and key. When
                    a brother came to claim his formal wear before a dance, Wells extracted
                        payment.<hi rend="sup">18</hi></p>
                <p>He served as Sigma Nu treasurer as well as Union Board treasurer, and was elected
                    Eminent Commander of his fraternity for his senior year to oversee fundraising
                    efforts for chapter house renovations. Thus he continued a pattern begun in high
                    school, serving the needs of the group through exercising his financial acumen.
                    And he continued another pattern - eschewing romantic or erotic relationships in
                    favor of platonic friendships.</p>
                <p>Wells did fall in love, as he reported later, but with a place, not a person. He
                    was fascinated by the university and loved its verdant setting, the community it
                    attracted, and the spirit of the place. He summarized his encounter with the <hi

                    &quot;Those years revealed a hitherto unimagined world to a small-town
                    boy.&quot; Through his undergraduate experience, Wells entered into a fellowship
                    beyond his family of origin. He felt a sense of belonging to the university,
                    whose ideals and traditions captivated his interest. <hi rend="i">Alma

                    sustenance, including novelists Willa Cather, Carl Van Vechten, Edith Wharton,
                    Zona Gale, and Sherwood Anderson. These authors and others, in his words,
                    &quot;opened new vistas of the human condition and revealed Huneker&apos;s
                    &apos;pathos of distance.&apos;&quot;<hi rend="sup">20</hi> James Huneker was a
                    journalist and critic who reviewed music, art, and drama. The title phrase of
                    his book <hi rend="i">The Pathos of Distance: A Book of a Thousand and One
                        Moments</hi> (1913) was borrowed from Friedrich Nietzsche&apos;s
                    philosophical writings, relating to the differences between self and other that
                    provide a basis for critical judgment. Huneker simplified the concept to apply
                    to aesthetics: &quot;Distance lends pathos, bathes in rosy enchantments the
                    simplest events of a mean past; is the painter, in a word, who with skillful,
                    consoling touches disguises all that was sordid in our youth.&quot;<hi
                        rend="sup">21</hi> In Nietzsche&apos;s ethics of virtue, however, the term
                    can also refer not only to critical judgments about the external world but also
                    to the process of human improvement through self-fashioning. Taken in this way,
                    it offers a tool for identifying, refining, and integrating disparate parts of
                    the self through self-discipline and self-understanding. The task is difficult
                    and never ending.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> This self-fashioning allows the

                <p>Wells, like everyone else, did not choose the circumstances of his birth, nor the

                    returning to work at his father&apos;s bank and living with his parents for two
                    more years. In 1926 he left home again, this time for good, to pursue a
                    master&apos;s degree in economics at IU. It would take another four years before
                    he got his foot on the academic ladder, as an instructor in economics at the
                    university. As he progressed administratively, to dean in 1935 and acting
                    president in 1937, he proved to be a talented executive as well as a discerning
                    ally and exponent of <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"

                <p>As president of Indiana University from 1937 to 1962, Wells embodied the caring
                    heart of a great institution. He rejoiced in the development of scholarship,
                    both by students and faculty, and was always looking for ways that the
                    university could serve the needs of the state and the nation. On the other hand,
                    he was often the chief official mourner when a member of the IU family passed
                    away. The collective grief of World War II was personalized by the death of
                    politician Wendell Willkie in October 1944 and of journalist Ernie Pyle six
                    months later. Striking closer to home was the demise of Wells&apos;s closest
                    friend and sole confidant, IU vice president and treasurer Ward Biddle, in May
                    1946. Biddle had mentored Wells for over twenty years. Two years later, in early
                    March 1948, the president was on a mission to restore the German education
                    system when news came that writer Ross Lockridge Jr. had committed suicide in
                            <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013437" reg="Bloomington"
                            >Bloomington</settlement></placeName>, just two months after the
                    publication of his brilliant novel <hi rend="i">Raintree County</hi>. The season
                    of death was not over yet for Wells, however. On March 20, 1948, his father
                    Granville swallowed poison in an attempt to take his own life. He died later
                    that day in the hospital, aged 73.</p>
                <p>In taking on his adult role as university leader and the head of the great
                    Indiana University clan, Wells redeemed his father&apos;s parental deficiencies.
                    He chose to accentuate the man&apos;s many positive qualities-his
                    civic-mindedness, his deep sense of honesty and fairness, his chosen role as a
                    trustworthy fiduciary-and to emulate them. The negative attributes - the
                    self-centeredness of Granville&apos;s black moods, his inability to engage on
                    the domestic front, his suicidal end-Wells took care to mitigate or avoid in his
                    own life.</p>
                <pb n="376" id="VAA4025-107-4-094"/>
                <p>The two great stresses-one social and one physiological-of his childhood did not
                    cripple Wells, but made him stronger as he navigated to adulthood. Looking for
                    love and approval outside of his nuclear family led him to enlarge his talent
                    for friendship. Able to smile and keep moving through his own psychological
                    storms, he discovered acceptance, joy, and solace in friends and colleagues.
                    Whatever residue of youthful disappointment and hurt remained, Wells transformed
                    it through a private alchemy. The affable and charming educator learned to
                    adapt, doing the best with what he had, in the place he was, and found his
                    vocation in serving others.</p>

                <p>Dixie Kline Richardson confesses that for thirty-five years, she has been in love
                    with Baynard Hall, who died in 1863. She further claims to know him perhaps
                    &quot;as well as he can be known&quot; (p. v). Her infatuation with Hall, the
                    first principal and faculty member of Indiana University, is evident throughout
                    the text, which offers a sympathetic and thorough account of Hall&apos;s life as
                    well as an engaging look into his eyewitness portrayal of <placeName><region
                            type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                        >Indiana</region></placeName> in the early 1800s.</p>
                <p>In 1824, Hall and his family settled just north of the territory known as the New
                    Purchase, which had recently been obtained through a treaty signed with local
                    Indian tribes. Although Hall never lived on those treaty lands, he titled his
                    book <hi rend="i">The New Purchase: or, Seven and a Half Years in the Far
                        West</hi>. The book, first published in 1843, offers a rare depiction of
                    early <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                            >Indiana</region></placeName> life, including the dialect of the local
                    citizens, their food, their travel challenges, and the illnesses they endured.
                    It also provides a brief history of the formation of Indiana University; of its
                    first president, Andrew Wylie; and of the &quot;Faculty Wars&quot; that
                    threatened the existence of the new college.</p>
                <p>Hall&apos;s book is a historical treasure, and because he was an educated man,
                    his reflections provide a particularly valuable window into <placeName><region
                            type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                        >Indiana</region></placeName>&apos;s early history. Nevertheless,
                    Hall&apos;s prose style is ponderous. Richardson acknowledges that his
                    &quot;deliberate jumble of time and his unintentional forgetfulness make it
                    virtually impossible to outline events in strict chronological terms&quot; (p.
                    103). In addition, Hall uses thinly disguised pseudonyms for all his major
                    characters and locations (including two pen names for himself), and he fails to
                    distinguish between fictitious and factual accounts. As a result, even the most
                        <pb n="378" id="VAA4025-107-4-096"/> diligent reader can easily become
                    bogged down in Hall&apos;s text.</p>
                <p>Yet Richardson clearly accomplishes her goal of reinvigorating interest in Hall
                    and his book. She breathes new life into Hall&apos;s history by lifting
                    captivating accounts from his cumbersome rhetoric. The reader is treated to
                    humorous vignettes, such as the description of one of the Halls&apos;s earliest
                    encounters with their new <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                            reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> neighbors, who served corn
                    pones &quot;hard enough to do execution from cannon&quot; during one night spent
                    in a &quot;miserable cabin...a barbarous rectangle of unhewed and unbarked
                    logs&quot; (pp.52-53). Poignant accounts, including the burial of an Indian baby
                    and the loss of loved ones to scarlet fever, illuminate the hardships of life
                    that are otherwise buried in Hall&apos;s prose. Throughout, Richardson places
                    Hall&apos;s story into historical context, and she includes many anecdotes that
                    significantly add to Hall&apos;s memories of events.</p>
                <p>By meticulously documenting Hall&apos;s life story and offering insight into his
                    personal trials, Richardson hopes to &quot;set the record straight&quot; on a
                    man she believes to have been &quot;misunderstood, misjudged, and misread&quot;
                    (p. i). Whether or not she succeeds in accomplishing that goal will depend on
                    the views of her readers, some of whom, for example, may consider Hall&apos;s
                    harsh depiction of IU president Andrew Wylie unforgivable.</p>
                <p>A brief listing and description of the editions of Hall&apos;s book (including
                    James Woodburn&apos;s 1916 centennial edition), would have been helpful. The
                    lack of in-text citation is the only other detraction from this otherwise

                    the famed author and Civil War soldier. &quot;First and foremost,&quot; she <pb

                    intelligent man,&quot; yet he sometimes played &quot;fast and loose with the
                    truth&quot; (p. 237). In life and letters, Wallace used war as an opportunity to
                    acquire fame and fortune. His 1906 autobiography, while wonderfully descriptive,
                    remains &quot;maddeningly lacking&quot; in important details.</p>
                <p>Although author of the highly acclaimed <hi rend="i">Ben-Hur: A Tale of the
                        Christ</hi>, Wallace is best known for having gotten lost on the way to the
                    Battle of Shiloh (April 6-7, 1862). Confused by contradictory orders to proceed
                    via conflicting routes, Wallace and the men of the 11th Indiana Regiment arrived
                    at the battlefield on the evening of April 6, too late in the day to be useful
                    to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. Gen. Don Carlos Buell, who arrived the same evening,
                    ferried his soldiers of the Army of the Ohio across the swollen <geogName

                    launched an offensive the following morning which turned the tide of the battle
                    and resulted in the Union&apos;s victory.</p>
                <p>Wallace became the scapegoat for the Union&apos;s near failure at Shiloh,
                    particularly when Northerners learned of the horrifying number of casualties.
                    Gen. Henry Halleck placed considerable blame on Wallace, arguing that his
                    incompetence in not arriving at the battlefield until evening nearly cost Grant
                    his army. Two months later, Wallace was reassigned to defend

                <p>Stephens provides an insightful, albeit brief, account of the native Hoosier and
                    his long life after the Civil War. She portrays him as an ambitious scholar,
                    gifted in oratory and with pen. In 1843, at the age of sixteen, Wallace worked
                    in the <placeName><region type="county" key="tgn_1002633" reg="Marion">Marion
                            County</region></placeName> clerk&apos;s office and wrote speeches for
                    legislators in his spare time. He expanded his literary pursuits with a novel
                    about the Spanish conquest of <placeName><country key="tgn_7005560" reg="Mexico"
                            >Mexico</country></placeName>, which was later published as <hi rend="i"
                        >The Fair God</hi> (1873). Although he joined the <placeName><settlement

                            >Indianapolis</settlement></placeName> militia, he was more interested
                    in studying law, the profession of his father and older brother. The outbreak of
                    the Mexican War inspired him to volunteer for the military. After the war, he
                    returned to <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                            >Indiana</region></placeName> where he practiced law. By the mid-1850s,
                    an interest in politics drew him into elective office. He became a prominent
                    Democrat and was elected to the Indiana Senate for one term. When the Civil War
                    erupted, he accepted a commission as colonel of the 11th Indiana Volunteer
                    Infantry. After the war, Wallace&apos;s legal acumen made him an ideal member of
                    both the military commission that <pb n="380" id="VAA4025-107-4-098"/> tried the

                    best-selling novel and earned him considerable fame. Over time, however,
                    Wallace&apos;s literary achievements would be eclipsed by the controversy
                    associated with his late arrival at one of the Civil War&apos;s greatest
                    battles.</p>
                <p>Well-researched, insightfully argued, and lucidly written, Stephens&apos;s
                    perceptive account of Lew Wallace provides a wonderful addition to the growing
                    literature on Hoosiers in the Civil War. Her story reminds us of how the events

                <p>William Wimberly, retired Presbyterian minister and author of <hi rend="i"
                        >Hanna&apos;s Town</hi>, grew up in <placeName><settlement type="city"

                            >Indiana</region></placeName>, surrounded by the &quot;uniquely
                    gorgeous&quot; nineteenth-century buildings that rise on the bluff above the
                    commercial district. With the perspective of a returned native son, Wimberly
                    undertakes a journey back to the years when this &quot;acropolis&quot; was
                    created. His purpose is to uncover the spirit of this earlier town in order to
                    explain the origins of <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2034008"
                            reg="Wabash">Wabash</settlement></placeName>&apos;s unusual, almost
                    religious, sense of pride and confidence.</p>
                <p>The author&apos;s leisurely journey begins in 1902 with the unheralded transfer
                    of the remains of town founder Hugh Hanna from the old cemetery near the
                        <geogName key="tgn_2746502" reg="Wasbash River">Wabash River</geogName> to a
                    new site on higher ground. The story then moves backward to the 1826 Treaty of
                    Paradise Springs, which opened the Miami Indians&apos; land to white developers,
                    and to the arrival of Hanna in 1835. In a roughly chronological progression,
                    Wimberly narrates the digging of the <geogName key="tgn_7026035"
                        reg="Wabash and Erie Canal">Wabash and Erie Canal</geogName> and the growth
                    of the town&apos;s commercial area. He relates the townfolks&apos; great
                    patriotic fervor to save the Union, in battle and on the home front. With
                    visceral detail, the author slogs through muddy streets and views historic fires
                    and floods. Along the way, church leaders, educators, and women&apos;s club
                    leaders tame the wilderness; civic fathers build the first courthouse and its
                    later grand replacement. Local villains and <pb n="381" id="VAA4025-107-4-099"/>
                    tabloid-variety scandals unfold. Material structures seem to replace community
                    members in importance as railroads arrive and palatial homes appear on the hill.
                    Almost inadvertently, it seems, Civil War veterans carry out their dream of a
                    fitting memorial by building one of the town&apos;s greatest jewels, the
                    magnificent Memorial Hall, next to the courthouse.</p>
                <p>Within this broad context, Wimberly introduces compelling individuals who
                    contributed to the town&apos;s spirit. The more interesting include town father
                    Hugh Hanna; New School Presbyterian minister Rev. James Thomson; Dr. James Ford,
                    physician and local Renaissance man; newspaper crusader Naaman Fletcher;
                    Catherine Caldwell, Civil War home front leader; lawyer and political leader J.
                    D. Connor; educator Adelaide Steele Baylor; and physician and Spanish American
                    War heroine Dr. Rosa Kidd Beere. Miami Chief Richardville and Indian traders are
                    particularly well researched. Likewise, Wimberly&apos;s narrative is
                    strengthened by accounts of the town&apos;s nineteenth-century Jewish and
                    African American communities.</p>
                <p>Readers interested in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                            reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>&apos;s pioneers will
                    appreciate <hi rend="i">Hanna&apos;s Town</hi> for its exhaustive research.
                    Likewise, historic preservationists will benefit from its detailed description
                    of nineteenth-century architecture. Less patient readers, however, may question
                    the author&apos;s narrative digressions. More importantly, readers may find
                    Wimberly&apos;s ambitious search for the underlying spirit of his town too
                    incomplete.</p>
                <p>Two occasions in particular raise intriguing questions about the town-and in
                    particular, its residents&apos; attitudes regarding race and the meaning of the
                    Civil War. In January 1866, townsfolk gave a reception and dance to honor
                    Indiana African American veterans of the horrific battles of
                            <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7022207" reg="Petersburg"
                            >Petersburg</settlement></placeName>, <placeName><region type="state"
                            key="tgn_7007919" reg="Virginia">Virginia</region></placeName>. While
                    the town was in the habit of welcoming returning soldiers, the interracial event
                    was &quot;especially poignant&quot; and &quot;graciously hosted by a mostly
                    white community&quot; (pp. 166-67). With further probing, Wimberly might connect
                    this celebration to the ministries of local churches opposed to slavery
                    (especially the New School Presbyterians) and to local Republicans&apos;
                    interpretation of the Declaration of Independence. In 1899, more than thirty
                    years after the war, when veterans dedicated Memorial Hall, had townspeople kept
                    the affirmation of liberty and racial justice alive? Was Memorial Hall intended
                    to represent more than the veterans&apos; own heroism and sacrifice in their
                    fight to save the Union?</p>
                <p>Finally, Wimberly&apos;s journey seems to end not at the new cemetery on top of
                    the bluff, but rather at the statue of Abraham Lincoln dedicated in 1932 on the
                    courthouse square. Symbolizing a commitment to compassion and justice, Lincoln
                    speaks to the town&apos;s proud past and points the way to the future.</p>

                            >Gary</settlement></placeName>, <placeName><region type="state"
                            key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>, is
                    punctuated by extremes. In the early twentieth century, the city was home to the
                    world&apos;s largest integrated steel mill complex, the Gary Works. During the
                    1960s, it became one of the nation&apos;s premier showcases for African American
                    political empowerment. By century&apos;s end, few places in the
                            <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United
                            States</country></placeName> displayed more severe symptoms of urban
                    distress. Because of these exceptional circumstances, the city was frequently
                    invoked in debates and discussions about the course of America&apos;s progress.
                    Paul O&apos;Hara takes full advantage of this prolific commentary in a book that
                    explores America&apos;s shifting views about industrial capitalism through the
                    lens of <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013797" reg="Gary"
                            >Gary</settlement></placeName>. While other scholars have chronicled the
                    unfolding of industrial development, social reform, racial politics, and
                    environmental activism within this fascinating city, O&apos;Hara is the first to
                    examine <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013797" reg="Gary"
                            >Gary</settlement></placeName> as an idea or, perhaps more accurately,
                    as a palimpsest upon which the rest of the nation projected its hopes, fears,
                    convictions, and assumptions. To this end, O&apos;Hara reveals
                            <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013797" reg="Gary"
                            >Gary</settlement></placeName> from the outside in, through the eyes of
                    journalists, novelists, filmmakers, and other observers who either visited the
                    steel town or passed through. As O&apos;Hara deftly demonstrates, it was these
                    image makers who vaulted <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013797"
                            reg="Gary">Gary</settlement></placeName> to national prominence and
                    allowed its history to narrate American culture in the twentieth century.</p>
                <p>The book&apos;s organization corresponds to three sequential phases of public
                    discussion, each guided by a distinctive set of themes and tropes. Early
                    commentary responded to the United States Steel Corporation&apos;s novel use of
                    geography to resolve the tension between industrial capitalism and social
                    harmony. Among admirers, <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013797"

                            >Chicago</settlement></placeName>&apos;s distant metropolitan periphery
                    and the internal demarcation of residential and work spaces inspired utopian
                    visions of industrial efficiency and effective social planning. Critics,
                    however, viewed the steel company&apos;s laissez-faire stance toward civic
                    affairs as an abnegation of corporate responsibility. This physical separation
                    of mill and town continued to influence public perceptions in subsequent
                    decades. <pb n="383" id="VAA4025-107-4-101"/> While the Gary Works trumpeted the
                    triumphs of mass production technology, the town&apos;s messy social scene
                    evoked frontier imagery. Alternatively, the town was a beacon of individual
                    opportunity and an unruly den of iniquity. After World War II, political
                    corruption, crime, racial discord, and de-industrialization produced a tale of
                    declension.</p>

                    analysis, but the author is careful to contrast national perspectives with
                    internally generated responses that flattered the city with an emphasis on
                    ethnic solidarity, a noble work ethic, and gritty masculinity. Taken together,
                    these conflicting narratives flesh out a self-portrait of America as it
                    struggled to reconcile a powerful manufacturing economy with a complicated array
                    of social repercussions. Although O&apos;Hara insists that these narratives
                    trace the &quot;ways Americans understood and felt about industrialism and
                    industrial spaces,&quot; (p. 4) the real storyline here is that concerns about
                    racial conflict in the late twentieth century displaced and disfigured a
                    national conversation about industrial capitalism.</p>

                <p><hi rend="i">A New Nation of Goods</hi> is a detailed yet wide-ranging study of
                    the manufacture and consumption of material goods in the provincial northeastern
                            <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United
                            States</country></placeName> between 1775 and 1850-a period after
                    provincial elites&apos; embrace of genteel goods, but before the materialization
                    of Victorian bourgeois culture. David Jaffee investigates the vital role played
                    by New England&apos;s provincial craftsmen in facilitating the emerging middle
                        <pb n="384" id="VAA4025-107-4-102"/> class&apos;s embrace of gentility. As
                    its title suggests, Jaffee&apos;s work is both a sequel and a rebuttal to
                    historians (most notably T. H. Breen, in his 1986 essay &quot;An Empire of
                    Goods&quot;) who have maintained that American culture was forged in
                    metropolitan ports during the colonial period. Instead, Jaffee maintains that an
                    American taste formed in rural New England after the American Revolution, as
                    producers modified elite goods in order to appeal to growing ranks of middling
                    consumers, formulating new methods of production and distribution along the
                    way.</p>
                <p>To support this broad claim, Jaffee focuses on four types of goods: clocks,
                    portraits / daguerreotypes, chairs, and books. He presents these artifacts not
                    as naïve-or folk-interpretations of established metropolitan types (still the
                    dominant view), but rather as unique design solutions that stemmed from
                    craftsmen&apos;s embrace of new techniques of mass production alongside
                    &quot;the concurrent development of a flexible marketing system&quot; (p. 181).
                    Jaffee argues that the itinerant peddlers, booksellers, and portraitists who
                    brought consumer goods to New England&apos;s gentry and middling sorts fueled
                    the production of ever more goods and simultaneously educated purchasers about
                    the material demands of gentility. Looking beyond the well-studied factories of
                            <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013975" reg="Lowell"
                            >Lowell</settlement></placeName>, <placeName><region type="state"

                    >Massachusetts</region></placeName>, he demonstrates that
                    &quot;industrialization took place outside the factory system&quot; (p.
                    187).</p>
                <p>The strength of Jaffee&apos;s work lies in his deft illumination of a more fluid,
                    &quot;grassroots&quot; (p. 296) form of industrialization, as individual
                    artisans took advantage of waterpower, available labor, and technological
                    innovation to forge regional ties and increase production. Chairs produced in

                    cut by waterpower in one city, legs turned on a lathe in a workshop in a
                    different city, and rush seats woven by women in surrounding farmhouses. In the
                    1850s, as manufacturing began to consolidate and the mobile, small-scale
                    entrepreneur was replaced with &quot;a more hierarchical structure&quot; (p.
                    296), Jaffee argues that middle-class consumers eschewed their independent
                    gentility, becoming reliant on metropolitan tastes and bound to urban centers of
                    production like <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7007567"
                            reg="New York">New York City</settlement></placeName>.</p>
                <p>Although readers will appreciate Jaffee&apos;s deft interweaving of the important
                    articles he has assembled over his career, his synthesis fails to elucidate
                    fully the connections between aesthetic choices and class identity.
                    Jaffee&apos;s concept of &quot;hybrid&quot; products that melded metropolitan
                    styles with local demand is suggestive, but is never fully developed. Why did
                    provincial middling consumers prefer stenciled chairs and meticulously
                    delineated portraits? Of all the goods used by colonial elites, why did middling
                    folks select clocks, chairs, and portraits as the constellation required for
                    gentility? If emulation <pb n="385" id="VAA4025-107-4-103"/> drove consumer
                    demand, then why did provincial consumers often purchase goods that looked
                    strikingly different from those used by metropolitan elites? Jaffee is hampered
                    in answering these questions by his loose and shifting definitions of the social
                    groups that constituted the emerging middle class, and by his selection of
                    illustrations. (There are no close-ups that allow readers to follow construction
                    details or decorative elements.) Despite these drawbacks, readers will
                    appreciate Jaffee&apos;s penetrating glimpse into the overlooked gap between the
                    consumer revolution and mass production and will come to appreciate the
                    important role played by small New England towns in crafting a new nation of
                    goods.</p>

                <p>In <hi rend="i">Hearts Beating for Liberty</hi>, Stacey Robertson argues that
                    western women held a distinctive place in the antislavery movement. Distanced
                    from the eastern split between the Garrisonian and anti-Garrisonian factions,
                    western women forged a unique antislavery stance that Robertson characterizes as
                    pragmatic, goal-oriented, and based on mixed-sex cooperation.</p>
                <p>Radical Garrisonians in the West were far more isolated and marginalized than
                    those in the East. Out of necessity, they built coalitions with Liberty Party
                    advocates (political abolitionists), church-based antislavery colleagues, and
                    those who helped fugitive slaves on the Underground Railroad. Robertson argues
                    that western Garrisonians had no choice but to cooperate with the various
                    anti-slavery factions while moderating their own radicalism. After all, she
                    states, <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio"
                            >Ohio</region></placeName>, <placeName><region type="state"

                            <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007251" reg="Illinois"
                            >Illinois</region></placeName> residents were generally more
                    conservative, more hostile to women&apos;s rights, and more racist in terms of
                    their Black Laws than those in the East. Since most westerners shunned
                    controversial Garrisonian positions like disunionism, nonvoting, and
                    women&apos;s rights, western antislavery activists developed a more flexible
                    approach based on forging coalitions and making compromises.</p>
                <pb n="386" id="VAA4025-107-4-104"/>
                <p>Robertson argues that the rural nature of the Old Northwest also determined which
                    types of abolitionism gained a foothold there. The free produce movement, for
                    example, worked well in the West, where a boycott of slave-made goods was less
                    of a sacrifice to rural farm families who did not rely on store-bought luxury
                    goods to begin with. Quaker men and women worked together to create relatively
                    successful free-produce publications and stores throughout the region. Robertson
                    points out, however, that &quot;advocacy of free produce often meant increasing
                    women&apos;s unpaid &apos;morally pure&apos; labor in the home. So while
                    boycotting slave-made produce might help immediate emancipation, it also
                    reinforced the binary of women as moral domestics and men as paid players in the
                    marketplace&quot; (p. 68).</p>
                <p>Some western abolitionist women also adopted the antislavery fair, which the
                    Garrisonian Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society had turned into a lucrative
                    fund-raiser. Western women were attracted to the fairs as respectable activities
                    that seemed to fall safely within &quot;a traditional feminine framework&quot;
                    of crafts, food, and charity (p. 97). Although most of their fairs did not raise
                    much money, Robertson suggests that they did help the participants gain
                    fellowship and support each other.</p>
                <p>The Liberty Party accepted women as fund-raisers, supporters, and
                    behind-the-scenes organizers, but not as independent members. Robertson
                    concludes that Liberty Party women&apos;s &quot;partisan knowledge and
                    participation did not necessarily lead them to advocate woman&apos;s rights or
                    woman&apos;s suffrage, but it did challenge the prevalent association of
                    politics with masculinity&quot; (p. 65). Western abolitionist women focused less
                    on suffrage and more on practical issues that could be linked to concrete
                    improvements in their communities, such as equal education and dress reform.
                    Although very few western women adopted the Bloomer costume since it was too
                    controversial, they were open to general dress reform ideas that promoted more
                    comfortable clothes and boots, thereby allowing women greater mobility and
                    flexibility in their rural terrain.</p>
                <p>When Garrisonian Abby Kelley lectured in <placeName><region type="state"
                            key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio">Ohio</region></placeName> in the mid-1840s,
                    she inspired many women to become abolitionists. She found, however, that they
                    focused on only certain priorities that meshed best with their region; one was
                    the laudable goal of promoting education for free blacks. Several women
                    abolitionists taught in black schools, braving hostility and violence from the
                    dominant white society. Initially, Robertson&apos;s claim that western women
                    established a unique approach, &quot;including a non-Garrisonian focus on
                    challenging racial inequality in the law and social settings,&quot; seems a bit
                    jarring (p. 129). After all, the Garrisonians Sarah and Angelina Grimké
                    developed close friendships with African Americans, invited a mixed-race group
                    of friends <pb n="387" id="VAA4025-107-4-105"/> to Angelina&apos;s wedding to
                    Theodore Weld, and fought against racial prejudice in the North. However, as
                    Robertson rightly points out, eastern Garrisonians such as Maria Weston Chapman
                    actually chided their western sisters for aiding fugitive slaves, describing
                    this life-saving work as a distraction and a mere palliative that would not help
                    achieve their true goal-an end to the evil system of slavery. Black and white
                    western abolitionist women ignored these rigid strictures and gained hands-on
                    experience in interracial cooperation as they fed and clothed the many fugitive
                    slaves whom they met and cared for. They also worked in interracial coalitions
                    to attack the region&apos;s Black Laws that restricted the rights of free
                    blacks.</p>

                <p>This is an ambitious book. As Judith Giesberg correctly explains, while
                    historians have extensively examined Southern women and middle-class Northern
                    women during the Civil War, there has been relatively little work on
                    working-class, rural, immigrant, or African American women in the North during
                    the conflict. The author uses a series of case studies to explore how different
                    types of Northern women, who often left little written record, experienced the
                    Civil War. Giesberg seeks to blur the distinctions between battlefield and home
                    front while simultaneously demonstrating how these women and the war affected
                    each other.</p>
                <p>Giesberg&apos;s case studies are wide-ranging thematically, including women
                    managing farms alone, seeking aid in relief shelters, working in munitions
                    factories, struggling to integrate street cars, and journeying to reclaim
                    soldiers&apos; bodies. Their geographical range is more limited-the

                    explained how and why she chose these locations and the particular women on
                    which she focuses, she would have aided the reader in understanding how
                    representative these case studies are and would have strengthened her assertions
                    about how Northern women in general acted and thought during the war.</p>
                <p>The book raises two constant themes: that &quot;the line separating the
                    battlefield from the home front had ... eroded during the war,&quot; and that
                    Northern and Southern women often experienced the conflict in similar ways (p.
                    16). In a needed corrective, Giesberg directly challenges Gary Gallagher&apos;s
                    argument that Southern women were distinctive in their enthusiastic support of
                    the Confederacy despite considerable wartime deprivation. She rightly insists
                    that the conflict deeply affected many Northern women, who in turn helped shape
                    the course of the war. Still, Giesberg may go too far, for real differences
                    remained between the difficulties faced by families on the Northern home front
                    and Union armies rampaging through the South. Her arguments-that &quot;though
                    popular images sought to create a sense of distance between home and the war,
                    women exposed that separation as largely imaginary,&quot; or that female
                    munitions workers were &quot;blurring the line between soldier and
                    civilian&quot;-sometimes feel strained (pp. 9, 76).</p>
                <p>Giesberg ambitiously engages a wide variety of theoretical models in a relatively
                    short book. James Scott&apos;s concept of &quot;infrapolitics,&quot; for
                    example, informs her discussion of how Northern women imagined free-labor
                    nationalism. She states that the &quot;book examines alternative wartime
                    geography&quot; and that &quot;the Civil War changed the way people on the home
                    front saw space and moved through it&quot; (pp. 10, 164). None of the
                    theoretical models, however, is fully developed.</p>
                <p>The critiques above arise only because Giesberg has written an ambitious book in
                    a relatively new field. This is the kind of work that provokes more questions
                    than it provides answers, exactly what the scholarship needs at this time.
                    Giesberg should be applauded for pushing the boundaries of scholarship and
                    helping to set the path for future research about women on the Northern home
                    front during the Civil War.</p>

                <p>Robert Hunt&apos;s <hi rend="i">The Good Men Who Won the War</hi> and Anne E.
                    Marshall&apos;s <hi rend="i">Creating a Confederate Kentucky</hi> each emphasize
                    how certain aspects of the Civil War were (and are) remembered. Considered
                    together, these books demonstrate the potential and the problems of a
                    memory-history paradigm, which on one level is simply a way of treating any and
                    all well-worn Civil War topics over again (the old book was about Sherman&apos;s
                    March, the new one is about the <hi rend="i">memory</hi> of Sherman&apos;s
                    March-in some cases, a distinction without a difference). Fortunately, these two
                    works have a great deal to offer on both sides of the fact-memory relationship.
                    Both are worth reading-together or separately.</p>
                <p>Hunt&apos;s primary research is conducted in regimental histories and memoirs
                    written by former soldiers who served in the Army of the Cumberland, mostly men
                    from <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio"
                        >Ohio</region></placeName>, <placeName><region type="state"

                            <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                            >Indiana</region></placeName>. He carefully limits his sources,
                    achieving very sharp focus. His goal-fully realized in this meticulous work-is
                    &quot;to evaluate how the authors included emancipation in their interpretation
                    of the North&apos;s victory in the Civil War&quot; (p. 1). Since the original,
                    announced purpose of the war was to the preserve the Union through a limited
                    campaign, every Union soldier had to come to grips with the big change to a
                    program of total war that destroyed the institution of slavery.</p>
                <p>In an epilogue, Hunt briefly develops his theories of the present-day American
                    way of war, which he sees as an extension and development of the hard
                    war/emancipation pattern traced for the first time in our history by the Union
                    Army, as exemplified by the Army of the Cumberland. The Cumberlanders remembered
                    and justified their total warfare &quot;as an emancipation event&quot; (p. 139).
                    Their goodness, their reputations as citizen-soldiers depended on it; it
                    constituted the point of the Civil War for them and for their nation.</p>
                <p>Marshall deals with the question of whether Kentucky became a Confederate state
                    after the war was over. Although <placeName><region type="state"
                            key="tgn_7007255" reg="Kentucky">Kentucky</region></placeName> never
                    seceded, although the state contributed many more troops to the Union Army than
                        <pb n="390" id="VAA4025-107-4-108"/> to the Confederacy, the answer-as
                    Marshall demonstrates with massive evidence-is yes. After establishing that
                            <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007255" reg="Kentucky"
                            >Kentucky</region></placeName> was probably more rebellious than the
                    Rebels, Marshall traces the impact of this extraordinary development in the
                    Commonwealth up to 1935 (in detail) and to the present (briefly)-with research
                    into Civil War memorial activity, the production of monuments, the staging of
                    conventions, and literature. The strongest aspect of this book is its scrutiny
                    of the development of a cultural memory that is simply false, the assumption or
                    pretense that <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007255" reg="Kentucky"
                            >Kentucky</region></placeName> was a member of the Confederacy, with all
                    the paraphernalia of legends, memorials, propaganda, organizations, and laws
                    needed to support an erroneous narrative of <placeName><region type="state"
                            key="tgn_7007255" reg="Kentucky">Kentucky</region></placeName> on the
                    losing side of the Civil War.</p>
                <p>Marshall&apos;s work is flawed by instances of careless research. For example,
                    she identifies the first president of Berea College as Charles Fairchild (p.
                    118) (his name was Edward Henry Fairchild-Charles was his son.) She states that
                    William Goodell Frost was president of Oberlin College before he became
                    president of Berea College (p. 119), when he was a professor at Oberlin, not a
                    president; she also mentions the &quot;fact&quot; that John G. Fee was a
                    Methodist minister (p. 13), but Fee was never a Methodist, nor did that
                    denomination influence his thinking. Given her themes and subject matter, she
                    could not afford such evident mistakes, the presence of which suggests that
                    there might be more.</p>
                <p>Hunt validates the memories of his carefully selected authors, comparing what
                    they remembered to what actually happened. He constructs a collective memory
                    from the narratives of the former soldiers, but the bases for his theorizing are
                    always personal, firsthand stories (and opinions) of men who served in the Army
                    of the Cumberland, men who were calling upon their own experiences. So
                    &quot;memory&quot; in Hunt&apos;s book means what we ordinarily mean by the
                    word. The former soldiers of the Army of the Cumberland are presented,
                    basically, as reliable witnesses, trying to come to terms with their remembered
                    wartime experiences in ways that illuminate &quot;what actually
                    happened.&quot;</p>
                <p>Marshall&apos;s sources are more diverse than Hunt&apos;s, as she explores
                    &quot;the strange ways in which Kentuckians remembered the Civil War&quot; (p.
                    xi). In fact, &quot;remembered&quot; is the wrong word. &quot;Memory&quot; in
                        <hi rend="i">Creating a Confederate Kentucky</hi> covers a wide spectrum of
                    lying, sentimentalizing, ignoring, covering up, forgetting, mythologizing,
                    believing your grandmother, and so on, through the various means by which human
                    beings delude themselves and others, creating powerful illusions that may last
                    for generations and beyond. A high percentage of Marshall&apos;s selected
                    authors are not reporting from first-hand experience-are not, in fact,
                    remembering. The creation of Confederate Kentucky involved a virtual <pb n="391"
                        id="VAA4025-107-4-109"/> eradication of &quot;what actually happened.&quot;
                    So Marshall, unlike Hunt, does not validate the accounts she explores-instead,
                    she repeatedly reveals how &quot;Civil War Memory&quot; does not square with the
                    facts. And, ironically, she wants her readers to remember what the actors in her
                    narrative forgot.</p>
                <p>The most significant common feature of these two books is not, however, their
                    consideration of memory versus facts. More strikingly, both authors discover
                    racism as the prevalent motivation in the alterations that Civil War
                    &quot;memory&quot; performs on history. The Cumberland soldiers claimed the
                    moral victory of emancipation without facing the failure of Reconstruction or
                    the position of freed slaves in postwar America; because the system of slavery
                    was destroyed by it, Kentuckians, by and large, rejected the Union cause that
                    they had formerly supported. Both Hunt and Marshall explore the role that
                    whiteness played in shaping these two quite different views of the Civil War. As
                    it turned out, the winners and the losers had one common lapse of
                    &quot;memory&quot; that would not be dealt with directly until the civil rights
                    era. What will we remember next?</p>

                <p>Through a detailed and engaging biography, Lori Ginzberg has attempted to
                    humanize the larger-than-life women&apos;s rights reformer, Elizabeth Cady
                    Stanton. Culling rich primary resources, Ginzberg explores Stanton&apos;s often
                    strained personal relationships, her ever-changing reform activities, and the
                    complicated connections between the two. Additionally, Ginzberg attempts to
                    place Stanton and her activism within the context of evolving conceptions of
                    gender within the dynamic nineteenth-century political debates over both
                    women&apos;s and African American rights that, as Ginzberg aptly shows, both
                    unified and polarized reformers themselves. Stanton was, in Ginzberg&apos;s
                    telling, an &quot;extraordinary American who, in many respects, lived a very
                    ordinary life&quot; (p. 8).</p>
                <p>Ginzberg argues that Stanton was one of the first reformers to devote <pb n="392"
                        id="VAA4025-107-4-110"/> her considerable intellectual and persuasive powers
                    exclusively to the cause of women&apos;s rights and that, in the process, she
                    came to define feminism and feminist reforms for generations. However, as
                    Ginzberg ably demonstrates, Stanton was also a mother who struggled with the
                    demands of raising a large family, a wife who mourned a strained and distant
                    relationship with her husband, a friend who frequently misunderstood the needs
                    of those who cared most about her, and a woman who loved comfort and luxury to
                    the point of hypocrisy.</p>
                <p>The greatest contribution of this work lies in its early chapters, where Ginzberg
                    explores Stanton&apos;s attraction to reform movements, her involvement in the
                    abolitionist cause, and her integral role in the women&apos;s rights movement up
                    to the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment. Particularly valuable is
                    Ginzberg&apos;s exploration of a number of prevalent myths surrounding
                    Stanton&apos;s childhood and early reform activities and their impact on her
                    ultimate women&apos;s rights work. Ginzberg contends that Stanton&apos;s own
                    fastidious editing of her papers resulted in inaccurate accounts of the
                    reformer&apos;s early activism, including the well-known gender discrimination
                    that she faced on her honeymoon at the World Anti-Slavery Convention. The result
                    of such changes was to inflate her importance within, and her dedication to, the
                    abolitionist movement. Through the use of exceptional primary research, Ginzberg
                    successfully presents the image of a woman at times blinded by her own
                    dedication to the cause of women&apos;s rights and never truly invested in
                    abolition, making it logical for Stanton to argue against the cause of African
                    American rights when she saw the Fifteenth Amendment as detrimental to
                    women&apos;s suffrage.</p>
                <p>Sadly, the subsequent chapters examining the period from 1868 to the end of
                    Stanton&apos;s life in 1902 are not as detailed or as brilliant as the first
                    section of the work. However, they still provide interesting insights into the
                    early functioning of the National Women&apos;s Suffrage Association, the writing
                    of the Women&apos;s Bible, and Stanton&apos;s other extensive women&apos;s
                    rights activism during this period. Ginzberg&apos;s gift for culling a wide
                    variety of primary sources is also prevalent in these chapters, as she explores
                    Stanton&apos;s complicated personal and professional relationship with Susan B.
                    Anthony, the reactions of other reformers to her personality and her activism,
                    as well as her strained and at times heartbreaking connections to her

                <p>Hamlin Garland&apos;s standing in contemporary American literary studies rests
                    largely on his tales of the Middle Border found in <hi rend="i">Main-Travelled
                        Roads</hi> (1891), a collection of short stories that present an honest and
                    often excoriating portrait of midwestern farm life in the 1880s. For a while he
                    was an essential reference point in the history and teaching of American realism
                    and naturalism, but his stock fell sharply in the culture wars of the 1970s and
                    &apos;80s, and it has only been with the recovery of local color writing and
                    regionalism in the last twenty years that his name has begun to creep back into
                    mainstream academic discussion. Donald Pizer&apos;s collection attempts to
                    contribute to this small resurrection of Garland&apos;s reputation, and does so
                    not by reiterating his position within the field of regional fiction but by
                    bringing together for the first time a series of his writings from the late
                    1880s and &apos;90s-the &quot;first act&quot; of his career, before he turned to
                    writing more conventional romantic novels-that reveal him as an engaged and
                    sometimes radical political writer.</p>
                <p>The figure that emerges in these pages is, however, not always entirely
                    persuasive. After a typically thorough and informative introduction from Pizer
                    that emphasizes the personal motivations behind Garland&apos;s work and that
                    highlights, especially, the importance of Henry George and Herbert Spencer to
                    his intellectual formation, the book splits into two sections: four examples of
                    his Middle Border fiction not previously collected, and a small but indicative
                    selection of &quot;Social, Political, and Critical Writing&quot; that captures
                    the anger and vigor of Garland&apos;s early life. The fiction is a welcome
                    addition to Garland scholarship and will prove invaluable to a fuller picture of
                    his literary output, but does present a vision of midwestern farm life that can
                    be forbiddingly hopeless. The first story, &quot;A Common Case&quot; (1888),
                    tells of a work-worn woman dying from cancer whose delirious and desperate final
                    moments are spent denouncing her entire life, particularly her husband;
                    &quot;John Boyle&apos;s Conclusion&quot; (also 1888), whose eponymous character
                    is driven to suicide by failed crops and <pb n="394" id="VAA4025-107-4-112"/>
                    unbearable poverty, brings to mind Michael Lesy&apos;s <hi rend="i">Wisconsin
                        Death Trip</hi> (1973). The feminist sympathies apparent in much of
                    Garland&apos;s writing-his novel <hi rend="i">Rose of Dutcher&apos;s Coolly</hi>
                    (1895) tackles the issue of the &quot;New Woman&quot; head on-are in full flow
                    in the other two stories, &quot;A Prairie Heroine&quot; (1891) and &quot;The
                    Land of the Straddle-Bug&quot; (1894-95). The latter of these is probably the
                    most daring, telling of an extramarital affair that not only goes unpunished but
                    is effectively celebrated as a legitimate act of rebellion by a heroine trapped
                    in intolerable circumstances. While these stories retain something of their
                    original power, their political didacticism and bleak bitterness can render them
                    difficult pills to swallow for any modern reader.</p>
                <p>The political and critical writings strike a more hopeful note-Garland&apos;s
                    views on land tax, independent theater, women&apos;s suffrage, and literary
                    sectionalism all get an airing-but do not always hold together as coherent
                    manifestos for his staunchly held beliefs. The radical Garland being presented
                    here can feel more like a reactionary nativist in &quot;Literary Emancipation of
                    the West&quot; (1893), while Pizer&apos;s sense that Garland developed a
                    &quot;full-blown aesthetic creed&quot; (p. 93) during the 1880s hardly holds up.
                    His most coherent expression of his literary and artistic theory appeared in <hi
                        rend="i">Crumbling Idols</hi> (1894) but, as with William Dean
                    Howells&apos;s own notions of realism-something Garland celebrated in his essay
                    &quot;Mr. Howells&apos;s Latest Novels&quot; (1890), also included in
                    Pizer&apos;s collection-it barely stands up to scrutiny. There is undoubtedly an
                    ardent and committed political figure revealed in these works, perhaps more so
                    than previously acknowledged, but not necessarily a thinker who deserves to be
                    taken a great deal more seriously.</p>
                <p>Pizer has gathered together an important collection, and for those interested in
                    midwestern or nineteenth-century fiction, or even early Populist politics, it
                    brings together an important set of texts that have long been almost
                    inaccessible. The volume may not catapult Garland into a place of greater
                    importance within intellectual history, but it does provide an illuminating
                    approach to the impassioned and fractious issues that swirled around American
                    life in the tumultuous 1890s.</p>

                <p>Lewis L. Gould, author of many distinguished works of political history, has used
                    his voluminous knowledge of the Progressive Era and the Republican Party to
                    produce two succinct works that offer a definitive view of the overlooked
                    presidency of William Howard Taft. Sandwiched between the charismatic Theodore
                    Roosevelt and the idealistic Woodrow Wilson, the ponderous, three-hundred-pound
                    Taft generally has been written off as a lackluster chief executive. Gould,
                    however, calls attention to his abilities and integrity, painting an absorbing
                    picture of the downward spiral of a presidency that floundered in part because
                    of inadequate political advisors. In this volume from the American Presidency
                    series, Gould reassesses Taft&apos;s administration in a well-argued work that
                    shows how Taft&apos;s relationship with his chief patron, Roosevelt, soured in a
                    series of relatively minor misunderstandings that included distrust between the
                    wives of the two leaders.</p>
                <p>The book provides a fascinating object lesson in how not to function successfully
                    as president in spite of good intentions and a profound belief in following the
                    U.S. Constitution and existing law. Taft&apos;s genial nature, which perhaps led
                    him to procrastinate, seemingly obscured his recognition of the need to plan his
                    public utterances more carefully. His compulsion to take lengthy speech-making
                    trips may have gratified his need for polite applause but did not serve him well
                    politically in the long run. Unlike T.R., his ebullient predecessor, Taft lacked
                    the ability to mesmerize his audiences, and perhaps some of the key issues
                    during his administration-such as complicated arguments over the tariff,
                    reciprocal trade agreements with Canada, and his support for a controversial
                    secretary of the interior who disagreed with Roosevelt&apos;s conservation
                    policies-did not lend themselves to exciting pronouncements. At any rate, he
                    failed to stir public sentiment as Roosevelt had, and he lacked his
                    predecessor&apos;s adeptness at public relations.</p>
                <p>Gould&apos;s companion work on Helen Taft, part of the Modern First Ladies series
                    of which he is the editor, introduces readers to a sprightly, strong-willed
                    woman who played <pb n="396" id="VAA4025-107-4-114"/> bridge for money, and
                    smoked and drank even after Prohibition, to her husband&apos;s dismay. Although
                    Helen Taft previously has been pictured as the power behind the throne, Gould
                    points out that her husband, who valued her counsel highly, was just as
                    ambitious as she. While Helen Taft&apos;s stroke in 1909 greatly diminished her
                    plans to expand the role of first lady into one of enhanced social and cultural
                    prominence, Gould offers the first extensive look at her extraordinary efforts
                    to bring acclaimed musicians to the White House. This book shows that she should
                    be remembered for more than simply overseeing the planting of Washington&apos;s
                    notable cherry trees.</p>
                <p>Taken together, these histories illuminate the years from 1908 to 1912, when a
                    somewhat ill-starred couple occupied 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Yet, as Gould
                    notes, Taft exhibited little bitterness when he came in a distant third in the
                    presidential election of 1912 and Wilson emerged victorious, with Roosevelt,
                    running as a third party candidate, coming in second. The press of the day did
                    not view the Taft presidency as a failure and, after these reading these books,
                    the modern reader is likely to have the same opinion. As Gould expressed it,
                    &quot;there was a sense that ... Taft had done his best for his country&quot;
                    (p. 201 in <hi rend="i">The William Howard Taft Presidency</hi>). Taft went on

                <p>Leigh Raiford&apos;s new book, <hi rend="i">Imprisoned in a Luminous Glare</hi>,
                    is a close examination of the role of the photograph in capturing the history of
                    black social movements in the <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149"
                            reg="United States">United States</country></placeName>. Raiford&apos;s
                    approach focuses on the agency of the photograph and the act of photography, not
                    only in documenting the legacy of racism but also in shaping public cognition of
                    the &quot;black body, the black eye, and black memory&quot; (p. 9). This
                    argument is of particular importance as it locates these three points as sites
                    of political and social resistance within the trajectory of the civil rights
                    struggle in the <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States"
                            >United States</country></placeName>. Raiford cites many resources in
                    her research, but <pb n="397" id="VAA4025-107-4-115"/> the influence of Stuart
                    Hall on her thinking cannot go unnoticed. Hall writes about the nation&apos;s
                    civil rights movement as a struggle over the rights of representation,
                    controlled by the forces that granted authorship in ascribing meaning to the
                    black body, the black eye, and the black memory. Raiford adapts Hall&apos;s
                    theory by adding that until the time of photography, that authorship (or agency)
                    rested with the oppressive forces of the racist white power structure.</p>
                <p>Black Americans were highly conscious of the representative function of the
                    photographic image, as they were a population that was highly misrepresented by
                    that image since its introduction to the United States in the mid-nineteenth
                    century. As Raiford points out, through the black American freedom struggle,
                    images became a means of negating the gaze of popular culture, and of
                    re-authoring the figure, vision, and memory of African Americans in the modern
                    world. The reclamation of the image, as simple as it sounds, is a highly
                    contested and revolutionary act that is inextricable from the visualization of
                    social and political movements of black people in the <placeName><country

                <p>The premise of Maurice Berger&apos;s <hi rend="i">For All the World to See</hi>
                    is that visual culture, particularly mass media such as picture magazines,
                    advertising, television, and motion pictures, was integral to the modern civil
                    rights movement. Not only did visual images document the movement, Berger
                    argues, but they also actively shaped the fight for civil rights through various
                    modes of persuasion, manipulation, or reprimand. While Berger&apos;s thesis is
                    not groundbreaking, the book is a solid, synthetic, non-theoretical work that
                    provides an easily digestible thematic history of civil-rights-related African
                    American imagery from approximately the 1930s until the 1970s.</p>

                    Museum of African <pb n="398" id="VAA4025-107-4-116"/> American History and
                    Culture. While not a catalog, the book includes a broad array of images from the
                    exhibition including advertisements, racist &quot;black memorabilia,&quot;
                    sports collectibles, book covers, photographs, stills from motion pictures and
                    television, and an occasional work of fine art. Much of the imagery is drawn
                    from the collection of the Civil Rights Archive at CADVC, which Berger helped to
                    create.</p>
                <p>The primary strength of <hi rend="i">For All the World to See</hi> is its attempt
                    to understand the simultaneity and interconnectivity of a range of aspects of
                    civil rights visual culture. By considering many different kinds of images,
                    Berger reinforces the notion that change was being wrought on many levels-from
                    nationally circulated African American magazines like <hi rend="i">Ebony</hi>
                    and <hi rend="i">Jet</hi> to affiliate television stations that broadcast
                    extremely local African American talk shows including <hi rend="i">Like It

                    from angry cartoons by Emory Douglas in the <hi rend="i">Black Panther</hi>
                    newspaper to family snapshots taken by African Americans all over the

                    offered to make up the face of her slain son, Emmett Till, emphasizes the true
                    power that civil rights images could wield.</p>
                <p>However, the topic of the book is an enormous one, and thus its strength also
                    becomes its weakness. <hi rend="i">For All the World to See</hi> includes an
                    eclectic and sometimes uneven group of images. For example, in an attempt to
                    provide context for the more radical visual culture produced at the height of
                    the movement, Berger provides an opening chapter that discusses a smattering of
                    stereotyped black imagery. This is well-worn territory that might have been
                    summarized in order to leave room for a more thorough examination of
                    lesser-known objects such as sports memorabilia (including a Jackie Robinson toy
                    bank) or the lunchbox collectible depicting Diahann Carroll, produced to promote
                    the NBC television show <hi rend="i">Julia</hi>. In addition, Berger&apos;s
                    discussion of images and objects can be exasperatingly thin. Examples include
                    the bizarre racist shirt from the early 1960s made of material apparently
                    printed with images depicting primitive Africans (cannibals?) that is barely
                    explored in the text and a discussion of Rupert Garcia&apos;s poster <hi
                        rend="i">No More O&apos; This Shit</hi> (1969) that seems entirely oblivious
                    to the fact that the character in the picture is an appropriation of Rastus, the
                    Cream of Wheat advertising icon. Despite such shortcomings, <hi rend="i">For All
                        the World to See</hi> presents an excellent general introduction to the
                    primacy of images during the modern civil rights movement.</p>

                    Gumprecht recalls that he spent a substantial part of his youth wandering the
                    streets of nearby <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014217"

                    University of Delaware. In later years Gumprecht fell into the nomadic existence
                    characteristic of many professors-in-the-making, spending time in, among other
                    university communities, <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013875"

                    learns of this personal history by reading Gumprecht&apos;s intently
                    autobiographical preface. When Gumprecht rolls out his more scholarly narrative
                    in chapter one, this reader was struck by the amorphousness of the analytical
                    enterprise: &quot;Much of what makes college towns unusual and interesting
                    cannot be quantified in any meaningful way&quot; (p. 4).</p>
                <p>But as a resolute social scientist, Gumprecht does indeed build <hi rend="i">The
                        American College Town</hi> on a research design: using a student population
                    threshold of 20 percent of the total local population and excluding cities with
                    a population in excess of 350,000, he collected data on 60 of 305 so-defined
                    college towns across the <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149"
                            reg="United States">United States</country></placeName> (among them,
                            <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013437" reg="Bloomington"
                            >Bloomington</settlement></placeName> and <placeName><settlement

                            key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>). In
                    practice, eight of the ten chapters in <hi rend="i">The American College
                        Town</hi> are thematically focused case studies (&quot;the campus as public
                    space,&quot; &quot;stadium culture,&quot; &quot;town vs. gown,&quot; and so on).
                    Interestingly, the eight academic institutions profiled in these chapters-the
                    University of Oklahoma, Cornell University, Kansas State University, the
                    University of California Davis, the University of Georgia, Auburn University,
                    the University of Michigan, and the University of Delaware-include not a single
                    college, that is, if one accepts the characteristic definition of colleges as
                    smaller institutions focused on undergraduate training. Nor-in large part due to
                    the size of the universities that Gumprecht studies-does he really engage with
                    any towns. <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014233" reg="Norman"

                    small cities.</p>
                <p>Thus Gumprecht, whose animating purpose is as attributable to nostalgia as it is
                    to a clear analytical <pb n="399" id="VAA4025-107-4-118"/> program, has written
                    a book dominated by the sort of university community many find to be essentially
                    uncaptivating. Nevertheless, this volume has its charms. Several of
                    Gumprecht&apos;s historical narratives are fascinating, such as his account of
                    successive University of Oklahoma presidents&apos; efforts to use campus
                    physical improvements as a means to win public approbation no less than state
                    legislative appropriation. Equally interesting is his discussion of the
                    residential development of <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013803"

                    Gumprecht loses track of his main analytical thread, i.e., the continuities
                    linking otherwise disparate university communities. Indeed, this tale of eight
                    small university cities ultimately leaves one to wonder: Aren&apos;t these
                    places fully as different from one another as any other eight municipalities
                    across the <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United

                    and on many occasions his fact-finding turns up marvelous anecdotes, such as the

                    $45.00.)</head>
                <p>In the introduction to this sweeping survey of and fulsome ode to American-style
                    capitalism, Stanley Buder argues that &quot;business history is best served by
                    being placed in a broad context that considers social as well as economic
                    developments, and yet this has rarely been done.&quot; This task he promises to
                    undertake in his three-part exploration of the &quot;ever-changing social
                    contract of business with the American polity&quot; (pp. 4, 6). Buder also
                    assures his readers that he will move well beyond the confines of earlier
                    entrepreneurial and institutional approaches to business history.</p>
                <pb n="401" id="VAA4025-107-4-119"/>
                <p>Few who have labored in the social and cultural history of business over the past
                    four decades would dispute the need for a new synthesis of business history.
                    Unfortunately, they will not find it in the pages that follow Buder&apos;s
                    introductory chapter. Indeed, <hi rend="i">Capitalizing on Change</hi> fails to
                    appreciate the wealth of scholarship produced over the last forty years, those
                    many monographs that move beyond earlier models and embrace broader social
                    contexts. Instead, Buder presents a fairly traditional narrative of American
                    business and political history, one that simply revisits most of the same
                    entrepreneurial figures, institutional changes, and political signposts
                    identified in earlier surveys, including those found in the more nuanced,
                    synthetic works of Robert Heilbroner, and Mansel Blackford and Austin Kerr.
                    Buder also seems oblivious to Thomas Cochran&apos;s famous clarion calls
                    (especially his 1976 <hi rend="i">Business in American Life</hi>) for deeper
                    explorations of American business as a significant social institution on par
                    with the family, religion, and education, and of the ways in which American
                    assumptions about business have shaped cultural values and power relationships
                    over time. Indeed, Buder only mentions Cochran in passing (p. 221), where he
                    also finally acknowledges Olivier Zunz, just one among many scholars over the
                    past four decades who have worked to link business institutions with social
                    developments, labor/social problems, and the intricate webs of
                    government-business-power relations. Business as social history has traveled in
                    many exciting directions, including into works that seek to address the everyday
                    realities of the vast majority of Americans; that employ bottom-up strategies to
                    understand the evolving relationship between American government, business,
                    labor, and society; and that place American developments within a much broader
                    global context. Unfortunately, Buder seems to have read few if any of these
                    works, evidenced by endnotes that rarely mention articles and books published
                    after 1980.</p>
                <p>Rather than synthesizing significant work in new business history, Buder&apos;s
                    book simply reinforces the standard tropes and myths associated with the
                    &quot;self-made&quot; entrepreneur (with the usual suspects-Carnegie,
                    Rockefeller, Vanderbilt, and others-taking center stage), while also continuing

                            States</country></placeName> as an exceptional nation of white men who
                    triumphed through grit and hard work. In this book, we learn nothing about the
                    engendering of business, about race and the economy, about business and the
                    environment; we learn precious little about the role of the government in
                    pre-World War II America.</p>
                <p>Even a passing glance at recent literature would have forced Buder to revisit his
                    arguments about the self-made American and the central myths of American
                    exceptionalism and its attendant meritocracy, or about the connection between
                    business success <pb n="402" id="VAA4025-107-4-120"/> and larger cultural,
                    political, and social aspirations and networks. A walk through journals devoted
                    to business and social history over the past forty years reveals a host of
                    business successes <hi rend="i">and</hi> failures, among people from various
                    ethnic, racial, and gender groups who contributed to and challenged the American
                    business model over time, who created larger connections between business, the
                    government, consumption patterns, and everyday life. Moreover, Buder does not
                    engage the gale-force winds that have accompanied American entrepreneurship and
                    global capitalism since infancy, including economic booms and busts, credit
                    dependency, planned obsolescence, and widening disparities in wealth.
                    Incredibly, he claims that the speculative fever of the 1920s emerged as the
                    first time in history when the American people lived beyond their means (p.
                    236), that Cold War policies never sought to advance American economic goals and
                    that the <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United
                            States</country></placeName> fostered &quot;free trade&quot; solely to
                    help others (pp. 392-94), and that &quot;thriving on chaos&quot; emerged for the
                    first time in the 1990s (p. 365).</p>
                <p>Although Buder&apos;s book provides an updated survey of American business
                    history, one that pays welcome attention to the post-1970s era, we still need a
                    new synthesis that actually embraces the social history of business from the
                    colonial era forward.</p>
