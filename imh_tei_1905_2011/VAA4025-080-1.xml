                    </placeName> was a latecomer to settlement work. The daughter of a prominent Indiana businessman and
                    politician, she was educated to piety, virtue, and gentility at home and at Miss Porter's
                    School for girls in Farmington, <placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1889. At twenty-nine, after a decade of family life, good works, and unhappiness in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>

                    </placeName> barely tore herself away to return home after two exhilarating months. Three more years

            <p>Most settlement workers, then as later, were recent college graduates. Full of idealistic enthusiasm
                    and unburdened by specific technical or professional training, both men and women responded eagerly

                    </placeName>, they had been raised on the moral and religious writings of the

                    Matthew, Charles Kingsley, Frederick D. Maurice—who laid out their Christian duties in an
                    industrial society and made compelling sense of such a middle-class mission to the slums.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> was stirred by the exhortations to "personal service" that formed the
                    core of the settlement idea as it evolved from Christian Socialist reformulations of the proper
                    spirit of philanthropy in a well-ordered society.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> But unlike those who moved
                    easily from their families and campuses to a new and hitherto alien field of action, Agnes found the
                    call of duty, not liberating, but confusing. For over ten years, despite increasing responsibility
                    and success in social service in her own city, she struggled with feelings of personal and spiritual
                    inadequacy. It seemed clear to her that the only resolution of the tensions plaguing her life was a

                    be. Agnes's search for her proper role in her society reflects American middle-class

                    </placeName> children played, studied, and grew through adolescence in their own comfortable
                    sanctuary. The first meaningful distinction in their lives was between "members"
                    (the cousins and the "grownups") and "outsiders." Indeed,
                    Agnes's parents, Andrew Holman and Phoebe, were adventurous in sending their children into
                    the community for their early schooling, for Montgomery and Gertrude taught their precocious
                    daughters, Edith, Alice, Margaret, and Norah, at home.</p>
            <p>Several years younger than her sisters, Katherine and Jessie, Agnes found her natural playmates in
                    her cousins Alice <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Aunt Mary's son, Allen <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> Williams (or "Allen W.," as he was called after one of
                    Agnes's two younger brothers was also christened with the family patronymic). The
                    "three A's" were born within several months of each other in the winter
                    of 1868–1869. As children they played together in and under an old tree they called the
                    "Frightfull," taking their imaginary personae from <hi rend="i">Robin Hood, King
                        Arthur,</hi> and, perhaps more unusually, the ancient Greek plays. Their games continued well
                    into adolescence, but in that difficult period tensions developed that transformed and complicated
                    the cousins' relationship. At first the major annoyance was Allen's boyish
                    betrayal of his female cousins: he began "slandering" them to his school
                        friends.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Soon, though, a worse rift threatened. In the diary Agnes began to
                    keep at fifteen she recorded that the other two had suddenly "taken it in their heads that
                    they want to know somebody." She found this whim incomprehensible. "I think the
                    boys and girls in this town are <hi rend="i">very</hi> stupid and silly and I don't care to
                    have anything to do with them."<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Though she gradually resigned herself
                    to her cousins' social forwardness, a more fundamental worry began to nag her. At sixteen

            <p>Until 1884 Agnes had attended the Westminster private academy in the mornings and on those afternoons
                    when drawing was offered, staying at home other days to study French with Allen and Alice. Seeking a
                    more structured regimen, she persuaded her parents in 1885 to allow her to try the public high
                    school for a year. Alice continued to study at home, while Allen was sent to school in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>, returning home during vacations to his cousins' fond admiration of his
                    "splendid" new physique and sophistication.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Agnes's conviction that she was stupid grew into an obsession as she measured herself not
                    only against her cousins but against her own resolutions of discipline and self-improvement.
                    Initially she concentrated on her bad habits of sloth at her studies and talking too much, which at
                    fifteen she considered her "principal fault." A week after these first resolutions
                    were taken she had to admit failure. "I have neither studied hard nor stoped talking but
                    next week I will try harder."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> On New Year's Eve, 1885, she
                    drew up the first of the more elaborate programs that punctuate her diaries for the next decade. She
                    was to rise at seven, study before school, devote the noon hour to Latin, read seriously
                    ("not novels nor even stories in Harpers or Century") for an hour and half after
                    school, and go to bed early. She was now seventeen and as far behind her cousins as ever:
                    "I still feel so childish and I know so very, very little, I am really quite alarmed when I
                    hear Allen and Alice talking about men and deeds that I have never heard of or that I merely know by
                        name."<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Despite her increasing self-doubt, Agnes was by nature cheerful and resilient. While belittling
                    herself, she glorified the family and celebrated the "members'" triumphs
                    and activities, even if she always had to be the "stupid know nothing."<hi rend="sup">9</hi> Her diary entries often shifted abruptly from meditations on her own failings

                    classically Victorian in content and ambiguous in purpose. In 1886 Alice and Agnes anticipated the
                    same opportunity with excitement and trepidation. Characteristically, Alice decided to prepare for
                    life among strangers at Farmington by meeting new people at home while Agnes hung back, declaring,
                    "I am very well contented with my present life for the present time."<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Her brilliant cousin Edith unconsciously added to Agnes's
                    trepidations by describing her recent Farmington schoolmates as "very bright and
                    studious." Agnes pictured the worst: "I never expected to be popular nor even to
                    be liked by a few but I did think that I could know my lessons." She pitied herself for the
                    blot she would leave on the family escutcheon, and "heartily wish[ed]" her school
                    days were already past.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At Farmington, Agnes seesawed between joy and agony. As had become habitual, she blamed her miseries
                    on herself rather than her surroundings. "Farmington is just as perfect as they all said it
                    would be, the girls, Miss Porter and all, but I don't think I am the right sort of
                    Farmington girl."<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Privately, however, she spared her schoolmates none
                    of the stern rigor with which she conducted her own self-evaluations. Ruthlessly she separated the
                    "bores" from the "demigods." She was sure that, were it not for
                    Alice, none of the nicer girls would ever look her way. The unpleasant novelty of her jealousy of
                    Alice propelled her into sharp self-disgust: "I thought for a while that I had given up
                    being conscious that there is an I always with me but here I am thinking of nothing else
                    … Stupid, stupid, stupid is all I can think of tonight. How can I expect anyone to like
                    me when I have just the character I especially dislike."<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Her poignant
                    self-abasement reached an acute state when, in December of their first year, the "nicest
                    girl in the school" asked the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> cousins to room with her the next term. When Alice confided her fear that Kitty
                    Ludington would find them dull, Agnes sought the silver lining. Since Kitty must already think Agnes
                    "very stupid and empty," she had nothing to lose. "It makes me perfectly
                    happy to be with her …. It will be very hard to give her up in the Spring term for of
                    course she will grow so tired of us that she will choose someone else to room with her."<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

                    "mental and moral philosophy," taught by rote from two impenetrable tomes written
                    by Miss Porter's brother, Yale president Noah Porter. Not surprisingly, the students could
                    not understand why this text was venerated by the instructor, a <placeName>

                    are gifted and would it not be well to take up those studies in which this deficiency is most

                    and languages, her reputation among her friends could not suffer much if she were not head of the
                    class in "Mental" and "Moral," as the Farmington students called

            <p>Aside from this pedagogical travesty, the education offered at Farmington seems to have been good.
                    Miss Sarah Porter, the school's founder and its guiding spirit from the 1840s to her death
                    in 1900, put the stamp of her own New <placeName>

                    </placeName> upbringing in a strongly Congregational family on her pupils' education. She
                    had been taught, as she later wrote, that "life must be earnest, progressive, not worldly
                    in motive or in plan," and she believed in the value of female education as a training in
                    character, piety, and responsibility. Herself a good linguist, she made sure that languages and
                    literature were taught with sensitivity in her school. Her brother Noah had just retired from the
                    presidency of Yale when the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> cousins arrived in Farmington; that family connection had long enriched the tiny school
                    with a stream of prominent Yale academics, clerics, and musicians, imported for the girls'
                    enlightenment (and Miss Porter's own intellectual pleasure). The school also offered
                    training in drawing and painting, a special joy to Agnes and her older sister Jessie before her.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though Sarah Porter valued intellectual training, she was no advocate of higher education for women.
                    Her students were being prepared for a disciplined Christian womanhood, not for scholarship. When
                    Edith <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> confided to her a yearning toward college, the great lady is said to have responded:
                    "My dear Edith, you can become learned; but, my dear Edith, I don't think much of
                        learning."<hi rend="sup">22</hi> This ambivalence was certainly congenial to the <placeName>

                    </placeName> "grownups," who fostered and supported their daughters'
                    talents but did not encourage plans for a college education. Though Agnes's mother urged
                    her to take moral philosophy, she would not require it. There was one matter, however, in which she
                    was adamant: "Please remember that is one thing I send you to school for—to

                        <settlement type="city">Hartford</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and confronted the adolescent terrors of the first solitary encounters with the self.
                    The pleasures of school life had enabled her to establish a fragile peace with her
                    "stupidity." Near the end of her second year she reflected: "Well, I am
                    made as I am. It is a trouble, a trial. Others have worse … I can be very thankful for my
                    power of enjoying and liking people though it is all on my side."<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Agnes also formed grand and vague plans for her future life in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>. No matter what profession she chose, she resolved to do "some really good
                    work which shall help to make some women better than if I had not been here." Unlike her
                    friend Kitty Ludington, who would develop naturally into a "splendid, noble"
                    woman, Agnes would have to fit herself for such a role through hard attention to the duties at hand.
                    "Anyone can carry out some splendid work if they only have perseverance and that is
                    something which may be gained if it is not born in one."<hi rend="sup">27</hi> By plunging
                    now into her studies and her drawing, she would reap the benefits later—not in the vain
                    gratification of being thought less stupid but in the true nobility of a life consecrated to duty.</p>
            <p>For Agnes <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> the idea of duty imparted unity to her life and simultaneously created the only real
                    conflicts that she ever knew. As the central tenet of her domestic, intellectual, and spiritual
                    life, "doing one's duty" was a peculiarly free-floating mandate that
                    invested objects, such as home and family members, and activities, such as reading, drawing,
                    learning, and working. In the decade after her return to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Agnes's inability to clarify and focus the unrelenting imperative of duty
                    splintered her days and obstructed her search for the purpose of her life.</p>

            <p>This primal sense of duty was an integral part of the culture imparted to and interpreted for her at
                    home, in school, and at church. Agnes was raised in the Presbyterian church, and from childhood she
                    lived in an untroubled and earnest acceptance of the faith. While Alice's father
                    communicated to his children his intellectual passion for the historical and philosophical
                    intricacies of theology, religion in Agnes's household was a less intellectual, if no less
                    serious, affair.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> The conflicts that had earlier shaken the Presbyterian church
                    had receded, and the impact of the Social Gospel lay in the future when Agnes took her examination
                    and was admitted as a church member in 1885. Church affairs served as Agnes's first contact
                    with the community, and visiting ministers were probably her first palpable link with the world
                    beyond her city. She and her sisters went to hear Dwight Moody when he came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>; she was less impressed than she had expected to be, but she appreciated his arguments
                    against scepticism. "I was very glad to hear what he said, for, although of course I
                    believe it all yet now if any time I should want to talk to any one I could argue much
                        better."<hi rend="sup">29</hi> She was more disturbed by the evangelical style of the
                    local Baptist minister: "I never heard such a sermon before, it was really painful to
                    listen to the Bible being yelled out in the manner that Mr. Northrup does it."<hi rend="sup">30</hi> She preferred the "earnest and not at all threatening or
                    tragical" approach of her own minister.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As a Presbyterian, Agnes was taught the value of an educated familiarity with scriptures and
                    doctrine, but what she sought and increasingly responded to in her religion was its aids to conduct
                    and attitude. At Miss Porter's she and Alice had supplemented their Sunday church-going
                    with evening prayer meetings with a few of their friends, choosing a topic, such as
                    "trust," and looking up readings in the Bible and religious literature to
                    illustrate it.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> She took deeply to heart all exhortations to self-improvement,
                    however bland, general, or frequent they may have been in adult discourse to this community of
                    vulnerable girls. A talk from Miss Porter on kindness toward others pricked her raw conscience and
                    sparked a new resolution to speak kindly in the evening to any girl she wronged in thoughtless
                    conversation during the day.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>

                    <pb n="13" id="VAA4025-080-1-019"/> She was particularly stirred by two sermons delivered by George
                    Barker Stevens of Yale in November of her second year. Focusing on the duty of the individual to
                    strive to lead a noble life, to shape his or her thoughts through judicious reading, and to bend all
                    of his or her energies on one goal or object in life, these talks chimed perfectly with
                    Agnes's new concern with her future. "Both sermons were just what I wanted, just
                    what I need. They help me to look forward to next year with perfect pleasure to plan it all out as I
                    never thought I should be able to." And she confessed: "I keep making plans and
                    resolutions but in every day life they come to nothing."<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the back of her diary for 1886–1887, her first year at Farmington, Agnes began
                    supplementing her daily schedules for Easter and summer vacations with broader resolutions, cast as
                    religious commandments, which she either composed or adapted from other sources: "Do what
                    little in thy power and God will assist thy good will." "Never be entirely idle;
                    but either be reading or writing or praying or meditating." "Those things that a
                    man cannot mend in himself or in others he ought to suffer patiently, until God order them
                    otherwise." "Set yourself earnestly to see what you were made to do, and then set
                    yourself earnestly to do it."<hi rend="sup">35</hi> As Agnes accepted her own limitations,
                    she looked increasingly to her religion to "ennoble" and impart to what she saw as
                    her humdrum, unattractive, "stupid" young womanhood the romance at least of
                    struggle, sacrifice, and victory. She might never equal her beloved Alice and Jessie in brains or
                    social adeptness—far less approach her somewhat austere and formidable cousin
                    Edith—but she could dedicate herself, over and over, to do "what little was in
                    her power," and God would assist.</p>
            <p>The rounds of resolutions, backsliding, anguished self-upbraiding, and renewed resolutions continued
                    at home in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> as Agnes set herself to the multiple tasks of self-improvement. The joy of being with
                    her sisters and cousins may have been tempered by an unacknowledged envy of their fixed ambitions.
                    Edith was stubbornly preparing herself for the Bryn Mawr entrance examinations, while Alice resolved
                    in the year after leaving Farmington to become a doctor. In retrospect, both sisters would attribute
                    their decisions to pursue professions to their father's declining fortunes and the
                    probability of having to support themselves, but <placeName>

                    would give her professional autonomy and the freedom to travel and to deal with many kinds of
                    people. So, while Edith studied trigonometry and polished her Latin and Greek, Alice made up her
                    almost total deficiency in scientific knowledge and then entered the tiny,
                    "third-rate" medical school in <placeName>

                    began to volunteer her services at "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName>," a nondenominational mission and social center across the St. Mary's

                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>. At first she took a class of young girls in the Sunday school sponsored by the
                    Christian Endeavor Society, a national interdenominational young people's group with a
                    missionary flavor and a program that emphasized the extension of Christian education through special
                    Sunday school classes taught outside the aegis of any one church.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> The Nebraska
                    classes were organized so that the teacher might stay with the same group of boys or girls for a
                    period of years.</p>
            <p>Agnes judged her teaching harshly. She rebuked herself for spending too little time preparing her
                    lessons and for teaching them in a "lifeless, empty" manner. "And yet it
                    was every word that fourteen girls will hear of Christ for seven days; every bit of high thought, of
                    encouragement, of help, of strength in the midst of low squalor, troubles, frightful
                        temptations."<hi rend="sup">39</hi> She also despaired of the girls themselves:
                    "They are turning out so dreadfully … They flit from one home to another, one

            <p>Teaching Sunday school was a natural outgrowth of Agnes's Christian upbringing as well as a
                    traditional activity for a young woman of her class and education. This occupation led only
                    gradually to a fuller commitment to social service. In her early twenties, increasingly restless in
                    her homebound life and undoubtedly goaded by her cousins' example, Agnes groped for
                    something larger, some grander outlet for her energies. In 1889 she enrolled in a course on the

                    the next two years, worrying her mother and from time to time requiring bed rest. Thoughts of

                    its incongruity with her outward activities. She had left Farmington at nineteen; she was now
                    twenty-six. Her responsibilities at Nebraska had gradually enlarged. By the end of 1894 she managed
                    the "Noon Rest," a tea-and-lunch service for working women; she helped administer

                    as a medical student as "the most selfish I have ever led, even more so than when I was at
                    Farmington"; and she assured Agnes: "After reading one of [your letters] I feel a

            <p>The growth of Agnes's church and community activities was accompanied by a gradual and
                    coherent maturation of her social attitudes. Because she was by nature reflective and acutely
                    self-conscious, it is not surprising that there was always an active interplay in her life between
                    experience and thought—between life as she saw and tried to live it and the distillation
                    of others' observations, experiences, and exhortations available in speeches and sermons
                    and above all in books. Since childhood Agnes had been a careful and constant, if not a voracious,
                    reader. She kept monthly lists of books read in the back of her diaries and conscientiously admitted

            <p>It is not surprising, then, that Agnes found her bearings in social thought through English writers.
                    She first encountered Kingsley during her school days and then began reading him in earnest, often

                    </placeName>. Kingsley's Christian Socialism exhorted social salvation through individual
                    regeneration. He deplored the social indifference which allowed the appalling living and working
                    conditions of industrial Britain to fester. Sanitary advances, labor reform, and political
                    reconstruction were urgent, but programmatic structural change was pointless without an accompanying
                    class reconciliation attainable only by the rededication of each individual, rich or poor, to the

                    </placeName> were his prescriptive strictures on the Christian individual's inward attitude
                    and outward behavior. Like so many other Victorian reformers who embraced the ideal of an
                    "organic" society, Kingsley harked back to an idealized Middle Ages for the
                    personal ideals of chivalry, honor, and duty that would provide the glue for such a social order. He
                    enjoined upon women particularly a clear understanding of the true meaning of personal heroism in
                    social service as entailing "the going beyond the limits of strict duty … [but]
                    never … the going out of the path of strict duty." <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>By 1892 Agnes had gone on from Kingsley to his fellow cleric and Christian Socialist Frederick

                    became regular reading for Agnes, and she copied into her diaries long passages on the need for
                    personal strength to carry out God's mission.<hi rend="sup">53</hi> Interestingly, she
                    seems to have come late to John Ruskin, the touchstone of Victorian aesthetics and social thought;
                    she encountered his work as part of her prescribed architectural reading. Though she appreciated
                    Ruskin, she was not an uncritical convert. She was most attracted to "his grand idea,
                    [that] a man's religion must enter all he does, all he says, all he thinks, if it be true
                    religion." She dismissed his "objection to machine-made articles" as
                    impractical and anachronistic.<hi rend="sup">54</hi> While Agnes introduced Alice to Kingsley and

                            experience for many social workers and marked a turning point in their thought. At this time
                            many early settlement residents rejected the classic distinction between
                            "deserving" and "undeserving" poor that had been
                            popularized by organized charity and moved toward an acceptance of environmental factors as

                    more sharply to William Jennings Bryan's campaign in 1896. On election day she wrote:

            <p>It is hard to say how much of Agnes's political thinking was independent, even by her
                    mid-twenties, and how much was shaped by family habit and social assumptions. Certainly the
                    half-conscious social attitudes of childhood lingered. (She readily used the adjective
                    "common" to describe people she found vulgar—those who pretended to a
                    social status their lack of refinement belied.<hi rend="sup">61</hi>) At the same time, under the
                    tutelage of English and American social thinkers, she had become more sophisticated about her own
                    economic position ("We are not even moderately rich, but the whole of what we have is
                    unearned"), and she took pride in practicing locally the social ideals they preached. She
                    boasted that in the city's YWCA "all are equally members, those who give and those
                    who take … It is not a charity given by one class to another but the poorest member, the
                    hardest worker, is carrying on this organization for mutual help as much as the richest woman with
                    all her time at her disposal." The one exclusionary rule, that members of the Board of
                    Managers must be drawn from the Protestant churches, "places the association, once and for
                    ever, in the right hands and is the only one necessary."<hi rend="sup">62</hi>

                    Economic Association, which was dedicated to an ethical and activist approach to the study of
                    economics, its chief purpose being, as Ely put it, "to bring science to the aid of

                    organism, in whose ideal state every individual's capacities could reach their fullest
                    development. The duty of the true Christian was to dedicate his life to the good of the whole; true

                    bravely swallowed his recommendation of an inheritance tax "to lessen the
                    ‘unearned increment.’" She was also reassured by his gradualist
                    approach to social change; she agreed that "a sudden change is contrary to all nature and

                    the Kingdom of God, complete with sanitary reforms, judicious economic regulation, and social and

                    indistinct in his speech, and powerfully attractive in "the truths that he
                    utters." He delivered a sermon on the Incarnation in her church: "As Christ came
                    here to live among men," she recorded his message, "so we must live among those to
                    whom we carry the salvation." A week later—the day before her twenty-eighth
                    birthday—he gave an "intensely interesting" public lecture on social
                    democracy. <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Agnes also heard Florence Kelley of Hull-House speak about the sweat-shop labor system at the
                    Women's Club League course in November, 1896, and she may have been responsible for
                    inviting Kelley to return in January to talk about settlement work. For Christmas in 1896 Agnes
                    asked for <hi rend="i">Hull-House Maps and Papers,</hi> a collection of articles and neighborhood

            <p>Agnes's new interest in settlement work was a natural extension of her long discipleship to
                    Charles Kingsley as well as her more recent readings in the American "school" of
                    Christian sociology. Graham Taylor's lectures in <placeName>

                    self-doubt and conflict about the purpose of her life. "O Christ lead me out of

                    was, simply, "quite perfect." "I really am quite school-girly in my

                    digested impressions of settlement residents, "neighbors," and visitors. Eager to
                    be accepted as "one of the people"—that is, the
                    residents—despite her guest status, she volunteered for the smallest tasks, helping to
                    recruit men for snow-shovelling jobs, delivering letters to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Commons, and opening the front door in the evenings. "At the last moment the
                    manager [of the Hull-House Players' current production] needed another white apron and to
                    my joy I had one in my trunk which I rushed for."<hi rend="sup">77</hi> She also filled in
                    for absent club leaders, judged a paper hat contest, and stuffed envelopes with political
                    broadsides. Hull-House was absorbed in its second full-scale campaign against the incumbent alderman
                    of the Nineteenth Ward, the popular and corrupt Johnny Powers. Agnes witnessed strategy sessions
                    around the dinner table and surreptitiously listened in on local Republican Club meetings (from
                    which women were commonly barred).<hi rend="sup">78</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Within a week Agnes was offered a regular "job" for the rest of her visit. The
                    morning doortender had left the settlement for a nursing position, and Addams wanted Agnes to fill
                    in. "She said something about Miss Holdin's manner not being all that was
                    desirable and insinuating that mine was suited to the circumstances, which was very pleasing in
                    her." (Had Addams been as other-worldly as she seemed, she might not have had such
                    remarkable success in attracting a lifelong series of just such loyal aides as Agnes.) Though Alice
                    protested that her cousin should use her time in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> to "fly around to see more," Agnes demurred: "I am very much
                    pleased to be wanted and I think [Alice] is pleased, too." When one of the older residents
                    told her that the others all hoped she would stay on for good, Agnes's cup of happiness
                    overflowed, "Aren't they fine to want me? I feel so proud and pleased and
                        grateful."<hi rend="sup">79</hi>

            <p>What was to be a stay of two weeks stretched to almost two months as the residents urged her to stay
                    and as she, like Alice, fell under the spell of Jane Addams. "The more I see of her, the
                    more I feel attracted to her. She is such a sane person looking at things so squarely and honestly
                    and above all so full of love."<hi rend="sup">80</hi> Agnes's responsibilities
                    increased when Addams asked her to take on some of the burden of her already vast correspondence.
                    "She has an idea that I write good letters and I am sure she has never seen one that I have
                    written, and I hope she never will."<hi rend="sup">81</hi> Agnes was also pressed to fill
                    in for the woman who organized the Hull-House club work when she took her vacation in late February.</p>
            <p>As Agnes lingered on, she repeatedly apologized to her mother for staying away so long and assured
                    her that she could leave at any time if needed at home. The great attraction of Hull-House, she
                    admitted, was that she was "wanted." "You see I am getting puffed up, and
                    considering myself of some use."<hi rend="sup">82</hi> Like other Hull-House residents, who
                    believed in living as "naturally" as they would uptown, Agnes took advantage of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s attractions; she juxtaposed visits to the police court and women's
                    club meetings with evenings at the theater. She cast a sceptical eye, however, on the myriad causes
                    and platforms she heard expounded at Hull-House. "It is amusing to hear people, each one
                    with his own scheme for setting us all straight and so sure that any other scheme would wreck us
                    worse than ever. Looking at them all has quite cured me of any one …. "<hi rend="sup">83</hi> What held her was less the external interest of life in <placeName>

            <p>It seems strange that a woman who was already a recognized leader in church and civic affairs in her
                    own city should derive such satisfaction from tending the door and answering letters in a distant
                    settlement house. An interesting juxtaposition of thoughts in one of her letters home hints at an
                    explanation: "Do tell me any time you want me. It is great fun in one way, and a very
                    useful experience in another with no fun at all but a good deal of misery. It is fine to know Miss
                    Addams and to see the way she deals with things and people. She is thirty seven years old, she told
                    me last Sunday, and came here when she was twenty eight. But, what I started out to say was that if

                    failures to do her duty. She may well have been heartened to reflect that Addams was only a year
                    younger when she moved to Hull-House and began her life's work.</p>
            <p>Agnes <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> was really very different from Jane Addams. Addams was a spiritual follower of Carlyle,
                    not of Christ. Her outward humility was belied by the confidence with which, at the age of thirty,
                    she moved toward national and then international prominence. But for Addams, as for Agnes <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the period of her twenties had been a fallow decade, punctuated by grand plans delayed
                    or abandoned ostensibly for reasons of ill health and family claims. Like Agnes, she had backed into
                    settlement work after years of inchoate and restless floundering in search of some unifying purpose
                    for her education and energies. Three years after founding Hull-House, in an address to fellow
                    settlement pioneers, she spoke from experience in delivering what remained the most eloquent
                    justification of the "subjective necessity for social settlements."<hi rend="sup">85</hi> The need for personal social work, she admitted candidly, lay as much with the workers
                    as with the worked upon. The idealism bred into young people by college education and by the
                    "democratic" and "humanitarian" spirit of the times was starved
                    into aimless frustration in the absence of any "recognized outlet." Addams
                    feelingly portrayed the plight of young women in the well-meaning thrall of
                    "inconsistent" parents: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            before the good of the ego. But when all this information and culture show results, when the
                            daughter comes back from college and begins to recognize her social claim to the
                            "submerged tenth," and to evince a disposition to fulfill it, the family
                            claim is strenuously asserted; she is told that she is unjustified, ill-advised in her
                                efforts.<hi rend="sup">86</hi>

                    devastating potency, however, was the internalized dinning of the strident voices of these young
                    adults' Anglo-American Protestant culture, which commanded simultaneously an active
                    response to the demands of duty and a vigilant and suspicious resistance to the stirrings of merely
                    personal ambition. For women particularly this was a cruel prescription for righteousness. For Agnes <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> the "family claim" was peculiarly palpable, but it was also a point
                    of both personal and intellectual confusion. "I believe in the family so
                    strongly," she wrote at twenty-six. "I believe in it as a divinely appointed
                    institution, the most sacred thing on earth … there seems to me nothing greater except
                    our great Father's fatherhood of which this little family is our best lesson." As
                    she continued to resist the notion that she rejected at twenty, that a woman's sole aim
                    should be marriage and child-rearing, she also hesitated to endorse her cousin Edith's
                    contention that "if a woman (wife and mother) finds she can carry out her individual life
                    better alone, she ought to give up her family and devote herself to improving herself and her own
                    individuality; that that must be done at any cost." Significantly, she interpreted their
                    disagreement on this point as the difference between "individualism and
                    socialism"—herself representing the "socialist" side.<hi rend="sup">88</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Christian Socialism and its variants spoke forcefully and pointedly to many of Agnes's
                    contemporaries. Addams ascribed the appeal of settlements to "a certain renaissance going
                    forward in Christianity" which expressed itself in "the impulse to share the lives
                    of the poor, the desire to make social service … express the spirit of
                    Christ…. "<hi rend="sup">89</hi> The heart of Christian Socialism, as expounded
                    by Kingsley, Maurice, Arnold Toynbee, and the Americans Ely, Hodges, Taylor, and their ministerial
                    and academic allies, was not the movement's concern with social reform but its
                    preoccupation with the soul of the reformer. Addams discerned in this ideology a cure for the ills
                    of both low and high society, but in effect it was less a cure than an irritant and a symptom. The
                    new Christian philanthropy demanded, "not money, but yourselves," as the English
                    reformer Walter Besant had written; but where and how was one to give oneself, and what made

                    self-examination and self-testing implicit in this whole strain of Christian social thought. The
                    social settlement movement as it shook itself out from Christian Socialism was more
                    merciful—short on ascetic self-denial and long on the creative anarchy of heterogeneous

                    mother had enjoined her to cultivate, Agnes was drawn again into settlement work. At first she
                    attended occasional evening activities and helped to paint scenery for plays. Then, in late 1901,
                    she decided to leave her boardinghouse and move into the Lighthouse, a Presbyterian settlement

                    for public health activism on a national scale, Agnes was one of the settlement movement's
                    staunch "insiders," whose dedication to a single local constituency insured the
                    settlements' institutional longevity.</p>

            <p>It is doubtful that Agnes found in settlement work a permanent release from the relentless
                    self-questioning that she had lived with since adolescence.<hi rend="sup">92</hi> She did gain,
                    first at Hull-House and then in the long Lighthouse years, an explicit sense of her own
                    worth—the joy of being "useful"—which had evaded her in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>. At home she had felt pulled in a dozen directions. Her busy-ness left her unfulfilled,
                    and resulting periods of restlessness would trigger bouts of self-recrimination followed by
                    rededication to the impossible task, or tasks, of self-perfection. Settlement life entailed a
                    similar splintering of her time and energy, but the encompassing walls imparted that crucial
                    illusion of "one single purpose" which she had sought, vainly and with an
                    increasing sense of her own guilty <hi rend="i">hubris,</hi> at home in Indiana. With its explicit
                    Presbyterian affiliation, the Lighthouse represented a direct continuation of Agnes's
                    religious work in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>. More broadly, the settlement embodied the ideas of Christian Socialism, which had
                    become for Agnes the litmus test of the worth of her worldly activities. A deep and enduring
                    affection for Esther Bradford, who with her husband Robert ran the Lighthouse for over thirty years,
                    also anchored Agnes to the settlement with a bond transcending institutional loyalty.</p>
            <p>Not a renunciation, but a re-creation, of home and family, the settlement achieved an almost seamless
                    merger of domestic detail and the personal enlargement and fulfillment of what Vida D. Scudder would
                    call the "freedom that is perfect service" to a clamoring, suffering world.<hi rend="sup">93</hi> There were certainly many who entered <list type="footnotes">

                            was an evangelistic movement that sought to bring both personal betterment and international
                            peace through a universal rededication to God and the four "Absolutes":
                            honesty, purity, unselfishness, and love. Agnes was apparently an ardent disciple and strove
                            to convert friends and family members. Her cousins resisted the call, not least because
                            Buchman's advocacy of "public confession" violated the
                            family's tacit code of privacy. (Interestingly, the practice of public profession
                            of faith was part of the Christian Endeavor idea as developed by Francis Clark, though it is
                            unclear whether Agnes's groups at Nebraska and her own church practiced this.)

            <p>The promotion of Alvin P. Hovey to brevet major general of volunteers in July, 1864, was an incident
                    of some note during the Civil War's <placeName>

                    </placeName> campaign. Angered by what he considered a political favor given to an unworthy officer,
                    General William T. Sherman protested vigorously. President Abraham <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who had granted the promotion, responded, and historians have used this exchange to
                    illustrate the personalities of both men. Thus overshadowed, Hovey's case receded into
                        obscurity.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is unfortunate that Hovey's promotion, as such, has not received more attention, for his
                    story is informative concerning the way in which military appointments in the Civil War were
                    intertwined with political considerations. Hovey's was not a simplistic case of military
                    patronage, as Sherman believed, but an illustration of the mutable boundaries between politics and
                    the military in a citizen army and the effects of that combination on the life of a man who
                    successfully worked in both spheres. Hovey was a political general as were John A. Logan, Frank P.
                    Blair, and other northwesterners. Unlike them, he failed to make maximum use of his talents as
                    politician and as general to achieve advancement of the kind he desired.</p>

            <p>With his new rank Hovey began to move in higher circles and to fill more important positions. He

                    although they yielded no significant results. Arkansas was a sideshow to the great objective of
                    opening the Mississippi River, and Hovey's expedition toward <placeName>

            <p>Before the winter of 1863 Hovey's war views were consonant with those of other conservatives
                    who supported the Union. He advocated vigorous action against armed opponents but lenient treatment
                    of noncombatants. His dispatches from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Helena</settlement>
                    </placeName> conveyed eagerness to take the offensive, leading Sherman to prophesy success for the <placeName>

                    it to stand until an expiration date prearranged by Hovey. Expressing his desire to wage a decent

            <p>Those views modified during the winter as Hovey witnessed the impact of a dual policy toward
                    southerners. During the <placeName>

                    northern traders who took advantage of a lenient Federal trade policy with southern civilians.
                    Military information traveled south with the traders, convincing Hovey that a liberal policy toward
                    noncombatants was inconsistent with a vigorous policy toward soldiers. "War and commerce
                    with the same people! What a Utopian dream!" he complained in December, 1862. The surest
                    sign of his conversion to a vigorous prosecution against civilians as well as fighters occurred when
                    Adjutant General Lorenzo Thomas spoke to the troops at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Helena</settlement>
                    </placeName> about the government's plan to arm freed blacks. Hovey endorsed the measure
                    and added: "I want all the cotton burned north and south, all trade stopped, all commerce
                    closed. I want all the women and children, especially of rebels, reduced to starvation and want.
                    This will bring their friends home who are fighting us."<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>The radicalization of Hovey's war views occurred at the same time that promotion became
                    obviously important to him. On January 30, 1863, the field officers of his unit petitioned <placeName>

                    </placeName> to give Hovey a commission as major general. They cited his service as a division
                    leader and "his untiring energy and unselfish patriotism …." The
                    officers had no trouble convincing their commander. He sent a copy of the petition to his wife and

                    mind.</p>
            <p>Hovey thereafter began to maneuver with the skill of an experienced politician. He considered his
                    vigorous war views as a tool of promotion. On February 2 he authored a circular that responded to
                    antiwar sentiment in the Northwest. Endorsed by many of his officers who shared his politics, the
                    circular urged Indianans to ignore southern efforts to alienate northern Democrats from the war
                    effort. Hovey argued that North and South could not live peaceably if separated and stressed the
                    shame of northern subservience to a despotic southern aristocracy. He sent a copy of this jeremiad
                    to Samuel R. Curtis, his department commander, who heartily endorsed his views and forwarded them to <placeName>

            <p>In addition to creating a good image in the right circles, Hovey tried to regain field command and
                    prove himself in battle. Opportunities were few at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Helena</settlement>
                    </placeName>; in fact, he was demoted to brigade command in February when a new superior officer
                    arrived. Hovey traveled downriver to see Grant personally about a command in the operations against <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vicksburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Returning with a promise of aid, Hovey assured his wife: "When I am once more
                    in battle I will [earn] my promotion, whether I receive it or not." Hovey constantly
                    worried that people he considered less qualified might be advanced before him. He decided to resign
                    if that occurred and began to brood at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Helena</settlement>
                    </placeName> while waiting for word from Grant. The promotions of "mere partizans"
                    like Blair and Cadwallader C. Washburn, "who never fought a battle," seemed to
                    prove his worst fears, but he retained hope. Hovey sent a blank petition asking for his promotion to

                    performance of his career. Grant and corps commander John A. McClernand were impressed with his
                    energy and determination. Hovey carefully guarded his reputation, investigating unidentified reports
                    that claimed other units replaced his during the battle rather than supported it. Later that summer
                    he participated in the siege of <placeName>

                    asked Hughes to present his case in writing so that he could examine and act on it. The routing of
                    Hovey's recommendation through Stanton had kept <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>Hovey was never so certain of his promotion as were his friends. In addition to career problems he
                    suffered a severe personal blow when Mary died in late November. The day after her burial he wrote
                    to Grant asking for orders. If a field command was not available, he wanted to remain in Indiana to
                    organize and train new recruits for the spring campaigns. Almost inevitably the subject of promotion
                    came up. Hovey wanted to correct the by-passing of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the process of forwarding his recommendation so the president could know that his
                    name had been officially advanced long before. Grant failed to oblige Hovey in that matter but
                    ordered him to work with recruits at <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>The assignment placed Hovey in the heart of political Indiana. In February, 1864, the
                    state's Republicans convened to nominate their ticket, presidential electors, and delegates
                    to the national convention. In addition to calling themselves the Union party, Republicans tried to
                    broaden their base of support by nominating War Democrats to fill state offices. Hovey
                    "persistently refused" to be included but was gratified when the party urged his
                    promotion. It made the array of endorsements complete; his subordinate officers, his superiors, and
                    now his political compeers supported him.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the winter progressed, Hovey learned that even those positive endorsements made no headway against
                    the system of army promotion. As Hughes informed him, there were limited shares of the pie and too
                    many hungry gourmands. Hughes discovered that Indiana Senator Henry Smith Lane, a Republican who
                    served on the Committee on Military Affairs, had tried to <list type="footnotes">

                    somewhat overshadowed Hovey's, and Hughes counseled his friend not to confront Kimball
                    publicly about the issue. He suggested private efforts and persuaded Frank P. Blair, Jr., whose
                    "influence with the President is great," to see <placeName>

            <p>Blair did not want to meddle in Indiana affairs but obliged Hughes because of a sense of duty to a
                    vigorous Unionist. He believed Hovey had priority in the promotion sweepstakes because of his work

                    </placeName> was surfeited with information on the worthy general. <placeName>

                    </placeName> assured Blair that he would soon nominate Hovey, but a few weeks before he had thrown
                    up his hands while talking with Schuyler Colfax about the subject. Colfax, the Republican speaker of
                    the House, and other Indiana representatives had requested that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> create another major generalcy for someone from their state. The president gave them
                    little hope, remarking that Iowa had no major general and he could not give her one, much less add
                    another to Indiana's credit. He either disremem-bered or lied to help himself evade
                    pressure from his group of visitors, for Iowa had at least one major general, Samuel R. Curtis.
                    Colfax, who had helped secure Hovey's promotion to brigadier general in 1862, offered the
                    Indianan more hope in early February when he relayed Lane's optimistic view of the

            <p>Those assurances made little difference; no promotion arrived, and spring brought a return to the
                    field. Hovey had worked energetically to raise new troops. In January, 1864, he had issued a call
                    promising recruits the opportunity to serve in a brigade composed entirely of Indiana regiments.
                    Grant had hoped Hovey could organize and ready the men for duty by spring. Ten regiments were
                    created, five of infantry and five of cavalry. The former were put under Hovey's orders and

            <p>Hovey's brief participation in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>
                    </placeName> campaign offered a strange contrast to his earlier field work. At the battle of Resaca,
                    May 15, 1864, his division received orders to move seven hundred yards across an open field exposed
                    to Confederate fire in order to support Alpheus S. Williams's division of the 20th Corps.
                    Hovey reported that his troops, although new, ran across the field and drove their enemy
                    "like smoke before the wind." Williams described it differently and probably more
                    accurately. He urged Hovey to support his command, but the Indianan admitted that his men
                    "could not be got through the line of artillery fire." Indeed, they did not move
                    up until the Rebels had been driven back. Hovey had poor soldiers to command, "many of whom
                    were old men and boys," according to the Army of the <placeName>

                    Corps leader John M. Schofield believed the problem lay in Hovey's mind. "He seems
                    incapable of comprehending an order or of having any definite idea of what is transpiring around
                    him." As a result, Schofield considered him untrustworthy in the field.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

            <p>A number of factors combined to decrease Hovey's efficiency by the spring of 1864. The loss
                    of his wife might have depressed him. Certainly, the inferior condition of his raw troops was
                    important in explaining his poor performance. A major factor, however, appears to have been
                    bitterness over the long-delayed advancement. Not only had Hovey's promotion been
                    consistently postponed despite repeated assurances to the contrary but his plans to lead an Indiana
                    legion had also fallen apart. He insisted that the cavalry units he had raised be added to his
                    division, a desire that was inconsistent with his previous attitude and irrational in professional
                    terms. During the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vicksburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> campaign Hovey had worked hard to learn the ways of a professional soldier whose
                    primary aim was to serve his subordinates. According to Charles A. Dana, a War Department observer
                    with Grant's army, Hovey tried "to learn the military profession just as if he
                    expected to spend his life in it." Dana also noted that Hovey was too concerned about
                    personal renown to be given complete confidence as a military leader, but in 1863 that flaw did not
                    mar his reputation or his field performance.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> One year later, after the death
                    of his wife and to a large degree because of the repeated frustration of his ambition, Hovey was a
                    different kind of soldier.</p>
            <p>The months of deferred hope for his promotion had set the foundation for Hovey's emotional
                    estrangement from the army. The refusal to increase his division's size was the final
                    catalyst for his physical estrangement. The Indianan offered his resignation on June 6, 1864, citing
                    the failure to promote him and the diversion of his cavalry regiments to other commands. "I
                    cannot be thus humbled and consent to serve longer," he concluded. As Hovey informed his
                    daughter, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s "broken promises" had been the cause of his discontent,
                    and he insisted on leaving the army "unless he [the president] gives me a Major Generalship
                    and a larger command …."<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hovey's resignation encountered opposition from Schofield and Sherman. The former modified
                    his opinion of the month before, apparently deciding that Hovey should remain unless a more
                    competent man could be found to replace him; the latter was reluctant to approve a resignation for
                    the reasons Hovey advanced. The cavalry regiments were not mounted because of a shortage of horses
                    and funds; in addition, they guarded supply <list type="footnotes">

                    command. A division consisting half of infantry and half of cavalry was out of the question; it
                    would "no more make a unit in a good whole than oil and water will commingle."
                    Sherman had nothing to do with promises for promotion. He wanted Hovey to reconsider his decision or
                    propose different reasons for resigning. The Indianan discussed it at length with Sherman on June 9
                    but remained adamant. Unwilling to create a hybrid unit or subtract regiments from another division
                    for him, and unable to promote him, Sherman decided to approve Hovey's resignation. Before

                    </placeName>, Hovey referred to the resignation in a farewell message to his command. "It
                    is enough for me to say that I think a due regard to my personal honor and the honor of my State
                    demand it."<hi rend="sup">22</hi>

                    </placeName>. Ironically, he called on the same friends who had lobbied for his promotion to push
                    for his resignation. Colfax informed him gently that his repeated requests for aid began to wear
                    thin. Taking time out of his busy schedule, the speaker visited <placeName>

                    </placeName> on June 18 and showed him Hovey's letters explaining his reasons for leaving
                    the army, ccording to Colfax the president took it badly, remarking "that they were the
                    only things he had seen in you [Hovey] that he did not like …." <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> decided not to accept the resignation for he had sincerely intended to promote Hovey,
                    and he tried to enlighten Colfax on the reasons for advancing other officers instead. Richard J.
                    Oglesby of Illinois had resigned and desired that Grenville M. Dodge of Iowa fill his place. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> felt he could not disoblige the former. Although James B. Steedman of Ohio had less
                    priority than Hovey, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> had nevertheless signed his commission when Stanton had forwarded it. Unwilling to
                    block Steedman's promotion after it had gone so far as to be confirmed by the Senate, the
                    president "did not like to refuse to sign it, as he had always intended to promote
                    him." It was the same story that Hovey's lobbyists had heard time and time again,
                    and Colfax realized the futility of his mission. After referring <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> dropped the idea in favor of a purely honorary promotion. He nominated Hovey for a
                    brevet commission as major general, which advanced him in no practical way but might soothe his ego.
                    The commission was approved by the Senate and sent to Indiana by mid-July. Hovey accepted it on the
                        eighteenth.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although Hovey took the commission, it did not satisfy him. Stanton requested that he withdraw his

                    his view it changed nothing. He insisted on leaving the army. The authorities were equally insistent
                    that he stay, and the impasse continued.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

            <p>The advancement, minor as it was, provoked a strong response from Sherman. On July 24 James A.

                            nominees for promotion to the Senate was very loose during the Civil War. Apparently someone

                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s. Correcting a misimpression in his earlier dispatch, Sherman noted that
                    Osterhaus had left the army because of "temporary sickness." Nevertheless, he
                    reemphasized his displeasure and expanded on the reasons for it. If the two had been promoted a year
                    before, when they had been nominated, no harm would have occurred. From the beginning of the <placeName>

                    stage in the game" had been reached to allow him "to balance accounts
                    …." The promotions worked injury on his officers' morale.

                    Lloyd Lewis accepted Cox's analysis, and military historian B. H. Liddell Hart also sided
                    with the generals.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sherman was able to assume his stance because he had limited responsibilities. As a field commander
                    he was concerned with efficiently accomplishing military objectives. The promotions injured morale
                    to some degree, as a remark by Williams proved: "The whole system of promotion is by the
                    practice of a low grovelling lick-spittle subserving and pandering …." The
                    incident prompted Williams to announce privately his decision to resign as soon as he could do so
                    honorably, a desire he later relinquished. Sherman distributed copies of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s July 26 dispatch to his army and division leaders in order to neutralize
                    their discontent. His anger over the promotions had been caused partially by his neglect to ask <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> to defer appointments until he recommended them. Sherman had written this request on
                    July 24, but it did not reach <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> in time to postpone either promotion. Nevertheless, Sherman put his house in order
                    quickly and made positive gains because of the controversy. On July 28 Hardie asked him to nominate
                    eight colonels for commissions as brigadier generals. As Cox noted, Sherman was primarily concerned
                    with exerting some control over promotions in his command. His judgments in this regard were based
                    almost entirely on military grounds.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>

                    number of openings existing for major generals by the war's midpoint, and the
                    qualifications of Hovey's competitors. The Indiana interests that Hovey represented had

                    </placeName>-American community. Hovey was a mainstream politician with only one outstanding
                    campaign to his credit. His support was desirable but not essential, so <placeName>

                    </placeName> offered him enough to retain his services but not so much as to hinder the patronage
                    power he needed to secure the good will of more valuable men. The president's insistence on
                    keeping Hovey in the army illustrated his successful efforts to balance the sometimes conflicting
                    requirements of politics and military professionalism.</p>
            <p>The degeneration of Hovey's field efficiency did not render him a supernumerary in the army.
                    In August, while awaiting a decision on his resignation, Hovey assumed command of a few Indiana
                    militiamen and conducted a foray into <placeName>

                    idly by while his home was in danger. The action resulted in unimportant skirmishing, but it sparked
                    efforts by the War Department to give him further employment. Ignoring the resignation, Stanton
                    assigned him to command the District of Indiana, and he accepted. Hovey left the army long after the
                    war's end, in October, 1865.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>

                    the general did not mention his inconsequential part in the battle of Resaca. Sherman had ignored
                    his "brilliant and effective charge," which had no equal "in the pages of

            <p>The Iroquois middleman theory has long been a source of contention for historians. Proponents of this
                    hypothesis believe that the Iroquois, or Five Nations, of colonial <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> acted as "economic" middlemen between English merchants and Indians
                    of the upper Great Lakes country. According to the theory, seventeenth-century Iroquois traders
                    obtained manufactured goods at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> and carried them westward, where they were exchanged for furs trapped by western
                    Indians. Opponents of the idea argue that the Iroquois never became effective economic middlemen.</p>
            <p>Charles H. McIlwain was the first modern historian to emphasize the Iroquois' role in
                    carrying English goods westward to trade among the Great Lakes tribes. "The great
                    rôle of the Iroquois," wrote McIlwain in 1915, "was that of middlemen
                    between the ‘Far Indians’ and the English, a rôle which enabled
                    them … to retain that position of superiority over the Indians of the eastern half of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> In 1940 George T. Hunt elaborated upon
                    McIlwain's ideas in his widely acclaimed <hi rend="i">The Wars of the Iroquois: A Study in
                        Intertribal Trade Relations.</hi> Hunt's work detailing the Iroquois' economic
                    motives for warfare against their Indian neighbors brought about a general acceptance of the

                    While admitting that the Iroquois might have had ambitions to become middlemen and might even have
                    served as middlemen on occasion, <list type="footnotes">

                    theory was doubtful at best. Trelease's more weighty evidence showed that the Iroquois
                    never played a major role as middlemen carrying English goods westward to trade for furs trapped by
                    Far Indians of the upper Great Lakes country.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Most historians today generally
                    accept Trelease's conclusion that Iroquois middleman activity in the western fur trade was
                    "sporadic and of slight importance." They believe, as Bruce G. Trigger states in
                    the <hi rend="i">Handbook of North American Indians,</hi> that "there is … no
                    convincing evidence that prior to 1673 the Iroquois were interested in exploiting their central
                    location in relationship to other tribes in order to play the role of middlemen."<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, this controversy over whether the Five Nations were economic middlemen in the
                    seventeenth century has obscured another type of middleman position developed by the Iroquois in the
                    eighteenth century. The Iroquois might not have been middlemen in the manner described by Trelease,
                    Hunt, and others, but after 1700 they were middlemen in another sense. Instead of functioning as
                    "economic" middlemen who transported goods westward, the Five Nations became
                    "geographic" middlemen by inviting western Indians to travel through Iroquoia to
                    the English trade at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Oswego</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This strategy was an excellent blend of geopolitics and economic diplomacy, for it
                    enabled the Iroquois to use their geographic location between the Indians of the upper Great Lakes
                    region and the traders of <placeName>

                    Neutrals, Eries, and other western tribes in a series of beaver wars in the mid-seventeenth century,
                    but their hegemony in the area was short-lived. By the turn of the century the Iroquois, who had
                    lost nearly half their warriors in bloody fighting against the French and western tribes during King
                    William's War, were no longer able to defend by force hunting rights in the West.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> The Five Nations realized, however, that their economic well-being, and
                    perhaps their very existence, depended on their being able to hunt safely in the Western Country.
                    The Iroquois also were aware that they would suffer many casualties in the event of renewed
                    hostilities with the numerous and powerful western tribes. These realizations set the stage for the
                    shift in Iroquois policy toward rapprochement with the western Indians in the early eighteenth
                    century. The Five Nations hoped that where a policy of war had failed to provide them with a source
                    of furs from the Western Country a policy of peace would succeed. They also hoped that whereas
                    warfare had failed to give them dominance and influence over the western Indians diplomacy would
                    succeed. In addition, the Iroquois soon recognized that benefits other than safety and hunting
                    privileges could accrue from a policy of peace toward their western neighbors. At that point choice
                    replaced necessity as the mother of the Iroquois' rapprochement strategy.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

                    </placeName> to treat with the French and their Indian allies. The Five Nations hoped that French
                    mediation and protection would improve their relations with the western tribes. The Grand Settlement
                    of 1701 established the Five Nations' neutrality in any future wars between <placeName>

                    Callières's words were exactly what the Iroquois wanted to hear. Even though

            <p>Not only did the Settlement of 1701 allow the Iroquois to hunt and travel throughout the West in
                    relative safety, it also provided them with the chance to visit the villages of the western tribes
                    to peddle their most important asset: their willingness to allow the western Indians to cross
                    Iroquoia to obtain English trade goods. Since the 1680s <placeName>

                    tribes of the Great Lakes country would benefit the Five Nations as well as the English. The great
                    losses suffered in King William's War forced the Iroquois to consider the New
                    Yorkers' proposal seriously. In 1700 <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s governor, the Earl of Bellomont, had stated: "you must needs be

                    that by their continued Warring upon you they will in a few years totally destroy you
                    …." Bellomont suggested that the Iroquois "try all possible Means to
                    fix a Trade &amp; correspondence with all those Nations, by which you would retain them to
                    yourselves, and," he added, "with my Assistance I am in hopes in a short time they

                    with the Waganhas (Ottawas) by soliciting English support. Colden noted that the Iroquois sent

                    Indians came to trade once, but after being cheated they never came back again. Apparently, the Five
                    Nations told the western Indians that they could find cheap prices for manufactured goods and
                    quality rum if they journeyed through Iroquoia and traded at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> or <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oswego</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The use of such a sales pitch by the Iroquois would explain their comments made to
                    Governor William Cosby at a conference in 1735. They complained that at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oswego</settlement>

                    like liars in the eyes of the western tribes.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Along with asking for better prices and trade practices, the Iroquois frequently sought prohibition

                    of the century. By enabling French merchants to obtain highly valued English manufactured goods that

                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>

            <p>The Five Nations' continued concern with the commerce between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Montreal</settlement>
                    </placeName> illustrates the importance of their geographic location between the English and the
                    western tribes. Although the Iroquois very seldom acted as seventeenth-century
                    "economic" middlemen in the manner described by McIlwain and Hunt, their
                    eighteenth-century "geographic" middleman position benefited them in numerous
                    ways. The Five Nations, in return for granting the western Indians free and safe passage through
                    Iroquoia, received a guarantee of peace and safety for Iroquois hunters in the Western Country. As
                    an added dividend, some Iroquois profited by trading with western Indians as they passed through
                    Iroquoia to and from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Further, the Iroquois geographic middleman position forced the English to remain on
                    good political and economic terms with the Iroquois in exchange for the Five Nations'
                    consent to allow the western tribes a free and safe passage to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> trade. The western Indians were also cognizant of the Iroquois' geographic
                    importance. In order to obtain safe passage through Iroquoia and thus access to English trade goods,
                    which were a better quality than the higher-priced French products, the western Indians had to
                    remain at peace with the Five Nations, a peace that the war-weakened Iroquois desperately needed.
                    Not only did the Iroquois' geographic middleman position help to neutralize a potentially
                    dangerous enemy, it also helped transform that enemy into a friend. Furthermore, for every tribe
                    that became an Iroquois ally, there was one less group willing to join the French in war against the
                    Five Nations. The Iroquois' military position, therefore, improved with every Indian nation
                    that agreed to journey through Iroquoia for trade with the English. In short, the Iroquois benefited
                    economically, politically, diplomatically, and militarily by establishing themselves as geographic
                    middlemen.</p>
            <p>The Iroquois' success as geographic middlemen also had a significant impact on the

                    English and western tribes were important by-products of the Iroquois' efforts, and this
                    alliance opened the way for English mercantile profits and English colonial expansion; ultimately it
                    became a contributing factor in the English-French contest for control of the Ohio Country and North
                    America. When the French realized that the balance of power in the Western Country was tipping
                    toward the English as many tribes accepted Iroquois invitations to trade with the English, French
                    leaders plotted a course of action that plunged them into the Seven Years' War. In the long
                    run, the Iroquois' geographic middleman activities not only provided the Five Nations with
                    economic, political, and military benefits, they also affected the English-French struggle to
                    control the West, the fur trade, and western tribes.</p>

            <p>This volume is a provocative and engaging description of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and its seat, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, between World Wars I and II. The book also portrays the lives, attitudes, and
                    circumstances of several citizens of the county during the period. Dillon Bustin has edited
                    photographer Frank M. Hohenberger's negatives and diaries to tell the story, but the work
                    is far more than a local history. As the tale unfolds, Bustin calls attention to a family of complex
                    and interesting issues, with ramifications far beyond the county and state.</p>
            <p>Hohenberger was an outsider who moved to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown County</region>
                    </placeName> from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, drawn by the same forces that have made the place a haven for artists and tourists
                    throughout the century. The magnet is a vision of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown County</region>
                    </placeName> as a place where time has stood still, a rural community full of geniality, honesty,
                    contentment, and love. The photographer had both a public and private persona. His public side was
                    manifested in the photographs he sold and the column he wrote for the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Star.</hi> Here, he tended to portray the area as pastoral and the people as colorful
                    rustics, and occasionally as bumpkins or hicks. The private side is seen in his diaries and
                    snapshots. Although these offer few glimpses of the man himself, they do highlight
                    Hohenberger's understanding of the complexity of local life. Still, nostalgic stereotyping
                    remains, and Bustin compares this vision—which Hohenberger shared with the other artists
                    who settled in the county—with the rhapsodies of peasant life created by Jean-Francois
                    Millet, William Morris, and Leo Tolstoy. Threading through the book is the theme: why are country
                    people idealized by a certain sort of city person?</p>
            <p>The book's main thrust is to limn a picture of a place and time, using
                    Hohenberger's images and words as paint and brush. The primary device is the portrait:
                    Bustin has painstakingly assembled his materials into chapters about eighteen individuals. The
                    individuals represent the range of local citizens, although, as Bustin notes, Hohenberger's
                    circle of friends consisted largely of bachelors, spinsters, and the moderately outcast.</p>
            <p>In the diary entries readers learn about Hohenberger's relationship with the individuals, a
                    topic further explored in another selection of entries on the photographer's relationship
                    to <pb n="62" id="VAA4025-080-1-068"/> the community at large. The relationship had its share of
                    sour moments, usually precipitated by the appearance of one of the <hi rend="i">Star</hi> columns.
                    In these sections Bustin explores the question of how members of different cultural groups
                    understand or fail to understand one another. One naturally expects this theme in, say, Isak
                    Dinesen's <hi rend="i">Out of Africa</hi> (1937) but is gratified to encounter it in a
                    discussion in which all parties are English-speaking Americans of North European ancestry.</p>
            <p>The book's second thrust is history in the more customary sense of the term. In the opening
                    sections and epilog Bustin sketches the county's economic situation, the larger American
                    scene as it impinged on the county, and the aspects of the art world that influenced <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s artist's colony. During this discourse Bustin examines the meaning
                    of the town's "Liar's Bench" and a broader theme emerges. The
                    liar's bench stood in front of the courthouse, an artifact fraught with symbolism. As
                    Bustin notes, it meant one thing to the men who sat on it, another to urban Americans who saw
                    Hohenberger's picturesque image of it, and yet another to the town's women,
                    presumably including the wives of the "idlers" who wasted time there. It was this
                    latter group who finally destroyed the bench. This story not only describes the town's
                    social dynamics but also tells how an object may become a symbol and how symbols are interpreted by
                    the variety of people who confront them.</p>
            <p>The book is well designed, the photographs well reproduced, and Bustin's prose reads
                    smoothly. The excerpts from Hohenberger's diaries tend to be telegraphic and often follow
                    one another for two or three uninterrupted pages. This demands close concentration from the reader,
                    but the method of juxtaposing the man's words and pictures is effective. Bustin had shaped
                    the materials into a humane and insightful chapter in the history of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown County</region>
                    </placeName>. At the same time and without tendentious scholarly writing, the occasion was used to
                    interpret the very process by which the evidence was created. Altogether, <hi rend="i">If You

                    in Pennsylvania and Indiana are well served by Karl J. R. Arndt's two most recent additions
                    to his meticulously compiled and annotated documentary history of the Harmony Society.
                    Chronologically second and fifth in his series, these volumes continue to flesh out in minute detail
                    the saga of economic, cultural, and communal achievements and conflicts of the 1,200 pietistic
                    Separatists from Württemberg who followed the millennialistic vision of George Rapp to
                    America after 1803 and built Harmony and Economy (now Ambridge), <placeName>

                        Harmony Society, 1785–1847</hi> (1972) a welcome guide to these works.</p>
            <p>Documents illuminate such subjects as the Harmonists' arrival, settlement, formal agreements
                    of association, adoption of a common treasury and celibacy, economic and political influence,
                    reasons for moving to Indiana territory in 1815 and returning to Pennsylvania a decade later,
                    building of their steamboat <hi rend="i">William Penn,</hi> and their dependence upon the Wabash and
                        <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>s. George Rapp's mystical passages and prophetic
                    interpretations of current events appear in pastoral letters together with his comments regarding
                    the publication and English translation of his <hi rend="i">Thoughts on the Destiny of Man</hi>
                    (1824), the first book of religious philosophy printed in Indiana.</p>
            <p>Arndt presents two types of evidence to support his main contention that Rapp's religious
                    community was the antithesis of the misguided, nonsectarian communal experiments of Robert Owen at <placeName>

                    carry the narrative. These include President Thomas Jefferson's 1804 letter to Albert
                    Gallatin attempting to facilitate Harmonist settlement on public lands in Ohio and John
                    Melish's favorable account of his 1811 visit to Harmony, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, which brought the Harmonists <pb n="64" id="VAA4025-080-1-070"/> their initial fame in
                    Europe and America and first attracted Robert Owen's attention to their successful
                    collectivism. Also reprinted are passages from Owenite sources such as the diaries of Robert Dale
                    Owen and Donald MacDonald; Robert Owen's radical Fourth of July Oration, which, contrary to
                    Arndt's suggestion, has always been readily accessible in the New-Harmony <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi> of July 12, 1826; and the published observations of both Owen's <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Rapp's Economy by Duke Bernard of Wiemar in the editor's new
                    translation. The second type of sources composing the bulk of these volumes includes Harmony Society
                    records and letters to and from George Rapp, his adopted son, Frederick, and a handful of other
                    Harmonists, including several women. These are selected from Arndt's own extensive private,
                    and still closed, collection at Clark University, the result of his forty years of tireless
                    research. Documents in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> are provided in English translation with valuable, if not totally unbiased, summaries
                    and notes but without direct citations to locate the original documents in his archives.</p>
            <p>The abuses of authoritarian leadership and intentionally devious organizational policies often
                    associated with cultist communal groups surfaced in the Harmony Society. George Rapp held spiritual
                    control and maintained group solidarity through his charismatic mysticism while his adopted son,
                    Frederick, directed the society's business affairs. George discouraged members'
                    private correspondence, censored their mail, implemented his utilitarian concept of women, and
                    eliminated potential challenges to his leadership by removing capable men from positions of
                    authority by vindictive acts of personal jealousy. George and Frederick never shared annual reports
                    of communal income and expenses with the membership. Reports of members' inheritances
                    collected for the society in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> were transmitted only in code. Frederick eventually speculated heavily with the
                    community's multiplying wealth without members' knowledge. Arndt is convinced that
                    the grasp for power represented by the "Declaration," which the members apparently
                    signed in 1825 and which put all society property in Frederick's name but which was not
                    legally filed until after his death in 1834, helped cause the great Harmonist schism when one third
                    left Economy in 1832. Despite Arndt's best investigative efforts, mystery still shrouds
                    when and why the society generated, signed, and made legal its organizational documents and whether
                    the ugly rumor that George Rapp inadvertently killed his only son, John, by castration in 1812 has
                    substance. John did not sign the society's first Articles of Association but did marry and
                    did father a child in the celibate community. Therefore, Arndt feels obligated to take the rumor <pb n="65" id="VAA4025-080-1-071"/> seriously enough to offer religious explanations that could
                    account for the elder Rapp's rationalization of such an heinous act.</p>
            <p>All this induces the leading Harmonist authority, who in 1980 revived the Harmony Society Press to
                    complete his publications, to lament that "the most disappointing, disillusioning and yet
                    undeniable result of my long and thorough research into the history of Rapp's determination
                    to build the City of God on earth is the inescapable fact that an element of doubt and uncertainity,
                    if not premeditated ‘pious’ fraud, clings to most of the important documents
                    of Rapp's Society as far as its honesty toward the members of the Society is
                    concerned" (<hi rend="i">Harmony on the <placeName>

            <p>So many elements in Theodore Dreiser the man and Theodore Dreiser the artist elude satisfactory
                    intellectual explanation and seem to embody the very essence of contradiction: Dreiser was the man
                    who strenuously attacked the Soviet system in print but who also referred to Stalin as the
                    "White Christ" and who, almost on his deathbed, applied for membership in the
                    Communist party; the creator of books at once harsh in their indictment of the American system and
                    sloppily sentimental about underlying religious and moral values; and the sometimes incisive thinker
                    who was also the often impossibly awkward, almost inarticulate writer.</p>
            <p>In <hi rend="i">Dreiser and His Fiction</hi> Lawrence E. Hussman, Jr., sees these and other problems
                    as parts of an underlying unity—the effort of an engaged mind to respond to the chaos in
                    himself and in the world and to make sense of both. Treating in chronological order all of the
                    novels and significant stories and essays as well, Hussman proposes that Dreiser's life was
                    a struggle toward solution: "Having cut himself off from religious beliefs at the outset of
                    an increasingly skeptical, materialistic age, he was nonetheless plagued by a gnawing need to
                    believe in some transcendent reality. His personal search and the art that flowed from it
                    represented an anguished attempt to find not only a worthy worldly ideal but also a method of living
                    that could guarantee secular salvation in the form of fulfillment" (p. 194). Those readers
                    who know only <hi rend="i">Sister Carrie</hi> and <hi rend="i">An American Tragedy</hi> may not
                    easily accept this notion of a religious goal in Dreiser's thinking; but those who also
                    know <hi rend="i">The "Genius," The Bulwark,</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Stoic</hi>
                    <pb n="66" id="VAA4025-080-1-072"/> will appreciate its value as a reconciliation of the apparent
                    dissimilarities in idea and attitude in Dreiser's fiction.</p>
            <p>In addressing his topic, Hussman makes several significant contributions of other kinds: he uses all
                    of Dreiser's fiction, not just selected works, to see the life and work whole; he provides
                    close critical readings of the fiction and draws not only upon the published versions but also upon
                    the manuscripts; and he takes Dreiser out of the narrow confines of literary naturalism to perceive
                    his sometimes mechanistic and Social Darwinistic ideas as part of a larger effort to understand, an
                    effort that also embraced Quakerism, Hinduism, even traditional Christianity.</p>
            <p>The only flaws in this otherwise very sound book are an occasional plodding dissertation quality:
                    some patches of biography which have no clear function, stiff catalogs of other critical opinion of
                    books and issues, bits of awkward and inefficient prose. The sensible reader, however, will forgive
                    these faults for the valuable organizing insight about Dreiser lying beneath.</p>

                    </placeName> entered the twentieth century alive with urban potential. Varied industries, good
                    transportation, attractive agricultural surroundings, and a confident booster spirit all favored
                    growth. The <placeName>

                    mirrored the aggressive business expansion of other successful trade centers. After 1920, however, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s urban prospects faded. Population growth ended, local business began to
                    falter, and rude "sin city" barbs began to be hurled by outsiders. Individual
                    success stories stood in contrast to community problems and invited study and explanation.</p>

                        <region type="county">Vigo County</region>
                    </placeName> Historical Society conducted an elaborate photographic history project designed to
                    collect and interpret materials of the years from 1900 to 1950. Grant funding permitted the society
                    both to collect materials and to use those photographs as the basis for interpretive public
                    programs. The resulting book contains over three hundred examples of the scenes and portraits
                    assembled during the search.</p>
            <pb n="67" id="VAA4025-080-1-073"/>
            <p>A majority of the illustrations are the product of one local source, Martins Photo Shop. Two
                    generations operated this family firm from 1906 to 1976 and retained a commercial file of scenes and
                    portraits whose range and technical quality are very good, if sometimes rather bland in content. The
                    Martin contribution is supplemented from fifteen other local sources of more uneven quality.</p>

                    portraiture; the years after 1920 receive substantially greater coverage than those before; and
                    chronology is subordinated to a topical treatment. The emphasis is upon personal and local
                    experience: in work, family, social service, recreation, and community response to wars and
                    depression. There is a serious attempt to incorporate the undersides of urban life so seldom found
                    in the visual record. Very little text accompanies the pictures, suggesting the original
                    project's desire to stimulate individual response and public discussion. A number of the
                    captions, however, contain effective and often unexpected insights along with the usual

            <p>J. Ronald Engel has written an informative volume that will be useful for a variety of readers,
                    including those interested in the history of the ecological movement in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, those concerned about the competition for control of natural and scenic resources, and
                    those committed to the preservation of representative areas of native habitat and natural
                    environment. This book blends historical description, religious analysis, and social criticism in an
                    interdisciplinary manner. It holds special interest for persons located in the Midwest, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> area, and the state of Indiana.</p>
            <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-080-1-074"/>
            <p>Engel places the twentieth-century effort to preserve the Indiana Dunes into the context of a larger
                    movement in the Midwest "to reform the democratic faith of the nation" (p. xviii).
                    He sees the band of crusaders seeking to save the shoreline of Lake Michigan from industrial and
                    commercial exploitation and destruction— a group composed of political, cultural,
                    scientific, and artistic figures, principally Chicagoans or residents of northern
                    Indiana—as informed by a vision of community interdependence and opposed to the
                    individualistic and capitalistic ethic of America. Engel identifies several stages in the story: the
                    struggle that preceded the establishment of the Dunes State Park in 1923, the fight at midcentury
                    against increasing industrialization, and the contemporary battle to preserve what little remains.
                    The opening chapter of the book contains an absorbing account of the Dunes pageant of 1917, which
                    dramatized the plight and the potential of the area. The final chapter describes the last-ditch
                    defense of the Dunes mounted by Senator Paul Douglas of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, who emerges in this volume as an ecological hero by contrast with a long line of
                    Indiana politicians who, in Engel's judgment, sold out to private industry.</p>
            <p>The most creative (and potentially the most controversial) aspect of this volume lies in
                    Engel's description of the "religious dimension" of the Dunes movement.
                    Drawing upon the works of Mircea Eliade and other phenomenologists of religion, Engel associates the
                    reform movement with a "new humanistic faith" emerging at the time, a faith which
                    identifies the "new" citizen as a reflection of the ultimate meaning of American
                    society. He analyzes the pageant of 1917 and its participants, for example, in terms of religious
                    ritual, seeing it as cosmic in scope, a symbolic pilgrimage to the center of the universe. For Engel
                    the Dunes movement cannot be understood apart from this "geocentric" value system.</p>
            <p>This book has a message. Engel echoes Douglas's passionate, almost apocalyptic tone as he
                    writes, "Standing on the last acre of the Dunes we stand symbolically on America's
                    last acre. Therefore to save the Dunes is to save our native land" (p. 237). Himself a
                    professor of social ethics and a committed environmentalist, Engel views the struggle for the Dunes
                    as a measure of basic moral issues in American life.</p>

            <p>This book works on three levels. First, it is an excellent anthology of comedy, featuring <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> humorists—many of them <pb n="69" id="VAA4025-080-1-075"/> nationally
                    prominent—from the 1840s to today. Second, though the editors do not directly address it
                    in their otherwise insightful notes, the selections frequently showcase the major comedy types
                    prevalent in the history of American humor, be they the crackerbarrel tendencies of Finley Peter
                    Dunne's Mr. Dooley or the antihero characteristics of Ring Lardner's Mr. Gullible.
                    Third, while the selections often seem to follow national patterns, there still remains a strong
                    regional stamp. This <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> orientation is particularly apparent when one considers the continuing influence of
                    politics on the city's humor, from the 1840 satirical attack on President Martin Van Buren
                    which opens the book to the frequently biting commentary of Mike Royko in the closing pages.</p>
            <p>A book of this nature, however, is not to be enjoyed for these reasons only, or even just for the new <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> framework it brings to well-known humorists such as Dunne or Lardner. The recognition
                    it provides for important but neglected humorists is also valuable. This reviewer most appreciated
                    making contact with the ethnic humor of Charles H. Harris's Carl Pretzel (who surely
                    influenced Dunne's Mr. Dooley) and the travel-book humor of Benjamin <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> Taylor, whose volumes paralleled the early travel humor of Mark Twain.</p>
            <p>Indiana readers will especially enjoy the inclusion of Hoosier George Ade, who first rose to
                    prominence at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

                    <hi rend="i">Morning News</hi> (later the <hi rend="i">Record</hi>) during the 1890s. The Ade
                    material is drawn from his celebrated daily column "Stories of the Streets and of the
                    Town" and the even more celebrated early "fables in slang" books.
                    Selections such as "The Fable of the Two Mandolin Players and the Willing
                    Performer" (probably Ade's most honored essay) rank with the best the volume has
                    to offer.</p>

                    By Page Smith. (<placeName>

                    </placeName>: McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1982. Pp. xvi, 1038. End maps, index. $29.95.)</head>
            <p>With this massive volume the indefatigable Page Smith presents the fifth volume in his
                    "People's History" of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, a project that began with his two-volume history of the Revolution. Smith is a
                    narrative historian, a skillful storyteller with a unerring eye for interesting and enlightening
                    detail. This approach makes his work somewhat old-fashioned; it is not what most academic historians
                    are doing these days, as Smith, who has all the credentials of the professional historian, well
                    knows.</p>
            <p>But this book is not addressed to academic historians. Smith's goal is to reach a popular
                    audience, to provide a readable study based on modern scholarship but accessible to the general
                    reader. He feels that much of modern historical scholarship, especially that concerning
                    Reconstruction, seldom gets beyond the confines of the academy. As a result, the true record of
                    Reconstruction and its accomplishments is largely unknown. Revisionist historians have provided a
                    fuller and more accurate picture, but their specialized work, Smith insists, has not reached the
                    general public which still considers Reconstruction as a tragic era marked by unrelieved corruption
                    and motivated by a vindictive desire by the victorious North to punish and humiliate the defeated
                    South by imposing upon it domination by ignorant blacks and their vicious, self-seeking white
                    allies, the carpetbaggers and the scalawags. Thus this long book is designed to reach the public
                    that the academic historians have failed to reach.</p>
            <p>If his intended audience provides one meaning for the "people" in Smith's
                    subtitle, his approach to his material provides another. He seeks to depict the lives and fortunes
                    of the people by including ordinary, everyday, homey incidents and by making extensive use of
                    diaries and letters to present these incidents in the words of the participants themselves.
                    Smith's work lacks the methodological apparatus characteristic of the new social history,
                    which shares his goal of describing the lives of the common folk but not his methods. The new social
                    historians would insist that surviving diaries and letters are not typical in any statistical sense;
                    in fact, most are the work of people who are hardly typical in any sense. If the opinions of
                    ordinary soldiers as expressed in <pb n="71" id="VAA4025-080-1-077"/> letters and diaries are not
                    typical, they do express the views of ordinary people. The same cannot be said of the diaries of
                    such people as Gideon Welles and George Templeton Strong, which Smith uses extensively.
                    Nevertheless, if the heavy use of such material does not qualify Smith as a new social
                    historian—a goal that he does not seek in any case—it does give his story a
                    dramatic quality that is absent in so much of modern historical scholarship.</p>
            <p>Because this book is not intended to be a work of original scholarship, it would be improper to
                    criticize it for its failings on that score. One questions, however, if Smith has fully achieved his
                    purpose, if the book will reach the audience for which it was designed. A thousand pages of text
                    present a forbidding task even for an avid reader. Although the many interesting anecdotes and
                    descriptions might hold a reader's attention, they might also obscure the major themes
                    Smith attempts to present.</p>
            <p>At the same time, despite its inordinate length, the book scants important parts of the story. Smith
                    gives little attention to what may be called economic reconstruction—the roles of
                    merchants, landowners, blacks, and northerners in building a new work regime and credit system and
                    in writing the laws and establishing the precedents necessary to build a free labor society on the
                    ruins of the slave labor system. Sharecropping, tenancy, and the crop lien do not even get the
                    attention necessary to warrant an entry in the index.</p>
            <p>Despite these reservations, the book can be recommended to the readers for whom it is designed. Smith
                    has written good popular history. In these days when so much of the history written for the popular
                    audience is bad history, Smith's achievement is an important one.</p>

            <p>Herman Hattaway and Archer Jones here present a major study of the military conduct of the Civil War,
                    with special emphasis on strategy and logistics. The beginning student of Civil War military history
                    will find the work an unmatched guide to how war was fought in the midnineteenth century. Anyone
                    already well versed in Civil War history will find immensely stimulating the authors'
                    interpretations of Union and Confederate <pb n="72" id="VAA4025-080-1-078"/> strategy,
                    interpretations that will have to be grappled with by all subsequent historians of the subject.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, flaws in presentation may distract some readers from the solid values of the book.
                    Hattaway and Jones too often are not content merely to present analyses; they go out of their way to
                    chide other historians for alleged shortcomings. Even while dedicating the book to T. Harry Williams
                    and somewhat unctiously proclaiming their respect for him in the introduction, the authors
                    gratuitously belabor the differences between their interpretations and his, proclaiming, with an
                    immodesty that proves characteristic of their style, that "as Marx felt he had found Hegel
                    standing on his head and turned him rightside up, we think we have done the same for
                    Williams" (p. x). With similar gratuitousness, they deviate from their narrative to reprove
                    Douglas Southall Freeman for using Civil War rather than modern staff terminology. In typical
                    passages they castigate other historians for alleged errors not of fact but of opinion and
                    interpretation (see, for example, pp. 108, 169). Since there can be no clearcut right or wrong
                    verdict in such instances, Hattaway and Jones themselves apparently are unable to distinguish
                    between fact and opinion.</p>
            <p>In addition to making a number of grammatical errors throughout the volume, Hattaway and Jones are
                    also not as thoroughly in command of the relevant historical literature as their pretensions might
                    imply. They would not claim that in 1862 "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> himself still remained indifferent toward total abolition and eventual
                    integration" (p. 270) if they had carefully read La Wanda Cox's <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                        </placeName> and Black Freedom</hi> (1981), or indeed a multitude of recent works. When they
                    write that successful reconstruction of southern states early reconquered by the Union
                    "would have the added advantage of supplying political supporters for the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> administration's policies against their radical opponents" (p. 430),
                    they imply a sharp division between <placeName>

                    </placeName> and the radicals, thereby suggesting that far from turning T. Harry Williams rightside

                    </placeName> and the radicals more recent than Williams's early work.</p>
            <p>Such limitations in dealing with any topics outside narrow military history cannot but weaken even
                    Hattaway's and Jones's analyses of strategy. Nevertheless, their contributions to
                    the strategic as well as operational and tactical history of the war do indeed make their work a
                    major study. The authors build their discussions of strategy upon an unexcelled account of American
                    military education before the Civil War in order to explain the preconceptions with which the
                    generals began. They explain much more adequately than any previous historians the specific ways <pb n="73" id="VAA4025-080-1-079"/> in which the precepts of Antoine Henri Jomini shaped the conduct
                    of the Civil War. They surpass previous historians in their perceptions of the influence of
                    logistics on Civil War strategy; particularly they make clear that in the western theater the
                    Union's inability to go on making consistent use of river lines of communications after <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shiloh</settlement>
                    </placeName> had a crippling effect on further offensives. In detailing the logistical realities,
                    they go far to rehabilitate Henry W. Halleck as a general with an especially acute grasp of those
                    realities. They show that Halleck was also among the first Civil War commanders to recognize that a
                    strategy of annihilating enemy armies in the classic, Napoleonic fashion would no longer work
                    because the rifled firepower and the maneuverability of Civil War armies as well as their size made
                    them almost impossible to destroy within any politically acceptable time limits and with an
                    acceptable casualty rate on one's own side.</p>
            <p>The authors conclude that because of the failure of a classical strategy of annihilation, Grant,
                    Halleck, and William T. Sherman devised a war-winning "strategy of exhaustion,"
                    which defeated the Confederacy by stripping it of the economic ability to supply its armies,
                    especially through Sherman's marches and through destructive cavalry raids. While this
                    reviewer will not emulate the authors' style by stating categorically that their conception
                    of the decisive effects of a strategy of exhaustion is in error, nevertheless their judgment must be
                    considered dubious. The fact remains that the destruction of southern resources essential to
                    carrying out Hattaway's and Jones's version of a strategy of exhaustion could not
                    begin to be achieved on a scale adequate to Union purposes until the Confederate armies had already
                    been substantially destroyed, whatever the costs of a strategy of annihilation.</p>
            <p>The authors' strategic analysis, however, cannot be quickly dismissed. All Civil War
                    students should read the book and ponder its arguments for themselves.</p>

            <p>Victor B. Howard states that it is his intention to write an "integrated" history
                    that incorporates the previously neglected experience of blacks into the whole of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>'s history, and he has achieved this objective admirably. The book is an
                    exemplary <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-080-1-080"/> study of the day-to-day impact of the Civil War on the
                    people and institutions of one state.</p>
            <p>Kentucky was distinctive, if not unique, in a number of respects. It was a border slave state which
                    did not secede and which became a battleground between Union and Confederate forces. Only in
                    Virginia and <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> was there a larger number of slaveholders. Kentucky did not emancipate its slaves by
                    state action, and in a gesture of frustration it refused to ratify the Thirteenth Amendment,
                    although by that time slavery was in reality dead.</p>
            <p>The book is a good study of what the war did to whites and white attitudes as well as to blacks. It
                    shows the complexity and diversity of the slave issue in relation to the preservation of the Union.
                    A minority of Kentuckians, while loyal to the Union, opposed emancipation. The Emancipation
                    Proclamation shook the faith of some of the most determined Union men, but a minority favored
                    emancipation from the beginning.</p>
            <p>The best parts of the book are those which deal with the erosion of slavery. Due to the initiative of
                    blacks themselves slavery began to collapse as soon as the war started. Slaves flocked to the Union
                    camps and to the states north of the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>. The war soon converted Union
                    soldiers to abolition as a practical, not a philosophical, matter, and they openly flouted rules
                    that required them to return slaves to loyal masters. Once enrollment of blacks into military
                    service began, large numbers of slaves sought to enroll (thereby, of course, reducing draft calls
                    upon whites). Other measures of the Union government, including the repeal of the Fugitive Slave
                    Law, combined with black initiatives to hasten the demise of slavery in the state which, by the end
                    of 1864, was "the only significant outpost of legal slavery in the nation" (p.
                    72). Vigorous efforts by the Union government to recruit slaves for military service further
                    weakened the institution.</p>
            <p>Important, too, was the act of Congress, late in the war, freeing families of black soldiers. The
                    military issued orders to recognize the legality of slave marriages. Concern for their families had
                    prevented some slaves from volunteering. "The desire for secure family life was
                    unquestionably the first priority of the prospective black soldier" (p. 11). A chapter on
                    "Families in Transition" illuminates the importance of the family to blacks and
                    the importance of blood relationships.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile large numbers of other slaves had simply left their masters and moved to towns or across
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Slaves had begun to demand wages as early as 1862. The entire labor system in parts of
                    the state where slavery was important was disrupted. After the war a contract system developed
                    which, however, was often disadvantageous to the freedmen.</p>
            <pb n="75" id="VAA4025-080-1-081"/>
            <p>The merit of this book is that it is based on massive and painstaking research, done over a long
                    period of time, in primary local sources—newspapers, personal letters of soldiers,
                    diaries—as well as government documents.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Minister's Wife: Her Role in Nineteenth-Century American
                    Evangelicalism.</hi> By Leonard I. Sweet. (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>: Temple University Press, 1983. Pp. viii, 327. Notes, index. $29.95.)</head>
            <p>Leonard I. Sweet's book is an important contribution both to women's studies and to
                    the history of nineteenth-century evangelical Protestantism. Noting that women occupied a central
                    place in American Protestant churches of the nineteenth century and that religion in turn was
                    intimately intertwined with both the public and private roles of women in that same era, Sweet has
                    focused these broad concerns by studying the historical evolution of the minister's wife, a
                    figure who has long eluded careful examination by professional historians.</p>
            <p>Sweet constructs a threefold typology which he argues shaped the roles of ministers' wives
                    throughout the nineteenth century. In rough chronological order these nineteenth-century models
                    were: the Sacrificer, who "clasped her hands in pious resignation, asked little of her
                    husband … and ‘hindered him not in his work’"; the
                    Assistant, who "became her husband's right arm, sharing many pastoral
                    responsibilities and functioning as an extension of his ministry"; and the Partner, who
                    "ministered with both her hands, developed a ministry alongside her husband, and often
                    served as the pastor's pastor" (p. 3). This thesis when fully fleshed out clearly
                    becomes an argument that as the century progressed evangelicalism often served as a liberating force
                    for women. Sweet arranges his interpretive models yet more specifically around the figures of three
                    women—Peggy Dow, wife of the famed itinerant Lorenzo Dow, and the first two wives of
                    Charles Finney, Lydia <pb n="77" id="VAA4025-080-1-083"/> and Elizabeth. The vivid contrasts between
                    Peggy Dow and Elizabeth Finney make clear an emerging feminist consciousness within evangelicalism.
                    Sweet has taken definite sides in the now-familiar debate about the role of religion in shaping (or
                    negating) early feminism in this country; his argument is detailed, wide-ranging, and persuasive. He
                    is also persuasive in his somewhat more speculative explanations for the decline of the
                    "Partner" image in the last third of the nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>A few nagging doubts persist about his study. An opening chapter, describing Protestant
                    ministers' wives from the sixteenth through the eighteenth century, is too brief and
                    hurried a survey. Typology is a dangerous device to be used in historical analysis. It may produce
                    an overly schematic interpretive structure that blurs the complexity of historical reality. Sweet
                    takes this possibility into account early on (pp. 4–5), but the difficulties implicit in
                    his analysis are never entirely overcome. The author has mined very effectively the magnificent
                    archival collection at Oberlin College for some of his most illuminating insights, but one sometimes
                    wonders how "representative" the women of Oberlin, a widely recognized center of
                    theological and social radicalism, were for many mainstream evangelicals during the antebellum era.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, however, this extremely well-written and thorough monograph remains a stimulating
                    analysis of women within evangelical Protestantism. For anyone interested in the history of women in
                    nineteenth-century America this is a key book to read and savor.</p>

            <p>In line with his premise that "the social history of a people in a given historical period
                    must begin with the testimony of the people themselves," Robert S. McElvaine has reproduced
                    in this volume 173 letters from the "forgotten men, women, and children of the
                    1930s" (p. [xi]). The sources from which this material is drawn are the files of the
                    President's Emergency Committee on Employment, the President's Organization for
                    Unemployment Relief, the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, and the Civil Works
                    Administration, plus the Eleanor Roosevelt, Robert F. Wagner, and <placeName>

                    fifteen thousand letters picked at random, selecting for publication those which were representative
                    of the "themes that emerged from the larger body of letters examined" (p. 8).</p>
            <p>The volume is organized around those themes. Part I consists of letters showing reactions to Herbert
                    Hoover and the economic breakdown. Part II aims to illustrate "Conditions of Life in the
                    Thirties" with subsections devoted to the economically distressed middle class, the rural
                    poor, blacks, the elderly, and two-to-thirteen-year-old youngsters. Part III is headed
                    "Reactions to the Depression" and includes a selection of letters revealing the
                    wide gamut of attitudes toward relief followed by examples of conservative and right-wing views,
                    desperation, cynicism, and rebelliousness. The concluding section presents views of FDR: on the one
                    side, the skeptical; on the other, the hero-worshipful. In his over-all
                    "Introduction" and in prefatory remarks to each set of letters, McElvaine does not
                    simply provide historical context but also underlines what he regards as the more important motifs
                    revealed.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, this reviewer must question what purpose this volume serves. No doubt many instructors
                    will find the paperbound edition a useful way of introducing their students to the flavor of the
                    period, and the publisher's promotional activities appear designed to appeal to 1930s
                    nostalgia buffs. But the extent to which this collection expands substantive understanding of the
                    time is doubtful. McElvaine argues that the letters provide a more direct and truer picture of the
                    feelings of the people than do interviews made long afterward (e.g., Stud Terkel's <hi rend="i">Hard Times</hi> [1970]); the reports of FERA and WPA investigators (e.g., Richard
                    Lowitt and Maurine Beasley, <hi rend="i">One Third of a Nation: Lorena Hickok's Reports on
                        the Great Depression</hi> [1981]); and even the interviews undertaken in the late 1930s by the
                    Federal Writers' Project (e.g., Tom E. Terrill and Jerrold Hirsch, <hi rend="i">Such As
                    Us</hi> [1978], and Ann Banks, <hi rend="i">First Person America</hi> [1980]). He admits, however,
                    that his selection constitutes no scientific sample. Letter writers were by definition people who
                    felt strongly. Although probably more Americans felt strongly in the 1930s than at any other time in
                    the country's history, the authors of these letters must still be regarded as in a sense
                    atypical. Most importantly, McElvaine fails to explain what principle he followed in allocating
                    space. In other words, does the number of letters exemplifying a given attitude—say, for
                    example, "desperate," "cynical," or
                    "rebellious"—accurately reflect the distribution of that outlook among
                    even the letters examined, much less the population at large?</p>

            <p>Charles F. Kettering, inventor and organizer of industrial research, had one of the most significant
                    and rewarding careers of any American engineer. As Stuart W. Leslie notes, Kettering
                    "bridged the single most important development in twentieth-century technology, the
                    transition from independent invention to scientifically oriented and corporately harnessed research
                    and development" (p. 340). More important than his inventions, many though they were, was
                    his "ability to sell research to an often skeptical business world" (p. 340).</p>
            <p>Born on a central Ohio farm in 1876, Kettering showed an early interest in mechanical and electrical
                    devices. Although he liked to pose as an untutored experimenter, he gained professional engineering
                    training at Ohio State University. A position at National Cash Register resulted in key improvements
                    in both electric and mechanical machines. He and a partner then struck out on their own, forming
                    DELCO (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Dayton</settlement>
                    </placeName> Engineering Laboratories) to develop an improved automotive ignition. The automotive
                    self-starter, Kettering's most famous invention, followed in 1911, and with it Kettering
                    revolutionized automotive electrical systems and greatly enhanced the appeal and utility of the car.
                    In 1916 DELCO was sold to William C. Durant, and by 1920 General Motors had acquired additional
                    Kettering properties, making him one of GM's largest shareholders, as well as the
                    engineer's services. Telling Alfred P. Sloan that he would work for GM if "I would
                    never be held accountable for the money I spent" (p. 96), Kettering joined the corporation
                    as a vice-president, board member, and general manager of a new division, the General Motors
                    Research Corporation. There he remained until his retirement in 1947.</p>
            <p>At GM Kettering pursued his interests virtually untrammeled, although, as he said, "the man
                    responsible for the laboratory must never lose sight of the fact that research work done with
                    corporate funds must justify itself economically" (p. 208). A wide-ranging curiosity
                    carried him in many directions. An interest in high-compression engines led to the development of
                    tetraethyl lead gasolines. The diesel engine was redesigned for railroads where it replaced steam
                    locomotives. Not all his efforts were successful. A tractor with "reins control,"
                    presumably to help the farmer adapt to internal combustion power, failed, as did a massive, costly
                    effort to perfect an air-cooled automotive engine.</p>
            <p>In this well-researched, prize-winning book, Leslie deals with Kettering fairly, pointing out his
                    failings and limitations as well <pb n="80" id="VAA4025-080-1-086"/> as his many triumphs. Kettering
                    sometimes underestimated the importance of academic expertise, never fully grasped the relationships
                    between theory and empirical research, and contributed little to General Motors in nontechnical
                    areas. His enduring monument was the belief that product improvement through applied science, under
                    corporate auspices, was indispensable.</p>

                    Paperbound, $4.00.) Walter B. Hendrickson's account of his growing up and young
                    adulthood in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> is both delightful and informative. He has a superb memory and a sharp eye for telling
                    detail, and he has a professional historian's instinct to set the specific event or process
                    in broader context. One of the most significant events in Hendrickson's life and in the
                    autobiography is the death of his father, which occurred before the time of pensions and social
                    security. Hendrickson, aged eleven, and his brother and mother fell quickly from comfort and
                    security to hard and anxious times. Hendrickson's contribution to the family's
                    income became essential, a contribution he made with a very wide variety of after-school and weekend
                    jobs. One of the most useful features of the account is Hendrickson's very detailed
                    description of his part-time jobs, including working in a grocery store, soda fountain, and shoe
                    store. He also provides detailed descriptions of such everyday life events of the early twentieth
                    century as the working of a coal-burning furnace, sledding, family vacations, classes at Shortridge
                    High School, and Boy Scout activities. And there are good accounts of student life at <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Purdue, and Indiana University, all of which Hendrickson attended. The book ends with
                    Hendrickson attaining his Ph.D. degree in history from <placeName>

            <p>In these, the second through fifth installments of his six-volume illustrated history of the Civil
                    War, editor William C. Davis adheres to the organization with which he started the series in <hi rend="i">Shadows of the Storm</hi> (1981). In each volume the photographs are arranged in
                    several topical sections, with each section bearing an introduction by a historian with an
                    appropriate area of expertise. Some of the sections cover relatively broad subjects, as with those
                    on "The South at War" (vol. III) and "The Forgotten War: The
                    West" (vol. V); others have a narrower focus, as in "The Second Bull Run"
                    (vol. II) and "The Siege of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charleston</settlement>
                    </placeName>" (vol. IV). Although readers with a strong interest in the Civil War will
                    certainly find some photographs they have seen before, the sheer number of illustrations included
                    (over 650 in each volume) means that even the most dedicated Civil War scholar should see much that
                    is new and of interest here. Those with a more general familiarity with the war will find that the
                    combination of striking photographs and interpretive essays provides a feel for its texture that

                    Billed as "the most comprehensive single-volume reference work on the War Between the
                    States ever published," this volume provides a daily chronology of the important events of
                    the Civil War. Following the chronological section, there are two shorter sections, one on weapons
                    and equipment used during the conflict and one which provides biographies of a number of people who
                    played significant roles in it. A detailed index provides quick access to information in all three
                    sections. In a brief introduction Henry Steele Commager presents his thoughts on possible reasons
                    for Americans' continuing interest in the Civil War. <hi rend="i">Gary L. Bailey, Indiana

               <hi rend="i">Editor's Note.</hi> This list of articles, pamphlets, and dissertations
                    published in 1981–1983 is intended as a bibliographic contribution to Indiana's
                    history. We hope to present such a list in each March issue of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of
                        History.</hi> We recognize that the list is neither complete nor systematic in coverage, and we
                    hope that readers will help us by sending items for possible inclusion. We are especially interested
                    in listing publications that make some contribution to understanding Indiana's past but are
                    not normally reviewed in the IMH. Generally, we will not list newspaper articles or accounts of
                    local historical society activities (which are reported in the <hi rend="i">Indiana History
                    Bulletin</hi>), but printed pamphlets as well as journal articles may be listed. All such items for
                    the March, 1985, issue must be received by December 1, 1984. Many people have contributed to the
                    present list, but major responsibility has rested with Robert G. Barrows of the Indiana Historical
                    Bureau and Gary L. Bailey and Amy C. Schutt of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History.</hi>
