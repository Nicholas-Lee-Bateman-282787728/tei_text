                <p>All poems occur as DIV0. Sonnets are attributed as "type=sonnets"; the rest are
                    "type=poem". All quotation marks, hyphens, dashes, apostrophes and colons have
                    been transcribed as entity references. All &lt;lg&gt; (line groups) are
                    attributed as cantos, stanzas, couplets, verse paragraphs, etc. All poems with
                    regularly indented lines use the attribute "rend" in the &lt;l&gt; tag, with the
                    value "indent1" for one tab stop, "indent2" for two tab stops, etc. All split
                    lines are attributed as "type=i" for the initial portion, and "type=f" for the
                    final portion.</p>
                <p>All apostrophes and single right quotation marks are encoded as &amp;rsquo;.</p>
                <p>Any hyphens occurring in line breaks have been removed; all hyphens are encoded
                    as &amp;hyphen; and em dashes as &amp;mdash;.</p>

                <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
                <p><hi>IT</hi> is pleasant to me to be able to assure my readers that the story I
                    have undertaken to versify is in no respect a fiction. I have added nothing to
                    the beautiful and striking simplicity of the events it details. I have respected
                    that mournful âromance of real lifeâ too much to spoil its lessons by any
                    poetical licence. Nothing is mine in this story but the language in which it is
                    told. The portrait of the Countess de la Garaye is copied from an authentic
                    picture preserved in one of the religious houses of Dinan, in Brittany, where
                    the Hospital of Incurables,<pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7089-009"/> founded by her and
                    her husband, still subsists. The ruined chÃ¢teau and its ivyâcovered gateway are
                    faithfully given, without embellishment or alteration, as they appeared when I
                    saw them in the year 1860. The chÃ¢teau is rapidly crumbling. The memory of the
                    De la Garayes is fresh in the memory of the people. They died within two years
                    of each other, and were buried among their poor in the district of Taden;
                    having, both during their lives and by will after death, contributed the greater
                    part of their fortune to the wisest and most carefully conducted charities.
                    Among the bequests left by the Count de la Garaye, was one especially
                    interesting to this country; for he left a large sum to the prisoners of Rennes
                    and Dinan, consisting principally of English officers and soldiers who where
                    suffering, in these crowded foreign jails, all the horrors<pb n="11" xml:id="VAB7089-010"/> which the philanthropic Howard endeavoured to reform
                    in his own land; and which at one time caused a sort of plague to break out in
                    Dinan. This humane bequest is the more remarkable, as the Count was, in spite of
                    the gentleness and generosity of his feelings towards imprisoned foes, patriotic
                    enough to insist on marching to oppose the landing of the English on the coast
                    of France in 1746, though he was then upwards of seventy years of age!</p>
                <p>He was of noble family, being the younger son of Guillaume Marot, Count de la
                    Garaye, Governor of the town and castle of Dinan;âthat strong fortress which
                    Anne of Brittany, in her threatened dominions, playfully termed the âkey of her
                    casket.â By the death of his elder brother, he became inheritor of the family
                    honours, and married Mademoiselle de la MotteâPiquet, niece<pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7089-011"/> of the Chevalier de la MotteâPiquet, who so greatly
                    distinguished himself in the American war. ClaudeâToussaint, Count de la Garaye,
                    was a man personally attractive in appearance and manner, and very dexterous in
                    fencing and feats of horsemanship. To the plaintive beauty of his wifeâs
                    portrait I have scarcely been able to render justice, even with the advantage of
                    its being engraved by Mr. Shaw.</p>
                <p>Those who may desire to read the narrative in plain prose, will find a notice of
                    the ChÃ¢teau de la Garaye in the âRecherches sur Dinan et ses Environs,â by Luigi
                    Odorici, Curator of the Museum of that town, and in the travelling guide lately
                    issued by M. Peignet, both works published on the spot. Allusion is also made to
                    the story, or rather to the beneficient works of charity performed by the De la
                    Garayes, in<pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7089-012"/> Madame de Genlisâ âAdÃ¨le et
                    ThÃ©odore;â but inasmuch as she has totally altered the real circumstances, and
                    attributed these holy deeds to the result of grief for the loss of a daughter,
                    even while admitting in a footânote that she is aware the De la Garayes never
                    had a child, and that all is her own invention, I do not think it necessary
                    further to allude to her version of the tale; more striking in its unadorned
                    beauty than all the art of the poet or romancist could make it.</p>
