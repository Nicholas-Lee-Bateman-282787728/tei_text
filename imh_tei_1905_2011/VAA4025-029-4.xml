            <p>The well known loyalty and fidelity of the red man to his friends has been the
                    subject of panegyric from the earliest days of the republic. The warning given
                    by Tecumseh to Captain Wilson and his friends at Prophet's Town of a
                    threatened assassination by the Prophet's queen and her
                    satellites—the story related by General William Henry Harrison of the
                    Iroquois chief who came to the camp of Anthony Wayne to avenge the death of
                    General Richard Butler, his friend, at the head of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Wabash</settlement>
                    </placeName>—the thousand and one instances where Indian scouts,
                    runners, interpreters and warriors have followed their white friends with
                    hound-like devotion through war, famine, flood and disaster—these
                    afford ample and positive proof of the red man's devotion in the face
                    of peril to his personal security. Nor must we neglect that beautiful story in
                        <hi rend="i">Wuu-Bun</hi> related by Mrs. Kinzie, in which she shows how
                    Captain William Wells, reared under the teachings and traditions of the ancient <placeName>

            <p>The red man of old was a man of the strictest integrity. To be a sneak-thief or a

                    detestation. The enumeration of instances might go on indefinitely. The first

                    leader, Tecumseh, and to him we are indebted for the best picture and
                    description of this celebrated warrior now extant. The early Shawnees are
                    represented by Colonel Hatch as being a noble, generous-hearted people, warmly
                    attached to their friends, and above all, honest. The second witness we summon
                    is General William Henry Harrison himself, who, in a remarkable tribute, to his
                    worthy antagonist along the <placeName>

                    other of the chiefs who attained to much distinction."<hi rend="sup">4</hi> In his youth he had been taught by his elder brother, Cheeseekau, to
                    practice those cardinal Indian virtues of bravery in battle and fortitude in
                    suffering, but above all to speak the truth and to entertain nothing but
                    contempt for everything mean and sordid. The third witness we summon is Colonel
                    James Smith of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

                    interesting description of Indian habits, customs and traditions and describes
                    their almost perfect military tactics and operations in the field. Among other
                    accounts is the story that the Indian hunters, trapping or hunting in the late
                    fall or early winter, suspended their hides and peltries on <hi rend="i">high

                    entertained no fear of bodily harm either to himself or family. The Indians
                    often stopped at his humble cabin for a drink of milk or some article of food
                    and were always welcome. His wife, Leah, however, becoming apprehensive shortly

                    </placeName> County, leaving a good patch of melons, and some chickens which he
                    was unable to transport. On his return in the spring he found the chickens
                    untouched and also found that the red man had respected his absence by keeping
                    away from his fields. Some of the great chiefs of the past, Cornplanter of the
                    Senecas, Cornstalk of the Shawnees, Little Turtle of the Miamis, Shaubena of the
                    Potawatomi, have each and all left an indelible imprint upon the pages of
                    history, which shall witness to their rectitude for all time to come.</p>
            <p>The red man was charitable, hospitable, and kindly to the poor. In most of the
                    Algonkian tribes of the Northwest there was a brotherhood or phratry of
                    individuals known as the Wolf clan. Among the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName> Potawatomi or Mascoutens, whose domain extended as far south as the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Wabash</settlement>
                    </placeName>, this was one of the principal divisions of the tribe. The members
                    of this gens conceived of a peculiar affinity with that animal who, as they
                    said, had a "hard time in getting a living—who had nothing
                    to eat in the morning, and who had to get up early to get food." There
                    was something about the hardships, the sufferings, the bitter cold and
                    starvation which this animal had to endure, that was so akin to the experiences
                    of the red man himself, that he termed the wolf a "brother".
                    Strange to say, that in the chants of this clan, for all the clans had religious
                    chants attuned to the beat of the drum, there is an expression of some of the
                    most reverent thankfulness and humble gratitude to the Great Spirit for the many
                    gifts he has bestowed to be found anywhere in the whole Indian missal. In this
                    Wolf chant are these sublime words: "What little I have received, I
                    feel, is great."</p>
            <p>The red man then in the face of the great forces of Nature, the winds, the
                    thunders and the rain—in spring, summer, autumn and
                    winter—humbly received, and with all due obedience was humbly
                    thankful for, the gifts of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Nor did he forget that inasmuch as he had received, so should he
                    give unto others. One of the beautiful customs of the Mandan chiefs, as observed
                    by Catlin, was to suspend a pot of flesh in their tents by day and by night,
                    that he who was miserable and hungry might enter and have food.
                    "Such", says Catlin, "is the unvarying custom amongst
                    the North American Indians, <pb n="272" id="VAA4025-029-4-004"/> and I very much
                    doubt, whether the civilized world have in their institutions any system which
                    can properly be called more humane or charitable. Every man, woman, or child in
                    the Indian communities is allowed to enter any one's lodge, and even
                    that of the chief of the nation, and eat when they are hungry, provided
                    misfortune or necessity has driven them to it."<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

                            the American Indians. From their infancy they are taught to be kind and
                            attentive to aged persons, and never to let them suffer for want of
                            necessaries or comforts. The parents spare no pains to impress upon the
                            minds of the children the conviction that they would draw down upon
                            themselves the anger of the Great Spirit, were they to neglect others

            <p>Hence it was that the older men, those ripest in experience, whether on the
                    battlefield or in the pursuits of peace, led the councils of the nation and
                    directed its policies. For a young man to insolently interrupt the discourse of
                    his superiors—to impertinently advance his own ideas in the face of
                    his elders—was regarded as a breach of decorum not to be tolerated.

                    "to instruct his elders."</p>

                    </placeName> and the Great Lakes, the custom prevailed of sometimes ducking the
                    most disobedient or temporarily depriving such an offender of food, but to
                    strike him with a whip or to inflict corporal punishment upon him in the sense
                    generally understood, was wholly unknown. This was to break the
                    child's spirit and to humble his pride—a thing scarcely to
                    be tolerated among a people SO proud. The instruction of youth began at an early
                    period and the efforts of the parents were seconded and assisted by the aid of
                    the whole community. The instruction of the young males in the art of war, in
                    hunting, trapping or fishing, was always intrusted to the most proficient in
                    field or forest. An interesting spectacle was witnessed by George Catlin among
                    the Mandans of the upper <placeName>

                    boys of the village between the ages of seven and fifteen years were led out
                    into the meadows by a corps of efficient and experienced leaders, and put
                    through various and complicated military evolutions and practices for a period
                    of two hours. Feints—advances—retreats—close up
                    attacks, and a multitude of maneuvers and operations were gone through, much to
                    the interest and admiration of the onlookers and the edification of the
                    participants. "Some five or six miles of ground are run over during
                    these evolutions", says Catlin, "giving suppleness to their
                    limbs and strength to their muscles, which aid and benefit them through

                    The tardy example of the colleges and universities who, after years of
                    procrastination and delay, have at last adopted the martial exercises to
                    encourage manliness, discipline, cleanliness and order, is but an
                    exemplification of the fact of how much we owe to the aborigines of America.</p>
            <p>We come now to an examination of the most admirable and the most praiseworthy of
                    the red man's many virtues. The Indian of Powhatan's, of
                    King Philip's day, was a man of majestic stature, both as to physique
                    and morals. The fermentation and distillation of liquors were wholly unknown to
                    him—the introduction of venereal disorders was the work of the white
                    man. That is the testimony of Heckewelder, Catlin, and others who profess to
                    know Indian character from the most intimate association. Even at this day after
                    having passed through so many unfortunate experiences, Indians are rarely of
                    ill-health, have square shoulders, sound teeth, and clear skins, and are
                    singularly exempt from many of those diseases brought about by a life of luxury
                    and pampered ease. The free, open, hard life of the river, the forest and the
                    plain gave birth to a creature who despised licentiousness and indulgence as
                    something inimical to his physical prowess and his fitness for the chase, The
                    undisputed fact remains that he was moral, clean, shunning all those corroding
                    influences which tended to impair his usefulness or enervate his arm. Of the
                    scores of young women taken captive from the settlements of <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Wabash</settlement>
                    </placeName> worshipped no idol nor did he fall prostrate. There was nothing of
                    the slave either in his demeanor or in his religion. He lifted up his hands in
                    adoration of the Great Manito, Ketci Munito, or the Great Spirit, Creator of the
                    heavens and the earth. It was his proud claim that he required no books to guide
                    him in his duty, but that the will of his Maker was engraved upon his heart. It
                    was the story of an old warrior of Heckewelder's day, that he climbed
                    to the top of a high mountain or pinnacle to thank the Great Spirit for all the
                    benefits he had received and to pray for a continuance of His
                    favor—that he was sure his prayers were <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Nor was the red man's conception of one universal, all-wise and
                    beneficent Being derived from the teachings of the early missionaries, French or
                    English. Heckewelder, who knew the Iroquois—Hatch, who knew the
                    Shawnees—Catlin, who painted and conversed with the chieftains of the
                    upper <placeName>

                    contact were free from the worship of fetishes and idols and that they were
                    supplicants before the Great Manito. Interesting above all perhaps is the
                    account of Colonel Hatch who was conversant with the practices and beliefs of
                    our own Shawnees of the <placeName>

                    great, creating, overruling God, to whom they applied the perfectly correct
                    term, the ‘Great Spirit’, whose power they beheld in the
                    storm, the lightning, the thunder and the whirlwind; whose goodness and benign
                    influence they saw and felt in the genial breeze, the early flower, the growing
                    grass of the spring, the fowl of the air, the fish of every water, the multitude
                    of animals given for their use and feeding on every plain, and every hill, and
                    in every solitude."<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this concept, that the Great Spirit created the heavens and the earth, the
                    fruits of the ground and the beasts of the field, and gave them all for the
                    common good and benefit of mankind, springs the Indian idea of hospitality and
                    open-handedness towards the poor man and the stranger alike. For how could one
                    who had shared in these universal benefactions refuse unto others that which he
                    himself had so freely received. "With them", says Heckewelder,
                    "it (hospitality) is not a virture, but a strict duty."<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

            <p>Nor may anything better illustrate the red man's thankfulness for the
                    many gifts of the Great Spirit than the story we are about to relate. There is,
                    in the northeastern part of Ben-ton County, Indiana, a high point of ground
                    commonly known as Mount Gilboa. This is at the eastern extremity of a long, low

                    which up to the year 1790 grazed upon the meadows and the grasslands of our
                    middle western world. Late in the <list type="footnotes">

                    east, to escape the prairie fires and to seek shelter from the storms of winter
                    in the timberlands along the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Wabash</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Tippecanoe</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Early in the following spring and when the shoots of the blue-stem
                    first appeared, they moved out into the prairies again, the great bulls at the
                    head of the line. The routes of these migrations from the
                    "heights" of Mount Gilboa were marked by two
                    trails—one extending to the north and east and towards the mouth of
                        <geogName>Eel River</geogName>, and one to the south and east and towards
                    the present city of Delphi.</p>

                    them the buffalo was "the-man-who-runs-over-the-plains", the
                    living embodiment of the gifts and the munificence of the Great Manito, and the
                    creature upon which they and their women and children were largely dependent for
                    their food and clothing. What then were the paeans of joy when, after the long
                    winter famine, the gaunt and emaciated savage beheld for the first time the
                    mantle of green covering the hillsides and the slopes—when he saw the
                    grass and the flowers, and straining his eyes to the far-away horizon, he noted
                    the advent of the coming herds! And then that glorious morning when the first
                    forms of the approaching bison actually appeared silhouetted against the distant
                    sky line—when the whistles of reed and drums of skin were brought
                    forth, and the people joined in joyful acclaim of dance and song! Want and
                    hunger were at an end—the prayers of the faithful at last answered.
                    "Thank the Great Spirit", resounds the Buffalo chant,
                    "because you have learned about the buffalo. Thank Him for pitying us!

            <p>In his oration on those Athenians who died in the first year of the Peloponnesian
                    War, Pericles, according to Thucydides, led the thoughts of his audience from
                    the sepulchre where lay the remains of the dead to the memory of them in the
                    minds of men all over the world. This memory, he said, rather than the place of
                    their burial, was their true sepulchre: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Of no man can it more truthfully be said than of Abraham Lincoln that not only in
                    his own land, but in foreign lands, there dwells an unwritten memorial, graven
                    in the hearts of men. Many are the monuments and statues which have commemorated

            <p>He is known to those to whom the written word is a sealed book and to those who

                    from slavery, and their children, but the poor and oppressed of all lands carry
                    his homely image in their hearts as a symbol of sympathy and encouragement. The

                    though he was and utterly alien to all pomp and circumstance. Statesmen call
                    upon him as the sanction of their purposes and the pattern of their careers. The
                    learned, also, look on him with unwonted reverence. The most authoritative
                    historian of the Civil War period writes: "His truthfulness, honesty
                    and self-abnegation make better men of the students of his words and deeds and
                    we all experience a moral uplifting in the contemplation of his

                    the same mysterious workings of the human mind, which in olden times created the
                    dim outlines of heroes and demigods, have made him a portent and an omen for the
                    modern world. He has come to be the incarnation of a great human experience, the
                    manifestation of a supreme power which exalts the lowly and strikes down the
                    proud, the protagonist of the common man rising to his height as ruler and
                    master of the world. As the Greek Prometheus was said to have brought down for
                    the use of men fire from heaven, so this Prometheus of the valley of the <placeName>

            <p>The Lincoln legend, as it "dwells in the hearts of men" is

                    was the utmost contrast to both. Throughout his life he devoted himself
                    ceaselessly to the pursuit of knowledge, justice, and the redress of wrong. His
                    rugged honesty, his limitless sympathy and his prophetic insight finally won
                    national recognition and election to the presidency. He conducted the great
                    Civil War to redress the wrong of negro slavery and, just as the war was won, he
                    died a martyr in the cause of the freedom of the oppressed. Poor heredity,
                    adverse environment in his youth, and the iniquitous politics he confronted in
                    his maturity were the foils against which his unique greatness and goodness
                    shone. His homely face and gaunt figure were the very symbols of the eternal
                    struggle of the lowly for existence and for justice.</p>
            <p>The student of history is familiar with the process by which the real Lincoln and
                    the circumstances of his life developed into this legend. Memory is an
                    automatically selective process; some things stay in our minds, and some things
                    disappear from them. For the most part it is the salient, striking outlines
                    which remain. These become, by elimination and by repetition, exaggerated in
                    their proportions. On the earth's surface, as valleys and hills and
                    mountains are formed, the process of erosion leaves rock crags and hilltops and
                    mountains as outstanding features of the landscape. So in the speech and the
                    writing of generation after generation, great men are left alone as the
                    landmarks of history. They are stripped of their actual surroundings and of
                    their minor qualities. They become the personification of the great movements of
                    their time, mountain peaks with bold outlines against an empty sky.</p>
            <p>Generally speaking, love of truth is an acquired trait. Most young children do
                    not show any signs of it. Many never develop that eagerness to know the truth,
                    that supreme devotion to the effort to see things as they really are which is
                    the foundation of science and of history. Most men want to hear and to read that
                    which pleases them: they like to tell that which interests their audiences. An
                    early church father, glorifying his faith, exclaimed of a reported miracle:
                    "Other men may not believe it, because it is improbable; I believe it
                    because it is improbable." So the legend, starting about one man among
                    many, and about one circumstance out of thousands, takes shape according to the
                    inclination of those who cherish it.</p>
            <p>Abraham Lincoln, and the circumstances of his life, furnished <pb n="280" id="VAA4025-029-4-012"/> material which readily lends itself to the molding
                    influence of hero worship. The widest appeal of the Lincoln legend lies in the
                    contrast between the lowliness of his origin and the power and triumph to which
                    he attained, Naturally, his origin has become described as lowlier and lowlier
                    until, inevitably, he is pictured as growing up in the depths of poverty in the
                    midst of ignorant and shiftless people. His unaccountable greatness, on the
                    other hand, has been exalted until he could scarce recognize himself in the
                    picture legend has made of him. His first important biographer began the
                        process.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> He admired, he almost worshipped Lincoln. He
                    tried it seems, to tell the truth about him, but the mythological tendency was
                    strong within him and he cast his material in a mold which magnified the genius
                    of the mature Lincoln at the expense of his family and of his associates, until
                    the only explanation of his greatness the reader could make was that a
                    mysterious, divine inspiration possessed him.</p>
            <p>The character and career of Abraham Lincoln as seen in the light of sixty and
                    more years of historical study are quite different from the picture thus drawn.
                    His ancestry on his father's side has been traced back through seven
                    generations of sturdy, forward-looking American Lincolns, every one occupying a
                    respectable position in his community. The most distinctive feature of the
                    family was that it kept moving with the frontier—it was one of the
                    families which made the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> a continental power by the development of new lands. His
                    mother's ancestry was more uneven, but she was of good pioneer stock.
                    Possibly she may have been of illegitimate birth, but her own character and
                    conduct were above reproach. Scandal mongers and ransackers of political garbage
                    have been busy, but they have found only the invention of their own malignant
                    imaginations. Nancy Hanks Lincoln will stand forever as the finest type of
                    motherhood in our pioneer days. The lonely grave on the hilltop beneath the oaks
                    where her remains lie side by side with those of other women who succumbed to
                    the sickness which ravaged this wilderness settlement, is a memorial of a life
                    as pure and as beneficent as that of any mother to whom a great man owed his
                    origin.</p>
            <p>The boy, Lincoln, grew up in a family which was never in actual want and which
                    always had property. He suffered the usual privations of pioneer life, remote
                    from the wealth and <list type="footnotes">

                    developed lands. But his family and his neighbors were working upward toward
                    those advantages. The atmosphere was that of progress. Within the circle of
                    Lincoln's acquaintance were leaders in the march of the democracy in
                    which America glories. The popular <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> legend, which has been reiterated by prominent historians, with its
                    emphasis upon the unfavorable environment of his early years, is a distortion of
                    his life. It is an injustice as well to a whole group of people to whom the
                    world owes gratitude for their contribution to the development of
                    Lincoln's character and talents.</p>
            <p>Lincoln himself knew the calibre of his early associates. In the very first days
                    of the War, in calling for four additional regiments, he wrote
                    "Probably they should come from the triangular region between the <placeName>

                    it did not hold him back. It would not be the truth, but it would be nearer the
                    truth to say that Abraham Lincoln became the man he was because of his dwelling
                    here, than it would be to say that he achieved greatness in spite of the
                    conditions under which he lived here. He not only shared the life of his
                    neighbors, but their qualities as well. He was different from them only in his
                    superiority of intellectual and spiritual power.</p>

                    nineteenth century involved dangers and hardships. A well known genealogical

                    an undesirable residence. All that can be said in its favor was that it was the

                    </placeName> Valley could possibly erect. There were trials and hardships
                    aplenty for the Lincoln family, as well as for its neighbors, but the
                    necessities of life were present and the environment was a spur to ambition, and
                    an incentive to progress.</p>
            <p>It is doubtful whether the multiplying of advantages, which more recent years
                    have given us, compensate for the dulling of the eagerness to learn and ambition
                    to lead others forward which developed in the youthful Lincoln, who had only
                    about a year's formal schooling and who walked miles to get books. It
                    almost seems that by the law of diminishing returns improvement of educational
                    facilities and increase in the ease and comfort of life deaden the eagerness for
                    knowledge and the desire for mastery which are the only basis of education. In
                    the case of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>, the balance between opportunity and desire was such that it gave
                    the greatest possible impetus to the development of his character and ability.</p>
            <p>In tracing the outlines of Lincoln's career, we pass to
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName>. Here the full
                    grown man earned his living by the practice of law and found his chief interest
                    in politics. As a lawyer, he was not a constant and profound student. He worked
                    not so much on the plane of the principles of the prevailing legal system, nor
                    of precedent, as on the particular facts in the case in which he engaged. He
                    became one of the leading lawyers of central <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. His reputation as a lawyer, however, was almost confined to this
                    region. In an important case conducted by counsel of national reputation, he was
                    slighted to the point of insult. As a politician, he was a leading member of the
                    Whig organization in the capital of his state. His political work in his
                    precinct and ward and state was rewarded by one term in Congress. He sought
                    federal appointments, but not receiving the ones he wanted he declined others.</p>
            <p>Often disappointed with himself and his career, sometimes to the point of black
                    melancholy, he was nevertheless accounted one of the most successful, one of the
                    leading citizens of his section. He accumulated property and was able to send
                    his oldest son to <placeName>

                    of the country as it now is.</p>
            <p>When the extension of slavery became an acute question, it found
                    Lincoln's party disorganized, divided and almost moribund. A new
                    party, opposed to the admission of slavery into new territories, but not
                    committed to its abolition in the states where it was already established, was
                    talked of, and its organization begun. Far from being its leader, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> at first held back. It was only when violent opposition to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>-<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName> Act had already assumed proportions which definitely assured the
                    new Republican party the support of most of the northern Whigs and many of the
                    Democrats, that he became one of its sponsors. Far from seeing the end from the
                    beginning, he slowly worked his way to the center of the problem. He was as far
                    as he could possibly be from the little group of crusaders whose lives were
                    spent in agitation against slavery as wrong in principle and inhuman in
                    practice. Only later, under the pressure of events and the responsibilities of
                    government did he come to the program of abolition.</p>
            <p>It was his intensive training in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> politics, as well as his reasoned convictions, which between 1854
                    and 1860 put him into the place of the logical leader of the Republican party.
                    His marvelous ability to gauge public sentiment, his mastery of the essentials
                    of political organization, the sureness of his judgment, made him the one man
                    capable of crystallizing into action the confused opinions and fictions of the
                    time. The fact that he did this was not so apparent at the time, even to his
                    associates and to his most ardent supporters, as it is to us today. Had he been
                    a crusader against slavery, he could never have been nominated for the
                    presidency; had he been nominated, he would have been defeated; had he become
                    president, the attempt to restore the southern states to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Union</settlement>
                    </placeName> would have been foredoomed to failure from the first. The
                    explanation of his success, the most striking element of his genius, was the
                    accuracy of his knowledge of public opinion. His force of character, his
                    intellectual grasp of problems, his power of perfect expression made him a
                    leader; his sure judgment of his associates and of people generally made him a
                    successful leader.</p>
            <p>In his debates with Stephen A. Douglas, he made the most of the break between
                    Douglas and the administration. He <pb n="284" id="VAA4025-029-4-016"/> tried to
                    fasten on his opponent the stigma of opening the northern territories to slavery
                    while at the same time he took advantage of the opposition of the proslavery
                    Democrats to Douglas on account of his denunciation of the effort to force
                    slavery upon <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>. Lincoln himself at times during the debates was on the defensive
                    because in his "House Divided" speech at the opening of the
                    campaign he had gone beyond public opinion in hinting at the ultimate extinction
                    of slavery. He was greatly concerned to show that he was not an anti-slavery
                    radical; that he tried only to prove that there was a legitimate place under the
                    constitution for the half-way measure of keeping slavery out of the territories.
                    Only incidentally, almost casually, did he allude to the ideal of an
                    organization of society in which every man should enjoy the results of his own
                    labor.</p>
            <p>In spite of the opposition of the national administration, Douglas won the
                    election, but his own party made his position of 1858 untenable in 1860.
                    Lincoln's position, difficult as it was to maintain in 1858, was
                    chosen not only as his solution of the crisis precipitated by the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>-<placeName>

                        <region type="county">Scott</region>
                    </placeName> decision, but as the strategic rallying point of public opinion in
                    the north. His strength lay not less in his judge. ment of the latter than of
                    the former.</p>
            <p>After his nomination and election as President came the crisis of secession.
                    Again he proved his marvellous command of the currents of popular opinion in
                    standing firm against any compromise which would extend slavery and in holding
                    the border states, save <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, in support of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Union</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Then and later, when the magnitude of the Civil War became
                    apparent, he spoke of slavery in the southern states in language strangely
                    reminiscent of Douglas in 1858. He would not attack slavery there if such an
                    attack would make it more difficult to restore the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Union</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but save the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Union</settlement>
                    </placeName> he would, with or without slavery. Douglas, however, in 1858 would
                    have preserved the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Union</settlement>
                    </placeName> by yielding ground, not beyond a certain limit it is true, to a
                    minority and to a disruptive force. Lincoln in 1861 and 1862 would save the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Union</settlement>
                    </placeName> as a national government expressive of the will of the whole
                    people.</p>
            <p>He finally took action against slavery in the seceded states. His action then was
                    based, not so much on principle, as on his judgement of public opinion. It was
                    not an end in itself, but <pb n="285" id="VAA4025-029-4-017"/> only the means to
                    the larger end of national unity under the rule of the majority. The
                    Emancipation Proclamation, by its very terms, applied only to those parts of the
                    country still in the possession of the Confederates; generally speaking, only to
                    those regions where it could not at the time be enforced. Public sentiment then
                    supported it; its influence was as timely as it was powerful, not only in this
                    country, but also in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Lincoln believed that secession and the Civil War involved more than slavery;
                    that they involved the existence, even the possibility, of democracy. If the
                    majority of the people could not enforce its law upon a minority, however
                    powerful, "government of the people, by the people, for the
                    people" could not endure. It was as the prophet and the statesman of
                    democratic nationalism, rather than as an emancipator or as an inspired hero of
                    social justice, that he became the "first American."</p>
            <p>Both Lincoln's political principles and his unequaled ability to apply
                    them to each crisis in the measure that public opinion could be brought to their
                    support were the result of his experiences and his associations in Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. His democratic nationalism he absorbed here in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer</region>
                    </placeName> County and over in Sangamon County. His sensitive accuracy in
                    gauging public opinion came from his intimate contact with the boys and the men
                    of his neighborhood. He was not the abstract genius that legend has made him,
                    aloof from the crowd and distinguished from it by an unique divine endowment. He
                    was in every sense one of the people, one of the people of the pioneer west of
                    the first half of the nineteenth century. Every quality he had he shared with
                    friends and models of his boyhood. His environment emphasized human equality,
                    ambition, nationalism, shrewdness and native wit.</p>
            <p>Legend says, and not a few biographers have patterned their work upon it: See
                    from what unfavorable surroundings the great man arose; see how inexplicably
                    great he was in the contrast he presents to his family and his environment! We
                    can say with much more truthfulness: See what qualities the pioneers of the
                    Middle West possessed, see the product of American ancestors and the Old
                    Northwest! If we lessen the contrast which legend draws between an adverse
                    environment and a supreme achievement, we do not lessen the greatness of <pb n="286" id="VAA4025-029-4-018"/> Abraham Lincoln. If we draw the picture of
                    a man who developed gradually under the influence of an invigorating environment
                    and a democratic frontier, a man who joined in movements rather than creating
                    them, we disclose his power of seeing far more clearly than his neighbors into
                    the heart and the meaning of those movements. He towered above his fellows, but
                    he never ceased to be one of them.</p>
            <p>The people who lived here in his boyhood, our own forefathers, cannot be
                    represented as the uncouth, unpromising figures of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> legend, standing for the depths from which he rose. They were the
                    sturdy, capable builders of American democracy. They leveled the wilderness,
                    they tilled the land, they mastered the mighty rivers,<hi rend="sup">8</hi> they

            <p>Success in any enterprise depends largely upon a proper beginning, and a proper
                    beginning is the result of wisdom and forethought. It was the forethought, the
                    courage, the determination, the energy and the sacrifices of the pioneers that
                    laid the foundation for the wonderful progress made by <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Wabash</settlement>
                    </placeName> county meant leaving relatives and friends and traveling with an ox
                    team through dense forests to the spot selected for a new home. It meant cutting
                    roads as the colonists went along; sleeping (until a cabin was ready) on beds
                    made on forked sticks driven into the ground, with stakes at the corners around
                    which a blanket was fastened to keep away mosquitoes; cutting timber, preparing
                    the logs and building a cabin with a stick and clay chimney, dirt floor, greased
                    paper for window panes and blankets hung over the doorway; it meant clearing the
                    land, burning the logs and pulling stumps before the crops on which the settlers
                    and their live stock must live could be planted. It often meant hunger for both
                    the pioneers and their stock and sometimes starvation for the latter. It meant
                    homes on which the sun never shown except at midday with the nearest neighbors
                    miles away and the trail between cabins marked by blazed trees; swamps with
                    malaria and ague and no physician within reach; spinning and weaving of the
                    cloth from which clothing and bedding were made; threshing grain with a flail;
                    carrying corn and wheat on horseback to the nearest grist mill, sometimes ten,
                    fifteen or even forty miles away; log school houses with backless seats;
                    teachers whose fitness for teaching was too often determined by their
                    proficiency in the use of the rod; weeks between letters from the folks back
                    home, and the howl of wolves from sunset until dawn.</p>
            <p>Long since the swamps and frog ponds have been eliminated by networks of ditches;
                    the plank and corduroy roads are buried far beneath paved highways; the tallow
                    candles have melted away in the glare of electric lights; the flail and
                    treadmill have vanished to the hum of the threshing machine; the music of the

                    compared with the noiseless turning of wheels and the purr of motors; the canal

                    obstacles that beset them on all sides would be appalling to us. We owe a debt
                    of gratitude to them that can best be paid by perpetuating in the minds of the
                    people of the County of their choice the memory of their courage, perseverance
                    and sacrifices.</p>
            <p>With this thought in view a number of the residents of the county, forty-two
                    years after the coming of the first settler, met at the office of Sivey
                    &amp; Mackey on August 30, 1870, to discuss the holding of an annual
                    get-together of the pioneers. A resolution defining and classifying old settlers
                    was adopted. <list type="footnotes">

                            <p>Since the Pioneer Society was not organized until 1870, a great many
                                of the early settlers had died, while some had left the County. The
                                above names constitute but a partial list of the settlers in the
                                County at the time of organization. The records of the first meeting
                                of the County Commissioners which was held in June, 1836, contain
                                the names of the three commissioners, the Brand and petit jurors who
                                were appointed at the meeting, and the names of those affixed to
                                road, grocery, tavern and ferry petitions for licenses. These
                                citizens were very probably all voters and freeholders. The names

                    1, 1836, were to make up the first class and to be designated by red badges;
                    those who came between January 1,1836, and January 1,1841, were placed in a
                    second class and assigned white badges; all who came between January 1,1841, and
                    January 1, 1846, were to make up the third class and were to wear blue badges. A
                    second meeting was held at the old court house on September 10, 1870, at which
                    time committees were appointed and arrangements made for a "Grand
                    Basket Picnic" to be held at the Fair Grounds on September 29. Posters
                    advertising the meting were scattered over the County. All persons attending,
                    "both old settlers and citizens," were asked to bring baskets
                    of "provisions for an old fashioned picnic dinner". People
                    having relics such as books, manuscripts or other old articles were urged to
                    bring them to the meeting for exhibition. The various musical organizations of
                    the city were invited and each township was asked to come <hi rend="i">en
                    masse</hi> under the direction of a township leader.</p>
            <p>The meeting was scheduled to last all day with an intermission for dinner. The
                    program consisted of "speeches (no speech to be longer than ten minutes
                    without consent of the meeting), addresses, reminiscences of early settlements,
                    exhibition of relics", etc., interspersed with music, The committee on
                    arrangements was composed of the following from the townships mentioned: Allen
                    W. Smith, J. D. Conner, Stearns Fisher, B. F. Williams, J. C. Sivey and Elijah

                    </placeName>; William Hale and Mahlon Pearson of Liberty; B. W. Lowery and John
                    Watkins of LaGro; Jacob Rantz and L. C. Groninger of Pleasant; and Nathan
                    Weesner and Tobias Miller of Waltz.</p>
            <p>As had been planned, a "procession" which formed at the public
                    square, was led by William T. Ross, marshall and chairman, to the Fair Grounds
                    marching in the following order: Reds (first class), Whites (second class),
                    Blues (third class), other Citizens. Some were on foot and some in wagons and
                    carriages, while those on horseback were at the rear. About two hundred people
                    were included in that first parade.</p>
            <p>A roll call of the first jurors of the County was answered by B. W. Lowery and
                    Mahlon Pearson. Each gave some of his experiences in the first court held in the
                    county, which was back in August, 1836. Sterns Fisher, the only survivor of the
                    first commissioner's court informed his hearers that there <pb n="290" id="VAA4025-029-4-022"/> were but twelve families in the entire
                    county at the time of his arrival. Other talks were given by George Abbot,
                    Daniel Sayre, Henry Strickler, Allen W. Smith, Robert Miller and Dr. James Ford.
                    There is no doubt, whatever, that much county history was lost because no record
                    was kept of that meeting.</p>
            <p>A second meeting was held at the same place in 1871. The committee arranged for
                    another parade but visitors coming in wagons drove directly to the Fair Grounds.
                    That being the usual mode of transportation for those coming from a distance,
                    there were few left to form a "procession". At that meeting,
                    there were three hundred who wore the red, white and blue badges. In reporting
                    this meeting the <hi rend="i">

                    organization to record their memorials, preserve their relics and add more
                    system to their jubilees.</p>
            <p>The tradition is that meetings were held each year, but the next meeting for
                    which any record has been found was that of 1879. On September 5 of that year,
                    at the call of a few citizens, a meeting was held at the court house at
                    "one and a half o'clock P.M." for the purpose of
                    forming an organization. Benjamin McClure was appointed temporary chairman and

                    early settlements of the county". The fifth article confined membership
                    in the society to "all citizens over fifty years of age who had resided

                    and an executive committee of nine members. The constitution was amended later,

                    September 11 [1879] "for the purpose of receiving signatures of old
                    settlers who wished to become members". A newspaper of Sept. 3, 1880,
                    records that, "An old settlers meeting at one P.M. was a feature of the
                    county fair". It was decided to hold an Old Settler's Picnic
                    on Thursday, Oct. 31. For some reason the meeting was postponed until the first
                    Thursday of the following June, when, "for lack of proper
                    notice" it was again postponed until June 24. On that day, eleven years
                    after the first meeting and two years after the organization of the Pioneer
                    Society, the annual reunions were really begun<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

                            so he may be said to have remained president of the Society till the
                            organization of the new Old Settlers' Association in 1924.
                            Secretaries of the Society were: B. E. Davis, Elijah Hackleman, B. F.

                            these, Elijah Hackleman, served for a long period, keeping the records
                            faithfully from 1887 to his death in 1901. Treasurers of the Society

                    Art Loan Exhibition that was being held by them in the city. They were
                    entertained at the exhibition in the morning and at the city hall in the
                    afternoon. They probably re-lived old times more thoroughly at that meeting than
                    at any other ever held by the Society. The fireplace of antique construction,
                    the primitive cooking utensils, the corn-pone and the dodger on the hearth, the
                    candles and lard lamps, the well-sweep, the cradle in which many a pioneer
                    infant had been lulled to sleep, the indispensible catnip hanging near, old
                    ladies spinning flax, the dummy, patiently displaying female finery of former
                    days, and the rude farming implements on exhibition were most conducive to the
                    reminiscent mood in which the visitors found themselves when they assembled at
                    the new city hall where they were addressed by Judge Horace P. Biddle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>A feature of the morning program was the appearance on the stage of George Myers
                    with the fiddle which he had used when playing for the celebration on July 4,
                    1837. This was when the first boat ploughed its way into the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Wabash</settlement>
                    </placeName> through the "raging billows" of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Wabash</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Erie Canal. Mr. Myers with his fiddle appeared on the programs
                    at other meetings.</p>
            <p>The meeting of 1888 was held in the new Fair Grounds where the Pioneers had the
                    use of the amphitheater and the judges' stand. Next year the meeting
                    went back to the old Fair Grounds which had become a city park. In 1896
                    "Because of the political unrest that prevailed throughout the country
                    it was next to impossible to collect together the old settlers in such numbers
                    as to be enjoyable and profitable in the sense contemplated by the
                    society", so no reunion was held that year. Meetings occurred each year
                    after that until 1917. The officers and directors met in the summer of that year
                    and appointed committees to raise funds with which to meet the expenses of the
                    coming reunion, but on August 31, it was agreed that since the day for the
                    meeting was the same as that set for the "departure of the first boys
                    for the World War training camps it would be impracticable to hold it on that
                    day." It was accordingly postponed until the regular day in 1918. When
                    that time came no meeting was held "because of the conditions brought
                    about by the war". And so ended the original <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Wabash</settlement>
                    </placeName> County Pioneer Society. In 1924 an association <pb n="293" id="VAA4025-029-4-025"/> was formed, since known as the Old
                    Settlers' Association of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Wabash</settlement>
                    </placeName> County.</p>
            <p>Meetings of the old Pioneer Society were held under the trees with a temporary
                    platform for the speakers. Men would come to the grove before the day of the
                    meeting and arrange seats for the comfort of the visitors. After the band-stand
                    was built, the programs were given from that place. In 1911 for the first time
                    in the history of the organization, the Pioneers met under cover, a big
                    Chautauqua tent having been rented for that purpose. Once again the tent was
                    used, then the pavillion in the city park was built, after which time the
                    Pioneers and later the "Old Settlers" have been able to laugh
                    at the weather and enjoy their sessions in comfort.</p>
            <p>A few relics appeared at the first meeting, then the number was increased as
                    interest in the annual reunions developed. In 1888 Dr. Ford suggested that the
                    society ask the county for a room, preferably in the court house, in which to
                    keep the collection. However, nothing seems to have been done towards securing a
                    safe place in which to store the treasurers of the Society until twenty years
                    later when plans were begun for the erection of a log cabin of the pioneer type
                    in which to keep the accumulated relics near the place of the meeting.</p>
            <p>Through the untiring efforts of Clarke Weesner, president of the Society, the
                    cabin became a reality in 1909. It was dedicated on the one hundredth
                    anniversary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln and is known as the
                    "Lincoln Cabin". That year was also the seventy-fifth
                    anniversary of the founding of the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Wabash</settlement>
                    </placeName> and both events were fittingly commemorated with a two-day
                    celebration. The number of visitors on the first day was estimated at five
                    thousand, the "Cabin" with its contents being the center of
                    attraction.</p>
            <p>An opportunity was always given to the older people to participate in the
                    programs. They told of their early experiences contrasting pioneer days with
                    modern days, and all agreed, with one exception, that the new ways were a
                    decided improvement over the old. One man, the only pessimist contributing to
                    the records of the Society, expressed the opinion that the human race in this
                    section of the country was degenerating; that the inventions and discoveries of
                    the new age were of very little benefit to humanity; that children were
                    compelled to attend school to the detriment of their physical development, and
                    that he "feared for the final outcome".</p>
            <pb n="294" id="VAA4025-029-4-026"/>
            <p>Many prominent men appeared upon the programs as the years passed, among them
                    being: Demarcus Brown, State Librarian, Gov. James A. Mount, Judge Lemuel Royce
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Warsaw</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Judge Horace P. Biddle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Lou Beauchamp, the humorist, and Thomas St. John of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName>. At one meeting, immediately after Judge Royce began his address,
                    "a thunder storm came up and suddenly the audience adjourned, sans
                    ceremony". The Judge was given another opportunity and finished his
                    speech a year later.</p>
            <p>Until 1894, it seems, the men were the only old settlers who ever made any
                    remarks regarded as worthy of being recorded. Then the pioneer women were asked
                    to relate some of their experiences, and since that time they have asserted
                    their right to be heard as well as to be seen. Twice, since 1894, the Board of
                    Directors has been composed entirely of women, and each meeting conducted solely
                    by the ladies was reported as having been the most successful ever held to the
                    time.</p>
            <p>Every musical organization in the county—each band, orchestra and
                    quartette—entertained the crowds with music at one time or another.
                    Occasionally songs by a volunteer chorus added much to the program. At the
                    meeting in 1888, a choir, dressed in costumes of half a century earlier, sang
                    old time songs. Again the old fiddle in the hands of Sanford Honeywell, recalled
                    old times with such tunes as the "Arkansaw Traveler" and
                    "Money Musk".</p>
            <p>The year 1898 saw a departure from the programs of former days, with the
                    inauguration of games, athletic and other contests and prizes at the morning
                    session. Bicycle races were the order on the day of the first contests. In one
                    race the contestants rode old style high bicycles wearing "stiff hats,
                    long frock coats, knee breeches and stockings." Another race was the
                    "Married Man's Handicap" in which each man was
                    given ten yards for each child he might have, while bachelors of thirty years
                    and over were required to "start from scratch." This was a
                    source of much merriment. The last bicycle race, for "scorchers with
                    monkey stoop", was followed by a ten minute grand parade of all
                    cyclists in costume.</p>
            <p>Prizes were given for horse back riding, jumping, and shot-put, as well as to the
                    oldest married couple and the couple having lived longest in the county. One
                    year a prize of five dollars was offered to the mother having reared the largest
                    family. The five dollars had to be divided among Mrs. Philip Hipskind, <pb n="295" id="VAA4025-029-4-027"/> Mrs. John Schlemmer, Mrs. Christian Clupper
                    and Mrs. Richard Elward, each having twelve living children. The entrance into
                    the contests of 1901 of the horseless carriage indicated that the old pioneer
                    order of things was indeed but a memory. Two prizes were given for the
                    automobile events, one for speed and one for management.</p>
            <p>One year the prizes were given by the merchants of the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Wabash</settlement>
                    </placeName> and included the following articles: a gold watch and chain, a
                    banquet lamp, a bicycle lamp, eleven boxes of cigars, a razor, a campaign hat, a
                    bottle of dandruff cure, an umbrella, a pipe, a package of fancy writing paper,
                    a pair of slippers, a pipe and case, a fine shirt, a pocket knife, a pair of
                    leggings, a pocket-book, a pair of gold cuff buttons, a Windsor necktie, a ball,
                    $1.50 in livery hire, open cab and driver for two hours, seven pounds
                    of "wiener wursts" and a box of toilet soap.</p>
            <p>Often a parade was a big feature of the day, when all sorts of ancient
                    conveyances were used. Also the young pioneer family on horseback appeared, the
                    husband on the old family horse with his good wife seated behind, her arm
                    encircling his portly form, each dressed in costumes of bygone days. One old man
                    came in a military suit that he had worn sixty years before. He wore a cockade
                    hat, white trousers, blue cloth coat with shining brass buttons and carried an
                    old flintlock gun which made him the observed of all observers. Another old man
                    of eighty years walked ten miles to the meeting carrying a bundle of old books.</p>
            <p>The expenses of the reunions were met by voluntary contributions. The speakers
                    must be paid and sometimes as much as $30 was paid to one musical
                    organization besides the cost of entertainment. One year the erection of a stand
                    alone cost $115. Water must be hauled to the fair grounds and tin
                    cups rented, organs rented and draymen paid for taking them to and from the
                    grounds. There was always the expense of printing notices and hand bills. Some
                    years there would not be sufficient funds in the treasury to meet all expenses
                    and at other times there would be a neat little sum left.</p>
            <p>In 1888 the practice of reading the names of the members who had passed away
                    since the preceding meeting was inaugurated. In looking over the lists one finds
                    that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Wabash</settlement>
                    </placeName> county is a land of long-lived people. The records show two <hi rend="i">who passed the century mark, one within a few days of one</hi>
                    <pb n="296" id="VAA4025-029-4-028"/> hundred years, three more who were
                    ninety-nine, fifty-six between ninety and one hundred and three hundred
                    seventy-five who were between eighty and ninety—certainly an unusual
                    number, each of whom reached a ripe old age.</p>
            <p>Those were truly grand reunions of brave men and women, to whose strong arms and
                    self sacrificing lives we owe much that we enjoy today. They met and recalled
                    the hardships and pleasures, the disappointments and triumphs of days long
                    passed. They came, with silvered hair, with quavering voices and faltering
                    steps, but their hearts grew young again as they lived once more, in memory,
                    through the days of cabin raisin's, log rollin's,
                    huskin' bees, quiltin's and maple sugar makin'.
                    So realistically did they picture the old days that listeners caught the pioneer
                    spirit and fancied themselves going forth with hearts full of courage and desire
                    for adventures to conquer an unsettled wilderness.</p>

            <p>Walter Quintin Gresham was born on March 17, 1832, in a farmhouse near
                    Lanesville, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison</region>
                    </placeName> County, Indiana. His grandfather, George Gresham, whose ancestry
                    can be traced back for many generations through a well known English family,
                    moved his family from <placeName>

                    </placeName> to Indiana Territory. Mary Pennington, who married George Gresham,
                    was a sister of Dennis Pennington.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> William Gresham, the
                    father of Walter, who was born in <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. He married Sarah Davis in 1825. While serving as sheriff of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison</region>
                    </placeName> County, he was killed by an outlaw. On the mother fell the
                    responsibility of rearing the five children. Walter, who was next to the
                    youngest, was not quite two years old when the tragic death of his father
                    occurred.</p>
            <p>The Gresham family were not overcome by misfortune. The boys developed into
                    strong, healthful, young men of character and courage. A schoolhouse stood in
                    the edge of a wooded area on the Gresham farm, and here the children attended
                    school during the winter months of each year. Walter seems to have made the most
                    of his opportunities while attending this country school in the Gresham woods.
                    Later he completed a two-year course in the Corydon Seminary, while serving as
                    an assistant first to the auditor and then to the clerk of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison</region>
                    </placeName> County. He taught his first term of school before he was sixteen,
                    and another term three years later. The next year, 1851-1852, he was a student
                    at Indiana University. On the advice of Dennis Pennington and Judge William T.
                    Otto, both of whom were much interested in the young teacher, he now turned to
                    the law. His course was taken in the law office of Judge William A. Porter. Much
                    of his success in life he attributed to the training which he received from
                    Judge Porter. The young man began the practice of law in 1854, as <list type="footnotes">

            <p>While a law student, young Gresham fell in love with Matilda McGrain. The
                    marriage occurred in 1858. Two children were born of this union, Otto Gresham,
                    who is still living, and Kate, who died several years ago. Matilda McGrain
                    Gresham was a woman of strong character and ability, an excellent companion for

            <p>Gresham became chairman of the house Military Committee in the regular session of
                    1861. He sponsored bills which were aimed to place Indiana in a state of
                    preparedness, but for these the Legislature was not yet ready. In regard to
                    secession, while he did not champion the Crittenden Compromise, he favored
                    compromise with the border states. In the special session, which convened about
                    a fortnight after the firing on Fort Sumter, military measures were passed that
                    placed great power in the hands of Oliver P. Morton. As chairman of the house
                    Military Committee, Gresham had much to do with the enactment of laws that
                    enabled Morton to become an outstanding "War Governor."

            <p>Following the close of the special session of 1861, Morton refused to grant a
                    commission to Gresham as colonel of a regiment, or even a commission as a lower
                    grade officer. The chairman of the Military Committee then returned to Cory-don,
                    aided in recruiting a regiment and enlisted as a private. Protests reached the
                    Governor, and after a few weeks, he made Gresham Lieutenant Colonel of the
                    thirty-eighth Indiana regiment which was organized at New <placeName>

                    William T. Sherman who became a fast friend of Gresham. In December, 1861,
                    Governor Morton asked Lieutenant Colonel Gresham to return to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> to become Colonel of the fifty-third Indiana which was then being
                    recruited. The call was accepted, but resulted in a new quarrel with the
                    Governor in regard to the expense of organizing the new regiment. Friends of
                    Gresham came to his aid with funds, the regiment was formed and sent to join
                    General Grant.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> After reaching the field a new controversy

                    resignation of Colonel Gresham. Receiving no response, Morton took vigorous
                    steps to obtain a removal, but the Colonel's friends evidently

                    This resulted in a lameness from which he never fully recovered. He was confined
                    to his bed for a year and compelled to walk with crutches for five additional
                    years. Following his enforced retirement from the army, General Gresham changed

                    reconstruction, Gresham supported Lincoln's plan of political

                    his party in Congress and in Indiana supported negro suffrage, Gresham was
                    greatly dissatisfied. His disappointment over the action of the Republicans of
                    Indiana was not lessened any by the fact that it was Governor Morton who reaped
                    the benefit of the drift toward the policy of the Radicals. In 1857 the Governor

                    Gresham the office of attorney for the federal court of the district of Indiana.
                    This offer was declined because at the time Gresham was calling at the White
                    House in the interest of a friend who desired the office. The friend, General
                    Thomas Brown, was appointed, but before the year was out Gresham was offered the

                    successful from the first. He always enjoyed a trial or lawsuit. On the whole,
                    he was self-possessed and appealed to the reason of his hearers. He studied
                    carefully the decisions of John Marshall and Chancellor Kent, and tried to

                    Though the tariff was a minor issue, the great controversy was over hard or soft
                    money. Kerr, like Gresham, stood for sound money as opposed to paper money. Kerr
                    was elected.</p>
            <p>Following the advice of Gresham, President Grant appointed Benjamin H. Bristow,
                    Solictor-General. The President was so well pleased that in 1874, Bristow was
                    made Secretary of the Treasury. The Treasury Department was in bad condition.
                    Bristow instituted some drastic reforms in the department. However, he rendered
                    the greatest service to the country when he broke up the notorious Whisky Ring.
                    This was a powerful and corrupt organization of distillers of the Middle West.
                    For several years the Ring had defrauded the federal government of revenue by
                    bribing the revenue officers, and, in some instances, other government officials
                    were implicated in the conspiracy.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of Bristow's war on corruption, he had the hearty
                    support of President Grant. However, when the President's private
                    secretary, Orville Babcock, was accused of being connected with the Ring, the
                    President, who believed him innocent, grew cold toward Bristow. Judge Gresham
                    was a friend to both Grant and Bristow and was greatly interested in the
                    investigation. He made a trip to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>
                    </placeName> in the hope that he could convince the President of
                    Bristow's honesty and sincerity of purpose. Nevertheless, his mission
                    failed. Grant came to the conclusion, largely through the influence of some of
                    his friends, that Bristow was using his office as a stepping stone to the
                    presidency, and the fighting Secretary was virtually forced from the Cabinet.</p>
            <p>Senator Oliver P. Morton was a prominent candidate for the nomination for the
                    presidency in 1876. In February, Morton and his friends let Gresham know that he
                    would be approved if he would make the race for governor of Indiana. Gresham
                    turned down this opportunity, since it would call for him to support Morton in
                    the National Republican Convention.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> There was a

                    the nomination of Benjamin H. Bristow for president. The movement failed, but it

            <p>During the seventies, one of the most complicated problems, and one which was of
                    very great importance, was the railroad question. After the panic of 1873, most
                    of the railroads in the Middle West passed into the hands of receivers, who were
                    selected, in the seventh <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> circuit, by Judge Thomas Drummond, an honest, straight-forward man
                    "whose public and private character illustrated all the old-fashioned
                        virtues."<hi rend="sup">21</hi>

            <p>During the depression ushered in by the panic of 1873, the wage scale of railroad
                    employees was several times reduced. Further reductions were to go into effect
                    on August 1 of the year 1877. On many of the roads the payrolls were withheld to
                    meet interest on the mortgages carried by the roads. The decision of Judge
                    Drummond was that railroads are public concerns and that "arrears for
                    wages and supplies that kept the railroad in operation must first he
                    liquidated," by the appointed receivers.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>

            <p>During June and the early part of July, 1877, there were many conferences between
                    the employers and employees. Most of the men accepted the reductions.
                    Nevertheless, by the middle of July, there was a strike on the <placeName>

                    that it would soon reach <placeName>

                    </placeName> was in the hands of a mob. The strike spread all around <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    leave. The Governor and Mayor took no action to preserve order. Judge Gresham
                    held a mass meeting in the federal court room at which he presided. Most of
                    those present had served in the Civil War. Gresham called attention to the fact,
                    "that the community was in possession of the mob, that the Governor,
                    the Mayor and the Sheriff, whose duty it was to act, were supine; life and
                    property were in danger; that society was disintegrating, if it had not
                    dissolved." The best policy to pursue was to organize a Committee of

                    the strikers had some causes for complaint, took command of one of the volunteer

            <p>Gresham offered to act under the Executive of the state, but both Governor and
                    Mayor at first refused his services. Inasmuch as the city officials made no
                    attempt to control the situation, Gresham ordered General Benjamin Spooner to
                    notify the mob "that they were in contempt of court." Spooner
                    went to the <placeName>

                    then permitted the trains that were under orders from receivers to leave the
                    station. Gresham called for federal troops which he placed under command of the
                    federal Marshall. Governor James D. Williams finally took the volunteer
                    companies into the service of the state and, with the aid of the federal troops,
                    the <placeName>

                    were dealing with a revolutionary situation, and they performed their duties not
                    only as officials but as citizens. During the strike, Judge Gresham did not
                    proceed rashly. He inquired of Judge Thomas Drummond by telegram if he had
                    authority to order the Marshal to make arrests.</p>
            <p>It was Judge Drummond who presided at the trials of the strike leaders in Indiana
                    as well as in <placeName>

                    Indiana because he had taken such an active part as a citizen in the effort to
                    prevent violence while the strike was going on.</p>
            <p>In 1883 Gresham resigned his judgeship to become Postmaster-General in President
                    Arthur's Cabinet. During his almost twelve years of service as a
                    federal district judge, he had proved to be fearless and upright. He commanded

                    organization. Tutt, one of the receivers, testified that when he heard of the
                    serious charges in connection with the Coal Company, he instituted an
                    investigation. However, he revealed nothing of importance to the court.</p>
            <p>The object in appointing receivers was to protect the property of the Wabash
                    R.R., but Judge Gresham saw clearly that it was "unusual and
                    novel" to appoint any man who was a director or a stockholder, since
                    the road had been managed unsuccessfully. The fighting spirit of an honest,
                    clear-minded man was aroused, and Gresham dared to defy the power of wealth. He
                    denied that the Federal circuit judge at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> had jurisdiction over property in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, and held that since interest on mortgages had not been paid,
                    foreclosure could not be prevented. He also declared that the non-assenting
                    stockholders of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Wabash</settlement>
                    </placeName> were justified in asking the removal of Humphreys and Tutt as
                    receivers, on the ground that they were unfit to act.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Judge Gresham now appointed Judge Thomas M. Cooley as receiver in the place of
                    Humphreys and Tutt who were members of the grafting "ring."
                    This action restored to the stockholders their rights over the property in which
                    they had invested their money. Jay Gould and those who served him became enemies
                    of Judge Gresham, but he was defended by many newspapers whose praise of his
                    stand found a wide response among the people. Gould at once insinuated that
                    Gresham was making a bid for the presidency. The belief that Gould and other
                    speculators and promoters of his kind would fight the Judge, caused many people
                    to hope that he might be drafted.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

            <p>The presidential election of 1876 was followed by a long dispute. Both Democrats
                    and Republicans claimed the victory. Unquestionably each party was guilty of
                    fraud. The excitement was intense, with threats of war on both sides. As the
                    upper house of Congress was Republican, a group of Radicals, one of whom was
                    Morton of Indiana, determined to decide the election in favor of the Republican
                    standard bearer, Rutherford B. Hayes. In the hope of a fair solution, Senator
                    George F. Edmunds proposed to have the controversy decided by an electoral
                    commission composed of five members of the Senate, five members of the House of
                    Representatives, and five justices of the Supreme Court. Gresham saw an
                    opportunity to weaken Morton and the Radicals. He acted quickly. In the midst of
                    a heated discussion, Senator Edmunds produced a <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The Joint High Electoral Commission turned out to be a strictly partizan body
                    voting eight to seven on every count. Nevertheless Hayes came in with a new
                    policy in regard to reconstruction. Gresham was so favorable to the withdrawal
                    of federal troops from the South that the President could not move fast enough
                    to satisfy the Judge. The new Administration was little over a month old when he
                    was writing of Hayes that "indecision and hesitation" would be
                    fatal to him. "Unless the Republican party abandons the policy of
                    martial state government in the South," he declared, "it
                    can't maintain its ascendency in the North…."<hi rend="sup">32</hi> The President went on to carry out the withdrawal of
                    troops, and Gresham was satisfied, but hostile to any interference with the
                    policy on the part of the Radicals. He saw that the power of the latter element
                    was waning, and believed that the people of the North would soon see
                    "the wisdom of letting the Southern States settle their domestic

                    </placeName>. Terrell, the incumbent, had been appointed Pension Agent by
                    President Grant in 1873 and served until 1877. He was military secretary of the
                    Executive Department in Indiana during the Civil War and was made
                    brigadier-general in 1865, which was an extraordinary honor for him. Terrell was
                    a close friend of Governor Morton, who in thanking him for his excellent service
                    said: "I wish to assure you, that should you ever ask me to do anything
                    for you, I will do it."<hi rend="sup">35</hi> The other party in the
                    conflict was General Knefler who served three years in the Civil War. At the
                    close of the War, he formed a law partnership with Zohn Hanna. Knefler was
                    supported in the fight by Walter Q. Gresham, while Terrell was supported by
                    Senator Morton. Knefler's side won, and he was appointed Pension
                    Agent by President Hayes, in 1877.</p>
            <p>In 1880 Judge Gresham again refused to be a candidate for governor. However,
                    since the Republicans were in control of the Indiana State Legislature, he did
                    become a candidate for the senatorial nomination, but "the strength of
                    Harrison caused him finally to withdraw from the fight."<hi rend="sup">36</hi>

            <p>Gresham now decided to retire from the bench and form a partnership with Joseph

                    President Arthur, to block an incipient presidential boom, it is claimed, and
                    with a view to an Arthur-Gresham ticket in 1884, offered Gresham the vacant post
                    by wire. Gresham was holding his last term of court at <placeName>

                    Gresham's appointment: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>In considering the claims of Indiana it was remembered that it had been
                            the judgment of the Republican leaders, since the campaign of 1880, that
                            Indiana should have a cabinet position. Wrangling among the Indiana
                            politicians had prevented the appointment of Judge Gresham, although
                            General Garfield, who personally knew him, and greatly respected him,
                            had fully determined to select him. The names most prominently
                            considered from Indiana were those of Governor Porter and Judge Gresham.
                            Governor Porter was not personally known to the President; Judge Gresham
                            was personally and favorably known to him. Moreover, Governor Porter was
                            not a <placeName>

                            Moreover, the fact that General Garfield had selected Judge Gresham had
                            a very strong influence upon President Arthur, and possibly turned the
                            scale in Gresham's favor.<hi rend="sup">39</hi>

            <p>It may be argued that Gresham's position as judge was more responsible
                    and dignified than a cabinet portfolio, yet, if he had ambitions for the
                    senatorship or the presidency, a cabinet position would bring him before the
                    public and furnish an excellent start in the political field. It was believed by

                    Gresham. Assistant Secretary of the Treasury John C. New said that
                    Gresham's appointment came through the recommendations of John W.
                    Foster and Senator David Davis of <placeName>

                    terms for some time, he was proud of the selection for the honor of Indiana, as
                    Gresham was a man eminently fitted for any office, no matter how exalted it
                    might be. On the whole, Gresham's appointment was received with favor
                    both by the public and the press. The prominence which he now enjoyed seemed to
                    many to place him in the front row for the presidency.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a good deal of speculation as to how well Assistant Postmaster-General
                    Frank Hatton and Walter &amp;. Gresham would agree. The former was a fierce
                    partisan. His idea of the Department was to use it as an adjunct to the party
                    machine. Gresham belonged to a different school, whose judicial mind preserved
                    him from narrow partisanship. His opinion was not that the Post Office
                    Department was a piece of political machinery, but that it should be run for the
                    best interests of the postal service.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The new Postmaster-General at once showed the spirit of the reformer. Through his
                    efforts legislation was secured to reduce letter postage from three cents to two
                    cents, and the weight of first-class mail was increased from one-half to one
                    ounce. The foreign postal service was improved; fast mails were
                    reëstablished and letter postage to <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> was lowered. His most notable activity, however, was the war he
                    waged against the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> Lottery Company, which was denied the use of the mails according to
                    law. The controversy, started by Gresham, was marked by rigid enforcement of
                    existing laws and the passing of more stringent laws against the use of the
                    mails for fraud. According to the <placeName>

            <p>After Gresham became Postmaster-General, his name appeared frequently as a
                    possible candidate for the governorship of Indiana. He was likewise often
                    mentioned for the presidency, and frequently as a strong man for the
                    vice-presidency. In his boom for governor, it was reported that he had written

                    Gresham's friends supported President Arthur. An Arthur-Gresham
                    ticket would satisfy them. The writer of the letter quoted Morris McDonald, one

                    Postmaster-General was a warm friend of President Arthur, who in turn favored
                    his candidacy for second place. Sherman and Gresham or Edmunds and Gresham were
                    not infrequently mentioned as possible combinations. The outcome of the contest

                    September 23, 1884, as a matter of accommodation to his chief. President Arthur
                    was reluctant to place new timber in his Cabinet. He much preferred to keep it
                    as it was, and there was no man among the President's counselors in

                    before the appearance of President Cleveland's message, and when the

            <p>In February, the chairman of the Republican National Convention made public a

                    </placeName>, in which he stated that he was not a candidate for the presidency.
                    However, a number of his warm friends continued to urge his nomination, but the
                    highest number of votes received by him was forty-eight on the fifth ballot.
                    Senator John Sherman reached the high tide of his success in the Convention when
                    he received two hundred forty-nine votes <pb n="316" id="VAA4025-029-4-048"/> on
                    the second ballot. Blaine's letter of withdrawal had increased the
                    number of candidates. Fourteen different party leaders received votes on the
                    first ballot. The real fight was between the Greshamites and the Harrisonites.</p>
            <p>The powerful Indiana Republican machine was strongly behind Harrison in the
                    Convention, while Gresham was not supported by any active organization. Since
                    the time when Gresham accepted the appointment in Arthur's cabinet,
                    he had been urged by his friends, both publicly and privately, to enter the race
                    for the presidency. His fearless decision in the famous <placeName>

            <p>The <hi rend="i">Nation</hi> could not understand how Gresham could be a real

                    protective tariff regardless of revenue was the only doctrine that would obtain
                    the support of the steel interests. Gresham seemed to be ruled out by the

            <p>In April Gresham's <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> friends held a meeting attended by a large number of representative
                    Republicans. They felt that his qualifications and merits were so well known
                    that it was not necessary to present them to the public. Several paid high
                    compliments to the popularity of the Judge and commented upon the fact, that
                    "as an active member of the federal judiciary, he could take no public
                    cognizance of anything that might be done in his behalf." It was
                    understood that he was adverse to any formal steps to further his nomination.
                    However, "a resolution was submitted pledging the use of all honorable
                    means to promote the nomination of Judge Gresham and expressing the opinion that
                    the sentiment in his behalf was so general and spontaneous, that it was

            <p>Moreover, since Judge Gresham had been on the circuit bench in <placeName>

                    </placeName> for over three years, <placeName>

                    </placeName> championed his cause as an adopted son. The <placeName>

                    </placeName> delegation was pledged to him and on the first three ballots he
                    received her forty-four votes. Even on the eighth ballot, Gresham had lost only

            <p>Senator Harrison's cause was greatly enhanced from the fact that he
                    had captured a delegate from Gresham's own Indiana county. However,
                    intimated an independent newspaper, that might be due "to the wire
                    pulling and delegate-electing class of Indiana Republicans," adding
                    that quite a difference exists between "popularity with party bosses
                    and workers" and popularity with the mass of voters.<hi rend="sup">54</hi> Nevertheless, the Republican political machine in Indiana, by skillful
                    management obtained pledges from the delegates of eleven of the thirteen
                    districts. In two districts the delegates were not pledged. However, analysis of

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

                    Gresham more than two votes, and on the eighth ballot the total of thirty votes
                    went to Harrison.</p>
            <p>The Brooklyn <hi rend="i">Times</hi> proclaimed that Harrison, by securing the

                    Logan, wife of General John A. Logan, did not hesitate to say that her choice
                    for the presidency was General Horatio Alger, adding that "she feared
                    that the Judge was not true to the ticket in 1884." He did not even
                    give it, she asserted, "half-hearted support." She,
                    "therefore, did not feel favorable to his candidacy, and did not think
                    he stood much show, or that he ought to."<hi rend="sup">63</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Gresham was constantly termed a "mugwump" and a "free
                    trader." His opponents defended their antagonism on the ground that he
                    supported Kerr for Congress in 1874, had not been loyal to the Republicans in
                    1876, and had voted for Cleveland in 1884.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, it was reported by the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, who was an intimate friend of Gresham, knew that the Judge did
                    support Blaine in 1884, since Henry "was with him and saw him deposit
                    the Blaine ticket straight." This also, added the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi>, "effectually disposes of the suspicion of lukewarmness
                    on protection,"<hi rend="sup">64</hi> but one wonders how this latter
                    contention could be made.</p>
            <p>However, the best evidence that Gresham voted for Blaine in 1884 was his own
                    statement made during the campaign of 1892. Then he said that he had
                    "voted the Republican ticket at every Presidential election since the
                    party was organized," except in 1864, when he was not able to go to the

                    he had taken no active part, personally, in politics." He was
                    "more of a disorganizer than anything else." He
                    "adjourned his court" in 1876, to work against the nomination
                    of Governor Morton, the idol of the Republicans of Indiana, for the presidency.

                    the district bench, General Tom Browne was district attorney; a quarrel arose
                    and Browne resigned. The attempted boom for the Judge in his native state had
                    already failed. Among his supporters not one prominent Republican was found.
                    Indiana had only one favorite son and leader, that was Harrison. The statements
                    of this eastern paper were not accurate as Gresham had many staunch supporters
                    at the Convention from Indiana. Such men as Charles W. Fairbanks, the leader of
                    the Gresham boom, Albert J. Beveridge, Noble C. Butler, Kenesaw M. Landis, and

                    and Fred and Jesse Grant were all active in the Judge's behalf.
                    Walker Blaine preferred him to any other man before the Convention. Fred Grant
                    heard his father say during his last illness, that the man the Republicans
                    should nominate for president was Judge Gresham.</p>

            <p>From the time of the Republican National Convention of 1888, Judge Gresham became
                    more and more pronounced in his views on the tariff. He believed, as he had
                    expressed in his Wall Street speech of 1884, that tariff revision was an
                    imperative necessity. The McKinley Tariff Act of 1890 increased the breach
                    between him and the leaders, of the Republican party.</p>
            <p>Just after the Democratic Convention in 1888, Gresham made the statement in New <placeName>

                    Convention, in the platform accepted, a complete endorsement of the low tariff
                    wing of the party." It was a "splendid triumph," he
                    continued, "of the principles so long and so ably advocated by Mr.

                    Gresham was repeatedly assured that if he would lead the fight, they would
                    nominate him; but he was decided in his stand, declearing, "I am out of

                    Omaha Convention, which was to be held in July. Even though Gresham had
                    repeatedly declined the nomination assured by the People's party, the
                    leaders, on the eve of assembling on July 4, were in favor of drafting him. Many

                    Judge, if he would accept the nomination of the new party. During the

                    subsequently selected as their nominee, together with other prominent members of
                    the Convention, made a final appeal by telegram soliciting Gresham's

            <p>In the August number of the <hi rend="i">Review</hi> of <hi rend="i">Reviews</hi>
                    there appeared an article entitled, "What Might Have Been at
                    Omaha." The author stated that it was the intention of the Convention
                    to nominate Judge Gresham who would "lift the political situation well
                    out of traditional ruts." He had been a prominent Republican and his
                    decisions and actions in the judiciary positions which he had held made him
                    popular with the so-called "antimonopolists." If Gresham had
                    assumed the "role of a Moses for the new movement, there would have
                    been a great stirring up of dry bones." The strength of the
                    People's party would have been amazing in November. The Convention
                    had been assured by Populist leaders of Gresham's acceptance, so that
                    his final refusal was a severe blow to the enthusiasm of the delegates assembled
                    at Omaha.<hi rend="sup">79</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Indiana delegation put forth great efforts to induce Gresham to accept the
                    nomination. There was no question but that he was the choice of the
                    People's party. He was "lionized by the convention, from the
                    start, as the most available man the People's party had, and the only
                    one likely to harmonize the different factions."<hi rend="sup">80</hi>

            <p>The People's party needed the leadership of a "great
                    practical statesman," logical in his thinking and able to separate
                    "things essential from things trivial." Gresham would have
                    aided the party greatly in the campaign, but he denied that he entertained any
                    thought of publicly supporting Mr. Weaver the nominee.<hi rend="sup">81</hi>

            <p>After it was definitely certain that Gresham would not support the
                    People's party ticket it seemed to be taken for granted, generally,
                    that he was still within the fold of the Republican party. It was made known to
                    the Judge that if a vacancy came in the Supreme Court he would receive the
                    appointment. Inasmuch as he was now opposed to the Republican principles, he
                    caused it to be announced that even though a position on the Supreme Court was
                    tendered him by President Harrison he would not accept it. Then the idea was
                    presented to the country that Walter Q. Gresham intended to vote for Grover
                    Cleveland.</p>
            <p>So many contradictory statements were made, and so many appeals and protests were
                    forthcoming that the Judge finally decided that the best method by which to <hi rend="i">make</hi> known his position was through a public letter.
                    Thereupon, the following letter written to a friend that it might be published,
                    appeared in the <hi rend="i">Literary Digest</hi> of November 5, 1892: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            Mr. Cleveland this fall because I agree in the main with his views on
                            the tariff and did not believe in the principles embodied in the
                            McKinley Bill. I adhere to that determination and have said nothing
                            indicating a change of purpose.</p>
                        <p>It is not true that with my knowledge or consent the President was asked
                            to appoint me to any office. It is not true that I requested anyone to
                            say or to do anything to obtain the Republican nomination this year. It
                            is not true that I voted for Mr. Cleveland in 1888. I voted the
                            Republican ticket at every presidential election since the party was
                            organized, except in 1864, when I was not able to go to the polls.</p>
                        <p>The Republicans were pledged to a reduction of the war tariff long before
                            1888, and during the campaign of that year the pledge was renewed with
                            emphasis again and again. Instead of keeping that promise the McKinley
                            Bill was passed, imposing still higher duties.</p>
                        <p>It was passed in the interest of favored classes, and not for the benefit
                            of the whole people.</p>
                        <p>It neither enhanced the price of farm products nor benefitted labor.
                            Wages are and ever will be regulated by supply and demand. Duties were
                            imposed on some articles so high as to destroy competition and foster
                            trusts and monopolies. I think you will agree with me that this was an
                            abandonment of the doctrine of moderate incidental protection.</p>
                        <p>The tariff is now the most important question before the people and

            <p>Woodrow Wilson considered Gresham's announcement that he would vote
                    for Cleveland "one of the notable incidents of the campaign."

            <p>The President-elect without suggestion, pressure from anyone, or the knowledge of
                    his campaign managers, determined to offer Gresham the first place in his
                    Cabinet. In his letter to Gresham tendering him the headship of the State
                    Department, Cleveland said: "In what may be called an emergency, in the
                    affairs of the people, I need you. Will you come to us?"<hi rend="sup">84</hi> This offer came as a great surprise to Judge Gresham. His wife and
                    son, Otto, objected to his acceptance. They felt that the Judge's
                    popularity would be sacrificed and that his motives would be misjudged. Owing
                    partly to their influence, the offer was at first rejected. Notwithstanding, a
                    number of Cleveland's personal friends and prominent Democrats, among

                    Gresham to accept. He still hesitated. Cleveland sent him a message asking him
                    to reconsider his refusal. It was the appeal made by Henry Watterson, however,
                    who was not a friend of Cleveland, that finally persuaded Gresham to accept the

            <p>It had been rumored for some time that the western jurist would be offered a
                    place in the new administration, but the selection of Judge Gresham to the
                    premiership of the Cabinet caused the greatest excitement and comment not only
                    among politicians of both parties but among business men and citizens of all
                    classes. However, all were agreed in regard to the Judge's honesty
                    and efficiency. Even by those who criticized the appointment most severely, it
                    was admitted that he was competent and eminently fitted for any position that
                    might be offered him. The chief objection voiced was that the Judge was such a
                    recent comer among Democrats. But it must be remembered that he never had been
                    an extreme partizan, and for sometime, had been out of sympathy with the
                    Republican party. According to the <placeName>

                    Harrison and Reedism, and Mc-Kinleyism made him shudder." His position
                    on the federal bench barred him from participating in partizan politics.
                    However, under the circumstances existing in 1892, he felt it his duty to break
                    away from his traditions, and publicly throw his support to Cleveland.</p>

                    His conservative and judicial cast of mind made him well fitted for the
                    position. His selection was accepted with almost universal favor not only by

                    Department of the Interior or as Postmaster-General, but Democrats in Congress
                    saw nothing that fitted him for Secretary of State. The leading Republican organ
                    of Indiana concluded that these must have been some underlying secret reason
                    that caused his selection, intimating that it was Gresham's reward

                    element of the party, the appointment would be satisfactory, but possibly not to
                    the party organization and old-line Democrats. On February 13, the <hi rend="i">News</hi> published comments on Gresham's appointment in which
                    the Honorable W. H. English declared that he was not dissatisfied in the least
                    with the selection. On the contrary, English felt about Gresham's
                    appointment as Clay did about the annexation of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, when he said, "I think I should be glad to see
                    it." English and Gresham were born in the same congressional district.
                    They belonged to different parties, but were always personal friends. English
                    believed that Gresham "by nature was a Democrat," and had
                    drifted into the Republican party through "family and other
                    influences." For years he was certain that the Judge had been in
                    sympathy with the leading Democratic principles. It was natural that Cleveland
                    would give some recognition to the Independents who supported him, and the
                    selection of Gresham was the "very best, he could have
                        made."<hi rend="sup">90</hi> Two days later the same paper

                    </placeName> citizens in regard to Gresham as a Cabinet member. Among these
                    Thomas Taggart expressed his high regard for Gresham, who, he felt, was amply
                    able to fill any position that Cleveland would bestow upon him. At the same time
                    Taggart feared that the appointment would not "meet the general
                    approval of those who for many years had been identified with the Democratic

                    foreign relations of the country." Gresham's learning and
                    experience was far from the diplomatic field. He would be ignorant regarding the
                    affairs of state, but would, no doubt, have been a fine Secretary of the
                    Interior. "It would seem a pity, I say," added Professor
                    Wilson, "to lose so fine a Secretary of the Interior in order that a

            <p>Possibly no other Cabinet appointment ever caused so much comment and criticism
                    as that of Judge Gresham to the office of Secretary of State. The party which he
                    deserted naturally condemned the selection and there was some bitter resentment.
                    Of course, there was a dissatisfied element in the Democratic party who
                    disapproved of the appointment to a high office of any one who had just come
                    over from the enemy's ranks.</p>
            <p>Gresham was, however, received into the Democratic family at <placeName>

                    </placeName> with a hearty welcome. He entered upon the duties of his new office
                    at once. There were several international questions left unsettled by the former
                    administration. Before the inauguration, the newly selected Secretary of State
                    had a conference with President-elect Cleveland at his home at Lakewood, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName>. One of the questions discussed was the Bering Sea arbitration. The
                    commissioners were to meet in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> on February 23, 1893, but the work did not really begin until after
                    Cleveland became President. Seal hunters were depopulating the waters of Bering
                    Sea and making vast profits. During Cleveland's first administration,
                    a controversy with the Dominion of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> arose. Secretary of State, Thomas F. Bayard, decided to confine the <placeName>

                    </placeName> claims to the three-mile limit in the Alaskan waters, and to urge
                    the British and Canadian governments to stop seal fishing in the open seas. The
                    question was not settled and became more serious under the Harrison
                    administration. The <placeName>

                    Secretary of State, John W. Foster, who served under Harrison, and gave a

                    claimed. Secretary Gresham accepted the report subject to the appropriation by
                    Congress of $425,000 awarded to Great Britain in full settlement. But
                    the next Congress, for partizan reasons refused to make the appropriation. A
                    joint commission was appointed in 1897 which awarded Great Britain
                    $48,151.26 more than had the tribunal of 1893. Congress then made the
                    appropriation authorizing the payment of the award.</p>
            <p>The most significant international question, and the one that brought forth the
                    greatest store of adverse criticism on the State Department, was the policy in
                    relation to the Hawaiian Islands. For instance, Gresham was accused of leaving
                    the bench of a federal circuit court to become premier in a Democratic Cabinet
                    in order to reverse one of Harrison's pet schemes. His attack on the
                    Hawaiian policy of the former administration was carried to the extent of
                    bolstering up the worn out Hawaiian dynasty by force.<hi rend="sup">93</hi>

            <p>In January, 1893, just before Cleveland first approached Judge Gresham, a revolt,
                    organized largely by a Committee of Public Safety, had deposed the Hawaiian
                    queen and established a provisional government. Then a deputation of five
                    commissioners was sent to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Within eleven days the commission and Secretary of State Foster
                    had drawn up a treaty of annexation which was submitted to the Senate on
                    February 14, 1893, together with a message from President Harrison urging
                    ratification. At the Lakewood conference, between Cleveland and Gresham before

            <p>Three days after the inauguration, the President withdrew the Harrison treaty of

                    Stevens, which had "obliged her to surrender her sovereignty,"

            <p>A letter was also sent to the provisional government stating the attitude of the
                    Cleveland Administration toward the Hawaiian situation. Minister Willis
                    explained to the Queen that her rights would be restored, provided she would
                    grant complete amnesty to all connected with the provisional government. This
                    she refused to do, as the laws of her government required persons who had
                    committed treason to be beheaded and their property confiscated. The Queen,
                    herself, thus blocked restoration, and the Cleveland Administration found itself
                    at the end of the tether. Gresham ordered Willis to explain that the President
                    could not use force without the authorization of Congress. On December 18, 1893,
                    Cleveland laid the whole controversy before Congress, for such action as it
                    might advise.</p>

                    with a liberal constitution was proclaimed. The following month President
                    Cleveland recognized the new Republic. The Senate, in January, 1895, after
                    prolonged discussion, passed a resolution approving the
                    Administration's policy of non-intervention. The Hawaiian government
                    continued undisturbed, with the exception of an unsuccessful revolution in 1895,

            <p>Many Republican newspapers explained the Hawaiian policy of the Cleveland
                    Administration as an outgrowth of Gresham's hostility to ex-President
                    Harrison. On account of "personal hatred," it was charged, the
                    Secretary of State had deliberately "thrown away the key to the

                    <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> claimed that the Gresham policy gave general
                    satisfaction. The national government would "not play the part of the

                    of America that she had protected the weak countries of the western continents
                    against the greed of Europe. The last administration had established a brilliant
                    foreign policy under a pretense of friendship. The only proper course to pursue
                    was to retrace our steps in the Hawaiian matter. The <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi>

                    Liliuokalani, stormy interviews between Secretary Gresham and Thurston took
                    place. Gresham's letter to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> minister at Honolulu sets forth in detail the circumstances of the
                    rupture which took place between himself and Thurston. According to the
                    Secretary of State, Thurston called at the State Department to discuss the
                    alleged violation of the neutrality laws of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                        <region type="state" reg="hiu">Hawaii</region>
                    </placeName>. "After a brief" discussion of this subject,
                    Gresham mentioned that he understood that Thurston "was not pleased
                    with the action of Minister Willis" in connection with recent events in
                    Honolulu. Whereupon "Thurston desired to know why" the
                    Secretary should arrive at such a conclusion. Gresham then inquired of the
                    Hawaiian minister if he were responsible for matter that had appeared in a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>
                    </placeName> paper, written by a "prominent" Hawaiian lawyer,
                    describing the situation in Honolulu and which matter was adverse to the
                    Administration and reflected upon its Hawaiian policy? Thurston denied that he
                    furnished the article to the newspaper but acknowledged that "he had
                    permitted an employee or agent of one of the press associations to copy at his
                    legation a private letter or letters which he had received." He
                    declared that he furnished the letter simply "as news or information
                    which the public might like to know from Honolulu." It was not done in
                    his representative capacity nor to cause a bitter feeling against the
                    Administration or against Minister Willis. Two days later Thurston again called
                    at the State Department. This time he admitted that he "was guilty of
                    official impropriety in furnishing for publication the matter"
                    previously mentioned. He regretted what he had done and apologized for it. The
                    secretary requested that his apology be presented in official form but Thurston
                    declined to acquiesce because he "did not feel called upon to make a
                    written apology." The Secretary was surprised that a foreign minister

            <p>One of the most knotty problems which occurred during Gresham's period
                    in the State Department was that relating to the Mosquito Coast. This
                    controversy which had begun in 1838 when the British vice-consul informed the
                    Nicaraguan government that the Mosquito Indians were an independent nation under
                    the protection of Great Britain. Prolonged discussions with the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> over the violation of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName> Doctrine occurred. The questions at issue were supposed to be
                    settled by the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty of 1850, which stipulated that neither the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> nor Great Britain would ever "occupy, or fortify, or
                    colonize, or assume, or exercise any doninion over Nicaragua, Costo Rica, the
                    Mosquito Coast, or any part of Central America." Differences of opinion
                    over the interpretation of the treaty followed, and finally in 1894, a
                    provisional government was set up in which the local British consul and a
                    British naval officer had prominent parts. Secretary Gresham at once ordered
                    Ambassador Bayard to ascertain the cause of British action. The British Foreign
                    Office denied any intention to extend British authority over any part of
                    Nicaragua. The aim was simply to protect British citizens. Secretary Gresham
                    maintained in his reply to the British government, that according to the
                    Clayton-Bulwer Treaty, joint authority of Great Britain and Nicaragua could not
                    exist on the Mosquito Coast, and that no foreign agency would be permitted to
                    dictate to Nicaragua. The British government explained that the only wish was to

                    </placeName> and declared: "Every nation, and especially every strong

            <p>Gresham's death occurred during the first stages of the Venezuelan
                    boundary dispute, which was therefore left to his successor, Richard Olney, who
                    sent a note to the British government that was practically an ultimatum.
                    However, had Gresham lived, the question might have been settled with less
                    excitement and ill feeling, as is indicated by the following dispatch from
                    Gresham to Ambassador Bayard at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>

                    and this government will gladly do what it can to furnish a determination in
                    that sense." Judge Gresham believed he could make such a statement of
                    the case that the British government would accept it or ask that it be left to
                    arbitration. Later, Mrs. Gresham in conversation with a friend regarding the
                    Venezuelan dispute said: "There was to be no ultimatum as my husband

                    "he was overfond of lounging about the corridors of
                    Willard's Hotel, and mingling with the very motley mob which sprawled

                    eyes of the world than they had meant for many a day."<hi rend="sup">112</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With the exception of approximately five years, Walter Q. Gresham was in public
                    service from the time he became a member of the State Legislature in 1861 until
                    his death in 1895. While it cannot be said that he rose rapidly in public life,
                    yet each appointment could be called a promotion. It is of interest that he
                    resigned each position that he held, with the exception of General in the Civil
                    War when a severe wound ended his military career and that of Secretary of State
                    which was ended by his death.</p>
            <p>Gresham's greatest strength was in his absolute honesty and undaunted
                    courage. No matter how severely his enemies censured him at no time was he
                    charged with deception, dishonesty or fraud. The criticism which he received
                    relative to the Hawaiian controversy can hardly be justified when compared with
                    his conscientious administration of all foreign affairs. He was courageous
                    enough in the face of adverse criticism, both of the public and of the press, to
                    make no unjust claims for his government. Because he advocated square dealing
                    and fairness, and because he refused to follow his party into paths, which, in
                    his judgment, were wrong, he never had the support of party bosses or of the
                    party machine. His independence caused him many bitter enemies.</p>
            <p>Gresham was as fearless on the field of battle as he was in rendering his
                    decisions on the federal bench. He was as true to his convictions on the tariff
                    question as he was in his dealings in foreign affairs. It was his natural
                    temperament.</p>
            <p>In rendering judicial decisions and in arriving at conclusions, he was perhaps
                    hasty. In his manners he was, no doubt, blunt, and cared little for that
                    superficial polish which makes so many political leaders prominent. In his
                    various public positions, as member of the Indiana State Legislature, as Colonel
                    and Brigadier-General in the Civil War, as <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    </placeName> Circuit Judge, and as Secretary of State, Walter Quintin Gresham
                    unquestionably rendered valuable service to both his state and to his nation.</p>

            <p>Cravenhurst is a three-story brick house set in the midst of veteran trees, with
                    a broad veranda, suggestive of southern homes, sweeping in a wide curve across
                    the front, side and back. This feature is an addition, made some forty years
                    ago, replacing the original, little front stoop. Such stoops were popular in the
                    architecture of the day in which the house was built. The veranda is, therefore,
                    something of a subtraction as it takes somewhat from the unity of the first
                    plan. There is the usual front hall of the period, cutting through the center,
                    the entire width of the house, to the rear veranda, and the usual stairways with
                    easy tread, ascending by graceful curves, to the second and third floors. The
                    rooms on the highest floor which served as servants' quarters in the
                    old days, include a wide, central hall off from which open two light and airy
                    bedrooms. Each of these has front and back closet-like attics which could easily
                    be transformed into snug winter bedrooms. The south room is especially
                    attractive with wall paper of yellow-bird design (impossible to match now) and a

                            of Mr. and Mrs. J. W. LaGrange, who made an inn of the place. Since the
                            death of Mr. LaGrange in July, 1933, Mrs. LaGrange has continued the
                            business, with herself as manager of the inn. Joseph M. Cravens served

                    hinges upon a lovely view of restful, green lawn.</p>
            <p>Four roomy bedrooms on the second floor have wonderful old bureaus, chests,
                    dressing tables, four-poster beds, mirrors and other furniture in keeping. As
                    one looks at the framed Godey prints on the walls one almost expects the lovely
                    ladies to glide out in their hoop skirts and give surprised greetings, so much
                    do the surroundings seem theirs. The most unusual things to be observed and
                    enjoyed are the rare old bells, still in the walls, by which the servants were
                    summoned in the days of the mansion's pride and glory. From the
                    landing on the second floor, the visitor may step back and emerge on a sort of
                    porch which looks like a conservatory, from which leads another series of rooms
                    and still more rooms—some twenty in all.</p>
            <p>On the ground floor, spacious double parlors are on the right of the hall. They
                    are divided by the fluted Corinthian pillars characteristic of old mansions in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Each parlor has its wonderful mantel piece and at each end of both
                    rooms, between the windows, are large gold-framed pier glasses. Heavy brass
                    cornices, suggestive of the old royal palaces of <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, extend across the mirrors and the windows as well. Elaborate
                    French gilt chandeliers strengthen the impression of foreign magnificence. There
                    is at least one chair that has passed the century mark. Needless to say it seems
                    thoroughly at home in its surroundings. A Birge-Mallory clock with its
                    invariable spread eagle, adorns the front mantel while a Seth Thomas of scarcely
                    less ancient "vintage" surmounts the corresponding mantel in
                    the back parlor. All the furnishings, chairs, sofas, tables, and other articles
                    are beautiful antiques that would delight the eye of a collector,</p>
            <p>At the left of the hall the house extends in a long drawn out wing of two
                    stories, the lower part terminating in an ell rising in a sort of postscript, as
                    it were, of more and more bedrooms. Here is a back stair leading to the third
                    story, already described, and an elevator, erected by Senator Joe Cravens for an
                    invalid sister.</p>
            <p>One of the most remarkable art treasures which the house contains is an old and
                    unique Chinese chandelier, beaded and fringed. Brought from the Orient by the
                    son of Governor Brough, it has shed light on the comings and goings of the old
                        <pb n="341" id="VAA4025-029-4-073"/> place for some eighty years. Much of
                    the paper on the walls is of very ancient pattern, which has clearly been there
                    for many years. It would be expected, of course, that the old mansion would have
                    a lion's head knocker on the front hall door.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                    The once extensive grounds have been diminished until now they include only ten
                    acres. Several drives lead to the hospitable front door of the dignified home
                    where so many distinguished guests have been entertained. When James Whitcomb
                    Riley was entertained here by Miss Drusilla Cravens, he composed a poem which he
                    scribbled on the margin of Moulton's edition of the <hi rend="i">Book

                    period and it is approached by a beautiful driveway. At the front is a wonderful
                    sun-parlor and just back of it a living-room commanding a magnificent view of
                    the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>. There is a music room with souveniers that
                    recall some of the most distinguished musicians. Among them is a mahogany
                    cabinet that once belonged to Liszt. The Library has not only rare old volumes
                    but an endless number of priceless works of art. The dining room has a wonderful
                    chandelier and antique china. In the bedrooms on the second floor are found
                    marvelous old four-posters with canopied tops. Here are also fine old mirrors,
                    chests and additional attractive furniture. Everything has an interesting
                    history, many objects having been brought from Europe by Miss Cravens, who has
                    made numerous trips across the Atlantic. She is an antiquarian of excellent

                            of the rooms and also many rooms were put to new uses. The first room on
                            the left as one enters the front door was once the library. It is now
                            one of a string of dining rooms, where are found old sideboards,
                            cupboards, tables and china, including the famed rosebud china of the
                            LaGrange family. One of the most striking features of the rear dining
                            room is a massive white mahogany sideboard, an inheritance of the
                            Cravens family. It is a marvel of the rococo style with deer,
                            dragons' heads, clusters of grapes—a riot of the
                            artist's imagination—carved all over it in high
                            relief. In the hallway hangs a very large picture, painted by A. Nicolls
                            in Rome in 1854. It seems to be a landscape, but the observer is rather
                            uncertain. It commands respect in America on account of its age. Just

            <p>Near the house of Miss Drusilla Cravens, is a lovely old mansion, now occupied by
                    her brother Senator Joe. There is a triangular lawn from which one gets a
                    splended view of the winding <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Great pillars support the facade in true southern style. This
                    house was built in 1832 by Shadrack Wilber, one of whose daughters, Mrs. Taylor,
                    widow of Captain Bush-rod Taylor of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Navy, owned and occupied the house until a few years ago.</p>
            <p>This mansion is furnished with the most wonderful antiques with everything
                    arranged in perfect harmony. It is worth traveling far to see. The priceless old
                    mahogany and cherry furniture are a delight to the eye. The wide hall with
                    hospitable settees, the great double rooms on each side and the inevitable broad
                    stairway—these present a picture from a past day, back into which the
                    visitor seems to have stepped. It was Captain Taylor's expectation
                    that, on retiring from the Navy after years of service in foreign ports, he
                    would cast final anchor at Wilber Point, but death claimed him before he was
                    made an admiral. His dream did not come true, but no one who has seen the old
                    place in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> can dispute the wisdom of his plan to make it his last harbor.</p>
            <p>There are many fine old homes on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> Hill and others in the little city.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> It is
                    always a matter of astonishment to people from other parts of Indiana to
                    discover that so many fine homes were built in the cities down along the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, but they are there and many of them were built by pioneers. They
                    show conclusively the presence of a high culture in an early period, and should
                    be a source of pride to the residents of the southern fringe of
                    Indiana—indeed to all Hoosiers.</p>

                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName>, where they were merchants, importing fine dress materials, furs,
                    etc. When they came west they brought great trunks full of fine silks, paisley
                    shawls, and other such luxuries, which were not displayed but kept packed for
                    years. They had been loyal to <placeName>

                    </placeName>, whose head had fought in the Revolutionary War, lived on the farm
                    next to them after they settled in Indiana. Henry Bryan married one of the
                    daughters. He was a well educated man. He surveyed the land for the location of
                    the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Centerville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He built a schoolroom on his farm, where his small girls were
                    taught in regular sessions, and he was their teacher. Other children in the
                    neighborhood were invited to attend school free of charge. He continued this
                    school until his girls were ready for the higher grades.</p>
            <p>Eliza Bryan, one of the daughters, lived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Centerville</settlement>
                    </placeName> across from the Methodist Episcopal Church for many years. I have
                    been in her parlor several times; it was furnished with old-fashioned haircloth
                    mahogany chairs and sofa and velvet carpet. She went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> later to live with a sister where she died.</p>
            <p>Martha, another daughter of Henry Bryan, who must have been beautiful when young,
                    married a young lawyer, Jacob B. Julian. They started housekeeping in two rooms
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Centerville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Jacob Julian had a taste for landscape gardening and could see
                    possibilities in a vacant lot. He selected a knoll in the west part of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Centerville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, built a substantial brick house with a large latticed porch at the
                    back of the kitchen, and laid off winding gravel walks in the large yard, with
                    clusters of shrubbery at the turns. He planted rare bulbs and shrubs, including
                    Jack Parlneyron <pb n="344" id="VAA4025-029-4-076"/> roses and many kinds of
                    trees, especially evergreen and fruit trees. The persimmon trees set out by him
                    multiplied into a grove at the west side of the lot.</p>
            <p>This home was sold to Oliver P. Morton, after which Mr. Julian bought the whole
                    block enclosed by what is now Morton Avenue on the west, the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> Railroad on the north, First Street on the east, and Plum Street on
                    the south. He made a gravel walk from the house at the east part of the lot to
                    Morton Avenue, with rare rose bushes on each side, and smoke bushes and other
                    shrubs just at the right places. A walk wound down the hill to
                    Paddy's Run. There was a perennial spring at the edge of the branch
                    with stepping stones leading to the circular-cut stone. A group of thick
                    evergreens was planted so as to enclose an oval space, within which was a seat
                    just large enough for two persons. This was called "Lovers
                    Retreat."</p>
            <p>A class of young girls gave a moonlight picnic in the Julian place one beautiful
                    moonlight night. Over one hundred guests were invited, many of them coming from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Two young girls served buttermilk from an artistic fountain. I
                    think they called it the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fountain</region>
                    </placeName> of Youth. There were long tables in the yard with cake, pie,
                    chicken, and other good things to eat. An orchestra furnished music for dancing.</p>
            <p>Mary, the oldest daughter of Jacob B. and Martha Bryan Julian, married James E.
                    Downey of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. She had been teaching a Sunday School class of young girls and
                    invited them to come and look at the wedding preparations, her dresses,
                    presents, and the tables already set for the feast. She also gave each one a
                    piece of her beautiful wedding dress, which some of them have kept to this day,
                    and a piece of cake to dream over. The Downeys afterwards lived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Irvington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and were the parents of nine children, Julian Bryan Downey being
                    the oldest. A daughter, Rebecca, is the wife of Professor Alfred Holmes White of
                    the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>. Rebecca, Julian next younger than Mary, married James L. Mason, a

                        <settlement type="city">Greenfield</settlement>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Martha, the youngest child, was a beautiful girl, a leader in school and society.

            <p>Henry Bryan, subject of Mrs. Anderson's sketch, was a brother of my
                    grandfather, John Bryan. They were the sons of my great-grandfather, Henry
                    Bryan, who at the time of the War of the Revolution lived on the Brandywine in
                    Newcastle County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName>, near Chads Ford, which is in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>. There is a family tradition that two daughters of Henry Bryan, the
                    elder, were captured by British troops, taken to British headquarters, and then
                    courteously conducted to their father's home. There is another
                    tradition that Washington visited the Bryan home and ate at their table. Some
                    years ago I saw a table which was piously believed to be the Washington table,
                    along with many other beautiful inheritances in mahogany and silver in the home
                    of Miss Walpole, granddaughter of Henry Bryan, the younger. Finally, there is
                    the tradition that Hessian troops invaded the Bryan home, ate whatever could be
                    found, and as a joke which little Henry Bryan could not enjoy but never forgot,
                    carried away his hat.</p>
            <p>My grandfather, John Bryan, born in 1763, spent most of his adult life in
                            <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Beaver County</region>, <settlement type="city">Pennsylvania</settlement>
               </placeName>, where he had a
                    typically large family. From his children have come very many descendants, of

                    </placeName> and beyond.</p>

                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> in 1811. He became a minister of the United Presbyterian Church. He

                    </placeName>, Indiana. He died in 1887.</p>

            <p>I shall record nothing of him here except that from his college days he was foe
                    of slavery and foe of the liquor traffic through years when it was dangerous
                    even in the North to be an open foe of slavery and dangerous even for a minister
                    to be the foe of the liquor traffic.</p>
            <p>When my father was about fifteen he spent considerable time at the home of his
                    uncle, Henry Bryan, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Centerville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. He maintained intimate acquaintance with his
                    uncle's family and cherished through life the friendship of his
                    cousins, Eliza and Martha Bryan, who became Mrs. Walpole and Mrs. Julian. They
                    are referred to in Mrs. Anderson's paper.</p>
            <p>My cousin, Reverend Dr. James O. Campbell, has prepared a formidable volume about
                    our Bryan clan. The book includes the names of hundreds of the dead and the
                    living.</p>
            <p>As a final note I may add that I have not found the name Bryan in any Scotch or
                    Scotch-Irish list of names. The name Bryan is found in English records as far
                    back as the thirteenth century and frequently thereafter.</p>

            <byline>By C<hi rend="sc">HRISTOPHER</hi> B. C<hi rend="sc">OLEMAN</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>In the <hi rend="i">Centennial Handbook</hi>, published in December, 1930, at the
                    end of the alphabetical list of members of the Indiana Historical Society, a
                    table was given of membership by counties. This brought out the fact that
                    membership was not as well distributed geographically as it ought to be. Six
                    counties were without any members. A number of counties had only one member
                    each. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> County had approximately two-fifths of the entire membership.</p>
            <p>Since 1930 circumstances have compelled the resignation of a number of members
                    and have prevented the accession of a considerable number of new members. The
                    total enrollment, therefore, has declined nearly one-third and the distribution
                    of members throughout the state is even more uneven than in 1930. The number of
                    important counties and important county seats which are either wholly without
                    representation in the Society or have only one member is a source of regret to
                    the Society and should be a stimulus to at least some people in each of those
                    counties to put their county into a more satisfactory situation.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> is sent to every member of the
                    Historical Society. It is hard for the secretary of the Historical Society to
                    think that there is any county in Indiana which can maintain a satisfactory
                    standard of civilization without receiving at least several copies of the <hi rend="i">Magazine.</hi> Requisites for membership consist in a good moral
                    character, interest in Indiana history and the annual two dollar membership
                    dues. There is no initiation fee. Applications for membership will be welcomed
                    by, and should be addressed to, the <hi rend="i">Secretary</hi>, State Library
                    and Historical Building, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Nominations for membership will also be appreciated.</p>
            <p>Occasionally the <hi rend="i">Secretary</hi> finds people who would like to be
                    members of the Society and who would be valuable additions to it but are waiting
                    to be asked to join, perhaps even hurt at not being asked.</p>
            <p>Let this be a general invitation to all who are interested to join the Society,
                    and to all who are members to extend personal invitations to others to do so.
                    The roll-call by Counties as it stands now is presented below.</p>

                    and J. M. Denny probably be appointed a field sergeant. The letter closed with
                    the statement that a former correspondent of the <hi rend="i">Sun</hi>,
                    "K. M. D.", who was at Camp <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vigo</region>
                    </placeName> would be "enrolled to go as one of us and in the capacity
                    of secretary,' and "K. M. D." would keep the <hi rend="i">Sun</hi> regularly informed on subjects of interest and as often as
                    possible send "news from the seat of war."</p>
            <p>On July 27 there appeared in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Sun</hi> the first of a series of letters from a correspondent who
                    used the name "Prock." This writer was not a member of Company
                    B (Old Post Guards), but of Company G, another of the companies of the
                    fourteenth Indiana. "Prock" was from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and had evidently made arrangements with Editor Greene before his
                    departure to write for the <hi rend="i">Sun.</hi> A natural inference would be
                    that "Prock" was the "whilom correspondent,
                    ‘K. M. D.,’ " that Corporal McHenry mentioned in
                    his letter. This seems not to be true, however, unless "Prock"
                    tried to hide his identity further. As the reader will notice, near the end of
                    the letter of July 25, printed below, "Prock" says:
                    "Nothing from home yet for ‘A. B.’; beats
                    h—11. Excuse the hard word friend G., as even the patience of our
                    Jobs has been exhausted, and I do not claim to be one. My address is Beverly,<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

                    </placeName>., Company ‘G’, 14th Regiment Indiana
                    Volunteers, care of Col. Kimball." It would seem from this complaint
                    that the initials of "Prock" were "A. B.",
                    though possibly, as already hinted, the letters "A.B." were
                    used to cover up the real initials of the correspondent.</p>
            <p>The letters of "Prock" to the <hi rend="i">Sun</hi> ran on to a
                    time far beyond that of the last one here printed. It is probable that the
                    remainder of this correspondence will be published in a future issue. The
                    letters were brought to the attention of the <hi rend="i">Editor</hi> by Mr.
                    Howard R. Burnett of <placeName>

                        <p>The Pass is about 250 yards wide. Our encampment is situated in
                                    the midst of a strip of pasture land or meadow. A noisy mountain
                                    stream of clear, cold water sparkling in the sunlight, as it
                                    rushes over its bed, supplies us with an abundance of the purest
                                    water—the mountains on either side are full half a
                                    mile high, and covered from foot to crest with the most
                                    luxuriant growth of trees, shrubs, vines and flowers imaginable.
                                    The tall, majestic pine towering far above the more modest, but
                                    none the less beautiful hemlock and juniper, chinkapin-shrubs,
                                    huckleberry bushes, and every variety of the wild mountain
                                    laurel fill up the picture.</p>

                                    Heaven seem to be weeping constantly over the unhappy condition
                                    of this once most peaceful and prosperous Republic.</p>
                        <p>Your readers would no doubt be gratified with a description of
                                    the battle of Rich Mountain.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> As our
                                    regiment took no part in it, 'tis impossible for me
                                    to afford them anything like a full account of it.
                                    'Twas fought about 4 P.M., and from appearances, I
                                    should judge pretty hotly contested. Seven pieces of artillery,
                                    one flag, and about $60,000 worth of property,
                                    consisting principally of horses, mules, wagons, provisions and
                                    clothing fell into the hands of the <placeName>
                                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                                    </placeName> forces. One 12 pounder was not discovered till the
                                    day after the fight. The gun carriage having broken, it had been
                                    rolled to the bottom of a deep ravine. Major
                                    Ringgold's name was on it, and the
                                    "Regulars" with us say 'twas one of
                                    the pieces used by the gallant Major at Palo Alto and Rosea De
                                    La Palma [Resaca de la Palma]. The small arms taken were of an
                                    inferior order. Two hundred men laid down their arms on the spot
                                    and 800 more were overtaken, cut off, and captured next day.</p>
                        <p>Owing to every regiment of volunteers being dressed differently,
                                    the <placeName>

                                    </placeName> boys fired a volley into the 13th Indiana regiment,
                                    which was coming down the opposite side of the hill at a charge
                                    bayonet, killing and wounding several. Most unfortunate is this
                                    variety of uniforms; 'tis hard to distinguish friend
                                    from foe at 150 yards.</p>
                        <p>As our regiment marched past the battleground next day, no
                                    unexpected sight greeted my eyes. Piles of dead men, and the

                        <p>A man can indeed realize that this is a soldier's

                                    a chain of wagons behind them—the sight of six brass
                                    field-pieces glistening in the light of the silvery moon as she
                                    escapes for a moment behind a flying cloud—stacks of
                                    muskets, whose polished barrels flash as they reflect the guard
                                    fires' uncertain light—and above all, the
                                    solomn stillness that reigns around, where but a few short hours
                                    before all was life and excitement, proves to your humble
                                    servant that he is soldiering—-"divil a

                                    "Halt! who comes there!" that, added to the
                                    ominous click of the musket locks, brings a man up "all
                                    standing" with a full consciousness of his dangerous
                                    situation and the necessity of a prompt
                                    answer—-"Sergeant of the Guard."
                                    "Advance, Sergeant of the Guard, and give the counter

                        <p>On Tuesday evening at 5 o'clock, your correspondent,
                                    one of 80 men, 5 of whom were cavalry, all under command of
                                    Capt. John Coons, left camp for a scout. Descending Cheat
                                    Mountain, we crossed Cheat river, and passed the last of our
                                    outposts. An hour's walk brought the command to the
                                    summit of a mountain, four miles from and overlooking the camp.
                                    Here we commenced a descent of sixteen miles. The view to the
                                    Eastward in the direction we were marching was magnificent.
                                    Having "cut loose" from the protection of the
                                    gallant Fourteenth, we proceeded cautiously down the mountain
                                    and through the valley, altogether the most beautiful and

                                    stillness which prevailed—the farm houses are
                                    deserted—no sight or sound of human had we during the
                                    night march. Calculating the distance marched at twenty miles,
                                    and judging the enemy's picquets to be not over half
                                    a mile in advance, our Captain at 11 o'clock halted
                                    the command, threw out an advance picquet, and we slept on our
                                    arms. At 4 A.M. we were aroused by the report of fire arms, and
                                    we saw our guards running in and four horsemen galloping away
                                    towards the enemy's camp. This, of course, gave the
                                    alarm; nevertheless, quickly forming, we advanced about 2 1/2
                                    miles, driving in their picquets, who fired upon us at every
                                    turn of the road, and then made tracks at "double
                                    quick." Owing to their being stationed on the mountain
                                    top on either hand, their bullets failed to reach, or whistled
                                    harmlessly over us. Having advanced some 2 1/2 miles <hi rend="i">inside</hi> their picquets and given the enemy a
                                    good scare, we retreated to the foot of the mountain where their
                                    first picquet guards discovered us, and being reinforced by 35
                                    cavalry, we too threw out picquets, and prepared to partake of a
                                    most excellent dinner of veal, new potatoes and honey, at a
                                    vacant house on the bank of a small river.</p>
                        <p>Soon three of our men brought a couple of mounted
                                    "seseshs" into camp as prisoners. At the same
                                    moment a light spring wagon, drawn by two horses, driven by a
                                    "sesesh" bearing a white flag, made its
                                    appearance from towards the rebel camp; it proved to be a

                                    again give himself up as a prisoner of war. He reported the
                                    rebels 1,000 strong and formed in line of battle inside of their
                                    entrenchments only three miles in advance up the mountain, and
                                    4,000 encamped eight miles farther on.</p>
                        <p>Capt. Coons immediately sent the officer and two prisoners
                                    forward under a guard of cavalry, and having leisurely disposed
                                    of our "grub" we prepared to return, when the

                                    advancing on us through the thick woods on the mountain sides,
                                    spies having discovered our actual numbers. Just before the
                                    rebels made their appearance in force, our cavalry took a scout
                                    up the mountain road, met and fired upon about an equal number
                                    of the enemy's horsemen, killing one. The fire
                                    was' returned by part of a company of infantry
                                    stationed in the bushes near by, but none of our cavalry were
                                    hit. Being rejoined by them, we marched for camp—our
                                    movements not in the least accellerated by the presence of the
                                    enemy, now having come out in full force and occupying the house
                                    we had a quarter of an hour before evacuated. Their cavalry
                                    flourished their sabres and shook them at us, but
                                    "nary" track did ye
                                    "sesechs" make over the river whilst we
                                    remained in sight—for we waited over an hour for
                                    'em.</p>

                        <p>After an excessively fatiguing march of 20 miles (up hill all the
                                    way remember) we reached camp at 7 P.M., "broke

                                    picquet-guard—one horse killed and the rider slightly
                                    wounded in the ankle. D—n the greenhorn that did it!

                        <p> The long-looked-for good news from home has during the past week
                                    been pouring into camp. Every day a huge pile of letters and
                                    papers arrives from below. Verily there was great rejoicing the
                                    day the first and most anxiously-expected batch came to hand,
                                    and there has been a small 4th of July excitement every evening
                                    since. Your correspondent returns thanks for the kindness of
                                    many well remembered friends.</p>

                                    miserable "perishing"—nothing
                                    tastes good to them <hi rend="i">except at meal times</hi>, when
                                    huge piles of well greased slap-jacks are stowed away somewhere
                                    and troubles are for the time forgotten.</p>
                        <p>A scouting party, 150 strong, left camp on Thursday evening
                                    last—part, composed of cavalry and infantry, were
                                    sent back on Friday afternoon with two prisoners calling
                                    themselves Mountain Rangers, a number of rifles, and driving
                                    before them 25 head of fat cattle. When 9 miles from this camp
                                    the cavalry and one infantry soldier (who, some 300 yards in
                                    advance of the rest, were urging forward the bovines) were fired
                                    upon by a party of Mountain Rangers in ambush, and the footman
                                    (William Wilkerson, a private in the Old Post Guards), and two
                                    horseman brought down—the former mortally and the
                                    latter dangerously wounded. One of the cavalry was fired upon
                                    the second time as he lay in the road, the ball piercing his
                                    arm. The ambushed party must have beaten a hasty retreat after
                                    their cowardly and assassin-like deed, for on the news reaching
                                    camp three companies of infantry and the whole cavalry force
                                    turned out, and with our gallant Colonel and Major at their
                                    head, hastened forward to the spot, brought in the poor fellows,

                        <p>Company "G" was ordered out on twenty-four
                                    hours picket-guard duty, four miles from camp Friday morning.
                                    Off they went, haversacks filled with crackers, one slap-jack
                                    and a cup of coffee constituting all the breakfast the boys
                                    could boast of to make a start on. About noon it began to rain
                                    (and has continued in "draps" without a

                                    wrapped around us, we kept a bright look-out, munched hard
                                    bread, and fought myriads of gnats till almost dark, when Gen.
                                    Gardner made his most welcome appearance on horseback with a
                                    fresh supply of crackers and some <hi rend="i">very fat</hi>
                                    pickled pork. Soon a fire was kindled and slices hung on ram
                                    rods were spittering in the blaze. Having a touch of the ague,
                                    your correspondent was excused by the Captain and returned to
                                    camp at tattoo. The company remained out till Saturday at 3 P.M.
                                    without capturing a "sesech" or getting sight
                                    at a "bar." The trip, however, gave them all
                                    appetites, such as only soldiers on extra duty experience.</p>
                        <p>The "great uncertainty" here is whether the

                                    September next, or remain in the service for three years. The
                                    question is undergoing discussion constantly all over camp, and
                                    in fact is the all-absorbing topic.</p>
                        <p>Our brave and patriotic German fellow-citizens have it seems
                                    received a back-handed blow from somewhere—a most
                                    outrageous and ungrateful act. Amongst the best soldiers in our
                                    regiment may be found the Germans, and one, the 9th <placeName>

                                    body of men I have yet seen) was exclusively a German regiment.</p>

                                    Even then the soldiers shivered and shook like aspens, as with
                                    blankets tightly wrapped, they rallied around the cheerful

                        <p> After enjoying four days of most delightful weather, another
                                    rainy season has set in, a dense fog obscures the sun, and the
                                    driving rain compells such of us as are not on duty to seek the
                                    welcome shelter of our tents. We are getting used to it,
                                    however, as people do who have the "third day
                                    ager" on the River Duschea in Old <placeName>

                        <p>Yesterday was a lively day in camp. Early in the morning orders
                                    were issued for an immediate change of quarters. Formerly we
                                    were scattered without much regard to regularity, each company
                                    having on their arrival here pitched their tents wherever they
                                    chose, but now the 14th is encamped in regular
                                    order—every command in its proper
                                    place—all in line. Quite a job it was to accomplish
                                    this according to the Engineer's plan, but all the
                                    digging, ditching, pitching of tents, and paving of streets, (to
                                    say nothing of the hard swearing,) is finished, the
                                    transformation from irregularity to order is complete, and the
                                    boys are as proud of their new quarters as a Miss of 16 is of a
                                    new bonnet. The broad, well bouldered avenue that runs north and
                                    south between the two rows of Co. G's
                                    "dens" has been dubbed Provision Street for
                                    the reason that it runs smack into the Commissary's
                                    Department. Denny, Patterson, and I have our bed filled with a
                                    plentiful supply of fresh "feathers," (the
                                    tips of young pine and cedar tree branches) and sleep as warm
                                    and comfortable thereon as though ensconced (Dutch fashion)
                                    between two feather beds. Our good natured
                                    "Orderly" Van Dyke and Tom Bailey have
                                    captured or <hi rend="i">won</hi> a
                                    "sesech's" tent, and with their new
                                    house, hoop-pole bedstead, and coffee-sack mattress are
                                    "fixed." In some of the
                                    "dens" the boys sleep on bark without <hi rend="i">barking</hi>—colds being unknown here.</p>
                        <p>About 11 o'clock last night the report of a musket was
                                    heard in the direction of our picket-guard and the news was
                                    speedily brought to camp that Paul Truckey, private in Co. G.
                                    had accidentally shot himself. It seems that in drawing his gun
                                    over a log, muzzle foremost, it went off, the ball tearing away
                                    the flesh and completely shattering the large bone of his right
                                    leg just above the ankle joint. Poor fellow! he was taken to the
                                    hospital, and this morning had his limb amputated about half way
                                    between the knee and ankle—is doing very well and
                                    will speedily recover. He took the severe operation very cooly,
                                    cracking jokes at the Surgeon's expense all the time.
                                    It is not a week since one George Betters, of New-burg, Indiana,
                                    a private in Co. E, had the misfortune to have his right hand
                                    blown clean off at the wrist. He was fixing his bayonet on at
                                    the time, the musket slipped, and the lock striking a stone,
                                    caused the piece to discharge.</p>
                        <p>I have just learned that the rebels have burned the bridge over
                                    Green Brier river, some eight miles East of us. This does not
                                    look much like they meditated an attack upon us. During the past
                                    week we have frequently been told that 12,000 were encamped only
                                    fifteen miles distant, and contemplated an immediate attack upon
                                    this point. The forces here are anxious to pay their compliments
                                    to their enemies, and all hope at least, if they do not pray,
                                    that the aforesaid 12,000 will carry out their programme, so far
                                    at least as <hi rend="i">attacking</hi> us is concerned.</p>

                                    out on a scout one day last week. Our route lay over a high
                                    mountain, where I do not suppose the foot of man ever trod
                                    before—walked the whole day over fallen trees,
                                    moss-covered rocks and roots, creeping under them clambering
                                    over acres of timber lain prostrate by
                                    tornadoes—forced our way through tangled thickets of
                                    laurel briars and hazel—forded streams, and finally,
                                    about 2 P.M., discovered a narrow path that brought us to a
                                    clearing and house, where your humble servant bought some
                                    cheese, milk and bread, and butter, of a pretty, black-eyed
                                    mountain lassie, the sight of whom refreshed me quite as much as
                                    the (to a soldier) rich repast. Here the drizzle that had been
                                    sifting down on us all day became a heavy rain, and we made
                                    tracks direct for camp (thirteen miles distant) and came
                                    devilish near being fired upon by our pickets just at
                                    dusk—arrived in safety at quarters as tattoo was

                        <p>Saturday night last, after disposing of supper, invested a
                                    "check" at the Sutler's for a
                                    cigar, and took a stroll above our camp to the
                                    "peak," where seated on a huge pine stump, I
                                    thought of you, friend G, and other friends in the Old Post, and
                                    wished all here to enjoy with he the splendid sight—a
                                    full moon rise in the mountains—far surpassing in
                                    beauty anything of the kind I had ever witnessed before, and it
                                    has been my fortune from many a height to see fair Luna cast her
                                    silver light o'er hill and dale. Oh, that I could
                                    wield for five minutes only the poetic pen of Prentice, that I
                                    might describe the to my poor pen indescribable scene. Those
                                    touchingly beautiful lines written by Longfellow, "or

                                    fact—100 men are engaged in fortifying our position
                                    and at least 100 more in levelling the timber in all directions
                                    around camp—mingled with the constant strokes of the
                                    axe, comes the crash and roar, as some towering pine, mighty
                                    monarch of the forest, is laid low; shovels and picks clash in
                                    the trenches; the ring of our blacksmith's hammer
                                    (the only familiar, home-like sound) is incessant; loud are the
                                    cries of soldiers engaged in hauling timbers, and louder still
                                    their curses as some baulky steed, "dancing"
                                    in the harness, refuses to pull a pound. Even the camp hum, that
                                    almost ceaseless sound that "tapps" alone can
                                    silence, is louder than usual—everybody is wide
                                    awake. Indeed, the bustle and excitement is unusual, and it
                                    seems to your correspondent no more like the Lord's
                                    Day than the Fourth of July.</p>
                        <p>Our muster rolls are being made out and the boys will in all
                                    probability handle some cash soon. I have quite forgotten how a
                                    gold dollar looks and feels; however, I do not remember of their
                                        <hi rend="i">sticking</hi> to my fingers. Come on, dollars!
                                    The Fourteenth is growing devilish tired of paper currency
                                    (Sutler's tickets) and long to hear the jingle of
                                    Uncle Sam's coin in their pockets.</p>
                        <p>Our uniforms are not received yet. Some of Company G's
                                    boys have manufactured coats and pants out of their <placeName>

                                    </placeName> rubber and other blankets. As the nights are now
                                    exceedingly cold, I do not see how they manage to keep warm
                                    without "kiver"—find a blanket
                                    indispensable.</p>
                        <p>I trust we will receive "marching orders" soon,
                                    as I should not fancy spending the winter in this region,
                                    encamped on a mountain top at that; but if I <hi rend="i">am</hi> compelled to, why I presume I can endure it as well as
                                    any other soldier in the regiment, "or any other
                                    man," ("or man's man," <hi rend="i">vide</hi> Levi).</p>
                        <p>About 50 rebels on a scouting edition were fired upon by a party
                                    of 25, composing a picket of the 15th Indiana Regiment, and 10
                                    of the rebels and a captain killed. This occurred on Thursday,
                                    at 2 P.M. Our Col. received the news by telegraph, and Capt.
                                    Coons was immediately dispatched with his company to intercept
                                    the remainder of the "sesesh," who, after
                                    informing the Captain that he was a <placeName>

                                    </placeName> man (caught with out arms they are all <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Union</settlement>
                                    </placeName> men) said the party we were in search of were not
                                    on that side of the mountain—had probably
                                    "changed direction." Found such to be the
                                    case, as no sight could we get of 'em, or by sign
                                    perceive they they had been along the path. Returned to camp at
                                    sun-down, with mud beplastered pants and ravenous appetites.</p>
                        <p>Friday night was on camp guard, Lieut, C. C. Miller, Co. E.
                                    acting Officer of the Guard. Although it rained hard for a
                                    couple of hours, we fought shy of the guard tents, (on account
                                    of the <hi rend="i">"body guards"</hi> said to

                        <p>The telegraph has no doubt informed you of a fight on Cheat
                                    Mountain. Well, there was quite a brush with the enemy on
                                    Thursday morning last, and up to yesterday the secesh had their
                                    tents pitched in full view on a high hill about four miles east.
                                    However, they disappeared in the evening, and your correspondent
                                    enjoyed a night's rest in quarters for the first time
                                    in a week. Last Wednesday night, after tattoo, Capt. Coons, with
                                    twenty men from Company G, and forty <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName> boys, started down the mountain, westward, for Gen.
                                    Reynolds' headquarters. On reaching the narrow path
                                    leading across the mountain (the "short cut"
                                    generally taken by infantry) the command halted till day light
                                    (and as it afterwards proved within a couple of hundred yards of
                                    1,500 or 2,000 rebels in ambush) then pushed on for four miles,
                                    when about 7, o'clock A.M., the advance guard (six
                                    men Company G) having entered the woods from a small meadow were
                                    fired upon, and four men wounded, Kline, d'Ewald, and
                                    Dehan, in the thigh, and Mulville through the hand. The
                                    remaining two, William and Amos Edmondson, escaped unhurt, and
                                    retreated to the main body, where the rebels, some 300 or 400
                                    strong, opened fire from the woods upon the entire party. The
                                    fire was promptly returned, and for a few moments the storm of
                                    leaden hail fell thick and fast, and our boys for the first time
                                    heard the whistle of rebel bullets. They retreated to cover in
                                    good order, however, obeying the commands of their officers like
                                    veterans of an hundred battles. No further damage was done by
                                    the rebel fire, and they not pursuing, the command deploying as
                                    skirmishers up the mountain-side, began their march homeward.
                                    When within a few hundred yards of the turn-pike, being some
                                    three and a half miles from our camp the woods were discovered
                                    to be full of rebels, and a running fight was immediately
                                    commenced, our boys giving it to them in true Indian style from
                                    behind rocks and trees, each man fighting on his own hook. This
                                    second skirmish had been going on some fifteen minutes, when all
                                    at once the rebels beat a hasty and precipitate retreat,
                                    throwing away guns, cartridge-boxes, knapsacks, canteens,
                                    haversacks, blankets, overcoats, &amp;c., with which the
                                    mountain was strewn for miles. About 5 P.M. Capt. Coons came
                                    into camp with a part of his command. The four wounded men of
                                    Company G have made their way to camp also, but two of the
                                    Company Adolph Meyer and John Sims, are missing—it is
                                    supposed taken prisoners; two of the <placeName>

                                    their names I could not learn. The Captain captured two darkies,
                                    who said that the rebel force consisted of 2,000 <placeName>

                                    Wm. Javens had a bullet shot through the heel of his shoe and a
                                    spent ball struck him on the shoulder. Joseph
                                    Campbell's hat was perforated with a musket ball.

                        <p>About 7 o'clock Thursday morning news was brought to
                                    Col. Kim-ball that the rebels had captured and overhauled a
                                    couple of our wagons between the picket and camp guard, and
                                    within a quarter of a mile from camp. Company after company flew
                                    to arms and were off at double quick down the pike, the Old Post
                                    Guards in advance under command of Lieutenant Mathew Green.
                                    Pretty soon the mountains echoed and reechoed with volley upon
                                    volley of musketry, and just then the rebels made their
                                    appearence in force on the hill east of us, threatening an
                                    attack from that quarter, The remaining companies were stationed
                                    in all direction around camp, and all of us anticipated a
                                    general fight. There was not a man I know of on the mountain but
                                    wished for 'em to come on. We were resolved on
                                    defending our positions to the very last.</p>
                        <p>About this time news was brought in by some of Capt.
                                    Coons' skirmishers, who had made their way to camp,
                                    that the Captain with about two-thirds of his command had been
                                    surrounded and compelled to surrender. Major Harrow, on
                                    receiving it, procured our company flag and nailed it to the top
                                    of a house in the very centre of camp, and in full view of the
                                    rebels on the hill.</p>
                        <p>The Old Post Guards met the rebels in the road and drove them
                                    back, killing two and wounding others. The
                                    "governor" was in skirmish and says he knows
                                    of two bullets that perforated rebel hide. Two of the Old Post
                                    Guards were wounded—Leonard Daum (slightly in the
                                    arm) and John Killgannon (in the knee). Secesh toggery is
                                    abundant on Cheat Mountain now.</p>
                        <p>The remainder of Company G. under command of Lieut. Wm. N. Denny,
                                    stood 48 hours picket on the outskirts of camp, and on Saturday
                                    at noon started on a long and fatiguing scout of 30 miles over
                                    one of the tallest of the tall mountains in this region, reached
                                    Huttonville at 11 P.M., and next morning returned, escorting the
                                    wagons containing the mail and grub for the 14th regiment.</p>

                                    Wilder. The rest were scattered, and one poor devil was out 5
                                    days, laying hid close to the rebels most of the time: says they

                                    brought in two bodies. The infernal scoundrels, not content with
                                    shooting the poor fellows dead, had mutilated their bodies by
                                    thrusting bayonets into them.</p>
                        <p>No rebels made their appearance when the flag reached the hill. </p>
                        <p>One of our picket-guard, Templeton, Co. D, was wounded and taken
                                    prisoner by the rebels. The wound was a slight one, but his
                                    captors bayonetted him through the head and left him laying in
                                    the road.</p>

                        <p>We are all excitement in camp still, and guard duty is heavy. Our
                                    Company was sent out for 24 hours picket yesterday noon. Your

                        <p>Lieut. Denny came near having his right hand blown off by the
                                    accidental discharge of his Enfield rifle. As it is, he escaped
                                    with a slight bruise and bad powder burn of second and third

                        <p>Thursday noon we were ordered to prepare two days'
                                    rations and hold ourselves in readiness to march at midnight. Up
                                    to 9 o'clock camp fires burned brightly; around them
                                    groups of soldiers gathered singing, laughing,
                                    "speculating" on the coming fight. There was a
                                    constant jingle, jingle of iron ram-rods, snapping of caps, and
                                    sputtering of hot grease in sundry frying pans—notes
                                    of preparation for the morrow; "tattoo" rolled
                                    off at 10 o'clock, one hour' later than
                                    usual, and "taps" at a quarter past, when camp
                                    fires were put out; <hi rend="i">all lights except</hi> in
                                    officers' tents extinguished, and the soldiers
                                    retiring to their quarters and blankets, sought two
                                    hours' repose. At 12 o'clock all were
                                    aroused, the companies forming into their respective quarters,
                                    were visited each in turn by our gallant Colonel, who spoke a
                                    few words of encouragement and bade them all stand by him, and
                                    remember they were from Indiana and belonged to the 14th
                                    regiment; then came the order to form in line, which movement
                                    was promptly executed. Right, face! Forward march! and the 14th
                                    taking the "route steps," moved quickly but
                                    silently down the mountain eastward, past several regiments in
                                    the dense fog, the boys shouting to each other as they filed
                                    rapidly by at Cheat River Bridge; overtook the artillery; passed
                                    it; were soon beyond our picket line, and hurrying up the
                                    opposite mountain, through the dark and silent night, without a
                                    moment's rest till the first faint streaks of light
                                    appeared in the East, when the regiment was halted, and muskets
                                    and rifles loaded; in motion again pretty soon; passed the
                                    ambulances belonging to the 9th Indiana and our own; then
                                    descending the mountain, approached the Greenbriar Bridge, when
                                    the sharp report of half-a-dozen muskets rang out on the still
                                    morning air, immediately followed by a crashing volley; then
                                    pop! pop! pop! and all was silent; on went the 14th, cheering as
                                    they rushed "double quick," over the bridge
                                    and down through the Greenbriar Valley; soon we came in sight of
                                    the 9th Indiana boys, drawn up in line of battle, across a
                                    meadow, their skirmishers hastening down from the surrounding
                                    mountains to join the regiment. The 14th closed in behind, when
                                    the two regiments moved steadily forward till we came in sight
                                    of the enemy's tents, when the advance halted and the
                                    artillery moved to the front, taking up a position on a slight
                                    elevation to the left of the pike. Other regiments now came up,
                                    and the 7th, 9th, and 17th Indiana boys filed across the <list type="footnotes">

                                    wing deploying their skirmishers advanced at "double
                                    quick" through the tall grass and bushes skirting the
                                    river and meadows. The 14th now marched forward along the pike
                                    for a few hundred yards, when the companies comprising our left
                                    wing, including Company G, were ordered to deploy and drive the
                                    rebels out of the woods to the left, while the remainder of the
                                    regiment marched along the pike to protect the batteries.</p>
                        <p>Soon we were climbing through the tanglewood and laurel up the
                                    steep mountain sides, when bang! goes a big gun from our battery
                                    of rifled cannon, and whiz! comes a shell over our heads,
                                    falling plump into the enemy's trenches, where it
                                    burst, killing three horses and doing other damage. A roar from
                                    the rebel camp answered, and a round shot whistled through the
                                    air in reply, tearing up the ground in rear of our artillery.
                                    The ball was now opened—roar after in quick
                                    succession from the big guns on both sides—the storm
                                    of shot and shell traversing mid air not more than fifty feet
                                    from our heads, was at once terribly grand and terrific. The
                                    fierce music of "grim war," such as had fallen
                                    upon the ears of but few of our brave fellows, who all
                                    unheeding, cheered lustily and pushed forward rapidly to the
                                    front.</p>
                        <p>The rebel skirmishers, 600 in number, were speedily rousted from
                                    cover, and the musketry now opened along our entire line on the
                                    retreating foe. To your correspondent the rapid "file
                                    firing" of the companies and the rebel shots in reply,
                                    intermingled with the deafening roar of artillery sounded like
                                    10,000 packs of fire-crackers set off at once.</p>
                        <p>Our batteries now took up a position in front, and for three
                                    hours poured shot and shell into the enemy's camp,
                                    doing great execution. He had eleven guns (one and 18-pounder)
                                    and one mortar; seven of these were silenced, when he was
                                    reinforced with both men and guns, and reopened fire again. Our
                                    ammunition for the artillery running short, the guns were
                                    withdrawn, and at 4 o'clock we began our march back
                                    to camp. As we came out of the woods into the open space to form
                                    into line the round shot ploughed up the ground around us. Every
                                    moment bang would go a gun, whiz! boom! and a shell would make
                                    the earth fly, filling the boys' eyes with gravel;
                                    but the brave fellows stood their ground without flinching, as
                                    formed in four ranks without a murmur they cooly awaited the
                                    order to march.</p>
                        <p>The Hoosiers are too much for Secesh—fire too rapidly
                                    and with aim too accurate—nothing in rebel shape can
                                    resist their impetuosity. Silence their batteries, Mr. Big Guns,
                                    and the infantry will soon complete the job.</p>
                        <p>The loss on our side trifling—eleven killed and
                                    fifteen wounded—three of the killed and four of the
                                    wounded belonged to the 14th—none from either of the <placeName>

                                    Gen. Reynolds would not grant the request, remarking that he

                                    struck by a round shot on the left arm, just below the shoulder,
                                    almost completely severing the member. The brave fellow took out
                                    his pocket knife, cut off his coat sleeve and the piece of flesh
                                    by which his arm still hung, letting it fall to the ground; then
                                    cooly picking it up, marched off to the rear.</p>
                        <p>Sergeant Price of Company A, 14th Indiana had his thigh shot off
                                    by a rifled cannon ball.</p>
                        <p>Just before we received the order to march, and whilst the 9th,
                                    14th, and 17th Indiana were standing in "four
                                    ranks," a compact mass on the narrow pike observed one
                                    of the 9th, not 20 yards off, sitting down in the act of tieing
                                    his shoe—when whiz! comes a six pound shot and
                                    striking the ground about 4 inches in his rear, turned the
                                    soldier, gun and all a complete summerset; up he jumped, rubbing
                                    the dirt out of his eyes, and snatching up his musket took his
                                    place in the ranks with the remark, "well aimed Mr.
                                    Secesh, but not quite powder enough."</p>
                        <p>In my last forgot to mention that the 32nd <placeName>

                                    gain our rear from another camp, and cut off our retreat by
                                    obtaining possession of a rock some 60 feet high, on top of
                                    which is a level space commanding the approach from the eastward
                                    to Green Briar Bridge and capable of holding a regiment, which
                                    deployed could successfully resist an army, for a considerable
                                    time at least. The rebels cannot withstand our infantry and the
                                    gallant 32nd first checked their advance and then dispersed them
                                    entirely, running the secesh through the the woods like
                                    frightened sheep.</p>

                        <p> On the 8th inst., at noon, the order
                                    came—"11th Regiment strike tents, and
                                    prepare to march immediately." Soon it was known all
                                    over camp that we were bound Westward. Most welcome order, and
                                    obeyed with alacrity, I assure you. By 1 o'clock we
                                    were on the march and at set of sun had left Cheat Mountain, its
                                    chilling winds and everlasting fogs far behind, and were
                                    encamped in a small meadow' on the banks of Tygart
                                    river, within three miles of Huttonville.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
                                    Our wagons failing to "come to time" we built
                                    fires supped on crackers and coffee, and passed the night in the
                                    open air, without other covering than our blankets.</p>
                        <p>At 8 A.M. we forded the river, went into camp on the west side
                                    and within a stone's throw of the so called <hi rend="i">town</hi> of Huttonville.</p>

                                    "Wagoners Camp" this afternoon, and we
                                    Hoosiers are all together, forming an Indiana Brigade under
                                    command of General Reynolds.</p>
                        <p>Chestnuts and apples, (the latter of a very inferior quality) are

                                    delightful—many degrees warmer here than on the <hi rend="i">breezy</hi> Summit.</p>
                        <p>Do we winter here, or move farther West? Can't answer
                                    that question, nor can "any other man"
                                    hereabouts.</p>
                        <p>We are all in the best of spirits. We would like very much to see
                                    some of our friends though, and much prefer wintering in Indiana

                                    silver <hi rend="i">wheels</hi>, fists tightly closed on sundry
                                    $10 bills, the "scrip" of our dear
                                    and much loved Uncle Samuel, their faces beaming with pleasure
                                    and delight; verily this mountain-locked valley of the Tygart
                                    seems a Paradise to us mountaineers, (the 14th is so called by
                                    other Indiana regiments) the broad meadows, hills (that would be
                                    mountains to any other but a "Fourteenth")
                                    covered with green pastures, farm houses nestled in groves of
                                    oak and chestnut, orchards with their golden fruit, the bright
                                    and beautiful river dashing o'er its rocky bed with
                                    ripples flashing in the sunlight or glittering like burnished
                                    blades as the silvery moon peeps o'er the distant
                                    mountain, banks shaded here and there with clumps of the wild
                                    plum, willow, and quaking ash, its course marked by a hedge of
                                    whortle and spice wood bushes, their bright red berries
                                    resembling a doubled string of beads; and, above all, the warm
                                    and genial sunshine, the balmy days of Autumn, seem to make the
                                    soldier's heart glad, and, though some may long to
                                    see the Hoosier Land, the majority are for the time being
                                    content—indeed those who are not should be sent back
                                    to Cheat Mountain Summit, and compelled to stand picket-guard 48
                                    hours without crackers! Here we have no pickets, and camp-guard
                                    is mere pastime while sun and moon so brightly shine.
                                    Discipline, however, is not forgotten by that kind-hearted but
                                    thorough-going soldier, our Colonel, and the following orders

            <p>There are evidently several purposes that may be subserved by book reviews. The
                    marks of a good history or biography are accuracy, worth-while content, evidence
                    of insight, and readability. A reviewer should evaluate any work of a historical
                    nature in relation to these points. Book reviews in which writers merely exploit
                    their own views, or praise the work of authors of volumes reviewed, or attempt
                    to promote sales, or exercise their talents for clever writing, or indulge in
                    stinging comments are of little value. So many reviews are published that really
                    aid no one desirous of learning the true nature of books before ordering or
                    reading them, that all students or readers of history and biography owe much to

                    careful evaluations of historical publications, The responsibility of the
                    editors of these scholarly quarterlies is therefore very great in relation to
                    the selection of reviewers, while that of the reviewers is even greater.</p>
            <p>Those who write reviews <hi rend="i">of historical books may be roughly</hi>
                    divided into two classes—college men who have had training in
                    research and who are more or less specialists in the fields of the works
                    reviewed, and literary men or journalists who are not trained investigators and
                    who do not, as a rule, possess special knowledge of the fields in which the
                    volumes reviewed fall. The most interesting results appear when trained
                    historians review the historical writings of journalists or when journalists
                    review the carefully prepared monographs of historical workers.</p>

            <p>The twelfth volume of the <hi rend="i">Dictionary of American Biography</hi>
                    appeared recently. The value of this important work increases as publication
                    progresses. Students of Indiana history will find sketches of many of the
                    leaders who have played parts in the state's history in the volumes
                    that have been brought out to date. The task of selection and rejection is one
                    of magnitude and difficulty, not only in regard to the biographical sketches to
                    be included but also in regard to the authors who are to write them. The job has
                    been so well done that one hesitates to raise any questions. One would,
                    nevertheless, like to know by what process or by whose advice the list of lives
                    to be included or excluded for any state is made out. It would also be
                    interesting to know by what method those in charge of this great undertaking
                    decide on the list of authors. It would seem that the editor and his assistants
                    would need the advice of persons in each state who may be supposed to know
                    something about who is fitted to write this or that biographical sketch.
                    Assuming no knowledge of what is true in regard to other states, it would not be
                    hard to demonstrate that several men in Indiana who could have given material
                    aid to the editors have not been consulted.</p>
            <p>The roll-call by counties of membership in the Indiana Historical Society
                    presented on another page of this issue reveals an interesting situation. It
                    should make good copy for newspapers all over Indiana. One tenth of the counties
                    have no members in the Society. A number of others can boast of but a single
                    member each. Many libraries of the state are subscribers to the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>, but it seems that only two of the
                    counties with no members in the Society have library subscriptions to the <hi rend="i">Magazine.</hi> It is true that a good many Indiana newspapers are
                    on the exchange list of the <hi rend="i">Magazine.</hi> In this way, perhaps two
                    or more of the zero counties receive the <hi rend="i">Magazine.</hi> The Indiana
                    Historical Society is <pb n="374" id="VAA4025-029-4-106"/> worthy of support,
                    and no county in the state should have fewer than ten members.</p>
            <p>It is almost unthinkable that any library in Indiana should be without the
                    publications of the Society or the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of
                    History.</hi> The sad truth is that a very considerable number of the libraries
                    of the state have no file of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> and are not now
                    subscribers. Nearly all libraries that receive the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>
                    are direct subscribers paying $2.00 per year. It should be understood
                    by libraries that institution memberships in the Indiana Historical Society are
                    available to all of them at $3.00 per year. Libraries carrying such
                    memberships will receive the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> and in addition the <hi rend="i">Bulletins</hi> and <hi rend="i">Publications</hi> of the Society.</p>

            <p>Full sets of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> can rarely be supplied to libraries
                    or individuals who may desire to purchase. A complete file from 1920 forward can
                    be supplied at fifty cents a copy, or two dollars per volume, unbound; from 1914
                    to 1919, the price is one dollar per copy, or four dollars per volume. Issues
                    from 1905-1913, when they can be supplied at all, will be sold at one dollar and
                    a half per number.</p>
