                    Britain and beyond. The works selected include anthologies, novels, political pamphlets, and volumes

                            <p> The MLA Bibliography staff has created a thesaurus of over 50,000 terms and 200,000
                                names to ensure consistency in the terms and names assigned during indexing. The VWWP
                                project will utilize a subset of the MLA Thesaurus to assign genre headings to the VWWP
                                texts. The genre terms are further enhanced by definitions compiled from various sources
                                such as <title level="m">The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms</title>. </p>

                <head rend="center">ON THE STAGE.</head>
                <p>THINGS dramatic and things theatrical are often confounded together in the minds of English people,
                    who, being for the most part neither the one nor the other, speak and write of them as if they were
                    identical, instead of, as they are, so dissimilar that they are nearly opposite.</p>
                <p>That which is dramatic in human nature is the passionate, emotional, humorous element, the simplest
                    portion of our composition, after our mere instincts, to which it is closely allied, and this has no
                    relation whatever, beyond its momentary excitement and gratification, to that which imitates it, and
                    is its theatrical reproduction; the dramatic is the <hi rend="i">real</hi>, of which the theatrical
                    is the <hi rend="i">false</hi>.</p>


                <pb n="4" xml:id="VAB7399-010"/>
                <p>Both nations and individuals in whom the dramatic temperament strongly preponderates are rather
                    remarkable for a certain vivid simplicity of nature, which produces sincerity and vehemence of
                    emotion and expression, but is entirely without the <hi rend="i">consciousness</hi> which is never
                    absent from the theatrical element.</p>
                <p>Children are always dramatic, but only theatrical when they become aware that they are objects of
                    admiring attention ; in which case the assuming and dissembling capacity of <hi rend="i">acting</hi>
                    develops itself comically and sadly enough in them.</p>
                <p>The Italians, nationally and individually, are dramatic; the French, on the contrary, theatrical; we
                    English of the present day are neither the one nor the other, though our possession of the noblest
                    dramatic literature in the world proves how deeply at one time our national character was imbued
                    with elements which are now so latent as almost to be of doubtful existence; while, on the other
                    hand, our American progeny are, as a nation, devoid <pb n="5" xml:id="VAB7399-011"/> of the dramatic
                    element, and have a considerable infusion of that which is theatrical, delighting, like the
                    Athenians of old, in processions, shows, speeches, oratory, demonstrations, celebrations, and
                    declarations, and such displays of public and private sentiment as would be repugnant to English
                    taste and feeling; to which theatrical tendency, and the morbid love of excitement which is akin to
                    it, I attribute the fact that Americans, both nationally and individually, are capable of a certain
                    sympathy with the French character, in which we are wanting.</p>

                <p>The combination of the power of representing passion and emotion with that of imagining or conceiving
                    it-that is, of the theatrical talent with the dramatic temperament —is essential to make a good
                    actor; their combination in the highest possible degree alone makes a great one.</p>
                <p>There is a specific comprehension of effect and the means of producing it, which, in some persons, is
                    a distinct capacity, and this forms <pb n="6" xml:id="VAB7399-012"/> what actors call the study of
                    their profession; and in this, which is the alloy necessary to make theatrical that which is only
                    dramatic, lies the heart of their mystery and the snare of their craft in more ways than one: and
                    this, the actor's <hi rend="i">business</hi>, goes sometimes absolutely against the dramatic
                    temperament, which is nevertheless essential to it.</p>
                <p>Every day lessens the frequency of this specific combination among ourselves, for- the dramatic
                    temperament, always exceptional in England, is becoming daily more so under the various adverse
                    influences of a state of civilisation and society which fosters a genuine dislike to exhibitions of
                    emotion, and a cynical disbelief in the reality of it, both necessarily repressing, first, its
                    expression, and next, its existence. On the other hand, greater intellectual cultivation and a purer
                    and more elevated taste, are unfavourable to the existence of the true theatrical spirit; and
                    English actors of the present day are of the public, by being "nothing if not critical," and are not
                    of <pb n="7" xml:id="VAB7399-013"/> their craft, having literally ceased to know "what belongs to a
                    frippery." They have lost for the most part alike the dramatic emotional temperament and the scenic
                    science of mere effect, and our stage is and must be supplied, if supplied at all, by persons less
                    sophisticated and less civilised. The plays brought out and revived at our theatres of late years
                    bear doleful witness to this. We have in them archaeology, ethnology, history, geography, botany
                    (even to the curiosity of ascertaining the Danish wild - flowers that Ophelia might twist with her
                    mad straws), and upholstery ; everything, in short, but acting, which it seems we cannot have.</p>
                <p>When Mrs. Siddons, in her spectacles and mob-cap, read <hi rend="i">Macbeth</hi> or <hi rend="i">King
                        John</hi>, it was one of the grandest dramatic achievements that could be imagined, with the
                    least possible admixture of the theatrical element; the representation of the <hi rend="i">Duke's
                        Motto</hi>, with all its resources of scenic effect, is a striking and interesting theatrical
                    entertainment, with <pb n="8" xml:id="VAB7399-014"/> hardly an admixture of that which is truly
                    dramatic.</p>
                <p>Garrick was, I suppose, the most perfect actor that our stage has ever produced, equalling in tragedy
                    and comedy the greatest performers of both ; but while his dramatic organisation enabled him to
                    represent with exquisite power and pathos the principal characters of Shakespeare's noblest plays,
                    his theatrical taste induced him to garble, desecrate, and disfigure the masterpieces of which he
                    was so fine an interpreter, in order to produce or enhance those peculiar effects which constitute
                    the chief merit and principal attraction of all theatrical exhibitions.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Siddons could lay no claim to versatility—it was not in her nature; she was without mobility of
                    mind, countenance, or manner; and her dramatic organisation was in that respect inferior to
                    Garrick's; but out of a family of twenty-eight persons, all of whom made the stage their vocation,
                    she alone preeminently combined the qualities requisite to <pb n="9" xml:id="VAB7399-015"/> make a
                    great theatrical performer in the highest degree.</p>
                <p>Another member of that family—a foreigner by birth, and endowed with the most powerful and vivid
                    dramatic organisation—possessed in so small a degree the faculty of the stage, that the parts which
                    she represented successfully were few in number, and though among them there were some dramatic <hi
                        rend="i">creations</hi> of extraordinary originality and beauty, she never rose to the highest
                    rank in her profession, nor could claim in any sense the title of a great theatrical artist.—This
                    was my mother. And I suppose no member of that large histrionic family was endowed to the same
                    degree with the natural dramatic temperament. The truth of her intonation, accent, and emphasis,
                    made her common speech as good as a play to hear, (oh, how much better than some we <hi rend="i"
                        >do</hi> hear!) and whereas I have seen the Shakespeare of my father, and the Shakespeare and
                    Milton of Mrs. Siddons, with every emphatic word underlined and accentuated, lest they should omit
                    the right <pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7399-016"/> inflection in delivering the lines, my mother could no
                    more have needed such notes whereby to speak <hi rend="i">true</hi> than she would a candle to have
                    walked by at noonday. She was an incomparable critic; and though the intrepid sincerity of her
                    nature made her strictures sometimes more accurate than acceptable, they were inestimable for the
                    fine tact for truth, which made her instinctively reject in nature and art whatever sinned against
                    it.</p>
                <p>I do not know whether I shall be considered competent to pass a judgment on myself in this matter,
                    but I think I am. Inheriting from my father a theatrical descent of two generations and my mother's
                    vivid and versatile organisation, the stage itself, though it became from the force of circumstances
                    my career, was, partly from my nature, and partly from my education, so repugnant to me, that I
                    failed to accomplish any result at all, worthy of my many advantages. I imagine I disappointed alike
                    those who did and those who did not think me endowed with the talent of my family, and incurred,
                    towards <pb n="11" xml:id="VAB7399-017"/> the very close of my. theatrical career; the severe
                    verdict from one of the masters of the stage of the present day, that I was "ignorant of the first
                    rudiments of my profession."</p>
                <p>In my father and mother I have had frequent opportunities of observing in most marked contrast the
                    rapid intuitive perception of the dramatic instinct in an organisation where it preponderated, and
                    the laborious process of logical argument by which the same result, on a given question, was reached
                    by a mind of different constitution (my father's), and reached with much doubt and hesitation,
                    caused by the very application of analytical reasoning. The slow mental process <hi rend="i"
                        >might</hi> with time have achieved a right result in all such cases; but the dramatic instinct,
                    aided by a fine organisation, was unerring; and this leads me to observe, that there is no reason
                    whatever to expect that fine actors shall be necessarily profound commentators on the parts that
                    they sustain most successfully, but rather the contrary.</p>


                <pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7399-018"/>
                <p>I trust I shall not be found wanting in due respect for the greatness that is gone from us, if I say
                    that Mrs. Siddons' analysis of the part of "Lady Macbeth" was to be found <hi rend="i">alone</hi> in
                    her representation of it; of the magnificence of which the "essay" she has left upon the character
                    gives not the faintest idea.</p>
                <p>If that great actress had possessed the order of mind capable of conceiving and producing a
                    philosophical analysis of any of the wonderful poetical creations which she so wonderfully embodied,
                    she would surely never have been able to embody them as she did. For to whom are all things given ?
                    and to whom were ever given, in such abundant measure, consenting and harmonious endowments of mind
                    and body for the peculiar labour of her life?</p>
                <p>The dramatic faculty, as I have said, lies in a power of apprehension quicker than the disintegrating
                    process of critical analysis, and when it is powerful, and the organisation fine, as with Mrs.
                    Siddons, perception rather than reflection reaches the aim proposed; and the <pb n="13"
                        xml:id="VAB7399-019"/> persons endowed with this specific gift will unite with it the mental
                    qualifications of philoosophers and metaphysicians: no better proof of which can be adduced than
                    Mrs. Siddons herself, whose performances were, in strict sense of the word, excellent, while the two
                    treatises she has left upon the characters of "Queen Constance" and "Lady eth"—two of her finest
                    parts—are feeble and superficial. Kean, who possessed, beyond stors whom I have seen, tragic
                    inspiration, could very hardly, I should think, have given a satisfactory reason for any one of the
                    great effects which he produced. Of Mdlle. Rachel, whose impersonations fulfilled to me the idea of
                    perfect works of art of their kind, I have heard, from one who knew her well, that her intellectual
                    processes were limited to the conration of the most purely mechanical part of her vocation; and
                    Pasta, the great lyric tragedian, who, Mrs. Siddons said, was capable giving her lessons, replied to
                    the observation, <foreign xml:lang="fr">"Vous avez dû beaucoup étudier l'antique,"</foreign>
                    <pb n="14" xml:id="VAB7399-020"/>
                    <foreign xml:lang="fr">"Je l'ai beaucoup senti."</foreign> The reflective and analytical quality has
                    little to do with the complex process of acting, and is alike remote from what is dramatic and what
                    is theatrical.</p>
                <p>There is something anomalous in that which we call the dramatic art that has often arrested my
                    attention and exercised my thoughts; the special gift and sole industry of so many of my kindred,
                    and the only labour of my own life, it has been a subject of constant and curious speculation with
                    me, combining as it does elements at once so congenial and so antagonistic to my nature.</p>
                <p>Its most original process, that is, the conception of the character to be represented, is a mere
                    reception of the creation of another mind; and its mechanical part, that is, the representation of
                    the character thus apprehended, has no reference to the intrinsic, poetical, or dramatic merit of
                    the original creation, but merely to the accuracy and power of the actor's perception of it; thus
                    the character of "Lady Macbeth" is as majestic, awful, and poetical, whether it be <pb n="15"
                        xml:id="VAB7399-021"/> worthily filled by its pre-eminent representaive, Mrs. Siddons, or
                    unworthily by the most competent of ignorant provincial tragedy queens.</p>
                <p>This same dramatic art has neither fixed ules, specific principles, indispensable rudiments, nor
                    fundamental laws; it has no basis in positive science, as music, painting, sculpture, ad'
                    architecture have; and differs from them U, in that the mere appearance of spontaneity, rhich 'is an
                    acknowledged assumption, is its alef merit. And yet— <q rend="blockquote">This younger of the sister
                        arts, Where all their charms combine—</q> requires in its professors the imagination of the
                    poet, the ear of the musician, the eye of the painter and sculptor, and over and above these, a
                    faculty peculiar to itself, inasmuch as the actor personally fulfils and embodies his conception;
                    his own voice is his cunningly modulated instrument; his own face the canvas whereon he portrays the
                    various expressions of his passion; his own frame the mould in which <pb n="16" xml:id="VAB7399-022"
                    /> he casts the images of beauty and majesty that fill his brain; and whereas the painter and
                    sculptor may select, of all possible attitudes, occupations, and expressions, the most favourable to
                    the beautiful effect they desire to produce and fix, and bid it so remain fixed for ever, the actor
                    must live and move through a temporary existence of poetry and passion, and preserve throughout its
                    duration that ideal grace and dignity, of which the canvas and the marble give but a silent and
                    motionless image. And yet it is an art that requires no study worthy of the name: it creates
                    nothing—it perpetuates nothing; to its professors, whose personal qualifications form half their
                    merit, is justly given the meed of personal admiration, and the reward of contemporaneous popularity
                    is well bestowed on those whose labour consists in exciting momentary emotion. Their most
                    persevering and successful efforts can only benefit, by a passionate pleasure of at most a few
                    years' duration, the play-going public of their own immediate day, and they are fitly <pb n="17"
                        xml:id="VAB7399-023"/> recompensed with money and applause, to whom may not justly belong the
                    rapture of creation, the glory of patient and protracted toil, and the love and honour of grateful
                    posterity.</p>

                    <hi>MACBETH</hi>. <lb/> No. I.</head>
                <p>MACBETH is pre-eminently the Drama of Con- science. It is the most wonderful history of temptation,
                    in its various agency upon the human soul, that is to be found in the universal range of imaginative
                    literature. Viewed in this aspect, the solemn march of the tragedy becomes awful, and its
                    development a personal appeal, of the profoundest nature, to every one who considers it with that
                    serious attention that its excellence as a work of art alone entitles :it to command. To every human
                    soul it tells the story of its own experience, rendered indeed <pb n="22" xml:id="VAB7399-028"/>
                    more impressive by the sublime poetry in which it is uttered; but it is the truth itself, and not
                    the form in which is it presented, which makes the force of its appeal; and the terrible truth with
                    which the insidious approach of temptation — its imperceptible advances, its gradual progress, its
                    clinging pertinacity, its recurring importunity, its prevailing fascination, its bewildering
                    sophistry, its pitiless tenacity, its imperious tyranny, and its final hideous triumph over the
                    moral sense — is delineated, that makes <hi rend="i">Macbeth</hi> the grandest of all poetical
                    lessons, the most powerful of all purely fictitious moralities, the most solemn of all lay sermons
                    drawn from the text of human nature.</p>
                <p>In a small pamphlet, written many years ago by Mr. John Kemble, upon the subject of the character of
                    Macbeth, and which now survives as a mere curiosity of literature, he defends with considerable
                    warmth the hero of the play from a charge of cowardice, brought against him either by Malone or
                    Steevens in some of their strictures on the tragedy.</p>


                <pb n="23" xml:id="VAB7399-029"/>
                <p>This charge appeared to me singular, as it would never have occurred to me that there could be two
                    opinions upon the subject of the personal prowess of the soldier; who comes before us heralded by
                    the martial title of Bellona's bridegroom, and wearing the garland of a double victory. But, in
                    treating his view of the question, Mr. Kemble dwells, with extreme and just admiration, upon the
                    skill with which Shakespeare has thrown all the other characters into a shadowy background, in order
                    to bring out with redoubled brilliancy the form of Macbeth when it is first presented to us. Banquo,
                    his fellow in fight and coadjutor in conquest, shares both the dangers and rewards of his
                    expedition; and yet it is the figure of Macbeth which stands out prominently in the van of the
                    battle so finely described by Rosse—it is he whom the king selects as heir to the dignities of the
                    treacherous Thane of Cawdor—it is to meet him that the withered ambassadresses of the powers of
                    darkness float through the lurid twilight of the battle day; and when the throb <pb n="24"
                        xml:id="VAB7399-030"/> of the distant drum is heard across the blasted heath, among the host
                    whose tread it times over the gloomy expanse, the approach of one man alone is greeted by the
                    infernal ministers. Their appointed prey draws near, and, with the presentiment of their dire
                    victory over the victor, they exclaim, "A drum! a drum! Macbeth doth come!"</p>
                <p>Marshalled with triumphant strains of warlike melody; paged at the heels by his victorious soldiers;
                    surrounded by their brave and noble leaders, himself the leader of them all; flushed with success
                    and crowned with triumph —Macbeth stands before us; and the shaggy brown heath seems illuminated
                    around him with the keen glitter of arms, the waving of bright banners, and broad tartan folds, and
                    the light that emanates from, and surrounds as with a dazzling halo, the face and form of a heroic
                    man in the hour of his success.</p>
                <p>Wonderful indeed, in execution as in conception, is this brilliant image of warlike glory! But how
                    much more wonderful, in conception <pb n="25" xml:id="VAB7399-031"/> as in execution, is that
                    representation of moral power which Shakespeare has placed beside it in the character of Banquo!
                    Masterly as is the splendour shed around, and by, the prominent figure on the canvas, the solemn
                    grace and dignity of the one standing in the shadow behind it is more remarkable still. How with
                    almost the first words that he speaks the majesty of right asserts itself over that of might, and
                    the serene power of a steadfast soul sheds forth a radiance which eclipses the glare of mere martial
                    glory, as the clear moonlight spreads itself above and beyond the flaring of ten thousand
                    torches.</p>
                <p>When the unearthly forms and greeting of the witches have arrested the attention of the warriors, and
                    to the amazement excited in both of them is added, in the breast of one, the first shuddering thrill
                    of a guilty thought which betrays itself in the start with which he receives prophecies which to the
                    ear of Banquo seem only as "things that do sound so fair;" Macbeth has already accepted the first
                    inspiration of <pb n="26" xml:id="VAB7399-032"/> guilt—the evil within his heart has quickened and
                    stirred at the greeting of the visible agents of evil, and he is already sin-struck and terror-
                    struck at their first utterance; but like a radiant shield, such as we read of in old magic stories,
                    of virtue to protect its bearer from the devil's assault, the clear integrity of Banquo's soul
                    remains unsullied by the serpent's breath, and, while accepting all the wonder of the encounter, he
                    feels none of the dismay which shakes the spirit of Macbeth- <quote rend="blockquote"><lg>
                            <l>"Good sir, why do you start, and seem to fear</l>
                            <l>Things that do sound so fair ?"</l>
                        </lg></quote>
                </p>
                <p>The fair sound has conveyed no foul sense to his perception, but, incited rather by the fear and
                    bewilderment of his usually dauntless companion than by any misgiving of his own (which indeed his
                    calm and measured adjuration shows him to be free from), he turns to these mysterious oracles, and,
                    with that authority before which the devils of old trembled and dispossessed themselves of their
                    prey, he questions, and they reply. Mark the power— <pb n="27" xml:id="VAB7399-033"/> higher than
                    any, save that of God, from which it directly emanates—of the intrepid utterance of an upright human
                    soul— <quote rend="blockquote">"In the name of <hi rend="i">Truth</hi>, are ye fantastical?"</quote>
                    At that solemn appeal, does one not see hell's agents start and cower like the foul toad touched by
                    the celestial spear? How pales the glitter of the hero of the battle-field before the steadfast
                    shining of this honest man, when to his sacred summons the subject ministers of hell reply true
                    oracles, though uttered by lying lips—sincere homage, such as was rendered on the fields of
                    Palestine by the defeated powers of darkness, to the divine virtue that overthrew them-such as for
                    ever unwilling evil pays to the good which predominates over it, the everlasting subjection of hell
                    to heaven. <quote rend="blockquote">"Hail, hail, hail —lesser than Macbeth, but greater,"</quote>
                    etc. And now the confused and troubled workings of Macbeth's mind pour themselves forth in rapid
                    questions, urging one upon another the evident obstacles which ctowd, faster than his <pb n="28"
                        xml:id="VAB7399-034"/> eager thought can, beat them aside, between him and the bait held forth
                    to his ambitious desires; but to <hi rend="i">his</hi> challenge, made, not in the name or spirit of
                    truth, but at the suggestion of the grasping devil which is fast growing into entire possession of
                    his heart, no answer is vouchsafed; the witches vanish, leaving the words of impotent and passionate
                    command to fall upon the empty air. The reply to his vehement questioning has already been made; he
                    has <hi rend="i">seen</hi>, at one glimpse, in the very darkest depths of his imagination, <hi
                        rend="i">how</hi> the things foretold <hi rend="i">may</hi> be, and to that fatal answer alone
                    is he left by the silence of those whose mission to him is thenceforth fully accomplished. Twice
                    does he endeavour to draw from Banquo some comment other than that of mere astonishment upon the
                    fortunes thus foretold them :— <quote rend="blockquote"><lg>
                            <l rend="center">"Your children shall be kings?</l>
                            <l rend="center">You shall be king ?</l>
                            <l rend="center">And Thane of Cawdor too—went it not so ?</l>
                            <l rend="center">To the self-same tune and words ?"</l>
                        </lg></quote></p>
                <p>But the careless answers of Banquo uncon- <pb n="29" xml:id="VAB7399-035"/>sciously evade the snare;
                    and it is not until the arrival of Rosse, and his ceremonious greeting of Macbeth by his new dignity
                    of Thane of Cawdor, that Banquo's exclamation of— <quote rend="blockquote">"What! can the devil
                        speak true?"</quote> proves at once that he had hitherto attached no importance to the prophecy
                    of the witches, and that, now that its partial fulfilment compelled him to do so, he unhesitatingly
                    pronounces the agency through which their foreknowledge had reached them to be evil. Most
                    significant indeed is the direct, rapid, unhesitating intuition by which the one mind instantly
                    repels the approach of evil, pronouncing it at once to be so, compared with the troubled, perplexed,
                    imperfect process, half mental, half moral, by which the other labours to strangle within himself
                    the pleadings of his better angel:— <quote rend="blockquote"><lg>
                            <l rend="center">"This supernatural soliciting cannot be ill-</l>
                            <l rend="center">Cannot be good! If ill,</l>
                            <l rend="center">Why hath it given me earnest of success</l>
                            <l rend="center">Beginning in a truth? I am Thane of Cawdor."</l>
                        </lg></quote></p>
                <p>The devil's own logic: the inference of <pb n="30" xml:id="VAB7399-036"/> right drawn from the
                    successful issue, the seal whose stamp, whether false or genuine, still satisfies the world of the
                    validity of every deed to which it is appended. Wiser than all the wisdom that ever was elaborated
                    by human intellect, brighter than any light that ever yet was obtained by process of human thought,
                    juster and more unerringly infallible than any scientific deduction ever produced by the acutest
                    human logic, is the simple instinct of good and evil in the soul that loves the one and hates the
                    other. Like those fine perceptions by which certain delicate and powerful organisations detect with
                    amazing accuracy the hidden proximity of certain sympathetic or antipathetic existences, so the
                    moral sensibility of the true soul recoils at once from the antagonistic principles which it detects
                    with electric rapidity and certainty, leaving the intellect to toil after and discover, discriminate
                    and describe, the cause of the unutterable instantaneous revulsion.</p>
                <p>Having now not only determined the nature of the visitation they have received, but become <pb n="31"
                        xml:id="VAB7399-037"/> observant of the absorbed and distracted demeanour and countenance of
                    Macbeth, for which he at first accounted guilelessly according to his wont, by the mere fact of
                    natural astonishment at the witches' prophecy and its fulfilment, together with the uneasy novelty
                    of his lately acquired dignities- <quote rend="blockquote"><lg>
                            <l rend="center">"Look how our partner's rapt,</l>
                            <l rend="center">New honours come upon him like our new garments,"</l>
                        </lg></quote> etc. Banquo is called upon by Macbeth directly for some expression of his own
                    opinion of these mysterious events, and the impression they have made on his mind. <quote>"Do you
                        not hope your children <hi rend="i">shall</hi> be kings,"</quote> etc.</p>
                <p>He answers with that solemn warning, almost approaching to a rebuke of the evil suggestion that he
                    now for the first time perceives invading his companion's mind:— <quote rend="blockquote"><lg>
                            <l rend="center">"That trusted home</l>
                            <l rend="center">Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,"</l>
                        </lg></quote> etc.</p>
                <p>It is not a little remarkable that, having in the first instance expressed so strongly his <pb n="32"
                        xml:id="VAB7399-038"/> surprise at finding a truth among the progeny of the father of lies, and
                    uttered that fine instinctive exclamation,<quote rend="blockquote"> "What! can the devil speak
                        true?"</quote> Banquo, in the final deliberate expression of his opinion to Macbeth upon the
                    subject of the witches' prophecy, warns him against the semblance of truth, that combined with his
                    own treacherous infirmity, is strengthening the temptation by which his whole soul is being
                    searched:— <quote rend="blockquote"><lg>
                            <l rend="center">"But it is strange,</l>
                            <l rend="center">And oftentimes to win us to our harm</l>
                            <l rend="center">The instruments of darkness tell us truths,"</l>
                        </lg></quote> etc.</p>
                <p>Although these two passages may appear at first to involve a contradiction almost, it seems to me
                    that both the sentiments—the brave, sudden denial of any kindred between the devil and truth, and
                    the subsequent admission of the awful mystery by which truth sometimes is permitted to be a
                    two-edged weapon in the armoury of hell—are eminently characteristic of the same mind. Obliged to
                    confess that the devil does speak true sometimes, Banquo, <pb n="33" xml:id="VAB7399-039"/>
                    nevertheless, can only admit that he does so for an evil purpose, and this passage is one of
                    innumerable proofs of the general coherence, in spite of apparent discrepancy, in Shakespeare's
                    delineations of character. The same soul of the one man may, with no inconsistency but what is
                    perfectly compatible with spiritual harmony, utter both the sentiments: the one on impulse, the
                    other on reflection.</p>
                <p>Here, for the first time, Macbeth encounters the barrier of that uncompromising spirit, that
                    sovereignty of nature, which as he afterwards himself acknowledges <quote rend="blockquote">"would
                        be feared,"</quote> and which he does fear and hate accordingly, more and more savagely and
                    bitterly, till detestation of him as his natural superior, terror of him as the possible avenger of
                    blood, and envy of him as the future father of a line of kings, fill up the measure of his murderous
                    ill-will, and thrust him upon the determination of Banquo's assassination; and when, in the midst of
                    his royal banquet-hall, filled with hollow-hearted feasting and ominous revelry and splendour, his
                    con- <pb n="34" xml:id="VAB7399-040"/> science conjures up the hideous image of the missing guest,
                    whose health he invokes with lips white with terror, while he knows that his gashed and mangled
                    corpse is lying stark under the midnight rain; surely it is again with this solemn warning, uttered
                    in vain to stay his soul from the perdition yawning for it in the first hour of their joint
                    temptation,— <quote rend="blockquote"><lg>
                            <l>"That trusted home</l>
                            <l>Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,"</l>
                        </lg></quote> etc. that the dead lips appear to move, and the dead eyes are sadly fixed on him,
                    and the heavy locks, dripping with gore, are shaken in silent intolerable rebuke.</p>
                <p>In the meeting with the kind-hearted old king, the loyal professions of the two generals are, as
                    might be expected, precisely in inverse ratio to their sincere devotion to Duncan. Banquo answers in
                    a few simple words the affectionate demonstration of his sovereign, while Macbeth, with his whole
                    mind churning round and round like some black whirlpool the murderous but yet unformed designs <pb
                        n="35" xml:id="VAB7399-041"/> which have taken possession of it, utters his hollow professions
                    of attachment in terms of infinitely greater warmth and devotion. On the nomination of the king's
                    eldest son to the dignity of Prince of Cumberland, the bloody task which he had already proposed to
                    himself is in an instant doubled on his hands; and instantly, without any of his late misgivings, he
                    deals in imagination with the second human life that intercepts his direct attainment of the crown.
                    This short soliloquy of his ends with some lines which are not more remarkable for the power with
                    which they exhibit the confused and dark heavings of his stormy thoughts than for being the first of
                    three similar adjurations, of various expression, but almost equal poetic beauty:— <quote
                        rend="blockquote"><lg>
                            <l rend="center">"Stars, hide your fires!</l>
                            <l rend="center">Let not light see my black and deep desires!</l>
                            <l rend="center">The eye wink at the hand, yet let that be</l>
                            <l rend="center">Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see!"</l>
                        </lg></quote></p>
                <p>In the very next scene, we have the invocation to darkness with which Lady Macbeth <pb n="36"
                        xml:id="VAB7399-042"/> closes her terrible dedication of herself to its ruling powers:— <quote
                        rend="blockquote"><lg>
                            <l rend="center">"Come, thick night,</l>
                            <l rend="center">And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,"</l>
                        </lg></quote> etc. What can be finer than this peculiar use of the word fall; suggestive not
                    only of blackness, but of that funereal blackness in which death is folded up; an image conveying at
                    once absence of light and of life?— <quote rend="blockquote"><lg>
                            <l rend="center">"That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,</l>
                            <l rend="center">Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,</l>

                        </lg></quote> etc.</p>
                <p>The third of these murderous adjurations to the powers of nature for their complicity is uttered by
                    Macbeth in the scene preceding the banquet, when, having contrived the mode of Banquo's death, he
                    apostrophises the approaching night thus:— <quote rend="blockquote"><lg>
                            <l rend="center">"Come, sealing night!</l>
                            <l rend="center">Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day,"</l>
                        </lg></quote> etc. (what an exquisite grace and beauty there is in this wonderful line!) <pb
                        n="37" xml:id="VAB7399-043"/>
                    <quote rend="blockquote"><lg>

                <p>Who but Shakespeare would thus have multiplied expressions of the very same idea with such wonderful
                    variety of power and beauty in each of them?—images at once so similar in their general character,
                    and so exquisitely different in their particular form. This last quoted passage precedes lines which
                    appear to me incomparable in harmony of sound and in the perfect beauty of their imagery: lines on
                    which the tongue dwells, which linger on the ear with a charm enhanced by the dark horror of the
                    speaker's purpose in uttering them, and which remind one of the fatal fascination of the Gorgon's
                    beauty, as it lies in its frame of writhing reptiles, terrible and lovely at once to the beholder:—
                        <quote rend="blockquote"><lg>
                            <l rend="center">"Light thickens, and the crow</l>
                            <l rend="center">Makes wing to the rooky wood."</l>
                        </lg></quote> We see the violet-coloured sky, we feel the soft intermitting wind of evening, we
                    hear the <pb n="38" xml:id="VAB7399-044"/> solemn lullaby of the dark fir-forest; the homeward
                    flight of the bird suggests the sweetest images of rest and peace; and, coupled and contrasting with
                    the gradual falling of the dim veil of twilight over the placid face of nature, the remote horror
                        <quote>"of the deed of fearful note"</quote> about to desecrate the solemn repose of the
                    approaching night, gives to these harmonious and lovely lines a wonderful effect of mingled beauty
                    and terror. The combination of vowels in this line will not escape the ear of a nice observer of the
                    melody of our language: the "rooky wood" is a specimen of a happiness of a sound not so frequent
                    perhaps in Shakespeare as in Milton, who was a greater master of the melody of words.</p>
                <p>To return to Banquo: in the scene where he and Macbeth are received with such overflowing
                    demonstrations of gratitude by Duncan, we have already observed he speaks but little; only once
                    indeed, when in answer to the king's exclamation, <quote rend="center">"Let me unfold thee, and hold
                        thee to my heart,"</quote> he simply replies— <pb n="39" xml:id="VAB7399-045"/>
                    <quote rend="center">"There if I grow, the harvest is your own."</quote> But while Macbeth is
                    rapidly revolving in his mind the new difficulties thrown in the way of his ambition, and devising
                    new crimes to overleap lest he fall down upon them, we are left to imagine Banquo as dilating upon
                    his achievements to the king, and finding in his praise the eloquence that had failed him in the
                    professions of his own honest loyalty; for no sooner had Macbeth departed to announce the king's
                    approach to his wife, than Duncan answers to the words spoken aside to him by Banquo:— <quote
                        rend="blockquote"><lg>
                            <l rend="center">"True, worthy Banquo, he is full so valiant,</l>
                            <l rend="center">And in his praises I am fed."</l>
                        </lg></quote></p>
                <p>This slight indication of the generous disposition that usually lives in holy alliance with integrity
                    and truth is a specimen of that infinite virtue which pervades all Shakespeare's works, the effect
                    of which is felt in the moral harmony of the whole, even by those who overlook the wonderful details
                    by which the general result is produced. Most fitting is it, too, that Banquo, should speak the
                    delicious lines by which the <pb n="40" xml:id="VAB7399-046"/> pleasant seat of Macbeth's castle is
                    brought so vividly to our senses. The man of temperate passions and calm mind is the devout observer
                    of nature; and thus it is that, in the grave soldier's mouth, the notice of the habits of the guest
                    of summer, <quote>"the temple-haunting martlet,"</quote> is an appropriate beauty of profound
                    significance. Here again are lines whose intrinsic exquisiteness is keenly enhanced by the impending
                    doom which hovers over the kind old king. With a heart overflowing with joy for the success of his
                    arms, and gratitude towards his victorious generals, Duncan stands inhaling the serene summer air,
                    receiving none but sensations of the most pleasurable exhilaration on the threshold of his
                    slaughter-house. The sunny breezy eminence before the hospitable castle gate of his devoted kinsman
                    and subject betrays no glimpse to his delighted spirits of the glimmering midnight chamber, where,
                    between his drunken grooms and his devil-driven assassin, with none to hear his stifled cries for
                    help but the female fiend who <pb n="41" xml:id="VAB7399-047"/>SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY OF MACBETH. 41
                    listens by the darkened door, his life-blood is to ooze away before the daylight again strikes at
                    the portal by which he now stands rejoicing in the ruddy glow of its departure. Banquo next meets
                    us, as the dark climax is just at hand; the heavens, obedient to the invocation of guilt, have shut
                    their eyes, unwilling to behold the perpetration of the crime about to be committed. The good old
                    king has retired to rest in unusual satisfaction, his host and hostess have made their last lying
                    demonstrations, and are gone to the secret councils of the chamber where they lie in wait. Banquo,
                    unwilling to yield himself to the sleep which treacherously presents to his mind, through the
                    disturbed agency of dreams, the temptation so sternly repelled by his waking thoughts, is about to
                    withdraw, supposing himself the last of all who wake in the castle; for on meeting Macbeth he
                    expresses astonishment that he is not yet abed. How beautiful is the prayer with which he fortifies
                    himself against the nightly visitation of his soul's enemy!— <pb n="42" xml:id="VAB7399-048"/>
                    <quote rend="blockquote"><lg>
                            <l rend="center">"Merciful powers,</l>
                            <l rend="center">Restrain in me the accursed thoughts that nature</l>

                        </lg></quote></p>
                <p>Further on the explanation of these lines is found in the brief conversation that follows between
                    himself and Macbeth when he says: <quote>"I dreamed last night of the three weird sisters;"</quote>
                    and it is against a similar visitation of the powers of darkness during his helpless hours of
                    slumber that he prays to be defended before surrendering himself to the heavy summons that
                        <quote>"lies like lead upon him."</quote> It is remarkable that Banquo, though his temptation
                    assails him from without in dreams of the infernal prophetesses, prays to be delivered not from
                    them, but from the <quote>"accursed thoughts that nature gives way to in repose;"</quote> referring,
                    and justly, his danger to the complicity with evil in his own nature—that noble nature of which
                    Macbeth speaks as sovereignly virtuous, but of which the mortal infirmity is thus confessed by him
                    who best knows its treacherous weakness.</p>


                <pb n="43" xml:id="VAB7399-049"/>
                <p>Banquo next appears in the midst of the hideous uproar consequent upon Duncan's murder, when the
                    vaulted chambers of the castle ring with Macduff's cries to the dead man's sleeping sons—when every
                    door bursts open as with the sweeping of a whirlwind, and half-naked forms, and faces white with
                    sudden terror, lean from every gallery overlooking the great hall, into which pour, like the
                    in-rushing ridges of the tide, the scared and staring denizens of the upper chambers; while along
                    remote corridors echoes the sound of hurrying feet, and inarticulate cries of terror are prolonged
                    through dismal distant passages, and the flare of sudden torches flashes above and below, making the
                    intermediate darkness blacker; and the great stone fortress seems to reel from base to battlement
                    with the horror that has seized like a frenzy on all its inmates. From the midst of this appalling
                    tumult rises the calm voice of the man who remembers that he <quote>"stands in the great hand of
                        God,"</quote> and thence confronts the furious elements of <pb n="44" xml:id="VAB7399-050"/>
                    human passion surging and swaying before him.</p>
                <p>Banquo stands in the hall of Macbeth's castle, in that sudden surprise of dreadful circumstances
                    alone master of his soul, alone able to appeal to the All-seeing Judge of human events, alone able
                    to advise the actions and guide the counsels of the passion-shaken men around him—a wonderful image
                    of steadfastness in that tremendous chaos of universal dismay and doubt and terror.</p>
                <p>This is the last individual and characteristic manifestation of the man. The inevitable conviction of
                    Macbeth's crime, and equally inevitable conviction of the probable truth of the promised royalty of
                    his own children, are the only two important utterances of his that succeed, and these are followed
                    so immediately by his own death that the regretful condemnation of the guilty man, once the object
                    of his affectionate admiration, cannot assume the bitterer character of personal detestation, or the
                    reluctant admission of the truth of the <pb n="45" xml:id="VAB7399-051"/> infernal prophecy beguile
                    him into dangerous speculations as to the manner of its fulfilment. The noble integrity of the
                    character is unimpaired to the last.</p>

                <head rend="center">NOTES ON MACBETH. No. II.</head>
                <p>IN a momentary absence of memory, a friend of mine once suggested to me the idea that Lady Macbeth's
                    exclamation in the sleeping scene—<quote>"The Thane of Fife had a wife; where is she
                    now?"</quote>—was a conscience-stricken reference to herself, and her own lost condition. Of course,
                    the hypothesis was immediately abandoned on the recollection that Macbeth never had been Thane of
                    Fife, and that it is Macduff's slaughtered mate Lady Macbeth is dreaming of,—the poor dame who, with
                    all her pretty chickens, was destroyed at one fell swoop by Macbeth's murderous cruelty.</p>
                <p>The conversation that ensued led me to reflect on this mistaken suggestion of my friend <pb n="50"
                        xml:id="VAB7399-056"/> as involving a much deeper mistake—an important psychological error. Not
                    only the fact was not as suggested, but a fact of that nature, —viz. an accusing return upon herself
                    by Lady Macbeth—could not be. Lady Macbeth, even in her sleep, has no qualms of conscience; her
                    remorse takes none of the tenderer forms akin to repentance, nor the weaker ones allied to fear,
                    from the pursuit of which the tortured soul, seeking where to hide itself, not seldom escapes into
                    the boundless wilderness of madness.</p>
                <p>A very able article, published some years ago in the <hi rend="i">National Review</hi>, on the
                    character of Lady Macbeth, insists much upon an opinion that she died of remorse, as some palliation
                    of her crimes, and mitigation of our detestation of them. That she died of <hi rend="i"
                        >wickedness</hi> would be, I think, a juster verdict. Remorse is consciousness of guilt,—often,
                    indeed, no more akin to saving contrition than the faith of devils, who tremble and believe, is to
                    saving faith,— but still consciousness of guilt: and that I <pb n="51" xml:id="VAB7399-057"/> think
                    Lady Macbeth never had; though the <hi rend="i">unrecognised</hi> pressure of her great guilt killed
                    her. I think her life was destroyed by sin as by a disease of which she was unconscious, and that
                    she died of a broken heart, while the impenetrable resolution of her will remained unbowed. The
                    spirit was willing, but the flesh was weak; the body can sin but so much, and survive; and other
                    deadly passions besides those of violence and sensuality can wear away its fine tissues, and
                    undermine its wonderful fabric. The woman's mortal frame succumbed to the tremendous weight of sin
                    and suffering which her immortal soul had power to sustain; and, having destroyed its temporal house
                    of earthly sojourn, that soul, unexhausted by its wickedness, went forth into its new abode of
                    eternity.</p>
                <p>The nature of Lady Macbeth, even when prostrated in sleep before the Supreme Avenger, whom she keeps
                    at bay during her conscious hours by the exercise of her indomitable will and resolute power of
                    purpose, is incapable of <pb n="52" xml:id="VAB7399-058"/> any salutary spasm of moral anguish, or
                    hopeful paroxysm of mental horror. The irreparable is still to her the <hi rend="i"
                        >un</hi>deplorable—<quote>"What's done cannot be undone:"</quote>—and her slumbering eyes see no
                    more ghosts than her watchful waking ones believe in: <quote>"I tell you yet again, Banquo is
                        buried; he cannot come out of his grave."</quote> Never, even in her dreams, does any gracious
                    sorrow smite from her stony heart the blessed brine of tears that wash away sin; never, even in her
                    dreams, do the avenging furies lash her through purgatorial flames that burn away guilt; and the
                    dreary but undismayed desolation in which her spirit abides for ever, is quite other than that
                    darkness, however deep, which the soul acknowledges, and whence it may yet behold the breaking of a
                    dawn shining far off from round the mercy-seat.</p>
                <p>The nightmare of a butcher (could a butcher deserve to be so visited for the unhappy necessity of his
                    calling) is more akin to the hauntings which beset the woman who has strangled conscience and all
                    her brood of pleading angels, <pb n="53" xml:id="VAB7399-059"/> ard deliberately armed her heart and
                    mind against all those suggestions of beauty or fear which succour the vacillating sense of right in
                    the human soul with promptings less imperative than those of conscience, but of fine subtle power
                    sometimes to supplement her law. Justly is she haunted by <quote>"blood,"</quote> who, in the hour
                    of her atrocities, exclaims to her partner, when his appalled imagination reddens the whole ocean
                    with the bloody hand he seeks to cleanse, <quote>"A little water clears us of this deed!"</quote>
                    Therefore, blood — the feeling of blood, the sight of blood, the smell of blood — is the one ignoble
                    hideous retribution which has dominion over her. Intruding a moral element of which she is conscious
                    into Lady Macbeth's punishment is a capital error, because her punishment, in its very essence,
                    consists in her infinite distance from all such influences. Macbeth, to the very end, may weep and
                    wring his hands, and tear his hair and gnash his teeth, and bewail the lost estate of his soul,
                    though with him too the dreadful process is <pb n="54" xml:id="VAB7399-060"/> one of gradual
                    induration. For he retains the unutterable consciousness of a soul; he has a perception of having
                    sinned, of being fallen, of having wandered, of being lost; and so he cries to his physician for a
                    remedy for that <quote>"wounded spirit,"</quote> heavier to bear than all other conceivable sorrow;
                    and utters, in words bitterer than death, the doom of his own deserted, despised, dreaded, and
                    detested old age. He may be visited to the end by those noble pangs which bear witness to the
                    preeminent nobility of the nature he has desecrated, and suggest a re-ascension, even from the
                    bottom of that dread abyss into which he has fallen, but from the depths of which he yet beholds the
                    everlasting light which gives him consciousness of its darkness. But <hi rend="i">she</hi> may none
                    of this: she may but feel and see and smell blood; and wonder at the unquenched stream that she
                    still wades in—<quote>"Who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in
                    him?"</quote>—and fly, hunted through the nights by that <quote>"knocking at the door,"</quote>
                    which <pb n="55" xml:id="VAB7399-061"/> beats the wearied life at last out of her stony heart and
                    seared, impenetrable brain.</p>
                <p>I once read a pamphlet that made a very strong impression upon me, on the subject of the possible
                    annihilation of the human soul as the consequence of sin. The author, supposing goodness to be
                    nearness to God, and this to be the cause of vitality in the soul, suggested the idea of a gradual,
                    voluntary departure from God, which should cause the gradual darkening and final utter extinction of
                    the spirit. I confess that this theory of spiritual self-extinction through sin seemed to me a
                    thousand times more appalling than the most terrific vision of everlasting torment.</p>
                <p>Taking the view I do of Lady Macbeth's character, I cannot accept the idea (held, I believe, by her
                    great representative, Mrs. Siddons) that in the banquet scene the ghost of Banquo, which appears to
                    Macbeth, is seen at the same time by his wife, but that, in consequence of her greater command over
                    herself, she not only exhibits no sign of perceiving the <pb n="56" xml:id="VAB7399-062"/>
                    apparition, but can, with its hideous form and gesture within a few feet of her, rail at Macbeth in
                    that language of scathing irony which, combined with his own terror, elicits from him the
                    incoherent, and yet too dangerously significant appeals with which he agonises her and amazes the
                    court.</p>
                <p>To this supposition I must again object that Lady Macbeth is no ghost-seer. She is not of the
                    temperament that admits of such impressions; she is incapable of supernatural terror in proportion
                    as she is incapable of spiritual influences; devils do not visibly tempt, nor angels visibly
                    minister to her; and, moreover, I hold that, as to have seen Banquo's ghost at the banqueting-table
                    would have been contrary to <hi rend="i">her</hi> nature, to have done so and persisted in her
                    fierce mocking of her husband's terror, would have been impossible to human nature. The hypothesis
                    makes Lady Macbeth a monster, and there is no such thing in all Shakespeare's plays. That she is
                    godless, and ruthless in the pursuit of the objects of her ambition, <pb n="57" xml:id="VAB7399-063"
                    /> does not make her such. Many men have been so; and she is that unusual and unamiable (but not
                    altogether unnatural) creature, a masculine woman, in the only real significance of that much
                    misapplied epithet.</p>
                <p>Lady Macbeth was this; she possessed the qualities which generally characterise men, and not
                    women—energy, decision, daring, unscrupulousness; a deficiency of imagination, a great preponderance
                    of the positive and practical mental elements; a powerful and rapid appreciation of what each
                    exigency of circumstance demanded, and the coolness and resolution necessary for its immediate
                    execution. Lady Macbeth's character has more of the essentially manly nature in it than that of
                    Macbeth. The absence of imagination, together with a certain obtuseness of the nervous system, is
                    the condition that goes to produce that rare quality —physical courage—which she possessed in a
                    pre-eminent degree. This combination of deficiencies is seldom found in men, infinitely seldomer in
                    women: and its invariable result is <pb n="58" xml:id="VAB7399-064"/> insensibility to many
                    things—among others, insensibility to danger. Lady Macbeth was not so bloody as her husband, for she
                    was by no means equally liable to fear; she would not have hesitated a moment to commit any crime
                    that she considered necessary for her purposes, but she would always have known what were and what
                    were not necessary crimes. We find it difficult to imagine that, if <hi rend="i">she</hi> had
                    undertaken the murder of Banquo and Fleance, the latter would have been allowed to escape, and
                    impossible to conceive that she would have ordered the useless and impolitic slaughter of Macduff's
                    family and followers, after he had fled to England, from a mere rabid movement of impotent hatred
                    and apprehension. She was never made savage by remorse, or cruel by terror.</p>
                <p>There is nothing that seems to me more false than the common estimate of cruelty, as connected with
                    the details of crime. Could the annals and statistics of murder be made to show the prevailing
                    temper under which the most atrocious crimes have been committed, <pb n="59" xml:id="VAB7399-065"/>
                    there is little doubt that those which present the most revolting circumstances of cruelty would be
                    found to have been perpetrated by men of more, rather than less, nervous sensibility, or
                    irritability, than the average; for it is precisely in such organisations that hatred, horror, fear,
                    remorse, dismay, and a certain blind bloodthirsty rage, combine under evil excitement to produce
                    that species of delirium under the influence of which, as of some infernal ecstasy, the most
                    horrible atrocities are perpetrated.</p>
                <p>Lady Macbeth was of far too powerful an organisation to be liable to the frenzy of mingled emotions
                    by which her wretched husband is assailed; and when, in the very first hour of her miserable
                    exaltation, she perceives that the ashes of the Dead Sea are to be henceforth her daily bread, when
                    the crown is placed upon her brow, and she feels that the <quote>"golden round"</quote> is lined
                    with red-hot iron, she accepts the dismal truth with one glance of steady recognition:— <pb n="60"

                    <quote rend="blockquote"><lg>

                            <l>Beholding all her own mischance,</l>
                            <l>Mute-with a glassy countenance."</l>
                        </lg></quote> She looks down the dreary vista of the coming years, and, having admitted that
                        <quote>"naught's had, all's spent,"</quote> dismisses her fate, without further comment, from
                    consideration, and applies herself forthwith to encourage, cheer, and succour, with the support of
                    her superior strength, the finer yet feebler spirit of her husband.</p>
                <p>In denying to Lady Macbeth all the peculiar sensibilities of her sex (for they are all included in
                    its pre-eminent characteristic—the maternal instinct—and there is no doubt that the illustration of
                    the quality of her resolution by the assertion that she would have dashed her baby's brains out, if
                    she had sworn to do it, is no mere figure of speech, but very certain earnest) Shakespeare has not
                    divested her of natural feeling to the degree of placing her without the pale of our common
                    humanity. Her husband shrank from the idea of her bearing <hi rend="i">women</hi> like herself, but
                    not <quote>"males,"</quote> of <pb n="61" xml:id="VAB7399-067"/> whom he thought her a fit mother;
                    and she retains enough of the nature of mankind, if not of womankind, to bring her within the circle
                    of our toleration, and make us accept her as <hi rend="i">possible</hi>. Thus the solitary positive
                    instance of her sensibility has nothing especially feminine about it. Her momentary relenting in the
                    act of stabbing Duncan, because he resembled her father as lie slept, is a touch of human tenderness
                    by which most men might be overcome, while the smearing her hands in the warm gore of the
                    slaughtered old man is an act of physical insensibility which not one woman out of a thousand would
                    have had nerve or stomach for.</p>
                <p>That Shakespeare never imagined Banquo's ghost to be visible to Lady Macbeth in the banquet-hall
                    seems to me abundantly proved (however inferentially) by the mode in which he has represented such
                    apparitions as affecting all the men who in his dramas are subjected to this supreme test of
                    courage,—good men, whose minds are undisturbed by remorse; brave men, soldiers, prepared to face
                    danger in every shape <pb n="62" xml:id="VAB7399-068"/> ("but that") in which they may be called
                    upon to meet it. For instance, take the demeanour of Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo, throughout
                    the scene so finely expressive of their terror and dismay at the appearance of the ghost, and in
                    which the climax is their precipitating themselves together towards the object of their horror,
                    striking at it with their partisans; a wonderful representation of the effect of fear upon creatures
                    of a naturally courageous constitution, which Shakespeare has reproduced in the ecstasy of terror
                    with which Macbeth himself finally rushes upon the terrible vision which unmans him, and drives it
                    from before him with frantic outcries and despairing gestures.</p>
                <p>It is no infrequent exhibition of fear in a courageous boy to fly at and strike the object of his
                    dismay—a sort of instinctive method of ascertaining its nature, and so disarming its terrors; and
                    these men are represented by Shakespeare as thus expressing the utmost impulse of a fear, to the
                    intensity of which their <pb n="63" xml:id="VAB7399-069"/> words bear ample witness. Horatio says:
                        <quote>"It harrows me with fear and wonder."</quote> Bernardo says to him: <quote>"How now,
                        Horatio! you tremble and turn pale!"</quote> and Horatio, describing the vision and its effect
                    upon himself and his companions, says to Hamlet— <quote rend="blockquote"><lg>
                            <l rend="center ti-8">"Thrice he walk'd</l>
                            <l rend="center">By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes</l>

                        </lg></quote> etc. And it must be remembered that nothing in itself hideous or revolting
                    appeared to these men—nothing but the image of the dead King of Denmark, familiar to them in the
                    majestic sweetness of its countenance and bearing, and courteous and friendly in its gestures; and
                    yet it fills them with unutterable terror. When the same vision appears to Hamlet—a young man with
                    the noble spirit of a prince, a conscience void of all offence, and a heart yearning with aching
                    tenderness towards the father whose beloved image stands before him precisely as his eyes had looked
                    upon and loved it in life—how does he accost it?— <pb n="64" xml:id="VAB7399-070"/>

                        </lg></quote> etc. The second time that Hamlet sees his father's ghost, when one might suppose
                    that something of the horror attendant upon such a visitation would have been dispelled by the
                    previous experience, his mother thus depicts the appearance that he presents to her— <quote

                    blood shrinks from the cold simulacrum of life—so like and so utterly unlike—so familiar and yet so

                    and in the closet scene with his mother passionate pity and tenderness for his father are the only
                    emotions Hamlet expresses with his lips, while his eyes start from their sockets, and his hair rears
                    itself on his scalp, with the terror inspired by the proximity of that <quote>"gracious
                        figure."</quote></p>
                <p>In "Julius Caesar," the emotion experienced by Brutus at the sight of Caesar's ghost is, if possible,
                    even more to the purpose. The spirit of the firm Roman, composed to peaceful meditation after his
                    tender and sweet reconciliation with his friend, and his exquisite kindness to his sleepy young
                    slave, is quietly directed to the subject of his study, when the ghost of Caesar appears to him,
                    darkening by its presence the light of the taper by which he reads, and to which Shakespeare,
                    according to the superstition of his day, imparts this sensitiveness to the preternatural influence.
                    Brutus, in questioning his awful visitor, loses none of his stoical steadfastness of soul, and yet
                    speaks of his blood running cold, and his hair <hi rend="i">staring</hi> with the horror of the
                    unearthly visitation.</p>


                <pb n="66" xml:id="VAB7399-072"/>
                <p>Surely, having thus depicted the effect of such an experience on such men as Horatio, Hamlet, Brutus,
                    and Macbeth, Shakespeare can never have represented a woman, even though that woman was the bravest
                    of her sex, and almost of her kind, as subjected to a like ordeal and utterly unmoved by it. An
                    argument which appears to me conclusive on the point however, is, that in the sleeping scene Lady
                    Macbeth divulges nothing of the kind; and, even if it were possible to conceive her intrepidity
                    equal to absolute silence and self-command under the intense and mingled terrors of the banquet
                    scene <hi rend="i">with</hi> a perception of Banquo's apparition, it is altogether impossible to
                    imagine that the emotion she controlled then should not reveal itself in the hour of those
                    unconscious confessions when she involuntarily strips bare the festering plagues of her bosom to the
                    night, and to her appalled watchers, and in her ghastly slumbers, with the step and voice of some
                    horrible automaton, moved by no human volition, but a dire <pb n="67" xml:id="VAB7399-073"/>
                    compelling necessity, acts over again the mysteries of iniquity with which she has been familiar.
                    But, on the contrary, while wringing from her hands the warm gore of the murdered Duncan, and
                    dragging, with the impotent effect of her agonised nightmare, her husband away from the sound of the
                        <quote>"knocking"</quote> which reverberates still in the distracted chambers of her brain,
                    almost the last words she articulates are: <quote>"I tell you yet again, Banquo is buried; he cannot
                        come out of his grave."</quote> Assuredly she never saw his ghost.</p>
                <p>I am not inclined to agree, either, with the view which lends any special tenderness to Lady
                    Macbeth's demeanour towards her husband after the achievement of their bad eminence. She is not a
                    woman to waste words, any more than other means to ends; and, therefore, her refraining from all
                    reproaches at the disastrous close of their great festival is perfectly consistent with the
                    vehemence of her irony, so long as she could hope by its fierce stimulus to rouse Macbeth from the
                    delirium of <pb n="68" xml:id="VAB7399-074"/> terror into which he is thrown by the sight of
                    Banquo's ghost. While urging her husband to the King's murder, she uses, with all the power and
                    weight she can give to it, the <quote>"valour of her tongue,"</quote> which she foresaw in the first
                    hour of receiving the written news of his advancement would be requisite, to <quote>"chas-
                        tise"</quote> the irresolution of his spirit and the fluctuations of his purposes. She has her
                    end to gain by talking, and she talks till she does gain it; and in those moments of mortal agony,
                    when his terrors threaten with annihilation the fabric of their fortunes—that fearful fabric, based
                    on such infinite depths of guilt, cemented with such costly blood—when she sees him rushing upon
                    inevitable ruin, and losing every consciousness but that of his own crimes, she, like the rider
                    whose horse, maddened with fear, is imperilling his own and that rider's existence, drives the
                    rowels of her piercing irony into him, and with a hand of iron guides, and urges, and <hi rend="i"
                        >lifts</hi> him over the danger. But, except in those supreme instants, where her purpose is to
                        <pb n="69" xml:id="VAB7399-075"/> lash and goad him past the obstruction of his terrors, her
                    habitual tone, from beginning to end,is of a sort of contemptuous compassion towards the husband
                    whose moral superiority of nature she perceives and despises, as men not seldom put by the finer and
                    truer view of duty of women, as too delicate for common use, a weapon of too fine a temper for
                    worldly warfare.</p>
                <p>Her analysis of his character while still hiding in her hand his affectionate letter, her admonition
                    to him that his face betrays the secret disturbance of his mind, her advice that he will commit the
                    business of the King's murder to her management, her grave and almost kind solicitude at his moody
                    solitary brooding over the irretrievable past, and her compassionate suggestion at the close of the

                    must have seen the utter hopelessness of long concealing crimes which the miserable <pb n="70"
                        xml:id="VAB7399-076"/> murderer would himself inevitably reveal in some convulsion of
                    ungovernable remorse, are all indications of her own sense of superior power over the man whose
                    nature wants the <quote>"illness"</quote> with which hers is so terribly endowed, who would
                        <quote>"holily"</quote> that which he would <quote>"highly,"</quote> who would not <quote>"play
                        false,"</quote> and yet would <quote>"wrongly win."</quote></p>
                <p>Nothing, indeed, can be more wonderfully perfect than Shakespeare's delineation of the evil nature of
                    these two human souls—the evil strength of the one, and the evil weakness of the other.</p>
                <p>The woman's wide-eyed, bold, collected leap into the abyss makes us gulp with terror; while we watch
                    the man's blinking, shrinking, clinging, gradual slide into it, with a protracted agony akin to his
                    own.</p>
                <p>In admirable harmony with the conception of both characters is the absence in the case of Lady
                    Macbeth of all the grotesquely terrible supernatural machinery by which the imagination of Macbeth
                    is assailed and daunted. She <pb n="71" xml:id="VAB7399-077"/> reads of her husband's encounter with
                    the witches, and the fulfilment of their first prophecy; and yet, while the men who encounter them
                    (Banquo as much as Macbeth) are struck and fascinated by the wild quaintness of their weird
                    figures,—with the description of which it is evident Macbeth has opened his letter to her,—her mind
                    does not dwell for a moment on these <quote>"weak ministers"</quote> of the great power of evil. The
                    metaphysical conception of the influence to which she dedicates herself is pure free-thinking
                    compared with the superstitions of her times; and we cannot imagine her sweeping into the murky
                    cavern, where the hellish juggleries of Hecate are played, and her phantasmagories revel round their
                    filthy cauldron, without feeling that these petty devils would shrink appalled away from the
                    presence of the awful woman who had made her bosom the throne of those <quote>"murdering

                        mischief."</quote></p>
                <p>Nor has Shakespeare failed to show how <pb n="72" xml:id="VAB7399-078"/> well, up to a certain point,
                    the devil serves those who serve him well. The whole-hearted wickedness of Lady Macbeth buys that
                    exemption from <quote>"present fears"</quote> and <quote>"horrible imaginings"</quote> which
                    Macbeth's half-allegiance to right cannot purchase for him. In one sense, good consciences—that is,
                    tender ones—may be said to be the only bad ones: the very worst alone are those that hold their
                    peace and cease from clamouring. In sin, as in all other things, thoroughness has its reward; and
                    the reward is blindness to fear, deafness to remorse, hardness to good, and moral insensibility to
                    moral torture—the deadly gangrene instead of the agony of cauterisation; a degradation below shame,
                    fear, and pain. This point Lady Macbeth reaches at once, while from the first scene of the play to
                    the last the wounded soul of Macbeth writhes and cries and groans over its own gradual
                    deterioration. Incessant returns upon himself and his own condition, betray a state of moral
                    disquietude which is as ill-boding an omen of the spiritual state as the morbid <pb n="73"
                        xml:id="VAB7399-079"/> feeling of his own pulse by a sickly self-observing invalid is of the
                    physical condition; and, from the beginning to the end of his career, the several stages of his
                    progress in guilt are marked by his own bitter consciousness of it. First, the startled misgiving as
                    to his own motives: <quote rend="blockquote"><lg rend="center">
                            <l>"This supernatural soliciting</l>
                            <l>Cannot be ill—cannot be good."</l>
                        </lg></quote> Then the admission of the necessity for the treacherous cowardly assumption of
                    friendly hospitality, from which the brave man's nature and soldier's alike revolt: <quote
                        rend="center">"False face must hide what the false heart doth know."</quote> Then the
                    panic-stricken horror of the insisting : <quote rend="blockquote"><lg rend="center">
                            <l>"But <hi rend="i">why</hi> could not I pronounce Amen?</l>

                            <l>Stuck in my throat."</l>
                        </lg></quote> The vertigo of inevitable retribution: <quote rend="blockquote"><lg rend="center">
                            <l>"Glamis doth murder sleep,</l>
                            <l>And therefore Cawdor shall sleep no more,</l>
                            <l>Macbeth shall sleep no more!"</l>
                        </lg></quote> The utter misery of the question: <pb n="74" xml:id="VAB7399-080"/>
                    <quote rend="center">"How is it with me, when ev'ry noise appals me?"</quote> The intolerable
                    bitterness of the thought: <quote rend="blockquote"><lg rend="center">
                            <l>"For Banquo's issue have I <hi rend="i">filed my breast</hi>,</l>

                            <l>Given to the common enemy of mankind."</l>
                        </lg></quote> Later comes the consciousness of stony loss of fear and pity: <quote
                        rend="blockquote"><lg rend="center">
                            <l>"The time has been</l>

                            <l> . . . . . . . . </l>
                            <l>Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,</l>

                        </lg></quote> After this, the dreary wretchedness of his detested and despised old age confronts
                    him: <quote rend="blockquote"><lg rend="center">
                            <l>"And that which should accompany old age,</l>
                            <l>As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,</l>
                            <l>I must not look to have."</l>
                        </lg></quote> Most wonderful of all is it, after reviewing the successive steps of this dire
                    declension of the man's moral nature, to turn back to his first acknowledgment of that Divine
                    government, that Supreme Rule of Right, by which the deeds of men meet righteous retribution.

                <p>The preservation of Macbeth's dignity in a degree sufficient to retain our sympathy, in spite of the
                    preponderance of his wife's nature over his, depends on the two facts of his undoubted heroism in
                    his relations with men, and his great tenderness for the woman whose evil will is made powerful over
                    his partly by his affection for her. It is remarkable that hardly one scene passes where they are
                    brought together in which he does not address to her some endearing appellation; and, from his first
                    written words to her whom he calls his <quote>"Dearest partner of greatness,"</quote> to his
                    pathetic appeal <pb n="76" xml:id="VAB7399-082"/> to her physician for some alleviation of her moral
                    plagues, a love of extreme strength and tenderness is constantly manifested in every address to or
                    mention of her that he makes. He seeks her sympathy alike in the season of his prosperous fortune
                    and in the hour of his mental anguish: <quote rend="center">"Oh, full of scorpions is my mind, dear
                        wife!"</quote> and in this same scene there is a touch of essentially manly reverence for the
                    womanly nature of her who has so little of it, that deserves to be classed among Shakespeare's most
                    exquisite inspirations:—his refusing to pollute his wife's mind with the bloody horror of Banquo's
                    proposed murder. <quote rend="center">"Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck!"</quote> is a
                    conception full of the tenderest and deepest refinement, contrasting wonderfully with the hard,
                    unhesitating cruelty of her immediate sugggestion in reply to his: <quote rend="blockquote"><lg

                    <pb n="77" xml:id="VAB7399-083"/> by which she clearly demonstrates that her own wickedness not only
                    keeps pace with his, but has indeed, as in the business of the King's murder, reached at a bound
                    that goal towards which he has struggled by slow degrees.</p>
                <p>At the end of the banquet scene he appeals to her for her opinion on the danger threatened by
                    Macduff's contumacious refusal of their invitation, and from first to last he so completely leans on
                    her for support and solace in their miserable partnership of guilt and woe, that when we hear the
                    ominous words: <quote rend="center">"My Lord, the Queen is dead!"</quote> we see him stagger under
                    the blow which strikes from him the prop of that undaunted spirit in whose valour he found the
                    never-failing stimulus of his own.</p>
                <p>In the final encounter between Macbeth and the appointed avenger of blood it appears to me that the
                    suggestion of his want of personal courage, put forward by some commentators on his character, is
                    most triumphantly refuted. <pb n="78" xml:id="VAB7399-084"/> Until his sword crosses that of

                    of his untimely birth, he has been like one drunk-maddened by the poisonous inspirations of the
                    hellish oracles in which he has put his faith; and his furious excitement is the delirium of mingled
                    doubt and dread with which he clings, in spite of the gradual revelation of its falsehood, to the
                    juggling promise which pronounced him master of a charmed life. But no sooner is the mist of this
                    delusion swept from his mind, by the piercing blast of Macduff's interpretation of the promise, than
                    the heroic nature of the man once more proclaims itself. The fire of his spirit flames above the
                    "ashes of his chance;" the <note place="foot" xml:id="note_001"><hi rend="super">1</hi> Noteworthy,

                    Death as they glare at him from Macduff's sockets, and exclaims, <quote>"Yet will I try the

                    pathetic reference to the human detestation from which in that supreme hour he shrinks as much as

                    SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY OF <lb/>HENRY VIII.</head>
                <p>THE Queen and Wolsey in Henry VIII are both types of pride, and yet there is an essential difference
                    in the pride which they each represent. Undoubtedly, the pride of birth and the mere pride of power
                    (whether that power be derived from wealth, intellect, or exaltation of station) are very different
                    things. Katharine represents the pure pride of birth, and Wolsey that of power. Pride of birth, the
                    noblest species of the vice, is not incompatible with considerable personal humility, and the proof
                    that Shakespeare thought so may be <pb n="84" xml:id="VAB7399-090"/> found in the Queen's frequently
                    modest and humble mention of herself, her infinite deference to the King, and the repeated reference
                    by the other characters in the play to her meek and quiet spirit. That this pride sometimes consorts
                    with humbleness arises from the fact that it does not rest on any personal, individual quality or
                    achievement, and is therefore less directly egotistical and selfish than the other; and being of a
                    less gross quality is oftener the snare of noble and refined minds, from which, when once possessed
                    by it, it will hardly endure to be eradicated. For it becomes bound up with feelings of personal
                    honour, family honour, and the order and economy of the body social and political, of which nobility
                    forms a principal sustaining pillar in countries whose governments admit it as an integral part of
                    their existence, and in upholding their particular portion of which nobly-born persons, proud of
                    their birth, conceive that they contribute to maintain the whole. Birth, too, with such persons, if
                    they be otherwise virtuously inclined, <pb n="85" xml:id="VAB7399-091"/> becomes to them a spur and
                    incitement to high and lofty thoughts and deeds; for how runs the French device, <foreign rend="i"
                        xml:id="fr">Noblesse oblige?</foreign>—a very weighty and worthy truth, making of high birth a
                    solemn trust to be solemnly fulfilled and answered for. Such, I think, is the pride of some members
                    of the English aristocracy even in these democratic days; such was the family pride of many
                    gentlemen of old and honourable name formerly in England; and, tainted as it is with mortal
                    infirmity, there is but one better thing to be put in its place. The humility of a true Christian is
                    doubtless a grander thing than the gentility of a true gentleman or the nobility of a true nobleman:
                    meantime that man and that nation are in ill case in whom neither is to be found. Of this
                    loftyseeming sin, this pride of birth, Shakespeare's Queen Katharine is a most perfect type, as well
                    as an instance of the (almost) impossibility of a mind once infected with it ever losing the taint.
                    No change of outward circumstance can affect it, and loss of fortune and decline of <pb n="86"
                        xml:id="VAB7399-092"/> station can only tend to increase, in those who have it, their veneration
                    for a species of dis- tinction compatible with the narrowest means and lowliest obscurity. The pride
                    of power, that pride which Wolsey exhibits, is, on the contrary, almost invariably arrogant, and
                    very seldom co-exists with any personal humility; for it springs generally from a consciousness of
                    personal merit, strength, capacity, good fortune or achievement, and thus is necessarily grossly
                    egotistical.</p>
                <p>Again, the pride of birth is comparatively a relative thing, and has, as it were, a scale or standard
                    by which it is graduated and moderated. The self-respect of those who entertain it naturally
                    involves their respect for those who claim in any degree, whether more or less than themselves, the
                    same distinction, whereas the pride of power is apt to lose all sense of comparison in its
                    overweening self-consciousness: it knows no scale of degree, for its boast is to break down or
                    overleap all such, and its measure is never the claims of others, but its <pb n="87"
                        xml:id="VAB7399-093"/> own performed or possible achievement; and it is consequently in
                    perpetual peril of losing all balance. Nobly-born persons invariably speak respectfully of the
                    ancient birth of others: their pride is of a determinate place in a settled system, while the other
                    temper delights in nothing so much as in overturning established order by the self-created precedent
                    of individual ability and success. To this Wolsey's whole language and demeanour during his
                    prosperity bear ample witness: his insolence to the noblemen and gentlemen of the court is nothing
                    more than a species of revenge taken by the butcher's son upon the sons of noblemen and gentlemen
                    for being born such. Those who <quote>"achieve greatness"</quote> do not always, therefore,
                    encounter with perfect equanimity those who are <quote>"born great:"</quote> it takes a spirit of
                    rather unusual natural nobility to do so, and the dignity which is not shaken by falling is as
                    nothing to the dignity which is not fluttered by rising. Wolsey, though he had made himself cardinal
                    and hoped to make himself pope, <pb n="88" xml:id="VAB7399-094"/> could not unmake himself a
                    butcher's son; and the serene sense of social superiority which men of high and princely birth had
                    over him in this respect galled his consciousness of general power, in which he so greatly excelled
                    them, with a bitter sense of utter impotence in this one particular. To this species of aggressive
                    pride may be attributed the insane arrogance of his <quote>"Ego et Rex meus."</quote> To the noble
                    Suffolk, the princely Buckingham, or the royal daughter of Spain, Katharine of Aragon, such a form
                    of speech would have seemed nothing short of an audacious act of treason, an offence against order,
                    duty, and majesty, a confounding of those all but sacred social laws by which they themselves were
                    upheld in their several high spheres of state. In the gross-minded, low-born <quote>"fellow of
                        Ipswich,"</quote> whose vigorous intellect and powerful will had raised him to strange heights
                    of glory, it was the mere excess and intoxication of the sense of self-made greatness, which had
                    learned to look upon coronets and crowns, and the papal <pb n="89" xml:id="VAB7399-095"/> tiara
                    itself, as the instruments or prizes of its daring ambition, to be used or won, but never respected
                    by him with that religious veneration which men of true nobility have felt for them. To him they
                    were merely the noble means of base self-aggrandisement.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, though this species of pride is so much grosser and more vulgar and offensive, I
                    believe it will always be found more easily capable of cure and eradication than the other. The
                    circumstances once altered under which personal power was or could be successfully exercised,
                    consciousness of weakness and defeat almost inevitably ensues; uncertainty, self-distrust, and a
                    sense of insecurity are engendered by failure; a lowered estimate of capacity to achieve things not
                    unnaturally brings with it lessened value of the achievement. For we betake ourselves, as the fox of
                    ancient times has testified ever since his day, to underprize that which is beyond our reach,
                    however much we may have overprized while compassing or possessing it. After this lower- <pb n="90"
                        xml:id="VAB7399-096"/> ing process, and in the vacancy of disappointment, a mortification of
                    spirit sometimes ensues upon which a true humility might possibly engraft itself. Thus, Wolsey might
                    have become humble when once hopelessly fallen from his high fortune, because, ruined, he was
                    nothing in the world's account but the butcher's son, all whose personal ability had not sufficed to
                    retain his great position, and might not suffice to regain it. In this predicament the nobler powers
                    of his mind, shifting their point of view so as to take in more than the mere worldly value of his
                    lost prosperity, might present to him a higher and holier standard by which his estimate of the
                    earthly greatness he had forfeited would become more just, and his wisdom and learning and powerful
                    intellectual faculties, chastened in their action by the sweet uses of adversity, might finally
                    produce in him the grace of meekness and humility. The soil, loosened by the uprooting of the rank
                    and noxious weeds of worldly pride and ambition, and harrowed by the bitterness of worldly <pb
                        n="91" xml:id="VAB7399-097"/> failure, might become fit for the good seed and harvest of a
                    wholesome abasement. And in Griffith's account of the great cardinal's death to Queen Katharine he
                    insists upon this very result of his downfall, and the dying man's pathetic words confirm the
                    statement: <quote rend="blockquote"><lg rend="center">

                    these speeches of Griffith's to have been written by Fletcher. Not so Katharine. All the virtue and
                    wisdom she was mistress of could not make her humble, because she was, and remained through ruin and
                    disgrace, even unto <quote>"beggarly divorcement"</quote> and death, the daughter of the king of
                    Spain, the wife of two kings of England, and felt herself bound, by all the religion and <pb n="92"
                        xml:id="VAB7399-098"/> superstition of early training and long habit, to honour her station in
                    herself. So with disgraces <hi rend="i">grew</hi> her pride; and with one dying hand stretched out
                    to receive the heavenly crown she was about to put on, with the other she imperiously commanded
                    homage to that earthly one which had been rudely snatched from her brows. Wolsey honoured himself in
                    his station: it was to him the palpable proof of his own great powers of achievement, and when he
                    lost it his confidence in himself must have been shaken to its foundations, and he may almost have
                    fallen into the hopelessness of self-contempt. With what a poisonous bitterness of absolute defeat
                    does he utter the words— <quote rend="blockquote"><lg rend="center">

                <p><hi rend="center">Henry VIII</hi> was the favourite play of Dr. Johnson, who does not appear to have
                    entertained the doubts of modern commentators as to its being the work of Shakespeare; and his <pb
                        n="93" xml:id="VAB7399-099"/> admiration of it is characteristic when one considers the great
                    wisdom and fine morality by which the whole composition is pervaded. He told Mrs. Siddons that his
                    highest enjoyment would be to see her perform Queen Katharine, for whose character, as delineated by
                    Shakespeare, he had the most unbounded enthusiasm — naturally enough, as it is impossible to
                    conceive a more perfect embodiment of the pure spirit of Toryism. The character is one of great
                    simplicity, and hence in part the impression of grandeur it produces. Instead of the infinitely
                    various motives, feelings, passions, and inclinations which make of most human characters such
                    pieces of involved and complex moral machinery, two strongly developed elements alone compose the
                    woman Shakespeare has copied from Nature and history—a profoundly conscientious and devout spirit,
                    almost saint-like in its obedience to right and duty as she conceived of them, and a towering and
                    indomitable spirit of pride, which so alloyed the more heavenly dispositions as <pb n="94"
                        xml:id="VAB7399-100"/> to give harshness and narrowness to a nature otherwise noble, and stamp
                    with its own peculiarly rigid and stern image of royalty the pure gold of her high and virtuous
                    qualities. Every speech Shakespeare puts into her mouth testifies to the wonderful discrimination
                    with which he has delineated this combination of qualities, from her first solemn rebuke to the Duke
                    of Buckingham's surveyor when she bids him beware lest in maligning a noble person he should peril
                    his own nobler soul (her respect for the earthly dignity of the great peer being only outweighed by
                    her respect for an immortal spirit), to the last dying words gasped from the wan and withered lips,
                    when, later even than the desire she expresses that honour may be paid to her as a chaste wife, she
                    commands that honour shall be paid to her as a queen and daughter of a king. This last touching and
                    terrible utterance of the mingled virtue and vice is, as becomes the last, awful and pathetic,
                    though less dramatically striking, perhaps, than the burst of sudden passion when, with her <pb
                        n="95" xml:id="VAB7399-101"/> face yet radiant with the reflection of the heavenly vision in
                    which she has received the homage of glorified spirits, with the crown of immortality descending
                    upon her pale, illumined brow, and that <quote>"celestial harmony she goes to"</quote> resounding in
                    her ears, upon the very threshold of heaven, she turns with such implacable resentment from the poor
                    servant whose <quote>"haste had made him unmannerly,"</quote> and who forgot to approach her
                    kneeling: <quote rend="blockquote"><lg rend="center">

                    Capucius she characteristically sums up their praise by saying they will deserve good husbands, even
                        —<hi rend="i">noble</hi> men.</p>
                <p>But, to me, the most masterly touch of delineation by which Shakespeare has given this moral portrait
                    its greatest perfection is in the Queen's speech on Wolsey's character, when, first of all his sins,
                    she enumerates his <quote>"unbounded stomach,"</quote> that made him <quote>"ever <pb n="96"

                    falsehood was aggravated by its perpetration before Henry VIII, and the sin against God's sovereign
                    majesty of truth assumed a deeper dye in Katharine of Aragon's judgment when committed in the royal
                    presence of the King and Queen of England.</p>

                    Holbein's pictures of her do not, I think (even allowing for the ungainly, unbecoming dress),
                    establish her claim to being <quote>"the goodliest woman that ever lay by man;"</quote>
                    <pb n="97" xml:id="VAB7399-103"/> and then the recollection of her superfluous fingers and toes
                    interferes extremely with whatever other charms she may be supposed to have possessed, though
                    Francis I, who (if all tales be true) admired her very much, was a connoisseur in matters of female
                    beauty. A deficiency in such natural extremities is far less repulsive than an overplus: the one
                    might be the result of accident, the other is pure monstrosity; and all the excellence of that
                    worthiest woman, Katharine, did not prevent her being woman enough to insist upon her fair
                    six-fingered rival perpetually playing at cards in the king's presence. It is amusing to see with

                    Wolsey, and the death of Katharine, produces a sense of sameness and monotony, though the variety in
                    similarity is very wonderful. The death of Katharine ends the interest of the piece, and the
                    venomous squabbling of the clergymen and the voice of the jubilant throngs, whose acclamations rend
                    the sky at the baptism of the Princess Elizabeth, break harshly on the silence which settles
                    solemnly round the dying Queen in the dim stillness of her deserted sick-chamber at Kimbolton. The
                    noble lines at the conclusion of <hi rend="i">Henry VIII.</hi> and the supplementary compliment to
                    James are beyond a doubt to be attributed to Fletcher, with whose manner they are distinctly
                    stamped. To his stately pen may probably also be referred the eulogium on Wolsey spoken by Griffith,
                    and Wolsey's own famous farewell to all his greatness. The passages of the play which are put into

                    Undoubtedly, there were giants in those days in the art of play-writing, but it is by their side
                    that we best measure the stature of him who was taller by the head and shoulders than all the rest,
                    in whose incomparable genius the dramatic intellect of that great mental epoch reached its climax. I

                            >boast</hi> was it, then,"</quote>—a change that any one possessed of poetical or dramatic
                    perception would have submitted to upon nothing short of the positive demonstration of the author's
                    having so written the passage.</p>
                <p>Opinions were, indeed, divided as to the intrinsic merit of the emendations or alterations. Some of
                    the new readings were undoubted improvements, some were unimportant, <pb n="106"
                        xml:id="VAB7399-112"/> and others again were beyond all controversy inferior to the established
                    text of the passages; and it seemed not a little difficult to reconcile the critical acumen and
                    poetical insight of many of the corrections with the feebleness and prosaic triviality of
                    others.</p>
                <p>Again, it was observed by those conversant with the earlier editions, especially with the little read
                    or valued Oxford edition, that a vast number of the passages given as emendations in Mr. Collier's
                    folio were precisely the same in Hanmer's text. Indeed, it seems not a little remarkable that
                    neither Mr. Collier nor his opponents have thought it worth their while to state that nearly half,
                    and that undoubtedly the better half of the so-called new readings are to be found in the finely
                    printed, but little esteemed, text of the Oxford Shakespeare. If, indeed, these corrections now come
                    to us with the authority of a critic but little removed from Shakespeare's own time, it is
                    remarkable that Sir Thomas Hanmer's, or rather Mr. Theobald's, ingenuity <pb n="107"
                        xml:id="VAB7399-113"/> should have forestalled the <hi rend="i">fiat</hi> of Mr. Collier's folio
                    in so many instances. On the other hand, it may have been judged by others besides a learned editor
                    of Shakespeare from whom I once heard the remark, that the fact of the so-called new readings being
                    many of them in Rowe and Hanmer, and therefore well known to the subsequent editors of Shake-
                    speare, who nevertheless did not adopt them, proved that in their opinion they were of little value
                    and less authority. But, says Mr. Collier, inasmuch as they are in the folio of 1632, which I now
                    give to the world, they are of authority paramount to any other suggestion or correction that has
                    hitherto been made on the text of Shakespeare.</p>
                <p>Thus stood the question in 1853. How stands it a few years later? After a slow, but gradual process
                    of growth and extension of doubt and questionings, more or less calculated to throw discredit on the
                    authority of the marginal notes in the folio,—the volume being subjected to the careful and
                    competent examination <pb n="108" xml:id="VAB7399-114"/> of certain officers of the library of the
                    British Museum,—the result seems to threaten a considerable reduction in the supposed value of the
                    authority which the public was called upon to esteem so highly.</p>
                <p>The ink in which the annotations are made has been subjected to chemical analysis, and betrays, under
                    the characters traced in it, others made in pencil, which are pronounced by some persons of a more
                    modern date than the letters which have been traced over them.</p>
                <p>Here at present the matter rests. Much angry debate has ensued between the various gentlemen
                    interested in the controversy, Mr. Collier not hesitating to suggest that pencilmarks in imitation
                    of his handwriting had been inserted in the volume, and a fly-leaf abstracted from it, while in the
                    custody of Messrs. Hamilton and Madden of the British Museum; while the replies of these gentlemen
                    would go towards establishing that the corrections are forgeries, and insinuating that they are for-
                        <pb n="109" xml:id="VAB7399-115"/> geries for which Mr. Collier is himself responsible.</p>
                <p>While the question of the antiquity and authority of these marginal notes remains thus undecided, it
                    may not be amiss to apply to them the mere test of common sense in order to determine upon their
                    intrinsic value, to the adequate estimate of which all thoughtful readers of Shakespeare must be to
                    a certain degree competent.</p>
                <p>The curious point, of whose they are, may test the science of decipherers of palimpsest manuscripts;
                    the more weighty one, of what they are worth, remains as it was from the first, a matter on which
                    every student of Shakespeare may arrive at some conclusion for himself. And, indeed, to this ground
                    of judgment Mr. Collier himself appeals, in his preface to the "Notes and Emendations," in no less
                    emphatic terms than the following:— <quote>"As Shakespeare was especially the poet of common life,
                        so he was emphatically the poet of common sense; and to, the verdict of <pb n="110"
                            xml:id="VAB7399-116"/> common sense I am willing to submit all the more material alterations
                        recommended on the authority before me."</quote></p>
                <p>I take "The Tempest," the first play in Mr. Collier's volume of "Notes and Emendations," and, while
                    bestowing my principal attention on the inherent worth of the several new readings, shall point out
                    where they tally exactly with the text of the Oxford edition, because that circumstance has excited
                    little attention in the midst of the other various elements of interest in the controversy, and also
                    because I have it in my power to give from a copy of that edition in my possession some passages
                    corrected by John and Charles Kemble, who brought to the study of the text considerable knowledge of
                    it and no inconsiderable ability for poetical and dramatic criticism.</p>
                <p>In the first scene of the first act of "The Tempest," Mr. Collier gives the line,— <quote
                        rend="center">"Good Boatswain, have care,"—</quote> adding, <quote>"It may be just worth remark,
                        that the colloquial expression is have a care, and a <pb n="111" xml:id="VAB7399-117"/> is
                        inserted in the margin of the corrected folio, 1632, to indicate, probably, that the poet so
                        wrote it, or, at all events, that the actor so delivered it."</quote></p>
                <p>In the copy of Hanmer in my possession, the <hi rend="i">a</hi> is also inserted in the margin, upon
                    the authority of one of the eminent actors above mentioned. <quote rend="blockquote"><lg

                    more likely to have written <hi rend="i">cheek</hi> than <hi rend="i">heat</hi>; for elsewhere he
                    uses the expression, <quote>"Heaven's face,"</quote>
                    <quote>"the welkin's face,"</quote> and, though irregular, the expression is poetical.</p>

                    <pb n="112" xml:id="VAB7399-118"/> Mr. Collier does Theobald the justice to observe that he, as well
                    as the corrector of the folio, I632, adds the necessary letter <hi rend="i">s</hi> to the word

                    implies the exercise of that foresight or <hi rend="i">pre</hi>vision; it is therefore better,
                    because more comprehensive.</p>
                <p>Mr. Collier's folio gives as an improvement upon Malone and Steeven's reading of the passage,— <quote

                        </lg></quote> Supposing the reading of the folio to be ingenious rather than authoritative, the
                    passage, as it stands in Hanmer, is decidedly better, because clearer:— <quote rend="blockquote"><lg

                        </lg></quote></p>
                <p>In the next passage, given as emended by the folio, we have what appears to me one bad and one
                    decidedly good alteration from the usual reading, which, in all the editions given hitherto, has
                    left the meaning barely perceptible through the confusion and obscurity of the expression. <quote
                        rend="blockquote"><lg rend="center">

                        </lg></quote> The folio says,— <quote rend="center">"He being thus <hi rend="i"

                    <pb n="114" xml:id="VAB7399-120"/> And to this change I object: the meaning was obvious before;
                        <quote>"lorded"</quote> stands clearly enough here for made lord of, or, over, etc.; and though
                    the expression is unusual, it is less prosaic than the proposed word <hi rend="i">loaded</hi>. But
                    in the rest of the passage, the critic of the folio does immense service to the text, in reading
                        <quote rend="blockquote"><lg rend="center">

                        </lg></quote> This change carries its own authority in its manifest good sense.</p>
                <p>Of the passage,— <quote rend="blockquote"><lg rend="center">

                        </lg></quote> Mr. Collier says that the iteration of the word <quote>"purpose,"</quote> in the
                    fourth line, after its employment in the second, is a blemish, which his folio obviates by
                    substituting the word <hi rend="i">practice</hi>
                    <pb n="115" xml:id="VAB7399-121"/> in the first line. I think this a manifest improvement, though
                    not an important one.</p>
                <p>Mr. Collier gives Rowe the credit of having altered <quote>"butt"</quote> to <hi rend="i">boat</hi>,
                    and <quote>"have quit it"</quote> to <hi rend="i">had quit it</hi>, in the lines— <quote

                        </lg></quote> Adding, that in both changes he is supported by the corrector of the folio, 1632.
                    Hanmer gives the passage exactly as the latter, and as Rowe does.</p>
                <p>We now come to the stage-directions in the folio, to which Mr. Collier gives, I think, a most
                    exaggerated value. He says, that, where Prospero says,— <quote rend="blockquote"><lg rend="center">
                            <l>"Lend thy hand</l>
                            <l>And pluck my magic garment from me,—so</l>
                            <l>Lie there, my art,"—</l>
                        </lg></quote> the words <quote>"Lay it down,"</quote> are written over against the passage. Now
                    this really seems a very unnecessary direction, inasmuch as the next very clearly indicates that
                    Prospero lays <pb n="116" xml:id="VAB7399-122"/> down as well as plucks off his <quote>"magic
                        garment"</quote> —unless we are to suppose Miranda holding it over her arm till he resumes it.
                    But still less do I agree with Mr. Collier in thinking the direction, <quote>"Put on robe
                        again,"</quote> at the passage beginning, <quote>"Now I arise,"</quote> any extraordinary
                    accession to the business, as it is technically called, of the scene; for I do not think that his
                    resuming his magical robe was in any way necessary to account for the slumber which overcomes
                    Miranda, <quote>"in spite of her interest in her father's story,"</quote> and which Mr. Collier says
                    the commentators have endeavoured to account for in various ways; but putting <quote>"<hi rend="i"
                            >because</hi> of her interest in her father's story,"</quote> instead of <quote>"<hi
                            rend="i">in spite</hi> of,"</quote> I feel none of the difficulty which beset the
                    commentators, and which Mr. Collier conjures by the stage-direction which makes Prospero resume his
                    magic robe at a certain moment in order to put his daughter to sleep. Worthy Dr. Johnson, who was
                    not among the puzzled commentators on this occasion, suggests, very agreeably to common sense, that
                        <pb n="117" xml:id="VAB7399-123"/>
                    <quote>"Experience proves that any violent agitation of the mind easily subsides in
                        slumber."</quote> But Mr. Collier says the Doctor gives this very reasonable explanation of
                    Miranda's sleep only because he was not acquainted with the folio stage-direction about Prospero's
                    coat, and knew no better. Now we are acquainted with this important addition to the text, and yet
                    know no better than to agree with Dr. Johnson, that Miranda's slumbers were perfectly to be
                    accounted for without the coat. Mr. Collier does not seem to know that a deeper and heavier desire
                    to sleep follows upon the overstrained exercise of excited attention than on the weariness of a dull
                    and uninteresting appeal to it.</p>
                <p>But let us consider Shakespeare's text, rather than the corrector's additions, for a moment. Within
                    reach of the wild wind and spray of the tempest, though sheltered from their fury, Miranda had
                    watched the sinking ship struggling with the mad elements, and heard when <quote>"rose from sea to
                        sky the wild <pb n="118" xml:id="VAB7399-124"/> farewell."</quote> Amazement and pity had thrown
                    her into a paroxysm of grief, which is hardly allayed by her father's assurance, that
                        <quote>"there's no harm done."</quote> After this terrible excitement follows the solemn
                    exordium to her father's story:— <quote rend="blockquote"><lg rend="center">
                            <l>"The hour's now come;</l>
                            <l>The very minute bids thee ope thine ear</l>
                            <l>Obey and be attentive."</l>
                        </lg></quote> The effort she calls upon her memory to make to recover the traces of her earliest
                    impressions of life—the strangeness of the events unfolded to her—the duration of the recital
                    itself, which is considerable—and, above all, the poignant personal interest of its details, are
                    quite sufficient to account for the sudden utter prostration of her overstrained faculties and
                    feelings, and the profound sleep that falls on the young girl. Perhaps Shakespeare knew this, though
                    his commentators, old and new, seem not to have done so; and without a professed faith, such as some
                    of us moderns indulge in, in the mysteries of magnetism, perhaps he believed enough in <pb n="119"
                        xml:id="VAB7399-125"/> the magnetic force of the superior physical as well as mental power of
                    Prospero's nature over the nervous, sensitive, irritable female organisation of his child to account
                    for the <quote>"I know thou canst not choose"</quote> with which he concludes his observation on her
                    drowsiness, and his desire that she will not resist it. The magic gown may, indeed, have been
                    powerful; but hardly more so, I think, than the nervous exhaustion which, combined with the
                    authoritative will and eyes of her lord and father, bowed down the child's drooping eyelids in
                    profoundest sleep.</p>
                <p>The strangest of all Mr. Collier's comments upon this passage, however, is that where he represents
                    Miranda as, up to a certain point of her father's story, remaining <quote>"standing eagerly
                        listening by his side."</quote> This is not only gratuitous, but absolutely contrary to Shake-
                    speare's text—a greater authority, I presume, than even that of the annotated folio. Pros- pero's
                    words to his daughter, when first he begins the recital of their sea-sorrow, are:— <pb n="120"
                        xml:id="VAB7399-126"/>
                    <quote rend="blockquote"><lg rend="center">
                            <l>"Sit down!</l>
                            <l>For thou must now know further."</l>
                        </lg></quote> Does Mr. Collier's folio reject this reading of the first line? Or does he suppose
                    that Miranda remained standing, in spite of her father's command? Moreover, when he interrupts his
                    story with the words, <quote>"Now I arise,"</quote> he adds, to his daughter, <quote>"Sit
                        still,"</quote> which clearly indicates both that she was seated and that she was about to rise
                    (naturally enough) when her father did. We say <quote>"Sit <hi rend="i">down</hi>"</quote> to a
                    person who is standing; and <quote>"Sit <hi rend="i">still</hi>"</quote> to a person seated who is
                    about to rise; and in all these minute particulars the simple text of Shakespeare, if attentively
                    followed, gives every necessary indication of his intention with regard to the attitudes and
                    movements of the persons on the stage in this scene; and the highly commended stage-directions of
                    the folio are here, therefore, perfectly superfluous.</p>
                <p>The next alteration in the received text is a decided improvement. In speaking of the royal fleet
                    dispersed by the tempest, Ariel says: <pb n="121" xml:id="VAB7399-127"/>
                    <quote rend="blockquote"><lg rend="center">

                        </lg></quote> for which Mr. Collier's folio substitutes:— <quote rend="blockquote"><lg

                            <l>"They all have met again,</l>

                            <l>Bound sadly back to Naples."</l>
                        </lg></quote></p>
                <p>Mr. Collier notices that the improvement of giving the lines, <quote rend="blockquote"><lg
                            rend="center">
                            <l>"Abhorred slave,</l>
                            <l>Which any print of goodness will not take,"</l>
                        </lg></quote> to Prospero, instead of Miranda, dates as far back as Dryden and Davenant's
                    alteration of "The Tempest," from which he says Theobald and others copied it.</p>
                <p>The corrected folio gives its authority to the lines of the song:— <quote rend="blockquote"><lg
                            rend="center">
                            <l>"Foot it featly here and there,</l>
                            <l>"And, sweet sprites, the burden bear,"—</l>
                        </lg></quote> which stands so in Hanmer, and, indeed, is the usually received arrangement of the
                    song.</p>
                <p>This is the last corrected passage in the first act, in the course of which Mr. Collier gives us no
                    fewer than sixteen, altered, <pb n="122" xml:id="VAB7399-128"/> emended, and commented upon in his
                    folio. Many of the emendations are to be found <hi rend="i">verbatim</hi> in the Oxford and
                    subsequent editions, and three only appear to be of any special value, tried by the standard of
                    common sense, to which it was agreed, on Mr. Collier's invitation, to refer them.</p>
                <p>The line in Prospero's threat to Caliban:— <quote rend="blockquote"><lg rend="center">
                            <l>"I'll rack thee with old cramps,</l>
                            <l>Fill all thy bones with <hi rend="i">aches</hi>, make thee roar,"—</l>
                        </lg></quote> occasioned one of Mr. John Kemble's characteristic differences with the public,
                    who objected, perhaps not without reason, to hearing the word "aches" pronounced as a dissyllable,
                    although the line imperatively demands it; and Shakespeare shows that the word was not unusually so
                    pronounced, as he introduces it with the same quantity in the prose dialogue of "Much Ado about
                    Nothing," and makes it the vehicle of a pun which certainly argues that it was familiar to the
                    public ear as <hi rend="i">aches</hi> and not <hi rend="i">akes</hi>. When Hero asks Beatrice, who
                    complains that she is sick, what she is sick for,—a hawk, <pb n="123" xml:id="VAB7399-129"/> a
                    hound, or a husband,—Beatrice replies, that she is sick for—or of—that which begins them all, an <hi
                        rend="i">ache</hi>,—an <hi rend="i">H</hi>. Indeed, much later than Shakespeare's day the word
                    was so pronounced; for Dean Swift, in the "City Shower," has the line,— <quote>"Old <hi rend="i"
                            >aches</hi> throb, your hollow tooth will rage."</quote></p>
                <p>The opening of this play is connected with my earliest recollections. In looking down the
                        <quote>"dark backward and abysm of time,"</quote> to the period when I was but six years old, my
                    memory conjures up a vision of a stately drawing-room on the ground-floor of a house, doubtless long
                    since swept from the face of the earth by the encroaching tide of new houses and streets that has
                    submerged every trace of suburban beauty, picturesqueness, or rural privacy in the neighbourhood of
                    London, converting it all by a hideous process of assimilation into more London, till London seems
                    almost more than England can carry.</p>
                <p>But in those years, "long enough ago," to <pb n="124" xml:id="VAB7399-130"/> which I refer,—somewhere
                    between Lee and Blackheath, stood in the midst of well-kept grounds a goodly mansion, which held
                    this pleasant room. It was always light and cheerful and warm, for the three windows down to the
                    broad gravel-walk before it faced south; and though the lawn was darkened just in front of them by
                    two magnificent yew-trees, the atmosphere of the room itself, in its silent, sunny loftiness, was at
                    once gay and solemn to my small imagination and senses,—much as the interior of Saint Peter's of
                    Rome has been since to them. Wonderful, large, tall jars of precious old china stood in each window,
                    and my nose was just on a level with the wide necks, whence issued the mellowest smell of fragrant
                        <hi rend="i">pot-pourri</hi>. Into this room, with its great crimson curtains and deep crimson
                    carpet, in which my feet seemed to me buried, as in woodland moss, I used to be brought for the
                    recompense of "having been very good," and there I used to find a lovely-looking lady, who was to me
                    the fitting divinity of this shrine of <pb n="125" xml:id="VAB7399-131"/> pleasant awfulness. She
                    bore a sweet Italian diminutive for her Christian name, added to one of the noblest old ducal names
                    of Venice, which was that of her family.</p>
                <p>I have since known that she was attached to the person of, and warmly personally attached to, the
                    unfortunate Caroline of Brunswick, Princess of Wales,—then only unfortunate; so that I can now guess
                    at the drift of much sad and passionate talk with indignant lips and tearful eyes, of which the
                    meaning was then of course incomprehensible to me, but which I can now partly interpret by the
                    subsequent history of that ill-used and ill-conducted lady.</p>
                <p>The face of my friend with the great Venetian name was like one of Giorgione's pictures, —of that
                    soft and mellow colourlessness that recalls the poet's line,— <quote rend="blockquote"><lg
                            rend="center">
                            <l>"E smarrisce 'l bel volto in quel colore</l>
                            <l>Che non è pallidezza, ma candore,"—</l>
                        </lg></quote> or the Englishman's version of the same thought, <quote>"Her face,—oh, call it
                        fair, not pale!"</quote>
                    <pb n="126" xml:id="VAB7399-132"/> It seemed to me, as I remember it, creamcoloured; and her eyes,
                    like clear water over brown rocks, where the sun is shining. But though the fair visage was like one
                    of the great Venetian master's portraits, her .voice was purely English, low, distinct, full, and
                    soft,— and in this enchanting voice she used to tell me the story of the one large picture which
                    adorned the room.</p>
                <p>Over and over again, at my importunate beseeching, she told it,—sometimes standing before it, while I
                    held her hand and listened with upturned face, and eyes rounding with big tears of wonder and pity,
                    to a tale which shook my small soul with a sadness and strangeness far surpassing the interest of my
                    beloved tragedy, "<hi rend="i">The Babes in the Wood</hi>," though at this period of my existence it
                    has happened to me to interrupt with frantic cries of distress, and utterly refuse to hear, the end
                    of that lamentable ballad.</p>
                <p>But the picture.—In the midst of a stormy sea, on which night seemed fast settling down, <pb n="127"
                        xml:id="VAB7399-133"/> a helmless, mastless, sailless bark lay weltering giddily, and in it sat
                    a man in the full flower of vigorous manhood. His attitude was one of miserable dejection, and, oh,
                    how I did long to remove the hand with which his eyes were covered, to see what manner of look in
                    them answered to the bitter sorrow which the speechless lips expressed! His other hand rested on the
                    fair curls of a girl-baby of three years old, who clung to his knee, and, with wide, wondering blue
                    eyes and laughing lips, looked up into the half-hidden face of her father.—"And that," said the
                    sweet voice at my side, "was the good Duke of Milan, Prospero,—and that was his little child,
                    Miranda."</p>
                <p>There was something about the face and figure of the Prospero that suggested to me those of my
                    father; and this, perhaps, added to the poignancy with which the representation of his distress
                    affected my childish imagination. But the impression made by the picture, the story, and the place
                    where I heard the one and saw the other, is among the most vivid that my <pb n="128"
                        xml:id="VAB7399-134"/> memory retains. And never, even now, do I turn the magic page that holds
                    that marvellous history, without again seeing the lovely lady, the picture full of sad dismay, and
                    my own six year-old self listening to that earliest <choice>

                    </choice> lore that my mind and heart ever received. I suppose this is partly the secret of my love
                    for this, above all other of the poet's plays:—it was my first possession in the kingdom of
                    unbounded delight which he has since bestowed upon me.</p>

                <head>NOTES ON THE TEMPEST. <lb/>No. II.</head>
                <p>THE <hi rend="i">Tempest</hi> is, as I have already said, my favourite of Shakespeare's Dramas. The
                    remoteness of the scene from all known localities allows a range to the imagination such as no other
                    of his plays affords—not even the <hi rend="i">Midsummer Night's Dream</hi>, where, though the <hi
                        rend="i">dramatic personæ</hi> are half of them superhuman, the scene is laid in a wood "near
                    Athens;" and Theseus and Hypolita, if fabulous folk, are among the mythological acquaintance of our
                    earliest school days.</p>
                <p>But the <quote>"uninhabited Island,"</quote> lost in unknown seas, gives far other scope to the
                    wandering fancy. As the scene is removed from all places with which we hold acquaint- <pb n="132"
                        xml:id="VAB7399-138"/> ance, so the story, simple in the extreme, has more reference to past
                    events than to any action in the play itself, which involves but few incidents, and has little to do
                    with common experience.</p>
                <p>But chiefly I delight in this play, because of the image which it presents to my mind of the glorious
                    supremacy of the righteous human soul over all things by which it is surrounded. Prospero is to me
                    the representative of wise and virtuous manhood, in its true relation to the combined elements of
                    existence—the physical powers of the external world, and the varieties of character with which it
                    comes into voluntary, accidental, or enforced contact.</p>
                <p>Of the wonderful chain of being, of which Caliban is the densest and Ariel the most ethereal extreme,
                    Prospero is the middle link. He—the wise and good man—is the ruling power, to whom the whole series
                    is subject.</p>
                <p>First, and lowest in the scale, comes the gross and uncouth but powerful savage, who represents both
                    the more ponderous and un- <pb n="133" xml:id="VAB7399-139"/> wieldy natural elements (as the earth
                    and water), which the wise Magician by his knowledge compels to his service; and the brutal and
                    animal propensities of the nature of man, which he, the type of its noblest development, holds in
                    lordly subjugation.</p>
                <p>Next follow the drunken, ribald, foolish retainers of the King of Naples, whose ignorance, knavery,
                    and stupidity represent the coarser attributes of those great unenlightened masses, which in all
                    communities threaten authority by their conjunction with brute force and savage ferocity; and only
                    under the wholesome restraint of a wise discipline can be gradually admonished into the salutary
                    subserviency necessary for their civilisation.</p>
                <p>Ascending by degrees in the scale, the next group is that of the cunning, cruel, selfish, treacherous
                    worldlings—Princes and Potentates —the peers in outward circumstances of high birth and breeding of
                    the noble Prospero— whose villanous policy (not unaided by his own dereliction of his duties as a
                    governor in <pb n="134" xml:id="VAB7399-140"/> the pursuit of his pleasure as a philosopher)
                    triumphs over his fortune, and, through a devilish ability and craft, for a time gets the better of
                    truth and virtue in his person.</p>
                <p>From these, who represent the baser intellectual as the former do the baser sensual properties of
                    humanity, we approach by a most harmonious moral transition, through the agency of the skilfully
                    interposed figure of the kindly gentleman, Gonzalo, those charming types of youth and love,
                    Ferdinand and Miranda—the fervent chivalrous devotion of the youth, and the yielding simplicity and
                    sweetness of the girl, are lovely representations of those natural emotions of tender sentiment and
                    passionate desire which, watched and guided and guarded by the affectionate solici- tude and
                    paternal prudence of Prospero, are pruned of their lavish luxuriance and supported in their violent
                    weakness by the wise will that teaches forbearance and self-control as the only price at which these
                    exquisite flowers of existence may unfold their blossoms <pb n="135" xml:id="VAB7399-141"/> in
                    prosperous beauty, and bear their rightful harvest of happiness as well as pleasure.</p>
                <p>Next in this wonderful gamut of being, governed by the sovereign soul of Prospero, come the shining
                    figures of the Masque— beautiful bright apparitions, fitly indicating the air, the fire, and all the
                    more smiling aspects and subtler forces of nature. These minister with prompt obedience to the
                    magical behests of Science, and, when not toiling in appointed service for their great task-master,
                    recreate and refresh his senses and, his spirit with the every-varying pageant of this beautiful
                    Universe.</p>
                <p>Last—highest of all—crowning with a fitful flame of lambent brightness this poetical pyramid of
                    existence, flickers and flashes the beautiful Demon, without whose exquisite com- panionship we
                    never think of the royal Magician with his grave countenance of command—Ariel seems to me to
                    represent the keenest perceiving intellect—apart from all moral conscious- ness and sense of
                    responsibility. His power <pb n="136" xml:id="VAB7399-142"/> and knowledge are in some respects
                    greater than those of his master—he can do what Prospero cannot—he lashes up the Tempest round the
                    Island—he saves the King and his companions from the shipwreck—he defeats the conspiracy of
                    Sebastian and Antonio, and discovers the clumsy plot of the beast Caliban —he wields immediate
                    influence over the elements, and comprehends alike without indignation or sympathy—which are moral
                    results —the sin and suffering of humanity. Therefore, because he is only a spirit of knowledge, he
                    is subject to the spirit of love—and the wild, subtle, keen, beautiful, powerful creature is
                    compelled to serve with mutinous waywardness and unwilling subjection the human soul that pitied and
                    rescued it from its harsher slavery to sin—and which, though controlling it with a wise severity to
                    the fulfilment of its duties, yearns after it with the tearful eyes of tender human love when its
                    wild wings flash away into its newly-recovered realm of lawless liberty.</p>

                <p>IN the second act we have the passage relating to the Princess Claribel's marriage to the King of
                    Tunis,— <quote rend="blockquote"><lg rend="center">
                            <l>"And the fair soul herself</l>
                            <l>Weigh'd between lothness and obedience at</l>
                            <l>Which end o' the beam <hi rend="i">should</hi> bow."</l>
                        </lg></quote> Malone considers that the <hi rend="i">should</hi> of the old copy was merely an
                    elliptical <hi rend="i">she would</hi>, and gives the lines thus,— <quote rend="blockquote"><lg
                            rend="center">
                            <l>"Weigh'd between lothness and obedience at</l>
                            <l>Which end of the beam <hi rend="i">she'd</hi> bow;"—</l>
                        </lg></quote> a version which has been most generally adopted by subsequent editors. Mr.
                    Collier, however, proposes as an improvement on this, <pb n="140" xml:id="VAB7399-146"/> the
                    alteration which he finds in his folio, and gives the passage thus:— <quote rend="blockquote"><lg
                            rend="center">
                            <l>"And the fair soul herself,</l>
                            <l>Weigh'd between lothness and obedience, <hi rend="i">as</hi></l>
                            <l>Which end of the beam should bow;"—</l>
                        </lg></quote> which I cannot think at all less <quote>"detrimental to the sense"</quote> than he
                    finds Malone's correction. In Hanmer we have what appears to me a much better reading of the
                    passage, by the mere omission of the preposition "of" in the third line:— <quote rend="blockquote"
                            ><lg rend="center">
                            <l>"And the fair soul herself</l>
                            <l>Weigh'd between lothness and obedience at</l>
                            <l>Which end the beam should bow."</l>
                        </lg></quote> This appears to me the best version of the lines given yet; and Pope thought so
                    too, for he adopted it.</p>
                <p>The next emendation to which I object is in the speech of Antonio, beginning,<quote> "She that is
                        Queen of Tunis,"</quote> the passage which in the old folio is printed thus:— <quote
                        rend="blockquote"><lg rend="center">
                            <l rend="i">"She that from whom</l>
                            <l>We were sea-swallow'd,"—</l>
                        </lg></quote>
                    <pb n="141" xml:id="VAB7399-147"/> was emended by Rowe by omitting "that" and printing "She from
                    whom;" and this reading has been universally adopted since. It seems curious to me that no one
                    bethought themselves of transposing "She that" into "That she," which would have been <choice>
                        <sic>Shakespearian</sic>
                        <corr>Shakespearean</corr>
                    </choice>, and justified the retention of the otherwise incomprehensible <hi rend="i">that</hi>.
                    However, Mr. Collier's folio omits "that," and alters another member of the passage, substituting
                    the word <hi rend="i">for</hi> instead of <hi rend="i">from</hi>:— <quote rend="blockquote"><lg
                            rend="center">
                            <l>"She <hi rend="i">for</hi> whom</l>
                            <l>We were all sea-swallow'd,"—</l>
                        </lg></quote> a change which he pronounces an improvement. I scarcely think it so: "from whom"
                    clearly indicates the meaning of "coming from whom;" at any rate, the change is quite un-
                    important.</p>
                <p>The next emendation in the passage which Mr. Collier finds in his folio he rejects, saying the
                    original reading seems preferable, and this is,— <quote rend="blockquote"><lg rend="center">
                            <l>"How shall that Claribel</l>
                            <l>Measure <hi rend="i">us</hi> back to Naples,"</l>
                        </lg></quote>
                    <pb n="142" xml:id="VAB7399-148"/> which Mr. Collier's folio changes into <quote>"measure <hi
                            rend="i">it</hi> back to Naples;"</quote> and strangely enough the Oxford edition has that
                    same alteration in the text; but inasmuch as the whole passage stands thus:— <quote
                        rend="blockquote"><lg rend="center">
                            <l>"A space whose every cubit</l>
                            <l>Seems to cry out, 'How shall that Claribel</l>
                            <l>Measure us back to Naples?'"</l>
                        </lg></quote> and that the many cubits which intervene between Tunis and Naples are supposed to
                    utter the observation, <quote>"Measure <hi rend="i">us</hi> back"</quote> is obviously the more
                    appropriate reading of the line.</p>
                <p>The next change in the text which Mr. Collier produces seems again unimportant. He says Alonzo's
                    exclamation on waking and finding Sebastian and Antonio with their swords drawn has always been
                    given,— <quote rend="blockquote"><lg rend="center">
                            <l>"Why are you drawn?</l>
                            <l>Wherefore <hi rend="i">this</hi> ghastly looking?"</l>
                        </lg></quote> and that upon the showing of his copy, the <hi rend="i">this</hi> is a misprint
                    for <hi rend="i">thus</hi>,— <quote rend="center">"Wherefore thus ghastly looking?"</quote>
                    <pb n="143" xml:id="VAB7399-149"/> He says the change is not absolutely necessary. I should say it
                    was absolutely unnecessary.</p>
                <p>The crossing of the T in Gonzalo's assertion that <quote>"there was a noise that's verity"</quote>
                    (the old copy reads <hi rend="i">verily</hi>), a merit which Mr. Collier imputes to his corrector,
                    is to be found in Hanmer—Pope being the originator of the correction, which, though consisting
                    merely of the alteration of a letter, materially affects the sense.</p>
                <p>In the soliloquy of Trinculo, which ends by his hiding under Caliban's gabardine, Mr. Collier's folio
                    says that the words, <quote>"I will here shroud till the <hi rend="i">dregs</hi> of the storm be
                        past,"</quote> should be, <quote>"I will here shroud till the <hi rend="i">drench of the</hi>
                        storm be past,"</quote> which he justifies upon the ground that Trinculo would perhaps have
                    thought it more desirable to avoid the drench or extreme violence of the storm than the mere dregs
                    or conclusion of it. But the dregs of anything are its thickest and heaviest part— the sediment, the
                    dirty residuum, deposited by liquid—and therefore, upon the whole, the least <pb n="144"
                        xml:id="VAB7399-150"/> desirable part of the storm, even though it be its conclusion—especially,
                    as according to Trinculo's apprehensive description of the threatening sky, one cloud was hovering
                    in it which he compares to a <quote>"foul bumbard"</quote> (a barrel for holding liquor), the lees
                    or " dregs" of which are assuredly not the pleasantest part to receive upon one's head. This
                    emendation I therefore do not accept as such.</p>
                <p>The next alteration of the text given is the omission of the syllable "ing " from the word trencher
                    in Caliban's song:— <quote rend="center">"Nor scrape trenchering, nor wash dish."</quote> Theobald
                    and Dryden both wrote the passage as Mr. Collier's folio has it, <quote>"nor scrape
                        trencher."</quote> Many of the subsequent editors, however, retain "trenchering," which may
                    perhaps be considered as a term for trenchers collectively, Caliban meaning by the trenchering of
                    the table all the trenchers used upon it. The omission is a decided improvement, I think, and is to
                    be found also in Hanmer. </p>


                <pb n="145" xml:id="VAB7399-151"/>
                <p>The opening lines of the third act, spoken by Ferdinand while employed in log-bearing for the love of
                    Miranda, conclude with a passage about which there has been much discussion:— <quote
                        rend="blockquote"><lg rend="center">
                            <l>"But these sweet thoughts do e'en refresh my labours</l>
                            <l>Most busy lest when I do it."</l>
                        </lg></quote> This is the version given by the earliest folio of 1623;in the folio of 1632 again
                    the passage stands,— <quote rend="center">"Most busy least when I do it,"</quote> which Mr. Collier
                    says is the usual reading of the passage. But Mr. Theobald's suggestion of reading it "Most busy
                    less" (i.e. least oppressed or absorbed with business) has been adopted by almost all subsequent
                    editors. Of this decided improvement on the original text Mr. Collier takes no notice, though it
                    involves but the change of one letter, but strongly commends the reading given in his corrected
                    folio, of— <quote rend="center">"Most busy—blest when I do it,"</quote> which he says is undoubtedly
                    the right reading <pb n="146" xml:id="VAB7399-152"/> of the passage corrupted by the accidental
                    omission of the letter <hi rend="i">b</hi> for two centuries and a half. I cannot at all agree that
                    this alteration is superior to Theobald's; the sense is more obscure, and the line is rendered harsh
                    and ungraceful by the abrupt break in it; whereas in Theobald's version the line is smooth to the
                    tongue, and quite as intelligible to the comprehension: while Sir Thomas Hanmer gives a far bolder
                    departure from the text, and not satisfied with changing one letter, alters the word <hi rend="i"
                        >most</hi> into its direct opposite, <hi rend="i">least</hi>— <quote rend="center">"Least busy
                        when I do it;"</quote> upon what authority, I know not. The passage of course has the same
                    meaning as Theobald's, but has not the merit of his near conformity to the text of the earliest
                    folio.</p>
                <p>The next emendation is in Prospero's speech to Ferdinand, when he bestows Miranda upon him,— <quote
                        rend="blockquote"><lg rend="center">
                            <l>"For I</l>
                            <l>Have given you a third of mine own life,"</l>
                        </lg></quote> which Mr. Collier's corrected folio reads a <pb n="147" xml:id="VAB7399-153"/>
                    <quote>"<hi rend="i">thread</hi> of my own life,"</quote> and all the modern editors so write the
                    passage. Mr. Collier, however, does not seem to accept the explanation which some commentators have
                    been satisfied with, that "third" in the old folio is simply an obsolete way of spelling thread, of
                    which Hawkins and Steevens both give examples.</p>
                <p>The exquisite lines addressed by Isis to Ceres in the Masque have afforded infinite scope to the
                    various editors of Shakespeare, after whose lucubrations on them nothing more restorative can be
                    imagined than to read the passage itself, redolent as it is with all the freshest fragrance of
                    earth, air, and water. <quote rend="center">"Thy banks with pionied and twilled brims,"</quote>
                    reads the original folio, which Mr. Collier's emended copy corrects into <quote>"pioned and tilled
                        brims,"</quote> pioned meaning, according, to him (and he can show Spencer for authority), dug,
                    or turned with a spade; the French words <foreign xml:lang="fr"><hi rend="i">pioche</hi></foreign>,
                    and <foreign xml:lang="fr"><hi rend="i">piocher</hi></foreign>, a rough spade, and to dig roughly,
                        <pb n="148" xml:id="VAB7399-154"/> are kindred to "pioned;" but besides that the use of that
                    word was certainly uncommon even in Shakespeare's time, the passage becomes tautological, as well as
                    rather prosaically agricultural, by this admission of a second word, "tilled," having so nearly the
                    meaning of the first. Shakespeare is not apt to be so poor in resources; some commentators insist
                    that twilled means twill pants, some species of flower, of which we have lost either the kind, or
                    this denomination; others convert the line into "peonied and lilied," giving many learned references
                    to the chaste virtues supposed to reside in peonies and lilies; and Sir Thomas Hanmer, having
                    perhaps some theory of his own to warrant the introduction of the gaudiest of Flora's darlings,
                    writes the line— <quote rend="center">"With peonied and tulip'd brims,"—</quote> a very violent
                    emendation of the text, to say nothing of the discord produced to the eye of the imagination by the
                    scarlet and yellow flames of this oriental flower blazing among the soft <pb n="149"
                        xml:id="VAB7399-155"/> elements of rural English beauty, which fill the preceding lines, and
                    amid which, tulips seem as little appropriate as they are to make <quote>"cold nymphs chaste
                        crowns."</quote></p>
                <p>But to return to Mr. Collier's proposed emendation of "pioned and tilled," his folio version was
                    given by Mr. Holt merely as a conjecture, and Steevens gives the line so corrected to him in one of
                    his notes. Upon the whole, the pleasantest, and therefore the best emendation of the line, when all
                    are equally uncertain, seems that which matches best with the tone and colouring of the rest of the
                    picture, and the peonied and lilied banks betrimmed by spongy April, are better in this respect than
                    anything else offered to Shakespeare's readers by the painful industry of his commentators.</p>
                <p>Of the blessing pronounced upon Ferdinand and Miranda, all the lines were originally attributed to
                    Juno. Theobald, with nice poetical discrimination, gives the latter portion of them to Ceres, a
                    change in which Sir Thomas Han- <pb n="150" xml:id="VAB7399-156"/> mer and all subsequent editors
                    coincide. Mr. Collier's folio, however, adheres to the original text in this particular; and the
                    general character of these emendations perhaps accounts sufficiently for this not being found among
                    them, suggested as it is, more by poetical feeling than critical acumen: whoever the unknown
                    commentator was, he was assuredly not a poet. Farther on, the folio alters the lines— <quote
                        rend="blockquote"><lg>
                            <l>"Spring come to you at the farthest</l>
                            <l>In the very end of harvest,"</l>
                        </lg></quote> to <quote>"<hi rend="i">Rain</hi> come to you at the farthest,"</quote> a change
                    which Mr. Collier pronounces "important," but which seems to me anything but an improvement. It is
                    very true, that rain before the <quote>"very end of harvest"</quote> would be unwelcome, but in that
                    sense the line ought to be—"Rain come to you at the <hi rend="i">earliest</hi>"—not at the <hi
                        rend="i">farthest; i.e.</hi> may your very first rain not fall till the harvest is carried. But
                    I think the passage simply means that spring shall rapidly succeed autumn, leaving the dreary winter
                    out of the calendar, a blessing Shakespeare has borrowed <pb n="151" xml:id="VAB7399-157"/> from
                    that proclaimed to the Jews in that wonderful and awful chapter of promises and threats, the 26th of
                    Leviticus, <quote>"And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto
                        the sowing time."</quote></p>
                <p>From the same chapter he takes the words, <quote>"Earth's increase."</quote> While observing upon
                    these biblical expressions, of which Caliban's picturesque <quote rend="blockquote"><lg

                        </lg></quote> is one borrowed from Genesis, it cannot but seem to every thoughtful reader of
                    Shakespeare how absolutely pervaded his language is with the spirit and form of that most precious
                    treasure of our tongue, the English Bible. It has been a question how much of Greek—if any— how much
                    of Latin, and the modern French and Italian languages, our great dramatist pos- sessed; and little
                    proof can be found of his having anything but the most superficial acquaintance with any language
                    but his own; <pb n="152" xml:id="VAB7399-158"/> but it is impossible to read his plays attentively
                    without perceiving that his mind was absolutely imbued with the style of thought and expression of
                    our Bible. And strange to say, an intimate familiarity with the peculiar characteristics of its
                    language is infinitely more perceptible in his profane (not to use the word in any but its technical
                    sense) plays, than in the great sacred epic of our English tongue, the <hi rend="i">Paradise
                        Lost</hi>, whose learned author had assuredly the Bible in his heart, but so great a store of
                    Greek, Latin, and Italian lore in his head, that though the subject of his poem is purely biblical,
                    the style seldom, if ever, recalls that of the Bible; while in reading his noble Jewish tragedy of
                    the Samson, the Greek dramatists occur to us half a dozen times for once that we are reminded of the
                    wild story of the Israelitish hero and his Philistian persecutors as it stands in the book of
                    Judges.</p>
                <p>And well it is for us and for him that our profane playwright knew his Bible as he did;— that book,
                    of which one of the most eminent <pb n="153" xml:id="VAB7399-159"/> seceders from the Church of
                    England—John Henry Newman—said, that it was the most formidable obstacle that Roman Catholic
                    propagandists have to encounter in converting English Protestants;—their Bible, of which the pure
                    and noble language becomes betimes so familiar to their minds and mouths, that it is impossible to
                    present to them the truth clothed in any words which can approach in lucid sublimity those that lie,
                    God be thanked! on every cottage chimney throughout the English land.</p>
                <p>The copious inspiration Shakespeare drew from this source has made his plays the lay Bible of
                    Englishmen; and it is curious enough that the ignorant among them misquote him for Holy Writ
                    sometimes (but never Milton), seduced, like the worthy Judge in Texas, by the similitude of speech
                    and spirit, into substituting the words of poetical for those of sacred inspiration.</p>

                    Malone and the later editors all concur in the change, so that the authority of the folio corrector
                    seems hardly needed to recommend it.</p>
                <p>In the folio's next emendation, namely, that of <hi rend="i">winding</hi> instead of <hi rend="i"
                        >windring</hi> brooks in the speech of Iris, the Oxford edition again has the identical
                    correction proposed by Mr. Collier's authority, and Steevens says that all the modern editors read
                    winding for windring, but himself proposes the word wand'ring, which I prefer, for, like winding, it
                    does but change one letter of the original text, but at the same time gives the line a fuller and
                    more musical sound, by the substitution of the vowel <hi rend="i">a</hi> for the vowel <hi rend="i"
                        >i</hi> in the word—a consideration by no means to be overlooked in verse, which is musical
                    speech,—and dramatic verse, which is written expressly to be spoken; of course "other things being
                    equal."</p>

                <p>In going through the second and third acts of the <hi rend="i">Tempest</hi> with Mr. Collier's volume
                    of corrections, I find five only out of sixteen which appear to me of any peculiar value tested by
                    common sense; the rest I think are either indifferent or objectionable, and of the five which are
                    decided improvements, every one is found in Hanmer and other of the early editors.</p>
                <p>Before closing my observations on the second and third Acts of the <hi rend="i">Tempest</hi>, I would
                    suggest to the reader's consideration the curious felicity of the scene when Ferdinand and Miranda
                    acknowledge their affection to each other. I mean in the harmonious contrast between a young prince,
                    bred in a Court, himself the centre of a sphere of the most artificial civilisation, and a girl not
                    only without any knowledge of the world and society, but even without previous knowledge of the
                    existence of any created man but her father and Caliban.</p>
                <p>Brought up in all but utter solitude, under no influence but that of her wise and loving <pb n="156"
                        xml:id="VAB7399-162"/> father on earth, and her wise and loving Father in Heaven, Miranda
                    exhibits no more coyness in her acceptance of Ferdinand's overtures than properly belongs to the
                    instinctive modesty of her sex, unenhanced by any of the petty pretty arts of coquetry and assumed
                    shyness, which are the express result of artificial female training. The simple emotion of
                    bashfulness, indeed, which (in spite of her halfastonished, half-delighted exclamation— <quote
                        rend="center">"Do you love me?"</quote> that elicits her lover's passionate declaration) causes
                    her to <quote>"weep at what she's glad of,"</quote> is so little comprehensible to herself, that she
                    shakes it off with something like self-reproach, as an involuntary disingenuousness: <quote>"Hence,
                        bashful <hi rend="i">cunning</hi>;"</quote> and then with that most pathetic and exquisite
                    invocation to <quote>"plain and holy innocence"</quote> offers her life to her lover with the
                    perfect devotion and humility of the true womanly nature:— <quote rend="blockquote"><lg

                    <pb n="157" xml:id="VAB7399-163"/> In the purity and simplicity of this <quote>"tender of
                        affection,"</quote> Ferdinand made acquaintance with a species of modesty to which assuredly
                    none of those ladies of the Court of Naples, <quote>"whom he had eyed with best regard,"</quote> had
                    ever introduced him; and indeed to them Miranda's proceeding might very probably have appeared
                    highly unlady-like, as I have heard it pronounced more than once by—ladies. The young prince,
                    however, was probably himself surprised for a little while into a sphere of earnest sincerity, as
                    different from the artificial gallantry with which he had encountered the former objects of his
                    admiration as the severe manual labour he was undergoing for the sake of Miranda was different from
                    the inflated offers of service, and professions of slavery, which were the jargon of civilised
                    courtesy;—that species of language which Olivia reproves when she says <quote rend="blockquote"><lg

                    challenge.</p>
                <p>It is not a little edifying to reflect how different Prospero's treatment of these young people's
                    case would have been, if, instead of only the most extraordinary of conjurors, he had been the most
                    commonplace of scheming matrons of the present day. He, poor man, alarmed at the sudden conquest
                    Ferdinand makes of his child, and perceiving that he must <quote>"this swift business uneasy make,
                        lest two light winning make the prize light,"</quote> can bethink himself of no better expedient
                    than reducing <pb n="159" xml:id="VAB7399-165"/> the poor young prince into a sort of supple-
                    mentary Caliban, a hewer of wood and drawer of water:—now, a modern chaperon would merely have had
                    to intimate to a well-trained modern young lady, that it would be as well not to give the young
                    gentleman too much encouragement, till his pretensions to the throne of Naples could really be made
                    out (his straying about without any Duke of Newcastle, and very wet, was a good deal like a mere
                    adventurer, you know); and I am pretty certain that the judicious mamma or female guardian of Miss
                    Penelope Smith, the fair British Islander who became Princess of Capua, pursued no other system of
                    provocation by repression. An expert matrimonial schemer of the present day, I say, would have
                    devised by these means a species of trial by torture for poor Ferdinand, to which his "sweating
                    labour" in Prospero's patient log man would have been luxurious idleness.</p>
                <p>But Prospero was after all a mere man, and knew no better than to bring up Miranda to <pb n="160"
                        xml:id="VAB7399-166"/> speak the truth, and the fair child had been so holily trained by him,
                    that her surrender of herself to the man she loves is so little feminine after the approved feminine
                    fashion, that it is simply angelic.</p>
                <p>That Shakespeare, who indeed knew all things, knew very well the difference between, such a creature
                    as Miranda and a well-brought up young lady, is plain enough, when he makes poor Juliet, after her
                    passionate confession of love made to the stars, and overheard by Romeo, apologise to him with quite
                    pathetic mortification for not having been more "strange." She regrets extremely her unqualified
                    expressions of affection,—assures Romeo that nothing would have induced her to have spoken the
                    truth, if she had only known he heard her, and even offers, if it can be the least satisfac- tion to
                    him, and redeem what she may have lost in his esteem by her frankness, to <quote>"frown and be
                        perverse and say him nay,"</quote>—and in short has evidently shocked her own conven- tional
                    prejudices quite as much as she fears she <pb n="161" xml:id="VAB7399-167"/> has his, by not having
                    had a chance of playing a thousand fantastical tricks about a passion which is thenceforth to govern
                    her life, and give her over to her early death. But then Juliet was the flower of Veronese young
                    ladies, and her good mother, and gossiping nurse, were not likely to have neglected her education to
                    the tune of letting her speak the truth without due preparation. Miranda is to be excused as a
                    savage—probably Ferdinand thought her excusable.</p>
                <p>To any one desirous of enhancing by comparison their appreciation of the <hi rend="i">Tempest</hi>, I
                    would recommend, not the perusal of, but a glance into, Dryden and D'Avenant's alteration of it,
                    "The Enchanted Island." This gross burlesque, perpetrated by a man of singular genius, who had
                    indeed "fallen on evil days," and ventured to lay unhallowed hands on Shakespeare's work, is the
                    finest comment by contrast that could be devised upon his divine poem. It was my misfortune, many
                    years ago, <pb n="162" xml:id="VAB7399-168"/> to see this coarse and ludicrous parody represented on
                    the English stage, whence it is to be hoped the better taste of later days has banished it for ever.

                    preparation had been made, even for that night, the spirit of the whole scene, from its beginning to

                    invincible hope of youth, and the anticipation of the <quote>"joy past joy,"</quote> which beckon
                    him, rise triumphant above all the misery and culminate in the farewell.</p>
                <p>In the parting scene in Juliet's room, she languid with passion, wan with woe, beneath his reiterated
                    tender offering of his life to her, the throbbing of the natural desire to live,—here again his
                    self-sacrifice is the sentiment, her selfishness the passion of love.</p>
                <p>The opening of the fifth act is a gentle, tender, melancholy ecstasy, a blending of exquisite

                    killing him,—all are lingering and broken touches of the sweet, tender, pathetic nature, choked with
                    the bitterness of his fate, and breaking through the settled, sullen, savage hardness of his
                    despair.</p>
                <p>I am not careless, as I may have appeared to you, of the value of the text of Shakespeare; but, poet,
                    philosopher, and playwright as he was, your dealings with him are in the latter capacity only. You
                    need not be afraid of eliminating the two nobler elements of his works; omit what you will, that is
                        <hi rend="i">impossible</hi>.</p>

                    from the errors of his time and place. As for occasional breaking of his lines, my excitement the
                    other evening made them more frequent than they really were; and a good musician should know how to
                    redeem a faulty line, in some measure, by his utterance.</p>
