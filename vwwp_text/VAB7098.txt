                To Clementina Black.
                
                    More blest than was of old Diogenes,
                    I have not held my lantern up in vain.
                    Not mine, at least, this evil—to complain :
                    “There is none honest among all of these.”
                
                
                    Our hopes go down that sailed before the breeze ;
                    Our creeds upon the rock are rent in twain ;
                    Something it is, if at the last remain
                    One floating spar cast up by hungry seas.
                
                
                    The secret of our being, who can tell ?
                    To praise the gods and Fate is not my part ;
                    Evil I see, and pain ; within my heart
                    There is no voice that whispers : “All is well.”
                
                
                    Yet fair are days in summer ; and more fair
                    The growths of human goodness here and there.

                            A London Plane?Tree.
                            
                                GREEN is the plane?tree in the square,
                                The other trees are brown ;
                                They droop and pine for country air ;
                                The plane?tree loves the town.
                            
                            
                                Here from my garret?pane, I mark
                                The plane?tree bud and blow,
                                Shed her recuperative bark,
                                And spread her shade below.
                            
                            
                                Among her branches, in and out,
                                The city breezes play ;
                                The dun fog wraps her round about ;
                                Above, the smoke curls grey.
                            
                            
                                Others the country take for choice,
                                And hold the town in scorn ;
                                But she has listened to the voice
                                On city breezes borne.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            London in July.
                            
                                WHAT ails my senses thus to cheat ?
                                What is it ails the place,
                                That all the people in the street
                                Should wear one woman’s face ?
                            
                            
                                The London trees are dusty?brown
                                Beneath the summer sky ;
                                My love, she dwells in London town,
                                Nor leaves it in July.
                            
                            
                                O various and intricate maze,
                                Wide waste of square and street ;
                                Where, missing through unnumbered days,
                                We twain at last may meet !
                            
                            
                                And who cries out on crowd and mart ?
                                Who prates of stream and sea ?
                                The summer in the city’s heart—
                                That is enough for me.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            A March Day in London.
                            
                                THE east wind blows in the street to?day ;
                                The sky is blue, yet the town looks grey.
                                ’Tis the wind of ice, the wind of fire,
                                Of cold despair and of hot desire,
                                Which chills the flesh to aches and pains,
                                And sends a fever through all the veins.
                            
                            
                                From end to end, with aimless feet,
                                All day long have I paced the street.
                                My limbs are weary, but in my breast
                                Stirs the goad of a mad unrest.
                                I would give anything to stay
                                The little wheel that turns in my brain ;
                                The little wheel that turns all day,
                                That turns all night with might and main.
                            
                            
                                What is the thing I fear, and why ?
                                Nay, but the world is all awry—
                                The wind’s in the east, the sun’s in the sky.
                            
                            
                            
                                The gas?lamps gleam in a golden line ;
                                The ruby lights of the hansoms shine,
                                Glance, and flicker like fire?flies bright ;
                                The wind has fallen with the night,
                                And once again the town seems fair
                                Thwart the mist that hangs i’ the air.
                            
                            
                                And o’er, at last, my spirit steals
                                A weary peace ; peace that conceals
                                Within its inner depths the grain
                                Of hopes that yet shall flower again.

                                SOME men to carriages aspire ;
                                On some the costly hansoms wait ;
                                Some seek a fly, on job or hire ;
                                Some mount the trotting steed, elate.
                                I envy not the rich and great,
                                A wandering minstrel, poor and free,
                                I am contented with my fate—
                                An omnibus suffices me.
                            
                            
                                In winter days of rain and mire
                                I find within a corner strait ;
                                The ’busmen know me and my lyre
                                From Brompton to the Bull?and?Gate.
                                When summer comes, I mount in state
                                The topmost summit, whence I see
                                Crœsus look up, compassionate—
                                An omnibus suffices me.
                            
                            
                            
                                I mark, untroubled by desire,
                                Lucullus’ phaeton and its freight.
                                The scene whereof I cannot tire,
                                The human tale of love and hate,
                                The city pageant, early and late
                                Unfolds itself, rolls by, to be
                                A pleasure deep and delicate.
                                An omnibus suffices me.
                            
                            
                                Princess, your splendour you require,
                                I, my simplicity ; agree
                                Neither to rate lower nor higher.
                                An omnibus suffices me.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            Ballade of a Special Edition.
                            
                                HE comes ; I hear him up the street—
                                Bird of ill omen, flapping wide
                                The pinion of a printed sheet,
                                His hoarse note scares the eventide.
                                Of slaughter, theft, and suicide
                                He is the herald and the friend ;
                                Now he vociferates with pride—
                                A double murder in Mile End !
                            
                            
                                A hanging to his soul is sweet ;
                                His gloating fancy’s fain to bide
                                Where human?freighted vessels meet,
                                And misdirected trains collide.
                                With Shocking Accidents supplied,
                                He tramps the town from end to end.
                                How often have we heard it cried—
                                A double murder in Mile End.
                            
                            
                            
                                War loves he ; victory or defeat,
                                So there be loss on either side.
                                His tale of horrors incomplete,
                                Imagination’s aid is tried.
                                Since no distinguished man has died,
                                And since the Fates, relenting, send
                                No great catastrophe, he’s spied
                                This double murder in Mile End.
                            
                            
                                Fiend, get thee gone ! no more repeat
                                Those sounds which do mine ears offend.
                                It is apocryphal, you cheat,
                                Your double murder in Mile End.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            Straw in the Street.
                            
                                STRAW in the street where I pass to?day
                                Dulls the sound of the wheels and feet.
                                ’Tis for a failing life they lay
                                Straw in the street.
                            
                            
                                Here, where the pulses of London beat,
                                Someone strives with the Presence grey ;
                                Ah, is it victory or defeat ?
                            
                            
                                The hurrying people go their way,
                                Pause and jostle and pass and greet ;
                                For life, for death, are they treading, say
                                Straw in the street ?
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            Between the Showers.
                            
                                BETWEEN the showers I went my way,
                                The glistening street was bright with flowers ;
                                It seemed that March had turned to May
                                Between the showers.
                            
                            
                                Above the shining roofs and towers
                                The blue broke forth athwart the grey ;
                                Birds carolled in their leafless bowers.
                            
                            
                                Hither and tither, swift and gay,
                                The people chased the changeful hours ;
                                And you, you passed and smiled that day,
                                Between the showers.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            Out of Town.
                            
                                OUT of town the sky was bright and blue,
                                Never fog?cloud, lowering, thick, was seen to frown
                                    ;
                                Nature dons a garb of gayer hue,
                                Out of town.
                            
                            
                                Spotless lay the snow on field and down,
                                Pure and keen the air above it blew ;
                                All wore peace and beauty for a crown.
                            
                            
                                London sky, marred by smoke, veiled from view,
                                London snow, trodden thin, dingy brown,
                                Whence that strange unrest at thoughts of you
                                Out of town ?
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            The Piano?Organ.
                            
                                MY student?lamp is lighted,
                                The books and papers are spread ;
                                A sound comes floating upwards,
                                Chasing the thoughts from my head.
                            
                            
                                I open the garret window,
                                Let the music in and the moon ;
                                See the woman grin for coppers,
                                While the man grinds out the tune.
                            
                            
                                Grind me a dirge or a requiem,
                                Or a funeral?march sad and slow,
                                But not, O not, that waltz tune
                                I heard so long ago.
                            
                            
                                I stand upright by the window,
                                The moonlight streams in wan :—
                                O God ! with its changeless rise and fall
                                The tune twirls on and on.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            London Poets.
                            (In Memoriam.)
                            
                                THEY trod the streets and squares where now I tread,
                                With weary hearts, a little while ago ;
                                When, thin and grey, the melancholy snow
                                Clung to the leafless branches overhead ;
                                Or when the smoke?veiled sky grew stormy?red
                                In autumn ; with a re?arisen woe
                                Wrestled, what time the passionate spring winds blow ;
                                And paced scorched stones in summer :—they are dead.
                            
                            
                                The sorrow of their souls to them did seem
                                As real as mine to me, as permanent.
                                To?day, it is the shadow of a dream,
                                The half?forgotten breath of breezes spent.
                                So shall another soothe his woe supreme—
                                “No more he comes, who this way came and went.”

                            To E.M.S.
                            
                                HERE, where your garden fenced about and still is,
                                Here, where the unmoved summer air is sweet
                                With mixed delight of lavender and lilies,
                                Dreaming I linger in the noontide heat.
                            
                            
                                Of many summers are the trees recorders,
                                The turf a carpet many summers wove ;
                                Old?fashioned blossoms cluster in the borders,
                                Love?in?a?mist and crimson?hearted clove.
                            
                            
                                All breathes of peace and sunshine in the present,
                                All tells of bygone peace and bygone sun,
                                Of fruitful years accomplished, budding, crescent,
                                Of gentle seasons passing one by one.
                            
                            
                            
                                Fain would I bide, but ever in the distance
                                A ceaseless voice is sounding clear and low ;—
                                The city calls me with her old persistence,
                                The city calls me—I arise and go.
                            
                            
                                Of gentler souls this fragrant peace is guerdon ;
                                For me, the roar and hurry of the town,
                                Wherein more lightly seems to press the burden
                                Of individual life that weighs me down.
                            
                            
                                I leave your garden to the happier comers
                                For whom its silent sweets are anodyne.
                                Shall I return? Who knows, in other summers
                                The peace my spirit longs for may be mine ?
                            
                        
                    

                
            
            
                

                    
                        
                        Love, Dreams, & Death.
                        
                            
                                
                                    Ah Love! could you and I with Him conspire
                                    To grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,
                                    Would not we shatter it to bits—and then
                                    Re?mould it nearer to the Heart’s Desire!

                                    SHE, who so long has lain
                                    Stone?stiff with folded wings,
                                    Within my heart again
                                    The brown bird wakes and sings.
                                
                                
                                    Brown nightingale, whose strain
                                    Is heard by day, by night,
                                    She sings of joy and pain,
                                    Of sorrow and delight.

                                    ’Tis true,—in other days
                                    Have I unbarred the door ;
                                    He knows the walks and ways—
                                    Love has been here before.
                                
                                
                                    Love blest and love accurst
                                    Was here in days long past ;
                                    This time is not the first,
                                    But this time is the last.

                                IF I were a woman of old,
                                What prayers I would pray for you, dear ;
                                My pitiful tribute behold—
                                Not a prayer, but a tear.
                            
                            
                                The pitiless order of things,
                                Whose laws we may change not nor break,
                                Alone I could face it—it wrings
                                My heart for your sake.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            Youth and Love.
                            WHAT does youth know of love ?
                            Little enough, I trow !
                            He plucks the myrtle for his brow,
                            For his forehead the rose.
                            Nay, but of love
                            It is not youth who knows.

                                        Believe me, this was true last night,
                                        Tho’ it is false to?day.

                                A FAIR dream to my chamber flew :
                                Such a crowd of folk that stirred,
                                Jested, fluttered ; only you,
                                You alone of all that band,
                                Calm and silent, spake no word.
                                Only once you neared my place,
                                And your hand one moment’s space
                                Sought the fingers of my hand ;
                                Your eyes flashed to mine ; I knew
                                All was well between us two.
                            
                            
                                * * * * *
                                On from dream to dream I past,
                                But the first sweet vision cast
                                Mystic radiance o’er the last.
                            
                            
                                * * * * *
                                When I woke the pale night lay
                                Still, expectant of the day ;
                                All about the chamber hung
                                Tender shade of twilight gloom ;
                                The fair dream hovered round me, clung
                                To my thought like faint perfume :—
                                Like sweet odours, such as cling
                                To the void flask, which erst encloses
                                Attar of rose ; or the pale string
                                Of amber which has lain with roses.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            On the Threshold.
                            O GOD, my dream ! I dreamed that you were dead ;
                            Your mother hung above the couch and wept
                            Whereon you lay all white, and garlanded
                            With blooms of waxen whiteness. I had crept
                            Up to your chamber?door, which stood ajar,
                            And in the doorway watched you from afar,
                            Nor dared advance to kiss your lips and brow.
                            I had no part nor lot in you, as now ;
                            Death had not broken between us the old bar ;
                            Nor torn from out my heart the old, cold sense
                            Of your misprision and my impotence.
                        
                        
                        
                            The Birch?Tree at Loschwitz.
                            
                                AT Loschwitz above the city
                                The air is sunny and chill ;
                                The birch?trees and the pine?trees
                                Grow thick upon the hill.
                            
                            
                                Lone and tall, with silver stem,
                                A birch?tree stands apart ;
                                The passionate wind of spring?time
                                Stirs in its leafy heart.
                            
                            
                                I lean against the birch?tree,
                                My arms around it twine ;
                                It pulses, and leaps, and quivers,
                                Like a human heart to mine.
                            
                            
                                One moment I stand, then sudden
                                Let loose mine arms that cling :
                                O God ! the lonely hillside,
                                The passionate wind of spring !
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            In the Night.
                            
                                CRUEL? I think there never was a cheating
                                More cruel, thro’ all the weary days than this !
                                This is no dream, my heart kept on repeating,
                                But sober certainty of waking bliss.
                            
                            
                                Dreams? O, I know their faces — goodly seeming,
                                Vaporous, whirled on many?coloured wings ;
                                I have had dreams before, this is no dreaming,
                                But daylight gladness that the daylight brings.
                            
                            
                                What ails my love ; what ails her ? She is paling ;
                                Faint grows her face, and slowly seems to fade !
                                I cannot clasp her—stretch out unavailing
                                My arms across the silence and the shade.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            Borderland.
                            AM I waking, am I sleeping ?
                            As the first faint dawn comes creeping
                            Thro’ the pane, I am aware
                            Of an unseen presence hovering,
                            Round, above, in the dusky air :
                            A downy bird, with an odorous wing,
                            That fans my forehead, and sheds perfume,
                            As sweet as love, as soft as death,
                            Drowsy?slow through the summer?gloom.
                            My heart in some dream?rapture saith,
                            It is she. Half in a swoon,
                            I spread my arms in slow delight.—
                            O prolong, prolong the night,
                            For the nights are short in June !
                        
                        
                        
                            At Dawn.
                            
                                IN the night I dreamed of you ;
                                All the place was filled
                                With your presence ; in my heart
                                The strife was stilled.
                            
                            
                                All night I have dreamed of you ;
                                Now the morn is grey.—
                                How shall I arise and face
                                The empty day?
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            Last Words.

                                THESE blossoms that I bring,
                                This song that here I sing,
                                These tears that now I shed,
                                I give unto the dead.
                            
                            
                                There is no more to be done,
                                Nothing beneath the sun,
                                All the long ages through,
                                Nothing—by me for you.
                            
                            
                                The tale is told to the end ;
                                This, ev’n, I may not know—
                                If we were friend and friend,
                                If we were foe and foe.
                            
                            
                                All’s done with utterly,
                                All’s done with. Death to me
                                Was ever Death indeed ;
                                To me no kindly creed
                            
                            
                            
                                Consolatory was given.
                                You were of earth, not Heaven. . . .
                                This dreary day, things seem
                                Vain shadows in a dream,
                            
                            
                                Or some strange, pictured show ;
                                And mine own tears that flow,
                                My hidden tears that fall,
                                The vainest of them all.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            June.
                            
                                LAST June I saw your face three times ;
                                Three times I touched your hand ;
                                Now, as before, May month is o’er,
                                And June is in the land.
                            
                            
                                O many Junes shall come and go,
                                Flow’r?footed o’er the mead ;
                                O many Junes for me, to whom
                                Is length of days decreed.
                            
                            
                                There shall be sunlight, scent of rose ;
                                Warm mist of summer rain ;
                                Only this change—I shall not look
                                Upon your face again.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            A Reminiscence.
                            
                                IT is so long gone by, and yet
                                How clearly now I see it all !
                                The glimmer of your cigarette,
                                The little chamber, narrow and tall.
                            
                            
                                Perseus ; your picture in its frame ;
                                (How near they seem and yet how far !)
                                The blaze of kindled logs ; the flame
                                Of tulips in a mighty jar.
                            
                            
                                Florence and spring?time : surely each
                                Glad things unto the spirit saith.
                                Why did you lead me in your speech
                                To these dark mysteries of death ?
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            The Sequel to “A Reminiscence.”
                            
                                NOT in the street and not in the square,
                                The street and square where you went and came ;
                                With shuttered casement your house stands bare,
                                Men hush their voice when they speak your name.
                            
                            
                                I, too, can play at the vain pretence,
                                Can feign you dead ; while a voice sounds clear
                                In the inmost depths of my heart : Go hence,
                                Go, find your friend who is far from here.
                            
                            
                                Not here, but somewhere where I can reach !
                                Can a man with motion, hearing and sight,
                                And a thought that answered my thought and speech,
                                Be utterly lost and vanished quite ?
                            
                            
                            
                                Whose hand was warm in my hand last week ? . . . 
                                My heart beat fast as I neared the gate—
                                Was it this I had come to seek,
                                “A stone that stared with your name and date ;”
                            
                            
                                A hideous, turfless, fresh?made mound ;
                                A silence more cold than the wind that blew ?
                                What had I lost, and what had I found ?
                                My flowers that mocked me fell to the ground—
                                Then, and then only, my spirit knew.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            In the Mile End Road.
                            
                                HOW like her ! But ’tis she herself,
                                Comes up the crowded street,
                                How little did I think, the morn,
                                My only love to meet !
                            
                            
                                Whose else that motion and that mien ?
                                Whose else that airy tread ?
                                For one strange moment I forgot
                                My only love was dead.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            Contradictions.
                            NOW, even, I cannot think it true,
                            My friend, that there is no more you.
                            Almost as soon were no more I,
                            Which were, of course, absurdity !
                            Your place is bare, you are not seen,
                            Your grave, I’m told, is growing green ;
                            And both for you and me, you know,
                            There’s no Above and no Below.
                            That you are dead must be inferred,
                            And yet my thought rejects the word.
                        
                        
                        
                            Twilight.
                            
                                SO Mary died last night ! To?day
                                The news has travelled here.
                                And Robert died at Michaelmas,
                                And Walter died last year.
                            
                            
                                I went at sunset up the lane,
                                I lingered by the stile ;
                                I saw the dusky fields that stretched
                                Before me many a mile.
                            
                            
                                I leaned against the stile, and thought
                                Of her whose soul had fled—
                                I knew that years on years must pass
                                Or e’er I should be dead.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            In September.
                            THE sky is silver?grey ; the long
                            Slow waves caress the shore.—
                            On such a day as this I have been glad,
                            Who shall be glad no more.
                        
                    
                
            
            
            
                


                    
                        Moods and Thoughts.
                        
                            
                                
                                    I sent my Soul through the Invisible
                                    Some letter of that After?life to spell ;
                                    And by and by my Soul returned to me,
                                    And answered, “I Myself am Heaven and Hell.”
                                
                                Omar Khayyám.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            The Old House.
                            
                                IN through the porch and up the silent stair ;
                                Little is changed, I know so well the ways ;—
                                Here, the dead came to meet me ; it was there
                                The dream was dreamed in unforgotten days.
                            
                            
                                But who is this that hurries on before,
                                A flitting shade the brooding shades among ?—
                                She turned,—I saw her face,—O God, it wore
                                The face I used to wear when I was young !
                            
                            
                                I thought my spirit and my heart were tamed
                                To deadness ; dead the pangs that agonise.
                                The old grief springs to choke me,—I am shamed
                                Before that little ghost with eager eyes.
                            
                            
                                O turn away, let her not see, not know !
                                How should she bear it, how should understand ?
                                O hasten down the stairway, haste and go,
                                And leave her dreaming in the silent land.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            Lohengrin.
                            
                                BACK to the mystic shore beyond the main
                                The mystic craft has sped, and left no trace.
                                Ah, nevermore may she behold his face,
                                Nor touch his hand, nor hear his voice again !
                                With hidden front she crouches ; all in vain
                                The proffered balm. A vessel nears the place ;
                                They bring her young, lost brother ; see her strain
                                The new?found nursling in a close embrace.
                            
                            
                                God, we have lost Thee with much questioning.
                                In vain we seek Thy trace by sea and land,
                                And in Thine empty fanes where no men sing.
                                What shall we do through all the weary days ?
                                Thus wail we and lament. Our eyes we raise,
                                And, lo, our Brother with an outstretched hand !

                                        A haunted town thou art to me.

                                TO?DAY in Florence all the air
                                Is soft with spring, with sunlight fair ;
                                In the tall street gay folks are met ;
                                Duomo and Tower gleam overhead,
                                Like jewels in the city set,
                                Fair?hued and many?faceted.
                                Against the old grey stones are piled
                                February violets, pale and sweet,
                                Whose scent of earth in woodland wild
                                Is wafted up and down the street.
                                The city’s heart is glad ; my own
                                Sits lightly on its bosom’s throne.

                                Why is it that I see to?day,
                                Imaged as clear as in a dream,
                                A little city far away,
                                A churlish sky, a sluggish stream,
                                
                                Tall clust’ring trees and gardens fair,
                                Dark birds that circle in the air,
                                Grey towers and fanes ; on either hand,
                                Stretches of wind?swept meadow?land ?
                            
                            
                                * * * * * * *
                                Oh, who can sound the human breast ?
                                And this strange truth must be confessed ;
                                That city do I love the best
                                Wherein my heart was heaviest !
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            In the Black Forest.
                            
                                I LAY beneath the pine trees,
                                And looked aloft, where, through
                                The dusky, clustered tree?tops,
                                Gleamed rent, gay rifts of blue.
                            
                            
                                I shut my eyes, and a fancy
                                Fluttered my sense around :
                                “I lie here dead and buried,
                                And this is churchyard ground.
                            
                            
                                “I am at rest for ever ;
                                Ended the stress and strife.”
                                Straight I fell to and sorrowed
                                For the pitiful past life.
                            
                            
                                Right wronged, and knowledge wasted ;
                                Wise labour spurned for ease ;
                                The sloth and the sin and the failure ;
                                Did I grow sad for these ?
                            
                            
                                They had made me sad so often ;
                                Not now they made me sad ;
                                My heart was full of sorrow
                                For joy it never had.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            Captivity.
                            
                                THE lion remembers the forest,
                                The lion in chains ;
                                To the bird that is captive a vision
                                Of woodland remains.
                            
                            
                                One strains with his strength at the fetter,
                                In impotent rage ;
                                One flutters in flights of a moment,
                                And beats at the cage.
                            
                            
                                If the lion were loosed from the fetter,
                                To wander again ;
                                He would seek the wide silence and shadow
                                Of his jungle in vain.
                            
                            
                                He would rage in his fury, destroying ;
                                Let him rage, let him roam !
                                Shall he traverse the pitiless mountain,
                                Or swim through the foam ?
                            
                            
                                If they opened the cage and the casement,
                                And the bird flew away ;
                                He would come back at evening, heartbroken,
                                A captive for aye.
                            
                            
                            
                                Would come if his kindred had spared him,
                                Free birds from afar—
                                There was wrought what is stronger than iron
                                In fetter and bar.
                            
                            
                                I cannot remember my country,
                                The land whence I came ;
                                Whence they brought me and chained me and made me
                                Nor wild thing nor tame.
                            
                            
                                This only I know of my country,
                                This only repeat :—
                                It was free as the forest, and sweeter
                                Than woodland retreat.
                            
                            
                                When the chain shall at last be broken,
                                The window set wide ;
                                And I step in the largeness and freedom
                                Of sunlight outside ;
                            
                            
                                Shall I wander in vain for my country ?
                                Shall I seek and not find ?
                                Shall I cry for the bars that encage me
                                The fetters that bind ?
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            The Two Terrors.
                            
                                TWO terrors fright my soul by night and day :
                                The first is Life, and with her come the years ;
                                A weary, winding train of maidens they,
                                With forward?fronting eyes, too sad for tears ;
                                Upon whose kindred faces, blank and grey,
                                The shadow of a kindred woe appears.
                                Death is the second terror ; who shall say
                                What form beneath the shrouding mantle nears ?
                            
                            
                                Which way she turn, my soul finds no relief,
                                My smitten soul may not be comforted ;
                                Alternately she swings from grief to grief,
                                And, poised between them, sways from dread to dread.
                                For there she dreads because she knows ; and here,
                                Because she knows not, inly faints with fear.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            The Promise of Sleep.
                            
                                Put the sweet thoughts from out thy mind,
                                The dreams from out thy breast ;
                                No joy for thee—but thou shalt find
                                Thy rest
                            
                            
                                ALL day I could not work for woe,
                                I could not work nor rest ;
                                The trouble drove me to and fro,
                                Like a leaf on the storm’s breast.
                            
                            
                                Night came and saw my sorrow cease ;
                                Sleep in the chamber stole ;
                                Peace crept about my limbs, and peace
                                Fell on my stormy soul.
                            
                            
                                And now I think of only this,—
                                How I again may woo
                                The gentle sleep— who promises
                                That death is gentle too.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            The Last Judgment.
                            
                                WITH beating heart and lagging feet,
                                Lord, I approach the Judgment?seat.
                                All bring hither the fruits of toil,
                                Measures of wheat and measures of oil ;
                            
                            
                                Gold and jewels and precious wine ;
                                No hands bare like these hands of mine.
                                The treasure I have nor weighs nor gleams :
                                Lord, I can bring you only dreams.
                            
                            
                                In days of spring, when my blood ran high,
                                I lay in the grass and looked at the sky,
                                And dreamed that my love lay by my side—
                                My love was false, and then she died.
                            
                            
                                All the heat of the summer through,
                                I dreamed she lived, that her heart was true
                                Throughout the hours of the day I slept,
                                But woke in the night, at times, and wept.
                            
                            
                            
                                The nights and days, they went and came,
                                I lay in shadow and dreamed of fame ;
                                And heard men passing the lonely place,
                                Who marked me not and my hidden face.
                            
                            
                                My strength waxed faint, my hair grew grey ;
                                Nothing but dreams by night and day.
                                Some men sicken, with wine and food ;
                                I starved on dreams, and found them good.
                            
                            
                                * * * * * * *
                                This is the tale I have to tell—
                                Show the fellow the way to hell.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            Felo de Se.
                            With Apologies to Mr. Swinburne.
                            FOR repose I have sighed and have struggled ; have sigh’d
                                and have struggled in vain
                            I am held in the Circle of Being and caught in the Circle of
                                Pain.
                            I was wan and weary with life ; my sick soul yearned for death ;
                            I was weary of women and war and the sea and the wind’s wild breath
                                ;
                            I cull’d sweet poppies and crush’d them, the blood ran rich and red
                                :—
                            And I cast it in crystal chalice and drank of it till I was dead.
                            And the mould of the man was mute, pulseless in ev’ry part,
                            The long limbs lay on the sand with an eagle eating the heart.
                            
                            Repose for the rotting head and peace for the putrid breast,
                            But for that which is “I” indeed the gods have decreed no rest ;
                            No rest but an endless aching, a sorrow which grows amain :—
                            I am caught in the Circle of Being and held in the Circle of
                                Pain.
                            Bitter indeed is Life, and bitter of Life the breath,
                            But give me life and its ways and its men, if this be Death.
                            Wearied I once of the Sun and the voices which clamour’d around :
                            Give them me back—in the sightless depths there is neither light nor
                                sound.
                            Sick is my soul, and sad and feeble and faint as it felt
                            When (far, dim day) in the fair flesh?fane of the body it dwelt.
                            But then I could run to the shore, weeping and weary and weak ;
                            See the waves’ blue sheen and feel the breath of the breeze on my
                                cheek :
                            Could wail with the wailing wind ; strike sharply the hands in
                                despair ;
                            
                            Could shriek with the shrieking blast, grow frenzied and tear the
                                hair ;
                            Could fight fierce fights with the foe or clutch at a human hand
                                ;
                            And weary could lie at length on the soft, sweet, saffron sand. . .
                                .
                            I have neither a voice nor hands, nor any friend nor a foe ;
                            I am I—just a Pulse of Pain—I am I, that is all I know.
                            For Life, and the sickness of Life, and Death and desire to die
                                ;—
                            They have passed away like the smoke, here is nothing but Pain and
                                I.
                        
                        
                        
                            The Lost Friend.
                            
                                The people take the thing of course,
                                They marvel not to see
                                This strange, unnatural divorce
                                Betwixt delight and me.
                            
                            
                                I KNOW the face of sorrow, and I know
                                Her voice with all its varied cadences ;
                                Which way she turns and treads ; how at her ease
                                Things fit her dreary largess to bestow.
                            
                            
                                Where sorrow long abides, some be that grow
                                To hold her dear, but I am not of these ;
                                Joy is my friend, not sorrow ; by strange seas,
                                In some far land we wandered, long ago.
                            
                            
                                O faith, long tried, that knows no faltering !
                                O vanished treasure of her hands and face !—
                                Beloved—to whose memory I cling,
                                Unmoved within my heart she holds her place.
                            
                            
                                And never shall I hail that other “friend,”
                                Who yet shall dog my footsteps to the end.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            Cambridge in the Long.
                            
                                WHERE drowsy sound of college?chimes
                                Across the air is blown,
                                And drowsy fragrance of the limes,
                                I lie and dream alone.
                            
                            
                                A dazzling radiance reigns o’er all—
                                O’er gardens densely green,
                                O’er old grey bridges and the small,
                                Slow flood which slides between.
                            
                            
                                This is the place ; it is not strange,
                                But known of old and dear.—
                                What went I forth to seek ? The change
                                Is mine ; why am I here ?
                            
                            
                                Alas, in vain I turned away,
                                I fled the town in vain ;
                                The strenuous life of yesterday
                                Calleth me back again.
                            
                            
                            
                                And was it peace I came to seek ?
                                Yet here, where memories throng,
                                Ev’n here, I know the past is weak,
                                I know the present strong.
                            
                            
                                This drowsy fragrance, silent heat,
                                Suit not my present mind,
                                Whose eager thought goes out to meet
                                The life it left behind.
                            
                            
                                Spirit with sky to change ; such hope,
                                An idle one we know ;
                                Unship the oars, make loose the rope,
                                Push off the boat and go. . . .
                            
                            
                                Ah, would what binds me could have been
                                Thus loosened at a touch !
                                This pain of living is too keen,
                                Of loving, is too much.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            To Vernon Lee.
                            
                                ON Bellosguardo, when the year was young,
                                We wandered, seeking for the daffodil
                                And dark anemone, whose purples fill
                                The peasant’s plot, between the corn?shoots sprung.
                            
                            
                                Over the grey, low wall the olive flung
                                Her deeper greyness ; far off, hill on hill
                                Sloped to the sky, which, pearly?pale and still,
                                Above the large and luminous landscape hung.
                            
                            
                                A snowy blackthorn flowered beyond my reach ;
                                You broke a branch and gave it to me there ;
                                I found for you a scarlet blossom rare.
                            
                            
                                Thereby ran on of Art and Life our speech ; 
                                And of the gifts the gods had given to each—
                                Hope unto you, and unto me Despair.

                                I WILL be glad because it is the Spring ;
                                I will forget the winter in my heart—
                                Dead hopes and withered promise ; and will wring
                                A little joy from life ere life depart.
                            
                            
                                For spendthrift youth with passion?blinded eyes,
                                Stays not to see how woods and fields are bright
                                    ;
                                He hears the phantom voices call, he flies
                                Upon the track of some unknown delight.
                            
                            
                                To him the tender glory of the May,
                                White wonder of the blossom, and the clear,
                                Soft green leaves that opened yesterday,
                                This only say : Forward, my friend, not here !
                            
                            
                                They breathe no other messages than this,
                                They have no other meaning for his heart ;
                                Unto his troubled sense they tell of bliss,
                                Which make, themselves, of bliss the better part.
                            
                            
                            
                                Yea, joy is near him, tho’ he does not know ;
                                Her unregarded shape is at his side,
                                Her unheard voice is whispering clear and low,
                                Whom, resting never, seeks he far and wide.
                            
                            
                                So once it was with us, my heart ! To?day
                                We will be glad because the leaves are green,
                                Because the fields are fair and soft with May,
                                Nor think on squandered springtimes that have
                                    been.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            On the Wye in May.
                            
                                NOW is the perfect moment of the year.
                                Half naked branches, half a mist of green,
                                Vivid and delicate the slopes appear ;
                                The cool, soft air is neither fierce nor keen,
                            
                            
                                And in the temperate sun we feel no fear ;
                                Of all the hours which shall be and have been,
                                It is the briefest as it is most dear,
                                It is the dearest as the shortest seen.
                            
                            
                                O it was best, belovèd, at the first.—
                                Our hands met gently, and our meeting sight
                                Was steady ; on our senses scarce had burst
                                The faint, fresh fragrance of the new delight. . .
                                    .
                            
                            
                                I seek that clime, unknown, without a name,
                                Where first and best and last shall be the same.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            Oh, is it Love?
                            
                                O IS it Love or is it Fame,
                                This thing for which I sigh ?
                                Or has it then no earthly name
                                For men to call it by ?
                            
                            
                                I know not what can ease my pains,
                                Nor what it is I wish ;
                                The passion at my heart?strings strains
                                Like a tiger in a leash.

                                DEEP in the grass outstretched I lie,
                                Motionless on the hill ;
                                Above me is a cloudless sky,
                                Around me all is still :
                            
                            
                                There is no breath, no sound, no stir,
                                The drowsy peace to break :
                                I close my tired eyes—it were
                                So simple not to wake.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            The End of the Day.
                            To B. T.
                            
                                DEAD?TIRED, dog?tired, as the vivid day
                                Fails and slackens and fades away.—
                                The sky that was so blue before
                                With sudden clouds is shrouded o’er.
                                Swiftly, stilly the mists uprise,
                                Till blurred and grey the landscape lies.
                            
                            
                                * * * * * * *
                                All day we have plied the oar ; all day
                                Eager and keen have said our say
                                On life and death, on love and art,
                                On good or ill at Nature’s heart.
                                Now, grown so tired, we scarce can lift
                                The lazy oars, but onward drift.
                                And the silence is only stirred
                                Here and there by a broken word.

                                O, sweeter far than strain and stress
                                Is the slow, creeping weariness.
                                
                                And better far than thought I find
                                The drowsy blankness of the mind.
                                More than all joys of soul or sense
                                Is this divine indifference ;
                                Where grief a shadow grows to be,
                                And peace a possibility.

                                I lounge in the doorway and languish in vain
                                While Tom, Dick and Harry are dancing with Jane
                            
                            
                                MY spirit rises to the music’s beat ;
                                There is a leaden fiend lurks in my feet !
                                To move unto your motion, Love, were sweet.
                            
                            
                                Somewhere, I think, some other where, not here,
                                In other ages, on another sphere,
                                I danced with you, and you with me, my dear.
                            
                            
                                In perfect motion did our bodies sway,
                                To perfect music that was heard alway ;
                                Woe’s me, that am so dull of foot to?day !
                            
                            
                                To move unto your motion, Love, were sweet ;
                                My spirit rises to the music’s beat—
                                But, ah, the leaden demon in my feet !
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            The First Extra.
                            A Waltz Song.
                            
                                O SWAY, and swing, and sway,
                                And swing, and sway, and swing !
                                Ah me, what bliss like unto this,
                                Can days and daylight bring ?
                            
                            
                                A rose beneath your feet
                                Has fallen from my head ;
                                Its odour rises sweet,
                                All crushed it lies, and dead.
                            
                            
                                O Love is like a rose,
                                Fair?hued, of fragrant breath ;
                                A tender flow’r that lives an hour,
                                And is most sweet in death.
                            
                            
                                O swing, and sway, and swing,
                                And rise, and sink, and fall !
                                There is no bliss like unto this,
                                This is the best of all.

                                WITH fruit and flowers the board is deckt,
                                The wine and laughter flow ;
                                I’ll not complain—could one expect
                                So dull a world to know ?
                            
                            
                                You look across the fruit and flowers,
                                My glance your glances find.—
                                It is our secret, only ours,
                                Since all the world is blind.

                                We were not Phyllis, simple?sweet,
                                And Corydon ; we did not meet
                                By brook or meadow, but among
                                A Philistine and flippant throng

                                The egoistic “I” and “you ;”

                                On Art and Letters, Life and Man.
                                Proudly we sat, we two, on high,
                                Throned in our Objectivity ;
                            
                            
                                Scarce friends, not lovers (each avers),
                                But sexless, safe Philosophers.

                                Dear Friend, you must not deem me light
                                If, as I lie and muse to?night,
                                I give a smile and not a sigh
                                To thoughts of our Philosophy.

                                WHAT wonder that I should be dreaming
                                Out here in the garden to?day ?
                                The light through the leaves is streaming,—

                                Our Poet brought us books and flowers,

                                    hours
                                Philosophy (sad Schopenhauer’s),

                                Where to the vulgar herd unknown,
                                Our pens we plied.

                                We stooped to see.
