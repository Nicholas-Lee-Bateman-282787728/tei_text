                                    'em,
                            
                            
                                'Cause I'm happier in
                                    these posies,
                            
                            
                                And the hollyhawks and sich,
                            
                            
                                Than the hummin' bird

                        THE DAYS GONE BY.
                        
                            O the days gone by! O the days gone by!
                            The apples in the orchard, and the pathway
                                through the rye;
                            The chirrup of the robin, and the whistle
                                of the quail
                            As he piped across the meadows sweet as
                                any nightingale;
                            When the bloom was on the clover, and the
                                blue was in the sky,
                            And my happy heart brimmed overin the
                                happy days gone by.
                        
                        
                            In the days gone by, when our naked feet
                                were tripped
                            By the honeysuckle tangles where the
                                water-lilies dipped,
                            And the ripples of the river lipped the
                                moss along the brink
                            Where the placid-eyed and lazy-footed
                                cattle came to drink,
                            And the tilting snipe stood fearless of
                                the truant's way-ward cry
                            And the splashing of the swimmer, in the
                                days gone by.
                            
                            O the days gone by! O the days gone by!
                            The music of the laughing lip, the luster
                                of the eye;
                            The childish faith in fairies, and
                                Aladdin's magic ring
                            The simple, soul-reposing, glad belief in
                                everything;
                            When life was like a story holding
                                neither sob nor sigh,
                            In the golden olden glory of the days
                                gone by.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE.
                        
                            As one who cons at evening o'er
                                an album all alone,
                            And muses on the faces of the friends that
                                he has known,
                            So I turn the leaves of Fancy, till in
                                shadowy design
                            I find the smiling features of an old
                                sweetheart of mine.
                        
                        
                            The lamplight seems to glimmer with a
                                flicker of surprise,
                            As I turn it low, to rest me of the dazzle
                                in my eyes,
                            And light my pipe in silence, save a sigh
                                that seems to yoke
                            Its fate with my tobacco, and to vanish
                                with the smoke.
                        
                        
                            'Tis a fragrant retrospection,
                                for the loving thoughts that start
                            Into being are like perfumes from the
                                blossom of the heart;
                            And to dream the old dreams over is a
                                luxury divine
                            When my truant fancies wander with that
                                old sweetheart of mine.
                            
                            Though I hear, beneath my study, like a
                                fluttering of wings,
                            The voices of my children and the mother
                                as she sings,
                            I feel no twinge of conscience to deny me
                                any theme
                            When Care has cast her anchor in the
                                harbor of a dream.
                        
                        
                            In fact, to speak in earnest, I believe
                                it adds a charm
                            To spice the good a trifle with a little
                                dust of harm
                            For I find an extra flavor in
                                Memory's mellow wine
                            That makes me drink the deeper to that
                                old sweetheart of mine.
                        
                        
                            A face of lily-beauty, with a form of
                                airy grace,
                            Floats out of my tobacco as the genii
                                from the vase;
                            And I thrill beneath the glances of a
                                pair of azure eyes
                            As glowing as the summer and as tender as
                                the skies.
                        
                        
                            I can see the pink sun-bonnet and the
                                little checkered dress
                            She wore when first I kissed her, and she
                                answered the caress
                            With the written declaration that,
                                " as surely as the vine
                            Grew round the stump," she loved
                                methat old sweet-heart of mine!
                        
                        
                            And again I feel the pressure of her
                                slender little hand,
                            As we used to talk together of the future
                                we had planned;
                            When I should be a poet, and with nothing
                                else to do
                            But write the tender verses that she net
                                the music to:
                        
                        
                        
                            When we should live together in a cozy
                                little cot,
                            Hid in a nest of roses, with a fairy
                                garden-spot,
                            Where the vines were ever fruited, and
                                the weather ever fine,
                            And the birds were ever singing for that
                                old sweetheart of mine:
                        
                        
                            And I should be her lover forever and a
                                day,
                            And she my faithful sweetheart till the
                                golden hair was gray;
                            And we should be so happy that when
                                either's lips were dumb
                            They would not smile in Heaven till the
                                other's kiss had come.
                        
                        
                            But-ah! my dream is broken by a step upon
                                the stair,
                            And the door is softly opened, and my
                                wife is standing there!
                            Yet with eagerness and rapture all my
                                visions I resign
                            To greet the living presence of that old
                                sweetheart of mine.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A FRUIT-PIECE.
                        
                            THE
                                afternoon of summer folds
                            Its warm arms round the marigolds,
                        
                        
                            And, with its gleaming fingers, pets
                            The watered pinks and violets
                        
                        
                            That from the casement vases spill,
                            Over the cottage window-sill,
                        
                        
                            Their fragrance down the garden walks
                            Where droop the dry-mouthed
                            hollyhocks.
                        
                        
                            How vividly the sunshine scrawls
                            The grape-vine shadows on the walls
                        
                        
                            How like a truant swings the breeze
                            In high boughs of the apple-trees!
                        
                        
                            The slender free-stone lifts aloof,
                            Full languidly above the roof,
                        
                        
                            A hoard of fruitage, stamped with gold
                            And precious mintings manifold.
                        
                        
                        
                            High up, through curled green leaves, a
                                pear
                            Hangs hot with ripeness here and
                            there.
                        
                        
                            Beneath the sagging trellis clings,
                            In lush, lack-luster clusterings,
                        
                        
                            Great torpid grapes, all fattened through
                            With moon and sunshine, shade and
                            dew,
                        
                        
                            Until their swollen girths express
                            But forms of limp deliciousness

                            With heaven's own sacramental
                                wine.

                                jerked his lines,
                            And smutted the lid of either eye,
                            And turned and stared at the
                                business signs;
                            And the street-car driver
                                stopped and beat
                            His hands on his shoulders,
                                and gazed up street
                            Till his eye on the long track
                                reached the sky
                            As the little white hearse
                                went glimmering by.

                            A stranger petted a ragged
                                child
                            In the crowded walks, and she knew not
                                why,
                            But he gave her a coin for
                                the way she smiled;
                            And to bootblack thrilled
                                with a pleasure strange,
                            As a customer put back his

                            With to kindly hand and to
                                grateful sigh,

                            A man looked out of a window
                                dim,
                            And his cheeks were wet and his heart was
                                dry,

                            And he thought of his empty
                                life, and said:"
                            Loveless alive, and loveless

                            To the country's cool retreats
                            From the riot to the rest
                            Where hearts beat the placidest;
                            Afterwhile, and we will fall
                            Under breezy trees, and loll
                        
                        
                        
                            In the shade, with thirsty sight
                            Drinking deep the blue delight
                            Of the skies that will beguile
                            Us as childrenafterwhile.

                            To be gentler to his friends
                            To walk with them, in the hush
                            Of still evenings, o'er the
                                plush
                            Of home-leading fields, and stand
                            Long at parting, hand in hand:
                            One, in time, will joy to take
                            New resolves for someone's sake,
                            And wear then the look that lies
                            Clear and pure in other eyes
                            He will soothe and reconcile
                            His own conscienceafterwhile.
                        
                        
                            Afterwhilewe have in view
                            A far scene to journey to,
                            Where the old home is, and where
                            The old mother waits us there,
                            Peering, as the time grows late,
                            Down the old path to the gate.
                            How we'll click the latch that
                                locks
                            In the pinks and hollyhocks,
                            
                            And leap up the path once more
                            Where she waits as at the door!
                            How we'll greet the dear old
                                smile,
                            And the warm tearsafterwhile
                        
                        
                            Ah, the endless afterwhiles!
                            Leagues on leagues, and miles on miles,
                            In the distance far withdrawn,
                            Stretching on, and on, and on,
                            Till the fancy is footsore
                            And faints in the dust before
                            The last milestone's granite
                                face,
                            Hacked with: Here Beginneth Space.
                            O far glimmering worlds and wings,
                            Mystic smiles and beckonings,
                            Lead as, through the shadowy aisles,
                            Out into the afterwhiles.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        HERR WEISER.
                        
                            HERR WEISER!Three-score-years-and-ten,
                            A hale white rose of his countrymen,
                            Transplanted here in the Hoosier loam,
                            And blossomy as his German home
                            As blossomy, and as pure and sweet
                            As the cool green glen of his calm
                                retreat,
                            Far withdrawn from the noisy town
                            Where trade goes clamoring up and down,
                            Whose fret and fever, and stress and
                                strife
                            May not trouble his tranquil life!
                        
                        
                            Breath of rest, what a balmy gust! 
                            Quit of the city's heat and
                                dust,
                            Jostling down by the winding road,
                            Through the orchard ways of his quaint
                                abode.
                            Tether the horse, as we onward fare
                            Under the pear-trees trailing there,
                            And thumping the wooden bridge at night
                            With lumps of ripeness and lush delight,
                            Till the stream, as it maunders on till
                                dawn,
                            Is powdered and pelted and smiled
                            upon.
                        
                        
                        
                            Herr Weiser, with his wholesome face,
                            And the gentle blue of his eyes, and
                                grace
                            Of unassuming honesty,
                            Be there to welcome you and me!
                            And what though the toil of the farm be
                                stopped
                            And the tireless plans of the place be
                                dropped,
                            While the prayerful master's
                                knees are set
                            In beds of pansy and mignonette,
                            And lily and aster and columbine,
                            Offered in love, as yours and mine?
                        
                        
                            What, but a blessing of kindly thought,
                            Sweet as the breath of forget-me-not!
                            What, but a spirit of lustrous love
                            White as the aster he bends above!
                            What, but an odorous memory
                            Of the dear old man, made known to me
                            In days demanding a help like his,
                            As sweet as the life of the lily is
                            As sweet as the soul of a babe,
                                bloom-wise
                            Born of a lily in paradise.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE BEAUTIFUL CITY.
                        
                            THE
                                Beautiful City! Forever
                            Its rapturous praises resound;
                            We fain would behold itbut never
                            A glimpse of its glory is
                                found
                            We slacken our lips at the tender
                            White breasts of our mothers
                                to hear
                            Of its marvelous beauty and splendor:
                            We seebut the gleam of a
                            tear!
                        
                        
                            Yet never the story may tire us,
                            First graven in symbols of
                                stone
                            Rewritten on scrolls of papyrus,
                            And parchment, and scattered
                                and blown
                            By the winds of the tongues of all
                                nations,
                            Like a litter of leaves
                                wildly whirled
                            Down the rack of a hundred translations,
                            From the earliest lisp of the
                                world.
                        
                        
                            We compass the earth and the ocean,
                            From the Orient's
                                uttermost light,
                            To where the last ripple in motion
                            Lips hem of the skirt of the
                                night,
                        
                        
                        
                            But The Beautiful City evades us
                            No spire of it glints in the
                                sun
                            No glad-bannered battlement shades us
                            When all our long journey is
                                done.
                        
                        
                            Where lies it? We question and listen;
                            We lean front the mountain,
                                or mast,
                            And see but dull earth, or the glisten
                            Of seas inconceivably vast:
                            The dust of the one blurs our vision
                            The glare of the other our
                                brain,
                            Nor city one island elysian
                            In all of the land or the
                                main!
                        
                        
                            We kneel in dim fanes where the thunders
                            Of organs tumultuous roll,
                            And the longing heart listens and
                                wonders,
                            And the eyes look aloft from
                                the soul;
                            But the chanson grows fainter and
                                fainter,
                            Swoons wholly away and is
                                dead;
                            And our eyes only reach where the painter
                            Has dabbled a saint
                            overhead.
                        
                        
                            The Beautiful City! O mortal,
                            Fare hopefully on in thy
                                quest,
                            Pass down through the green grassy portal
                            That leads to the Valley of
                                Rest,
                        
                        
                        
                            There first passed the One who, in pity
                            Of all thy great yearning,
                                awaits
                            To point out The Beautiful City,
                            And loosen the trump at the
                                gates.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        LOCKERBIE STREET:
                        
                            SUCH a
                                dear little street it is, nestled away
                            From the noise of the city and heat of the
                                day,
                            In cool shady coverts of whispering trees,
                            With their leaves lifted up to shake hands
                                with the breeze
                            Which in all its wide wanderings never may
                                meet
                            With a resting-place fairer than Lockerbie
                                street!
                        
                        
                            There is such a relief, from the clangor
                                and din
                            Of the heart of the town, to go loitering
                                in
                            Through the dim, narrow walks, with the
                                sheltering shade
                            Of the trees waving over the long
                                promenade,
                            And littering lightly the ways of our
                                feet
                            With the gold of the sunshine of
                                Lockerbie street.
                        
                        
                            And the nights that come down the dark
                                pathways of dusk,
                            With the stars in their tresses, and
                                odors of musk
                            In their moon-woven raiments, bespangled
                                with dews,
                            And looped up with lilies for lovers to
                                use
                            In the songs that they sing to the tinkle
                                and beat
                            Of their sweet serenadings through
                                Lockerbie street.
                        
                        
                        
                            O, my Lockerbie street! You are fair to
                                be seen
                            Be it noon of the day, or the rare and
                                serene
                            Afternoon of the nightyou are one to my
                                heart,
                            And I love you above all the phrases of
                                art,
                            For no language could frame, and no lips
                                could repeat
                            My thyme-haunted raptures of Lockerbie
                                street.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        DAS KRIST KINDEL.
                        
                            I HAD fed
                                the fire and stirred it, till the sparkles in delight
                            Snapped their saucy little fingers at the
                                chill December night;
                            And in dressing-gown and slippers, I had
                                tilted back ' my throne'
                            The old split-bottomed rockerand was
                                musing all alone.
                        
                        
                            I could hear the hungry Winter prowling
                                round the outer door,
                            And the tread of muffled footsteps on the
                                white piazza floor;
                            But the sounds came to me only as the
                                murmur of a stream
                            That mingled with the current of a
                                lazy-flowing dream.
                        
                        
                            Like a fragrant incense rising, curled the
                                smoke of my cigar,
                            With the lamp-light gleaming through it
                                like a mist-enfolded star;
                            
                            And as I gazed, the vapor like a curtain
                                rolled away,
                            With a sound of bells that tinkled, and
                                the clatter of a sleigh.
                        
                        
                            And in a vision, painted like a picture
                                in the air,
                            I saw the elfish figure of a man with
                                frosty hair
                            A quaint old man that chuckled with a
                                laugh as he appeared,
                            And with ruddy cheeks like embers in the
                                ashes of his beard.
                        
                        
                            He poised himself grotesquely, in an
                                attitude of mirth,
                            On a damask-covered hassock that was
                                sitting on the hearth;
                            And at a magic signal of his stubby
                                little thumb,
                            I saw the fireplace changing to a bright
                                proscenium.
                        
                        
                            And looking there, I marveled as I saw a
                                mimic stage
                            Alive with little actors of a very tender
                                age;
                            And some so very tiny that they tottered
                                as they walked,
                            And lisped and purled and gurgled like
                                the brooklets, when they talked.
                        
                        
                            And their faces were like lilies, and
                                their eyes like purest dew,
                            And their tresses like the shadows that
                                the shine is woven through;
                            And they each had little burdens, and a
                                little tale to tell
                            Of fairy lore, and giants, and delights
                                delectable.
                        
                        
                        
                            And they mixed and intermingled, weaving
                                melody with Joy,
                            Till the magic circle clustered round a
                                blooming baby-boy;
                            And they threw aside their treasures, in
                                an ecstasy of glee,
                            And bent, with dazzled faces, and with
                                parted lips, to see.
                        
                        
                            'Twas a wondrous little fellow,
                                with a dainty double chin,
                            And chubby cheeks, and dimples for the
                                smiles to blossom in;
                            And he looked as ripe and rosy, on his
                                bed of straw and reeds,
                            As a mellow little pippin that had
                                tumbled in the weeds.
                        
                        
                            And I, no the happy mother, and a group
                                surrounding her,
                            That knelt with costly presents of
                                frankincense and myrrh;
                            And I thrilled with awe and wonder, as a
                                murmur on the air
                            Came drifting o'er the hearing
                                in a melody of prayer:
                        
                        
                            
                                By the splendor in the heavens, and the
                                    hush upon the sea,
                            
                            
                                And the majesty of silence reigning over
                                    Galilee,
                            
                            
                            
                                We feel Thy kingly pesence, and we humbly
                                    bow the knee
                            
                            
                                And lift our hearts and voices in
                                    gratefulness to Thee.
                            
                        
                        
                            
                                Thy messenger has spoken, and our doubts
                                    have fled and one
                            
                            
                                As the dark and spectral shadows of the
                                    night before the dawn;
                            
                            
                                And, in the kindly shelter of the light
                                    around its drawn,
                            
                            
                                We would e nestle down forever in the
                                    breast we lean upon.
                            
                        
                        
                            
                                You have given us a shepherdYou have given
                                    us a guide,
                            
                            
                                And the light of Heaven grew dimmer when
                                    You sent Him from Your side,
                            
                            
                                But He comes to lead Thy children where
                                    the gates will open wide
                            
                            
                                To welcome His returning when His works
                                    are glorified.
                            
                        
                        
                            
                                By the splendor in the heavens, and the
                                    huh upon the sea,
                            
                            
                                And the majesty of silence reigning over
                                    Galilee,
                            
                            
                                We feel Thy kingly presence, and we humbly
                                    bow the knee
                            
                            
                                And lift our hearts and voices in
                                    gratefulness to Thee.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            Then the vision, slowly failing, with the
                                words of the refrain,
                            Fell swooning in the moonlight through
                                the frosty window-pane;
                            And I heard the clock proclaiming, like
                                an eager sentinel
                            Who brings the world good
                                tidings," It is Christmasall is well'
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE ORCHARD LANDS OF LONG AGO.
                        
                            THE
                                orchard lands of Long Ago!
                            O drowsy winds, awake, and blow
                            The snowy blossoms back to me,
                            And all the buds that used to be!
                            Blow back along the grassy ways
                            Of truant feet, and lift the haze
                            Of happy summer from the trees
                            That trail their tresses in the seas
                            Of grain that float and overflow
                            The orchard lands of Long Ago!
                        
                        
                            Blow back the melody that slips
                            In lazy laughter from the lips
                            That marvel much if any kiss
                            Is sweeter than the apple's is.
                            Blow bade the twitter of the birds
                            The lisp, the titter, and the words
                            Of merriment that found the shine
                            Of summertime a glorious wine
                            That drenched the leaves that loved it
                                so,
                            In orchard lands of Long Ago!
                        
                        
                        
                            O memory! alight and sing
                            Where rosy-bellied pippins cling,
                            And golden russets glint and gleam,
                            As, in the old Arabian dream,
                            The fruits of that enchanted tree
                            The glad Aladdin robbed for me!
                            And, drowsy winds, awake and fan
                            My blood as when it over-ran
                            A heart ripe as the apples grow
                            In orchard lands of Long Ago!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE SOUTH WIND AND THE SUN.
                        
                            O THE South Wind and the Sun!
                            How each loved the other one
                            Full of Fancyfull of folly
                            Full of jollity and fun!
                            How they romped and ran about,
                            Like two boys when school is
                                out,
                            With glowing face, and lisping lip,
                            Low laugh, and lifted
                            shout!
                        
                        
                            And the South Windhe was
                                dressed
                            With a ribbon round his
                                breast
                            That floated, flapped and fluttered
                            Ina riotous unrest,
                            And a drapery of mist,
                            From the shoulder and the
                                wrist
                            Flowing backward with the motion
                            Of the waving hand he
                            kissed.
                        
                        
                        
                            And the Sun had on a crown
                            Wrought of gilded
                                thistledown,
                            And a scarf of velvet vapor,
                            And a raveled-rainbow gown;
                            And his tinsel-tangled hair,
                            Tossed and lost upon the air,
                            Was glossier and flossier
                            Than any anywhere.
                        
                        
                            And the South Wind's
                                eyes were two
                            Little dancing drops of dew,
                            As he puffed his cheeks, and pursed his
                                lips,
                            And blew and blew and blew!
                            And the Sun'slike
                                diamond-stone,
                            Brighter yet than ever known,
                            As he knit his brows, and held his
                                breath,
                            And shone and shone and
                                shone!
                        
                        
                            And this pair of merry fays
                            Wandered through the summer
                                days;
                            Arm-in-arm they went together
                            Over heights of morning haze
                            Over slanting slopes of lawn
                            They went on and on and on,
                            Where the daisies looked like star-tracks
                            Trailing up and down the
                                dawn.
                        
                        
                        
                            And where'er they
                                found the top
                            Of a wheat-stall droop and
                                lop
                            They chucked it underneath the chin
                            And praised the lavish crop,
                            Till it lifted with the pride
                            Of the heads it grew beside,
                            And then the South Wind and the Sun
                            Went onward satisfied.
                        
                        
                            Over meadow-lands they
                                tripped,
                            Where the dandelions dipped
                            In crimson foam of clover-bloom,
                            And dripped and dripped and
                                dripped;
                            And they clinched the
                                bumble-stings,
                            Gauming honey on their wings,
                            And bundling them in lily-bells,
                            With maudlin murmurings.
                        
                        
                            And the humming-bird, that
                                hung
                            Like a jewel up among
                            The tilted honeysuckle-horns,
                            They mesmerized, and swung
                            In the palpitating air,
                            Drowsed with odors strange
                                and rare,
                            And, with whispered laughter, slipped
                                away
                            And left him hanging
                            there.
                        
                        
                        
                            And they braided blades of
                                grass
                            Where the truant had to pass;
                            And they wriggled through the rushes
                            And the reeds of the morass,
                            Where they danced, in rapture
                                sweet,
                            O'er the leaves that
                                laid a street
                            Of undulant mosaic for
                            The touches of their
                            feet.
                        
                        
                            By the brook with mossy
                                brink,
                            Where the cattle came to
                                drink,
                            They trilled and piped and whistled
                            With the thrush and bobolink,
                            Till the kine, in listless
                                pause,
                            Switched their tails in mute
                                applause,
                            With lifted heads and dreamy eyes,
                            And bubble-dripping jaws.
                        
                        
                            And where the melons grew,
                            Streaked with yellow, green
                                and blue,
                            These jolly sprites went wandering
                            Through spangled paths of
                                dew;
                            And the melons, here and
                                there,
                            They made love to everywhere,
                            Turning their pink souls to crimson
                            With caresses fond and
                            fair.
                        
                        
                        
                            Over orchard walls they went,
                            Where the fruited boughs were
                                bent
                            Till they brushed the sward beneath them
                            Where the shine and shadow
                                blent;
                            And the great green pear they
                                shook
                            Till the sallow hue forsook
                            Its features, and the gleam of gold
                            Laughed out in every
                            look.
                        
                        
                            And they stroked the downy
                                cheek
                            Of the peach, and smoothed it
                                sleek,
                            And flushed it into splendor;
                            And, with many an elfish
                                freak,
                            Gave the russet's
                                rust a wipe
                            Prankt the rambo with a
                                stripe,
                            And the winesap blushed its reddest
                            As they spanked the pippins
                                ripe.
                        
                        
                            Through the woven ambuscade
                            That the twining vines had
                                made,
                            They found the grapes, in clusters,
                            Drinking up the shine and
                                shade
                            Plumpt, like tiny skins of
                                wine,
                            With a vintage so divine
                            That the tongue of fancy tingled
                            With the tang of
                            muscadine.
                        
                        
                        
                            And the golden-banded bees,
                            Droning o'er the
                                flowery leas,
                            They bridled, reined, and rode away
                            Across the fragrant breeze,
                            Till in hollow oak and elm
                            They had groomed and stabled
                                them
                            In waxen stalls that oozed with dews
                            Of rose and lily-stem.
                        
                        
                            Where the dusty highway
                                leads,
                            High above the wayside weeds
                            They sowed the air with butterflies
                            Like blooming flower-seeds,
                            Till the dull grasshopper
                                sprung
                            Half a man's height
                                up, and hung
                            Tranced in the beat, with whirring
                                wings,
                            And sung and sung and
                            sung!
                        
                        
                            And they loitered, hand in
                                hand,
                            Where the snipe along the
                                sand
                            Of the river ran to meet them
                            As the ripple meets the
                                land,
                            Till the dragonfly, in light
                            Gauzy armor, burnished
                                bright,
                            Came tilting down the waters
                            In a wild, bewildered
                                flight.
                        
                        
                        
                            And they heard the
                                killdee's call,
                            And afar, the waterfall,
                            But the rustle of a falling leaf
                            They heard above it all;
                            And the trailing willow
                                crept
                            Deeper in the tide that
                                swept
                            The leafy shallop to the shore,
                            And wept and wept and
                            wept!
                        
                        
                            And the fairy vessel veered
                            From its mooringstacked and
                                steered
                            For the center of the current
                            Sailed away and disappeared:
                            And the burthen that it bore
                            From the long-enchanted
                                shore
                            "Alas! the South Wind and the
                                Sun!

                            For the South Wind and the Sun,
                            Each so loves the other one,
                            For all his jolly folly,
                            And frivolity and fun,
                            That our love for them they
                                weigh
                            As their fickle fancies may,
                            And when at last we love them most,
                            They laugh and sail
                            away.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE LOST KISS.

                                the half-written poem,

                            But the little been feet on the stairway,
                            And the faint, smothered laugh
                                in the hall,
                            And the eerie-low lisp on the silence,
                            Cry up to me over it all.
                        
                        
                            So I gather it upwhere was broken
                            The tear-faded thread of my
                                theme,
                            Telling how, as one night I net writing,
                            A fairy broke in on my dream,
                            A little inquisitive fairy
                            My own little girl, with the
                                gold
                            Of the sun in her hair, and the dewy
                            Blue eyes of the fairies of
                                old.
                        
                        
                        
                            'Twas the dear little girl that
                                I scolded

                            I said, "when she knew I was

                            And the cold hand that turned
                                her away!
                            And take, from the lips that denied her,
                            This answerless prayer of

                            That pitiful sob of despair,
                            And the patter and trip of the little
                                bare feet,
                            And the one piercing cry on

                                hold,
                            And I'll not pray
                            For gold;
                        
                        
                        
                            The tanned face, garlanded with mirth,
                            It bath the kingliest smile on earth
                            The swart brow, diamonded with sweat,
                            Hath never need of coronet.
                            And so I reach,
                            Dear Lord, to Thee,
                            And do beseech
                            Thou givest me
                            The wee cot, and the cricket's
                                chirr,
                            Love, and the glad sweet face of her!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        OUR KIND OF A MAN.
                        
                            I.
                            THE kind
                                of a man for you and me!
                            He faces the world unflinchingly,
                            And smites, as tong as the wrong resists,
                            With a knuckled faith and force like
                                fists:
                            He lives the life he is preaching of,
                            And loves where most is the need of love;
                            His voice is clear to the deaf
                                man's ears,
                            And his face sublime through the blind
                                man's tears;
                            The light shines out where the clouds were
                                dim,
                            And the widow's prayer goes up
                                for him;
                            The latch is clicked at the hovel door,
                            And the sick man sees the sun once more,
                            And out o'er the barren fields
                                he sees
                            Springing blossoms and waving trees,
                            Feeling, as only the dying may,
                            That God's own servant has come
                                that way,
                            Smoothing the path as it still winds on
                            Through the golden gate where his loved
                                have gone.
                        
                        
                        
                            II.
                            The kind of a man for me and you!
                            However little of worth we do
                            He credits full, and abides in trust
                            That time will teach us how more is just.
                            He walks abroad, and he meets all kinds
                            Of querulous and uneasy minds,
                            And, sympathizing, he shares the pain
                            Of the doubts that rack us, heart and
                                brain;
                            And, knowing this, as we grasp his hand,
                            We are surely coming to understand!
                            He looks on sin with pitying eyes
                            E'en as the Lord, since
                                Paradise,
                            Else, should we read, Though our sins
                                should glow
                            As scarlet, they shall be white as snow?
                            And feeling still, with a grief half
                                glad,
                            That the bad are as good as the good are
                                bad,
                            He strikes straight out for the Rightand
                                he
                            Is the kind of a man for you and me!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE HARPER.
                        
                            LIKE a
                                drift of faded blossoms
                            Caught in a-slanting rain,
                            His fingers glimpsed down the strings of
                                his harp
                            In a tremulous refrain.
                        
                        
                            Patter, and tinkle, and drip, and drip!
                            Ah! but the chords were rainy
                                sweet!
                            And I closed nay eyes and I bit my lip,
                            As he played there in the
                                street.
                        
                        
                            Patter, and drip, and tinkle!
                            And there was the little bed
                            In the corner of the garret,
                            And the rafters overhead!
                        
                        
                            And there was the little window
                            Tinkle, and drip, and drip!
                            The rain above, and a mother's
                                love,
                            And God's
                                companionship!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE RIPEST PEACH.
                        
                            THE ripest
                                peach is highest on the tree
                            And so her love, beyond the reach of me,
                            Is dearest in my sight. Sweet breezes, bow
                            Her heart down to we whew I worship
                            now!
                        
                        
                            She looms aloft where every eye may see
                            The ripest peach is highest on the tree.
                            Such fruitage as her love I know, alas!
                            I may not reach here from the orchard
                                grass.
                        
                        
                            I drink the sunshine showered past her
                                lips
                            As roses drain the dewdrop as it drips.
                            The ripest peach is highest on the tree,
                            And so mine eyes gaze upward eagerly.
                        
                        
                            Whywhy do I not turn away in wrath
                            And pluck some heart here hanging in my
                                path?
                            Love's lower boughs bend with
                                thembut, ah me!
                            The ripest peach is highest on the
                            tree.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        OLD AUNT MARY'S.
                        
                            WASN'T it pleasant, O brother mine,
                            In those old days of the lost sunshine
                            Of youthwhen the Saturday's
                                chores were through,
                            And the "Sunday's wood
                                " in the kitchen, too,
                            And we went visiting, " me and
                                you,"
                            Out to Old Aunt
                                Mary's?
                        
                        
                            It all comes back so clear to-day!
                            Though I am as bald as you are gray
                            Out by the barn-lot, and down the lane,
                            We patter along in the dust again,
                            As light as the tips of the drops of the
                                rain,
                            Out to Old Aunt
                                Mary's!
                        
                        
                            We cross the pasture, and through the
                                wood
                            Where the old gray snag of the poplar
                                stood,
                            Where the hammering
                                "red-heads" hopped awry,
                            And the buzzard "raised
                                "in the "clearing"-sky,
                            And lolled and circled, as we went by
                            Out to Old Aunt
                                Mary's.
                        
                        
                        
                            And then in the dust of the road again;
                            And the teams we met, and the countrymen;
                            And the long highway, with sunshine
                                spread
                            As thick as butter on country bread,
                            Our cares behind, and our hearts ahead
                            Out to Old Aunt
                                Mary's.
                        
                        
                            Why, I see her now in the open door,
                            Where the little gourds grew up the
                                sides, and o'er
                            The clapboard roof!And her faceah, me!
                            Wasn't it good for a boy to see
                            And wasn't it good for a boy to
                                be
                            Out to Old Aunt
                                Mary's
                        
                        
                            And O my brother, so far away,
                            This is to tell you she waits to-day
                            To welcome us:Aunt Mary fell
                            Asleep this morning, whispering,
                                "Tell
                            The boys to come!" And all is
                                well
                            Out to Old Aunt
                                Mary's.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        ILLILEO.
                        
                            ILLILEO, the moonlight seemed lost across
                                the vales
                            The stars but strewed the azure as an
                                armor's scattered scales;
                            The airs of night were quiet as the breath
                                of silken sails,
                            And all your words were sweeter than the
                                notes of night-ingales.
                        
                        
                            Illileo Legardi, in the garden there
                                alone,
                            With your figure carved of fervor, as the
                                Psyche carved of stone
                            There came to me no murmur of the
                                fountain' under-tone
                            So mystically, musically mellow as your
                                own
                        
                        
                            You whispered low, Illileoso low the
                                leaves were mute,
                            And the echoes faltered breathless in
                                your voice's vain pursuit;
                            And there died the distant dalliance of
                                the serenader's lute:
                            And I held you in my bosom as the husk
                                may hold the fruit.
                        
                        
                        
                            Illileo, I listened. I believed you. In
                                my bliss,
                            What were all the worlds above me since I
                                found you thus in this?
                            Let them reeling reach to win meeven
                                Heaven I would miss
                            Grasping earthward!I would cling here,
                                though I clung by just a kiss.
                        
                        
                            All blossoms should grow odorlessand
                                lilies all aghast 
                            And I said the stars should slacken in
                                their paces through the vast,
                            Ere yet my loyalty should fail enduring
                                to the last.
                            So vowed I. It is written. It is
                                changeless as the past.
                        
                        
                            Illileo Legardi, in the shade your palace
                                throws
                            Like a cowl about the singer at your
                                gilded porticos,
                            A moan goes with the music that may vex
                                the high repose
                            Of a heart that fades and crumbles as the
                                crimson of a rose
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A BRIDE.
                        
                            " O I AM weary! " she
                                sighed, as her billowy
                            Hair she unloosed in a torrent
                                of gold
                            That rippled and fell o'er a
                                figure as willowy,
                            Graceful and fair as a goddess
                                of old:
                            Over her jewels she flung herself
                                drearily,
                            Crumpled the laces that snowed
                                on her breast,
                            Crushed with her fingers the lily that
                                wearily
                            Clung in her hair like a dove
                                in its nest.
                            And naught but her shadowy
                                form in the mirror
                            To kneel in dumb agony down
                                and weep near her!
                        
                        
                            "Weary? "of what? Could
                                we fathom the mystery?
                            Lift up the lashes weighed
                                down by her tears,
                            And wash with their dews one white face
                                from her history,
                            Set like a gem in the red
                                rust of years?
                            Nothing will rest herunless he who died
                                of her
                            Strayed from his grave, and,
                                in place of the groom,
                            Tipping her face, kneeling there by the
                                side of her,
                            Drained the old kiss to the
                                dregs of his doom.
                            And naught but that shadowy
                                form in the mirror
                            To kneel in dumb agony down
                                and weep near her!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        SONG.
                        
                            There is ever a song somewhere, my dear;
                            There is ever a something
                                sings alway:
                            There's the song of the lark when
                                the skies are clear,
                            And the song of the thrush
                                when the skies are gray.
                            The sunshine showers across the grain,
                            And the bluebird trills in the
                                orchard tree;
                            And in and out, when the eaves drip rain,
                            The swallows are twittering
                                ceaselessly.
                        
                        
                            There is ever a song somewhere, my dear,
                            Be the skies above or dark or
                                fair,
                            There is ever a song that our hearts may
                                hear
                            There is ever a song somewhere, my dear 
                            There is ever a song
                                somewhere!
                        
                        
                            There is ever a song somewhere, my dear,
                            In the midnight black, or the
                                mid-day blue;
                            The robin pipes when the sun is here,
                            And the cricket chirrups the
                                whole night through.
                        
                        
                        
                            The buds may blow and the fruit may grow,
                            And the autumn leaves drop
                                crisp and sere;
                            But whether the sun, or the rain, or the
                                snow,
                            There is ever a song
                                somewhere, my dear.
                        
                        
                            There is ever a song somewhere, my dear,
                            Be the skies above or dark or
                                fair,
                            There is ever a song that our hearts may
                                hear
                            There is ever a song somewhere, my dear
                            There is ever a song
                                somewhere!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        WHEN BESSIE DIED.
                        
                            If from your own the dimpled hands had
                                slipped,
                            And ne'ver would
                                nestle in your palm again;
                            If the white feet into the grave had
                                tripped
                        
                        
                            WHEN Bessie died
                            We braided the brown hair, and tied
                            It just as her own little hands
                            Had fastened back the silken strands
                            A thousand timesthe crimson bit
                            Of ribbon woven into it
                            That she had worn with childish pride
                            Smoothed down the dainty bowand cried
                            When Bessie died.
                        
                        
                            When Bessie died
                            We drew the nursery blinds aside,
                            Burst like a primrose into bloom,
                            Her pet canary's cage we hung
                            Where she might hear him when he sung
                            And yet not any note he tried,
                            Though she lay listening folded-eyed.
                        
                        
                        
                            When Bessie died
                            We writhed in prayer unsatisfied;
                            We begged of God, and He did smile
                            In silence on us all the while;
                            And we did sec Him, through our tears,
                            Enfolding that fair form of hers,
                            She laughing back against His love
                            The kisses we had nothing of
                            And death to us He still denied,
                            When Bessie died
                            When Bessie died.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE SHOWER
                        
                            THE
                                landscape, like the awed face of a child,
                            Grew curiously blurred; a hush
                                of death
                            Fell on the fields, and in the darkened
                                wild
                            The zephyr held its
                            breath.
                        
                        
                            No wavering glamour-work of light and
                                shade
                            Dappled the shivering surface
                                of the brook;
                            The frightened ripples in their ambuscade
                            Of willows thrilled and
                            shook.
                        
                        
                            The sullen day grew darker, and anon
                            Dim flashes of pent anger lit
                                the sky;
                            With rumbling wheels of wrath came
                                rolling on
                            The storm's
                                artillery.
                        
                        
                            The cloud above put on its blackest
                                frown,
                            And then, as with a vengeful
                                cry of pain,
                            The lightning snatched it, ript and flung
                                it down
                            In raveled shreds of
                            rain:
                        
                        
                        
                            While I, transfigured by some wondrous
                                art,
                            Bowed with the thirsty lilies
                                to the sod,
                            My empty soul brimmed over, and my heart
                            Drenched with the love of
                                God.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A LIFE-LESSON.
                        
                            THERE!
                                little girl; don't cry!
                            They have broken your doll, I
                                know;
                            And your tea-set blue,
                            And your play-house, too,
                            Are things of the long ago;
                            But childish troubles will
                                soon pass by. 
                            There! little girl;
                                don't cry!
                        
                        
                            There! liltle girl; don't cry!
                            They have broken your slate, I
                                know;
                            And the glad, wild ways
                            Of your school-girl days
                            Are things of the long ago;
                            But life and love will soon
                                come by. 
                            There! little girl;
                                don't cry!
                        
                        
                        
                            There! little girl! don't cry!
                            They have broken your heart,
                                I know;
                            And the rainbow gleams
                            Of your youthful dreams
                            Are things of the long ago;
                            But Heaven holds all for
                                which you sigh
                            There! little girl;
                                don't cry!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE SCRAWL.
                        
                            I WANT to sing somethingbut this is all
                            I try and I try, but the
                                rhymes are dull,
                            As though they were damp, and the echoes
                                fall
                            Limp and unlovable.
                        
                        
                            Words will not say what I yearn to say
                            They will not walk as I want
                                them to;
                            But they stumble and fall in the path of
                                the way
                            Of my telling my love for
                            you.
                        
                        
                            Simply take what the scrawl is worth
                            Knowing I love you as sun the
                                sod
                            On the ripening side of the great round
                                earth
                            That swings in the smile of
                                God.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        AWAY.
                        
                            I CANNOT say, and I will not say
                            That he is dead.He is just away!
                        
                        
                            With a cheery smile, and a wave of the
                                hand,
                            He has wandered into an unknown land,
                        
                        
                            And left us dreaming how very fair
                            It needs must be, since he lingers
                            there.
                        
                        
                            And youO you, who the wildest yearn
                            For the old-time step and the glad
                            return,
                        
                        
                            Think of him faring on, as dear
                            In the love of There as the love of
                            Here:
                        
                        
                            And loyal still, as he gave the blows
                            Of his warrior-strength to his
                                country's foes.
                        
                        
                            Mild and gentle, as he was brave,
                            When the sweetest love of his life he
                                gave
                        
                        
                            To simple things:Where the violets grew
                            Pure as the eyes they were likened
                            to,
                        
                        
                        
                            The touches of his hands have strayed
                            As reverently as his lips have
                            prayed:
                        
                        
                            When the little brown thrush that harshly
                                chirred
                            Was dear to him as the mocking-bird;
                        
                        
                            And he pitied as much as a man in pain
                            A writhing honey-bee wet with rain. 
                        
                        
                            Think of him still as the same, I say:
                            He is not deadhe is just away!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        WHO BIDES HIS TIME.
                        
                            And lifts a mirthful roundelay,
                            However poor his fortunes be,
                            He will not fail in any qualm
                            Of povertythe paltry dime
                            It will grow golden in his palm,
                            Who bides his time.
                        
                        
                            Who bides his timehe tastes the sweet
                            Of honey in the saltest tear;
                            And though he fares with slowest feet,
                            Joy runs to meet him, drawing
                                near;
                            The birds are heralds of his cause,
                            And like a never-ending
                                rhyme,
                            The roadsides bloom in his applause,
                            Who bides his time.
                        
                        
                            Who bides his time, and fevers not
                            In the hot race that none
                                achieves,
                            Shall wear cool-wreathen laurel, wrought
                            With crimson berries in the
                                leaves;
                        
                        
                        
                            And he shall reign a goodly king,
                            And sway his hand
                                o'er every clime,
                            With peace writ on his signet ring,
                            Who bides his time.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        LAUGHTER HOLDING BOTH HIS SIDES.
                        
                            Aye, thou varlet! Laugh away!
                            All the world's a holiday!
                            Laugh away, and roar and shout
                            Till thy hoarse tongue lolleth out!
                            Bloat thy cheeks, and bulge thine eyes
                            Unto bursting; pelt thy thighs
                            With thy swollen palms, and roar
                            As thou never hast before!
                            Lustier! wilt thou! peal on peal!
                            Stiflest? Squat and grind thy heel
                            Wrestle with thy loins, and then
                            Wheeze thee whiles, and whoop again!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        AND THIS IS FAME.
                        I
                        
                            ONCE, in a
                                dream, I saw a man,
                            With haggard face and tangled
                                hair,
                            And eyes that nursed as wild a
                                care
                            As gaunt Starvation ever can;
                            And in his hand he held a wand
                            Whose magic touch gave life
                                and thought
                            Unto a form his fancy wrought,
                            And robed with coloring so grand,
                            It seemed the reflex of some
                                child
                            Of Heaven, fair and undenled
                            A face of purity and love
                            To woo him into worlds above;
                            And as I gazed, with dazzled eyes,
                            A gleaming smile lit up his
                                lips
                            As his bright soul from its
                                eclipse
                            Went flashing into Paradise.
                            Then tardy Fame came through the door
                            And found a picturenothing more.
                        
                        
                        
                            II.
                            And once I saw a man, alone,
                            In abject poverty, with hand
                            Uplifted o'er a block of stone
                            And smiled upon him, fair and
                                good
                            A perfect work of womanhood,
                            Save that the eyes might never weep,
                            Nor weary hands be crossed in sleep,
                            Nor hair that fell from crown to wrist,
                            Be brushed away, caressed and kissed.
                            And as in awe I gazed on her,
                            I saw the sculptor's
                                chisel fall
                            I saw him sink, without a
                                moan,
                            Sink lifeless at the feet of
                                stone,
                            And lie there like a worshiper.
                            Fame crossed the threshold of
                                the hall,
                            And found a statuethat was
                                all.
                        
                        
                            III
                            And once I saw a man who drew
                            A gloom about him like a
                                cloak,
                            And wandered aimlessly. The few
                            Who spoke of him at all, but
                                spoke
                        
                        
                        
                            Disparagingly of a mind
                            The Fates had faultily designed:
                            Too indolent for modern times
                            Too fanciful, and full of
                                whims
                            For, talking to himself in rhymes,
                            And scrawling never-heard-of
                                hymns,
                            The idle life to which he clung
                            Was worthless as the songs he sung!
                            I saw him, in my vision, filled
                            With rapture o'er a
                                spray of bloom
                            The wind threw in his lonely
                                room;
                            And of the sweet perfume it spilled
                            He drank to drunkenness, and flung
                            His long hair back, and laughed and sung
                            And clapped his hands as children do
                            At fairy tales they listen to;
                            While from his flying quill there dripped
                            Such music on his manuscript
                            That he who listens to the words
                            May close his eyes and dream the birds
                            Are twittering on every hand
                            A language he can understand.
                            He journeyed on through life, unknown,
                            Without one friend to call his own;
                            He tired. No kindly hand to press
                            The cooling touch of tenderness
                        
                        
                        
                            Upon his burning brow, nor lift
                            To his parched lips God's freest
                                gift
                            No sympathetic sob or sigh
                            Of trembling lipsno sorrowing eye
                            Looked out through tears to see him die
                            And Fame her greenest laurels brought
                            To crown a head that heeded not.
                        
                        
                            And this is fame! A thing, indeed,
                            That only comes when least the need:
                            The wisest minds of every age
                            The book of life from page to page
                            Have searched in vain; each lesson conned
                            Will promise it the page beyond
                            Until the last, when dusk of night
                            Falls over it, and reason's
                                light
                            Is smothered by that unknown friend
                            Who signs his nom de plume, The End.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE BEETLE.
                        
                            The shrilling locust slowly sheathes
                            His dagger-voice, and creeps
                                away
                            Beneath the brooding leaves where breathes
                            The zephyr of the dying day:
                            One naked star has waded through
                            The purple shallows of the
                                night,
                            And faltering as falls the dew
                            It drips its misty light.
                            O'er garden-blooms,
                            On tides of musk,
                            The beetle booms adown the
                                glooms
                            And bumps along the dusk.
                        
                        
                            The katydid is rasping at
                            The silence from the tangled
                                broom;
                            On drunken wings the flitting bat
                            Goes staggering athwart the
                                gloom:
                            The toadstool bulges through the weeds;
                            And lavishly to left and
                                right
                            The fire-flies, like golden seeds,
                            Are sown about the night.
                        
                        
                        
                            O'er slumbrous blooms,
                            On floods of musk,
                            The beetle booms adown the glooms
                            And bumps along the dusk.
                        
                        
                            The primrose flares its baby-hands
                            Wide open, as the empty moon,
                            Slow lifted from the underlands,
                            Drifts up the azure-arched
                                lagoon:
                            The shadows on the garden walk
                            Are frayed with rifts of
                                silver light;
                            And, trickling down the poppy-stalk,
                            The dewdrop streaks the
                                night.
                            O'er folded blooms,
                            On swirls of musk,
                            The beetle booms adown the
                                glooms
                            And bumps along the dusk.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE BROOK-SONG.
                        
                            Little brook! Little brook!
                            You have such a happy look
                            Such a very merry manner, as you swerve
                                and curve and Crook
                            And your ripples, one and one,
                            Reach each other's
                                hands and run
                            Like laughing little children
                                in the sun!
                            Little brook, sing to me:
                            Sing about a bumblebee
                            That tumbled from a lily-bell and grumbled
                                mumblingly,
                            Because he wet the film
                            Of his wings, and had to
                                swim,
                            While the water-bugs raced
                                round and laughed at him!
                        
                        
                            Little brooksing a song
                            Of a leaf that sailed along
                            Down the golden-braided center of your
                                current swift and strong,
                        
                        
                        
                            And a dragonfly that lit
                            On the tilting rim of it,
                            And rode away and
                                wasn't scared a bit.
                        
                        
                            And singhow oft in glee
                            Came a truant boy like me,
                            Who loved to lean and listen to your
                                lilting melody,
                            Till the gurgle and refrain
                            Of your music in his brain
                            Wrought a happiness as keen
                                to him as pain.
                        
                        
                            Little brooklaugh and leap!
                            Do not let the dreamer weep:
                            Sing him all the songs of summer till he
                                sink in softest sleep;
                            And then sing soft and low
                            Through his dreams of long
                                ago
                            Sing back to him the rest he
                                used to know!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE OLD MAN.
                        
                            Lo! steadfast and serene,
                            In patient pause between
                            The seen and the unseen,
                            What gentle zephyrs fan
                            Your silken silver hair,
                            And what diviner air
                            Breathes round you like a prayer,
                            Old Man?
                        
                        
                            Can you, in nearer view
                            Of Glory, pierce the blue
                            Of happy heaven through;
                            And, listening mutely, can
                            Your senses, dull to us,
                            Hear angel-voices thus,
                            In chorus glorious
                            Old Man?
                        
                        
                            In your reposeful gaze
                            The dusk of Autumn days
                            Is blent with April haze,
                            As when of old began
                        
                        
                        
                            The bursting of the bud
                            Of rosy babyhood
                            When all the world was good,
                            Old Man.
                        
                        
                            And yet I find a sly
                            Little twinkle in your eye;
                            And your whisperingly shy
                            Little laugh is simply an
                            Internal shout of glee
                            That betrays the fallacy
                            You'd perpetrate on me,
                            Old Man!
                        
                        
                            So just put up the frown
                            That your brows are pulling down!
                            Why, the fleetest boy in town,
                            As he bared his feet and ran,
                            Could read with half a glance
                            And of keen rebuke, perchance
                            Your secret countenance,
                            Old Man!
                        
                        
                            Now, honestly, confess:
                            Is an old man any less
                            Than the little child we bless
                            And caress when we can?
                        
                        
                        
                            Isn't age but just a place
                            Where you mask the childish face
                            To preserve its inner grace,
                            Old Man?
                        
                        
                            Hasn't age a truant day,
                            Just as that you went astray
                            In the wayward, restless way,
                            When, brown with dust and
                                tan,
                            Your roguish face essayed,
                            In solemn masquerade,
                            To hide the smile it made,
                            Old Man?
                        
                        
                            Now, fair, and square, and true,
                            Don't your old soul tremble
                                through,
                            As in youth it used to do
                            When it brimmed and overran
                            With the strange, enchanted sights
                            And the splendors and delights
                            Of the old "Arabian
                                Nights,"
                            Old Man?
                        
                        
                            When, haply, you have fared
                            Where glad Aladdin shared
                            His lamp with you, and dared
                            The Afrite and his clan;
                        
                        
                        
                            And, with him, clambered through
                            The trees where jewels grew
                            And filled your pockets, too,
                            Old Man?
                        
                        
                            Or, with Sinbad, at sea
                            And in veracity
                            Who has sinned as bad as he,
                            Or would, or will, or can?
                            Have you listened to his lies,
                            With open mouth and eyes,
                            And learned his art likewise,
                            Old Man?
                        
                        
                            And you need not deny
                            That your eyes were wet as dry,
                            Reading novels on the sly!
                            And review them, if you can,
                            And the same warm tears will fall
                            Only faster, that is all
                            Over Little Nell and Paul,
                            Old Man!
                        
                        
                            O, you were a lucky lad 
                            Just as good as you were bad!
                            And the host of friends you had
                            Charley, Tom, and Dick, and
                                Dan;
                        
                        
                        
                            And the old school-teacher, too,
                            Though he often censured you;
                            And the girls in pink and blue,
                            Old Man.
                        
                        
                            Andas often you have leant,
                            In boyish sentiment,
                            To kiss the letter sent
                            By Nelly, Belle, or Nan
                            Wherein the rose's hue
                            Was red, the violet blue
                            And sugar sweetand you,
                            Old Man,
                        
                        
                            So, to-day, as lives the bloom
                            And the sweetness, and perfume
                            Of the blossoms, I assume,
                            On the same mysterious plan
                            The Master's love assures,
                            That the self-same boy endures
                            In that hale old heart of yours,
                            Old Man.

                            I part the clouds aboon the scene
                            Where thou wast born, and peer atween,

                            But sweeter seems
                            Because they poured their limpid rune

                                is but an idle god, I guess,
                            Since all the fair midsummer
                                of my dreams
                            He loiters listlessly by woody
                                streams,
                            Soaking the lush glooms up with laziness;
                            Or drowsing while the maiden-winds caress
                            Him prankishly, and powder him
                                with gleams
                            Of sifted sunshine. And he
                                ever seems
                            Drugged with a joy unutterableunless
                            His low pipes whistle hints of
                                it far out
                            Across the ripples to the dragonfly
                            That, like a wind-borne
                                blossom blown about,
                            Drops quiveringly down, as though to die
                            Then lifts and wavers on, as
                                if in doubt
                            Whether to fan his wings or
                                fly without.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        DUSK.
                        
                            THE
                                frightened herds of clouds across the sky
                            Trample the sunshine down, and
                                chase the day
                            Into the dusky forest-lands of
                                gray
                            And sombre twilight. Far, and faint, and
                                high,
                            The wild goose trails his harrow, with a
                                cry
                            Sad as the wail of some poor
                                castaway
                            Who sees a vessel drifting far
                                astray
                            Of his last hope, and lays him down to
                                die.
                            The children, riotous from school, grow
                                bold,
                            And quarrel with the wind
                                whose angry gust
                            Plucks off the summer-hat, and flaps the
                                fold
                            Of many a crimson cloak, and
                                twirls the dust
                            In spiral shapes grotesque, and dims the
                                gold
                            Of gleaming tresses with the
                                blur of rust.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        JUNE.
                        
                            O QUEENLY
                                month of indolent repose!
                            I drink thy breath in sips of
                                rare perfume,
                            AS in thy downy lap of
                                clover-bloom
                            I nestle like a drowsy child, and doze
                            The lazy hours away. The zephyr throws
                            The shifting shuttle of the
                                summer's loom,
                            And weaves a damask-work of
                                gleam and gloom
                            Before thy listless feet: the lily blows
                            A bugle-call of fragrance
                                o'er the glade;
                            And, wheeling into ranks,
                                with plume and spear,
                            Thy harvest-armies gather on
                                parade;
                            While, faint and far away,
                                yet pure and clear,
                            A voice calls out of alien lands of
                                shade,
                            All hail the Peerless Goddess
                                of the Year!"
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        SILENCE
                        
                            THOUSANDS
                                and thousands of hushed years ago,
                            Out on the edge of Chaos, all
                                alone
                            I stood on peaks of vapor,
                                high upthrown
                            Above a sea that knew nor ebb nor flow,
                            Nor any motion won of winds that blow,
                            Nor any sound of watery wail
                                or moan,
                            Nor lisp of wave, nor
                                wandering undertone
                            Of any tide lost in the night below.
                            So still it was, I mind me, as I laid
                            My thirsty ear against mine
                                own faint sigh
                            To drink of that, I sipped it, half
                                afraid
                            'Twas but the ghost
                                of a dead voice spilled by
                            The one starved star that tottered
                                through the shade,
                            And came tiptoeing toward me
                                down the sky.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        PUCK.
                        
                            O IT was
                                Puck! I saw him yesternight
                            Swung up betwixt a phlox-top
                                and the rim
                            Of a low crescent moon that
                                cradled him,
                            Whirring his rakish wings with all his
                                might,
                            And pursing his wee mouth, that dimpled
                                white
                            And red, as though some dagger
                                keen and slim
                            Had stung him there, while
                                ever faint and dim
                            His eerie warblings piped his high
                                delight;
                            Till I, grown jubilant, shrill answer
                                made,
                            At which, all suddenly, he
                                dropped from view;
                            And peering after, 'neath the
                                everglade,
                            What was it, do you think, I
                                saw him do?
                            I saw him peeling dewdrops with a blade
                            Of starshine sharpened on his
                                bat-wing shoe.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        SLEEP.
                        
                            THOU
                                drowsy god, whose blurred eyes, half awink
                            Muse on me,drifting out upon
                                thy dreams,
                            I lave my soul as in enchanted
                                streams,
                            Where reveling satyrs pipe along the
                                brink,
                            And, tipsy with the melody they drink,
                            Uplift their dangling hooves
                                and down the beams
                            Of sunshine dance like motes.
                                Thy languor seems
                            An ocean-depth of love wherein I sink
                            Like some fond Argonaut, right
                                willingly,
                            Because of wooing eyes upturned to mine,
                            And siren-arms that coil
                                their sorcery
                            About my neck, with kisses so divine,
                            The heavens reel above me,
                                and the sea
                            Swallows and licks its wet
                                lips over me.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        HER HAIR.
                        
                            THE beauty
                                of her hair bewilders me
                            Pouring adown the brow, its
                                cloven tide
                            Swirling about the ears on
                                either side,
                            And storming round the neck tumultuously:
                            Or like the lights of old antiquity
                            Through mullioned windows, in
                                cathedrals wide,
                            Spilled moltenly o'er
                                figures deified
                            In chastest marble, nude of drapery.
                            And so I love it.Either unconfined;
                            Or plaited in close braidings
                                manifold;
                            Or smoothy drawn; or indolently twined
                            In careless knots whose
                                coilings come unrolled
                            At any lightest kiss; or by the wind
                            Whipped out in flossy
                                ravelings of gold.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        TO THE CRICKET.
                        
                            THE
                                chiming seas may clang; and Tubal Cain
                            May clink his tinkling metals
                                as he may;
                            Or Pan may sit and pipe his
                                breath away;
                            Or Orpheus wake his most entrancing strain
                            Till not a note of melody remain:
                            But thou, O cricket, with thy
                                roundelay,
                            Shalt laugh them all to scorn!
                                So wilt thou, pray,
                            Trill me thy glad song o'er and
                                o'er again:
                            I shall not weary; there is
                                purest worth
                            In thy sweet prattle, since it sings the
                                lone
                            Heart home again. Thy
                                warbling hath no dearth
                            Of childish memoriesno harsher tone
                            Than we might listen to in
                                gentlest mirth,
                            Thou poor plebeian minstrel
                                of the hearth.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE SERENADE.
                        
                            THE
                                midnight is not more bewildering
                            To her drowsed eyes, than, to
                                her ears, the sound
                            Of dim, sweet singing voices,
                                interwound
                            With purl of flute and subtle twang of
                                string,
                            Strained through the lattice, where the
                                roses cling,
                            And, with their fragrance,
                                waft the notes around
                            Her haunted senses. Thirsting
                                beyond bound
                            Of her slow-yielding dreams, the lilt and
                                swing
                            Of the mysterious, delirious
                                tune,
                            She drains like some strange opiate, with
                                awed eyes
                            Upraised against her
                                casement, where, aswoon
                            The stars fail from her sight, and up the
                                skies
                            Of alien azure, rolls the
                                full round moon
                            Like some vast bubble blown
                                of summer noon.

                            WHEN she
                                comes home again! A thousand ways
                            I fashion, to myself, the
                                tenderness
                            Of my glad welcome: I shall
                                trembleyes;
                            And touch her, as when first in the old
                                days
                            I touched her girlish hand, nor dared
                                upraise
                            Mine eyes, such was my faint
                                heart's sweet distress.
                            Then silence: And the perfume
                                of her dress:
                            The room will sway a little, and a haze
                            Cloy eyesightsoulsight,

                                throat,
                            To know that I so ill deserve
                                the place
                            Her arms make for me; and the sobbing
                                note
                            I stay with kisses, ere the

                            of melody, indeed, but a poet, certainly
                        
                            "Who, through long days of labor,
                            And nights devoid of ease,
                            Still heard in his soul the music
                            Of wonderful
                                melodies."
                        
                        And it is simply the purpose of this concluding series of
                            dialectic Studies to reflect the real worth of this homely child of
                            Nature, and to echo faithfully, if possible, the faltering music of his
                            song.
                    
                    
                    
                        THE OLD SWIMMIN'-HOLE.
                        OH! the old swimmin'-hole! whare the
                            crick so still and deep
                        Looked like a baby-river that was
                            layin' half asleep,
                        And the gurgle of the worter round the drift
                            jest below
                        Sounded like the laugh of something we
                            onc't ust to know
                        Before we could remember anything but the eyes
                        Of the angels lookin' out as we left
                            Paradise;
                        But the merry days of youth is beyond our
                            control,
                        And it's hard to part forever with
                            the old swimmin'-hole.
                        Oh! the old swimmin'-hole! In the
                            happy days of yore,
                        When I ust to lean above it on the old
                            sickamore,
                        Oh! it showed me a face in its warm sunny
                            tide
                        That gazed back at me so gay and glorified,
                        It made me love myself, as I leaped to caress
                        My shadder smilin' up at me with
                            sech tenderness.
                        But them days is past and gone, and old
                            Time's tuck his toll
                        From the old man come back to the old
                            swimmin'-hole,
                        
                        Oh! the old swimmin'-hole! In the
                            long, lazy days
                        When the hum-drum of school made so many
                            ran-a-ways,
                        How plesant was the jurney down the old dusty
                            lane,
                        Whare the tracks of our bare feet was all
                            printed so plain
                        You could tell by the dent of the heel and
                            the sole
                        They was lots of fun on hands at the old
                            swimmin'-hole,
                        But the lost joys is past! Let your tears in
                            sorrow roll
                        Like the rain that ust to dapple up the old
                            swimmin'-hole.
                        Thare the bullrushes growed, and the
                            cat-tails so tall,
                        And the sunshine and shadder fell over it
                            all;
                        And it mottled the worter with amber and gold
                        Till the glad lilies rocked in the ripples
                            that rolled;
                        And the snake-feeder's four gauzy
                            wings fluttered by
                        Like the ghost of a daisy dropped out of the
                            sky,
                        Or a wownded apple-blossom in the
                            breeze's control,
                        As it cut acrost some orchard to'rds
                            the old swinnnin'-hole.
                        Oh! the old swimmin'-hole! When I
                            last saw the place,
                        The scenes was all changed, like the change
                            in my face;
                        The bridge of the railroad now crosses the
                            spot
                        Whare the old divin'-log lays sunk
                            and fergot.
                        And I stray down the banks whare the trees
                            ust to be
                        But never again will their shade shelter me!
                        And I wish in my sorrow I could strip to the
                            soul,
                        And dive off in my grave like the old
                            swimmin'-hole.
                    
                    
                    
                        THOUGHTS FER THE DISCURAGED FARMER.
                        THE summer
                            winds is sniffin' round the bloomin' locus'
                            trees;
                        And the clover in the pastur' is a
                            big day fer the bees,
                        And they been a-swiggin' honey, above
                            board and on the sly,
                        Till they stutter in their buzzin',
                            and stagger as they fly.
                        The flicker on the fence-rail 'pears
                            to jest spit on his wings
                        And roll up his feathers, by the sassy way he
                            sings;
                        And the hoss-fly is a-whettin'-up his
                            forelegs fer biz,
                        And the off-mare is a-switchin' all
                            of her tale they is!
                        You can hear the blackbirds jawin' as
                            they toiler up the plow
                        Oh, theyr bound to git theyr brekfast, and
                            theyr not a-carin' how;
                        So they quarrel in the furries, and they
                            quarrel on the wing
                        But theyr peaceabler in pot-pies than any
                            other thing:
                        
                        And it's when I git my shotgun
                            drawed up in stiddy rest,
                        She's as full of tribbelation as a
                            yaller-jacket's nest;
                        And a few shots before dinner, when the
                            sun's a-shinin' right,
                        Seems to kindo-sorto sharpen up a
                            feller's appetite!
                        They's been a heap o' rain,
                            but the sun's out to-day,
                        And the clouds of the wet spell is all
                            cleared away,
                        And the woods is all the greener, and the
                            grass is greener still;
                        It may rain again to-morry, but I
                            don't think it will.
                        Some says the crops is ruined, and the
                            corn's drownded out,
                        And propha-sy the wheat will be a failure,
                            without doubt;
                        But the kind Providence that has never failed
                            us yet,
                        Will be on hands onc't more at the
                            'leventh hour, I bet!
                        Does the medder-lark complain, as he swims
                            high and dry
                        Through the waves of the wind and the blue of
                            the sky?
                        Does the quail set up and whistle in a
                            disappinted way,
                        Er hang his head in silence, and sorrow all
                            the day?
                        Is the chipmuck's health
                            a-failin'? Does he walk, er does he run?
                        Don't the buzzards ooze around up
                            thare jest like they've allus done?
                        
                        Is they anything the matter with the
                            rooster's lungs er voice?
                        Ort a moral be complainin' when dump
                            animals rejoice?
                        Then let us, one and all, be contented with
                            our lot;
                        The June is here this morning, and the sun is
                            shinin' hot.
                        Oh! let us fill our harts up with the glory
                            of the day,
                        And banish ev'ry doubt and care and
                            sorrow far away!
                        Whatever be our station, with Providence fer
                            guide,
                        Such fine circumstances ort to make us
                            satisfied;
                        Fer the world is full of roses, and the roses
                            full of dew,
                        And the dew is full of heavenly love that
                            drips fer me and you.
                    
                    
                    
                        A SUMMER'S DAY.
                        
                            THE
                                Summer's put the idy in
                            My head that I'm a boy again;
                            And all around's so
                                bright and gay
                            I want to put my team away,
                            And jest git out whare I can
                                lay
                            And soak my hide full of the
                                day!
                            But work is work, and must be done
                            Yit, as I work, I have my fun,
                            Jest fancyin' these furries here

                            And so I walk through medder-lands,
                            And country lanes, and swampy
                                trails
                            Whare long bullrushes bresh my hands;
                            And, tilted on the ridered
                                rails
                            Of
                                dead'nin' fences, "Old Bob

                            I wunder on in deeper glooms

                            When I burried my first womern, William
                                Leachman, it was you
                            Had the only consolation that I could
                                listen to

                            Of the times when we first settled here
                                and travel was so bad;
                            When we had to go on hoss-back, and
                                sometimes on "Shanks's mare,"
                            And "blaze" a road fer

                            As he leaves the house, bare-headed, and
                                goes out to feed the stock,
                            When the frost is on the punkin and the
                                fodder's in the shock.
                        
                        
                            They's something kindo'
                                hearty-like about the atmosphere
                            When the heat of summer's over
                                and the coolin' fall is here
                        
                        
                        
                            Of course we miss the flowers, and the
                                blossoms on the trees,
                            And the mumble of the
                                hummin'-birds and buzzin' of the bees;
                            But the air's so
                                appetizin'; and the landscape through the haze
                            Of a crisp and sunny morning of the airly
                                autumn days
                            Is a pictur' that no painter has
                                the colorin' to mock
                            When the frost is on the punkin and the
                                fodder's in the shock.
                        
                        
                            The husky, rusty rustle of the tossels of
                                the corn,
                            And the raspin' of the tangled
                                leaves, as golden as the morn;
                            The stubble in the furrieskindo'
                                lonesome-like, but still
                            A-preachin' sermons to us of the
                                barns they growed to fill;
                            The strawstack in the medder, and the
                                reaper in the shed;
                            The hosses in theyr stalls belowthe
                                clover overhead!
                            O, it sets my heart a-clickin'
                                like the tickin' of a clock,
                            When the frost is on the punkin and the

                            But thare is times, when all alone,
                            I work out idees of my own.
                            And of these same thare is a few
                            I'd like to jest refer to you

                            I allus argy that a man
                            Who does about the best he can
                            Is plenty good enough to suit
                            This lower mundane institude
                            No matter ef his daily walk
                            Is subject fer his neghbor's
                                talk,
                            And critic-minds of ev'ry whim
                            Jest all git up and go fer him!
                        
                        
                            I knowed a feller onc't that had
                            The yaller-janders mighty bad,
                            And each and ev'ry friend
                                he'd meet
                            Would stop and give him some reccet
                        
                        
                        
                            Fer cuorin' of 'em. But
                                he'd say
                            He kind o' thought
                                they'd go away
                            Without no medicin', and boast
                            That he'd git well without one
                                doste.
                        
                        
                            He kep' a yallerin'
                                onand they
                            Perdictin' that he'd
                                die some day
                            Before he knowed it! Tuck his bed,
                            The feller did, and lost his head,
                            And wundered in his mind a spell
                            Then rallied, and, at last, got well;
                            But ev'ry friend that said
                                he'd die
                            Went back on him eternaly!
                        
                        
                            Its natchural enough, I guess,
                            When some gits more and some gits less
                            Fer them-uns on the slimmest side
                            To claim it aint a fair divide;
                            And I've knowed some to lay and
                                wait,
                            And git up soon, and set up late,
                            To ketch some feller they could hate
                            Fer goin' at a faster gait.
                        
                        
                            The signs is bad when folks commence
                            A findin' fault with Providence,
                            And balkin' 'cause the
                                earth don't shake
                            At ev'ry prancin' step
                                they take.
                        
                        
                        
                            No man is great till he can see
                            How less than little he would be
                            Ef stripped to self, and stark and bare
                            He hung his sign out anywhare.
                        
                        
                            My doctern is to lay aside
                            Contensions, and be satisfied:
                            Jest do your best, and praise er blame
                            That follers that, counts jest the same.
                            I've allus noticed grate success
                            Is mixed with troubles, more or less,
                            And it's the man who does the
                                best
                            That gits more kicks than all the
                            rest.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        ON THE DEATH OF LITTLE MAHALA ASHCRAFT.
                        
                            "LITTLE Haly! Little
                                Haly!" cheeps the robin in the tree;
                            "Little Haly!" sighs the
                                clover, "Little Haly!" moans the bee;
                            "Little Haly! Little
                                Haly!" calls the killdeer at twilight;
                            And the katydids and crickets hollers
                                "Haly" all the night.
                        
                        
                            The sunflowers and the hollyhawks droops
                                over the garden fence;
                            The old path down the gardenwalks still
                                holds her footprints' dents;
                            And the well-sweep's
                                swingin' bucket seems to wait fer her to come
                            And start it on its wortery errant down
                                the old bee-gum.
                        
                        
                            The bee-hives all is quiet, and the little
                                Jersey steer,
                            When any one comes nigh it, acts so
                                lonesome like and queer;
                        
                        
                        
                            And the little Banty chickens kind
                                o' cutters faint and low,
                            Like the hand that now was
                                feedin' 'em was one they didn't know.
                        
                        
                            They's sorrow in the
                                wavin' leaves of all the apple-trees;
                            And sorrow in the harvest-sheaves, and
                                sorrow in the breeze;
                            And sorrow in the twitter of the swallers
                                'round the shed;
                            And all the song her red-bird sings is
                                "Little Haly's dead!"
                        
                        
                            The medder 'pears to miss her,
                                and the pathway through the grass,
                            Whare the dewdrops ust to kiss her little
                                bare feet as she passed;
                            And the old pin in the gate-post seems to
                                kindo-sorto' doubt
                            That Haly's little sunburnt
                                hands '11 ever pull it out.
                        
                        
                            Did her father er her mother ever love
                                her more'n me,
                            Er her sisters er her brother prize her
                                love more tenderly?
                            I questionand what answer?only tears, and
                                tears alone,
                            And ev'ry neghbor's
                                eyes is full o' tear-drops as my own.

                            "Little Haly!" sighs
                                the clover, "Little Haly!" moans the bee;
                            "Little Haly! Little

                            SOME sings of the lily, and daisy, and
                                rose,
                            And the pansies and pinks that the
                                summertime throws
                            In the green grassy lap of the medder that
                                lays
                            Blinkin' up at the skyes through
                                the sunshiny days;
                            But what is the lily, and all of the rest
                            Of the flowers, to a man with a hart in
                                his breast
                            That was dipped brimmin' full of
                                the honey and dew
                            Of the sweet clover-blossoms his babyhood
                                knew?
                        
                        
                            I never set eyes on a clover-field now,
                            Er fool round a stable, er climb in the
                                mow,
                            As the smell of the clover I'm
                                sniffin' again;
                            And I wunder away, in a bare-footed
                                dream,
                            Whare I tangle my toes in the blossoms
                                that gleam
                            With the dew of the dawn of the morning
                                of love
                            Ere it wept o'er the graves that
                                I'm weepin' above.
                        
                        
                            And so I love cloverit seems like a part
                            Of the sacerdest sorrows and joys of my
                                hart;
                            And wharever it blossoms, oh, thare let
                                me bow
                            And thank the good God as I'm
                                thankin' Him now;
                        
                        
                        
                            And I pray to Him still fer the
                                stren'th, when I die,
                            To go out in the clover and tell it
                                good-bye,
                            And lovin'ly nestle my face in
                                its bloom
                            While my soul slips away on a breth of
                                perfume.
