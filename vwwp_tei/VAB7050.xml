                <p>All poems occur as DIV0. Sonnets are attributed as "type=sonnets"; the rest are
                    "type=poem". All quotation marks, hyphens, dashes, apostrophes and colons have
                    been transcribed as entity references. All &lt;lg&gt; (line groups) are
                    attributed as cantos, stanzas, couplets, verse paragraphs, etc. All poems with
                    regularly indented lines use the attribute "rend" in the &lt;l&gt; tag,
                    with the value "indent1" for one tab stop, "indent2" for two tab stops, etc. All
                    split lines are attributed as "type=i" for the initial portion, and "type=f" for
                    the final portion.</p>
                <p>All apostrophes and single right quotation marks are encoded as
                    &amp;rsquo;.</p>
                <p>Any hyphens occurring in line breaks have been removed; all hyphens are encoded
                    as &amp;hyphen; and em dashes as &amp;mdash;.</p>

                            <l>Shone on the soundless thoroughfare</l>
                            <l>Whose shuttered houses, closed and still,</l>
                            <l>Seemed bodies without heart or will;</l>
                            <l>Yea, all the stony city lay</l>
                            <l>Impassive in that phantom day,</l>
                            <l>As amid livid wastes of sand</l>
                            <l>The sphinxes of the desert stand.</l>

                            <l>And we, we two, turned night to day,</l>
                            <l>As, whistling many a studentâs lay,</l>
                            <l>We sped along each ghostly street,</l>
                            <l>With girls whose lightly tripping feet</l>

                            <l>Well matched our longer, stronger stride,</l>

                            <l>We took a boat; each seized an oar,</l>
                            <l>Until on either hand the shore</l>
                            <l>Slipped backwards, as our voices woke</l>
                            <l>Far echoes, mingling like a dream</l>
                            <l>With swirl and tumult of the stream.</l>
                            <l>Onâonâaway, beneath the ray</l>
                            <l>Of midnight in the mask of day;</l>
                            <l>By great wharves where the masts at peace</l>
                            <l>Look like the oceanâs barren trees;</l>
                            <l>Past palaces and glimmering towers,</l>
                            <l>And gardens fairyâlike with flowers,</l>

                            <l>And that pathetic flowerâlike blue</l>
                            <l>Of eyes which, as they look at you,</l>
                            <l>Seemed yet to stab your bosom through.</l>
                            <l>I rowed, she steered; oars dipped and flashed,</l>
                            <l>The broadening river roared and splashed,</l>
                            <l>So that we hardly seemed to hear</l>
                            <l>Our comradesâ voices, though so near;</l>
                            <l>Their faces seeming far away,</l>

                            <l>A studentsâ haunt on summer eves,</l>

                            <l>Of those fraternal poplar trees</l>

                            ingrained national passion for dancingâthe Willi or Willis were the
                            spirits of young affianced girls who, dying before marriage, could not
                            rest in their graves. It was popularly believed that these phantoms
                            would nightly haunt lonely heaths in the neighbourhood of their native
                            villages till the disconsolate lovers came as if drawn by a magnetic
                            charm. On their appearance the Willi would dance with them without
                            intermission till they dropped dead from exhaustion.</opener>

                        <q>âThere is perhaps no phase of our history more capable of poetic
                            treatment than the sainted lives of the Irish monks who first spread the
                            Christian faith over the western shores of Scotland, and yet it would be
                            difficult to point to a single representative poem having Saint Columba
                            and the devoted band of his disciples for its heroes. An attempt at
                            filling up this gap has recently been made by Miss Blind in a narrative
                            poem devoted to the fate of St. Oran, the friend and disciple of St.
                            Columba.... Apart from the sonorous beauty of her lines, there is in her
                            diction a straightforwardness and simplicity, and an entire absence of
                            affectation and false sentiment, which, combined with considerable power
                            of characterization, make her volume a remarkable contribution to
                            English literature.â</q>

                        <q>âTo disturb the <foreign xml:lang="fre">motif</foreign> of a legend is
                            always a bold, and mostly a rash proceeding.... And yet so skilfully is
                            the story handled that the main incidents of the legend do not lose, but
                            gain by this disturbance of the <foreign xml:lang="fre">motif</foreign>,
                            and the character of Oran, which with the old <foreign xml:lang="fre">motif</foreign> could only have presented the single side of the
                            religious enthusiast, becomes a character exhibiting that complexity
                            which modern taste demands.... Directness of style and lucidity of
                            narrative are the characteristic excellences of the poem. There are few
                            contemporary poets who could have done so much dramatic business in so
                            few lines.... In each of the sonnets there is a thought that is well
                            expressed, and worth expressing.â</q>

                    <item>
                        <q>âIt is in the domain of character that the poem is distinguished by its
                            highest excellence. There is an ideal statuesqueness embodied in the
                            person of St. Columba such as is felt to possess a powerful appeal to
                            the imagination. The poem embraces many passions, of which the most
                            tender and beautiful finds expression in the exquisite creation of the
                            radiant goldenâhaired girl for whose love St. Oran breaks his vow of
                            chastity. But the really powerful contribution to our knowledge of
                            character which this book contains is fittingly centred in St. Oran
                            himself. A dramatic instinct of high order finds utterance in his
                            struggles between opposing passions. Nor are the metrical excellences of
                            the poem less conspicuous.... If one were in need of some single phrase
                            by which to denote the ultimate effect produced by this book, one might
                            say that it seems the most <emph>mature</emph> of all recent first
                            efforts, even of established rank.â</q>

                        <q>âIn the choice of a subject for her chief poem she has been singularly
                            fortunate.... That a story such as this is full of poetical
                            suggestiveness is obvious, and Miss Blind has proved herself equal to
                            the occasion. She has avoided writing anything approaching to a
                            âtendency poem.â She metes out justice with an equal hand to all her
                            characters. The genuine enthusiasm and religious zeal of the monks are
                            set forth in language as inspired as is the final protest of St. Oran
                            against their narrow fanaticism; and one of the best passages in the
                            book is indeed the Sermon in which St. Columba announces the Gospel of
                            love and redemption to the islanders.â</q>

                            there is visible a firm and practised hand, a bold and unmistakable
                            power. âThe Street Childrenâs Danceâ not unworthily ranks with some of

                            round an organ is as pathetically moralized and as tender and full of
                            loving pity as Mrs. Browningâs âCry of the Children.ââ</q>

                            work by the same unfaltering hand. This poem is a true work of art,

                        <q>âMiss Blind has produced one of the most noticeable and moving poems
                            which recent years have added to our shelves.... As a singer with a
                            message her attempt is praiseworthy, and her performance is fairly
                            selfâconsistent. It is eminently homogeneous; the passion once felt, the
                            inspiration once obeyed, the wellâhead pours forth its stream in a
                            strong and uniform current, which knows no pause until its impulse
                            ceases.... The story is pathetic at once in its simplicity and in its
                            terror.... We congratulate the author upon her boldness in choosing a
                            subject of our own time, fertile in what is pathetic, and free from any
                            taint of the vulgar and conventional. Poetry of late years has tended
                            too much towards motives of a merely fanciful and abstruse, sometimes a
                            plainly artificial, character; and we have had much of lyrical energy or
                            attraction, with little of the real marrow of human life, the flesh and
                            blood of man and woman. Positive subjectâmatter, the emotion which
                            inheres in actual life, the very smile and the very tear and heartâpang,
                            are, after all, precious to poetry, and we have them here. âThe Heather
                            on Fireâ may possibly prove to be something of a new departure, and one
                            that was certainly not superfluous.â</q>

                            tale is a fiction it is too well founded on fact.... It may be said
                            generally of the poem that the most difficult scenes are those in which
                            Miss Blind succeeds best; and on the whole we are inclined to think that
                            its greatest and most surprising success is the picture of the poor old
                            soldier Rory driven mad by the burning of his wife. In his frenzy he
                            mixes up his old battles with the French and the descent of the
                            landlordâs ejectors upon the village.â</q>

                            Miss Mathilde Blind. Irish evictions have offered so convenient a theme
                            to party strife, that the sufferings of the unhappy Highland crofters
                            have not always met with the compassion they were so well calculated to
                            inspire. In eloquent and forcible verse, Miss Blind tells the tale of
                            their wrongs, their resistance to the hard fate imposed upon them, and
                            describes the bitter grief with which, <ref>

                            equally sincere and equally hearty; for it is a poem that is rich not

                            stirs and moves us, and of which so much contemporary verse is almost
                            painfully deficient. Miss Blind does not possess her theme; she is
                            possessed by it, as was Mrs. Browning when she wroteâAurora Leigh.â...
                            We can best describe the kind of her success by noting the fact that

                            at all, but read on and on under the spell of a great horror and an
                            overâpowering pity. Poetry of which this can be said needs no other
                            recommendation, and, therefore, we need not unduly lengthen our review

                            Miss Blind passes in review some of the facts of the eviction of the

                            whom has just been bitten by the tarantula, and, according to the

                        <q>âMiss Blind traces the âAscent of Manâ through successive stages, until
                            first love, and then sorrowâwhich is love under another guiseâlead us to
                            the highest conception of human life we can hope to reach. It is a
                            brave, sad, glorious story, told with inimitable skill, and as only a
                            poet who knows manâs heart, with its hopes, doubts, fears, aspirations,
                            could possibly tell it.... The other poems in the volume are as
                            excellent in their kind as those which give a title to it. The only
                            difference between them is that one series is rich with human
                            experience, and with the results of knowledge and of high thinking,
                            while the other is all aglow with the fresh delights of the outdoor
                            world. These delights find an almost perfect expression.... A reviewer
                            who is so fortunate as to light on a book like this, lays it down with
                            regret, and fears that he has not said of it all that it deserves should
                            be said. That is my feeling; and, lest I should have omitted any note of
                            praise that ought to be sounded, I should like to add, by way of
                            suggestion to all lovers of poetryâand I hope they are still manyâthat
                            here is truly a book that is worth the loving.â</q>
