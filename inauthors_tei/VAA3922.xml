                <p>Having a natural predilection for the corn-fields, being &quot;born and
                    brought up&quot; on their borders, and by virtue of that fact able to
                    discriminate between a perfect ear and one that is immature, and with an eye to
                    the &quot;eternal fitness of things,&quot; I have, after carefully
                    comparing this little volume with others more pretentious, decided upon its
                    name, sincerely regretting the superabundance of husks, and the absence of
                    perfect grain. In order to place it within reach of those upon whom (as upon
                    myself) Fate, in her distribution of prizes, has bestowed neither
                    Aladdin&apos;s lamp nor the &quot;goose that lays the golden
                    egg,&quot; it is bound in this simple fashion, with a hope that it may find
                    its way to humble firesides, where we ourselves, forgetting for the time the
                    strife and turmoil of the busy world outside, would gladly bask once more in the
                    sunshine of the smiles of &quot;the folks we used to know.&quot;</p>

                        <l rend="ti-2">And the paths to the doorway were all overgrown.</l>

                        <l>An April blending of shade and shine</l>
                        <l>Is warp and woof in this life of mine;</l>
                        <l>Songs as sweet as the Angels know,</l>
                        <l>Alternate with a dirge of woe</l>
                        <l>A golden dawn. A noontide gray,</l>

                    <head>MY OLD SCHOOL ALBUM.</head>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Hidden away in the attic I found it</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">In an old oaken chest back under the eaves,</l>
                        <l>It was covered with dust, there were cobwebs around it,--</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">That pall for dead years that the spider erst weaves.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Its hinges creaked sadly as though to remonstrate</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">In tones that were solemn, and measured, and slow,</l>
                        <l>As I reverently drew from its hasp the rude padlock,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And opened the chest that was closed long ago.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Then forth from its depths there stole a sweet perfume,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">A breath from that beautiful island of yore</l>
                        <l>That lies afar off on time&apos;s mystic river,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And the keel of my barque was aground on its shore.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>It seems almost sacrilege now to remove it;</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">&apos;T has lain there unheeded through years that have
                            fled,--</l>

                        <l>My old school album with dear vanished faces</l>

                        <l>Ah! that proved not binding. The youth and the maiden</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Have drifted apart since &apos;t was given to me.</l>

                        <l>Had well nigh obscured all the blossoms of Spring-time</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">That gladdened the heart in the sweet long ago.</l>

                        <l rend="ti-2">Forgotten the years with their toil and their strife,</l>
                        <l>And my heart still responds to the selfsame emotions</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">That thrilled it far back in the morning of life.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>As one yearningly looks on the face of a loved one</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Ere the lid of the casket shall hide it for aye,</l>
                        <l>E&apos; en so do I gaze on each face in my album,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Then tenderly closing it, lay it away.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>With a hope that again in that far away <hi rend="i">somewhere,</hi></l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">That dim, misty somewhere, of which we are told,</l>

                    <head>&quot;AT REST.&quot;</head>
                    <lg>
                        <l>I stood to-day by a casket,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">With love&apos;s last offering dressed,</l>
                        <l>And saw amid the blossoms</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">These beautiful words, &quot;At rest.&quot;</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>And I thought as I gazed on the sleeper,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">As in silence and peace he lay,</l>
                        <l>How toilsome had been the journey,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">How rugged and steep the way.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>How little of joy and sunshine,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">How much of grief and pain,</l>
                        <l>And could I have called the spirit</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Back to its house again,</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>I would but have folded closer</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">The pale hands to his breast,</l>
                        <l>Not having the heart to wake him,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Seeing him thus &quot; At rest.&quot;</l>
                    </lg>

                    <lg>
                        <l>He had toiled through the heat of summer,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And on through the rain and sleet,</l>
                        <l>Till the burden had grown too heavy,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Falt&apos;ring the weary feet.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Not with the hope of fortune,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">But with a silent dread,</l>
                        <l>Of the &quot;wolf at the door,&quot; he had striven,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Toiled for his daily bread.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>The pale thin hands were folded,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">The brow was marked by care,</l>
                        <l>There were numberless threads of silver</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">All through the dark brown hair.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>And yet he was not an old man,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Nay just in the prime of life,</l>
                        <l>But the battle had been a fierce one,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And these were the marks of strife.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>One by one his neighbors</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">In a long procession passed,</l>
                        <l>Each pausing for a moment</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">To silently look their last.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Then one who was bent and aged</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Brushed the moisture from his cheek,</l>
                        <l>And said in a voice that faltered,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">&quot;Friends, I&apos;ve a word to speak.</l>
                    </lg>

                    <lg>
                        <l>&quot;I have known this man from childhood,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Gainsay it ye who can,</l>
                        <l>But he who lies before you</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Was ever an honest man.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>&quot;And I challenge one among you,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">No matter who ye be,</l>
                        <l>To say of this silent sleeper,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">He hath defrauded me.&quot;</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>He paused as for an answer,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">No sound the silence broke,</l>
                        <l>Again the old lips quivered,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And thus again he spoke:</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>&quot;Though the path he trod was humble,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">No fame did his life-work bring,</l>
                        <l>Yet he lies in that simple casket</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Crowned by his life, a king.&quot;</l>
