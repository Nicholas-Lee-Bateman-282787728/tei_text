            <p>Few members of President Benjamin Harrison's administration traveled so complicated a route
                    to political preferment as Stephen B. Elkins, secretary of war from 1891 to 1893. Elkins’
                    pivotal role in the Republican national convention of 1888, when he acted as a broker between
                    Harrison's managers and the followers of James G. Blaine, was well known at the time and
                    has since been documented by historians.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> What is less well known is why Elkins
                    took on the role of a Warwick and what reward he expected for his pains. The answer is simple:
                    Elkins wanted to be a <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senator from West <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. The problem was that he did not live in the Mountain State; thus, he naturally faced
                    competition there from native Republican leaders. These considerations forced him to adopt a
                    complicated strategy of maneuver in state and national politics. Harrison, for reasons of his own,
                    eventually fell in with Elkins’ strategy, but not before giving him some anxious moments,
                    first during the preconvention campaign of 1888, then during the period of Cabinet making and
                    remaking after he entered the White House.</p>
            <p>Elkins began his political career in the territory of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName>, but he won national prominence as the manager of Blaine's several campaigns
                    for the presidency. Elkins’ ideas about a senatorial career dated back at least to 1879
                    when Blaine promised to make his protege "Senator from New <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName> in two years," at which time, presumably, the Plumed Knight expected to place
                    the weight of the presidency behind a New <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName> statehood bill acceptable to local land speculators.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> But Blaine
                    failed to win the presidential chair in 1880 or again in 1884, when Elkins acted as the architect of
                    his narrowly <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName>, where he managed business interests extending to several states and territories.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> In a day when geographical considerations counted for much, Elkins sorely
                    needed a new political home. He also needed a new political patron after Blaine sailed away to
                    Europe in the summer of 1887 making uncharacteristic noises about retiring from politics.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> West Virginia supplied the first need; Harrison, the second. The key man in
                    each transaction was Elkins’ father-in-law and principal business partner, Henry Gassaway
                    Davis.</p>
            <p>It was not Blaine but Davis who sponsored the initial Elkins-Harrison political discussions in 1887.
                    A former Democratic senator from West Virginia from 1871–1883 with extensive mining and
                    railroad interests in the state, Davis had seen his own political career disrupted by factional
                    conflicts at home and his business interests threatened by the rising tide of tariff reform
                    sentiment in the national Democracy.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> By the spring of 1887 he concluded that
                    the interests of West Virginia coal producers would "be better served ... by a liberal
                    Republican [senator] than by a Free trade anti improvement Democrat."<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
                    After repeated and unsuccessful attempts to distract President <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> from the spell of the tariff reformers, he seems to have reached similar conclusions
                    regarding the presidency.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> At no time did Davis openly oppose candidates of his
                    own party; rather his strategy was the covert withdrawal of funds and
                    followers—"passiveness in certain quarters" as Elkins later <list type="footnotes">

                    thanks to impressive Republican gains in the 1884 and 1886 elections, Davis’ potential
                    influence was not inconsiderable.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> A long standing personal friendship with
                    Harrison made him all the more eager to cooperate with Elkins’ design if
                    indeed—as Elkins later hinted<hi rend="sup">11</hi>—he did not instigate it.
                    Harrison and his family were frequent visitors at Deer Park, the Davis summer home atop the Maryland
                        Alleghenies.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> The Hoosier's 1887 sojourn at Deer Park was
                    different, however. In addition to the usual rich mixture of political gossip and mountain air,
                    Harrison's hosts offered the prospect of the presidency. Blaine, Elkins told him, might not
                    stand for renomination and if he did, might not get it. In that case Elkins could think of no one
                    more likely to win support of the "Blaine Legion" than Harrison. Davis advised his
                    guest to encourage any presidential boom that might develop and hinted at his own willingness to
                    support him.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> Harrison replied to these overtures with the modesty appropriate
                    to this stage of the campaign; but the idea had been broached, and none of the principals forgot the
                    conversations during the months that followed. By December, when <placeName>

            <p>On March 1, 1888, Blaine lent his approval to Elkins’ presidential strategy although he
                    said nothing and probably knew nothing about the West Virginia angle in the affair. In his
                    "Florence Letter" of January 25, the Plumed Knight had publicly renounced designs
                    on the presidential nomination, and subsequent private elaborations to Elkins discounted the
                    possibility of a draft.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Blaine also cast a <list type="footnotes">

                    a clutch of favorite son candidates were "unavailable at critical points"; they
                    were hostile to Blaine and Elkins (Sherman), unattractive to business interests (Walter Q. Gresham
                    and William B. Allison), or could not be elected ("Evarts, Hawley, Phelps, Alger, Cullom,
                    Rush, et id omne genus"). The "one man remaining" was Harrison.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Elkins passed on these assurances to Harrison as they arrived from Europe. He
                    did not write off the possibility of a draft nomination for Blaine and discussed it frankly with
                    Harrison. "I know he wants to escape the turmoil and excitement of another campaign, but it
                    is possible yet that the Convention may if it finds a sharp division between the other candidates
                    without result, go to Blaine by acclamation." Elkins thought that the best strategy was to
                    promote Harrison as a second choice candidate among the Plumed Knight's followers, thereby
                    reducing the chances of a stalemate.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> He had already passed the word around in <placeName>

                    </placeName> and would, he said, make the Indianian the heritor of Blaine's strength,
                    "At the proper time &amp; when I think it will best serve your interest."<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Elkins’ approach to Harrison was quite explicitly that of a Warwick. The "Blaine
                    element," he wrote, "will largely determine the result at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and probably go where Blaine friends decide it is best to go."<hi rend="sup">20</hi> This was a clear invitation to bargain: what would Harrison do for Elkins in return for
                    his support in the nominating convention? Harrison's answers were disappointing.
                    His replies to Elkins’ advances were an adroit mixture of diffidence and encouragement.
                    He was profuse with reciprocal declarations of friendship and promptly responded to
                    Elkins’ inquiries as to his record and the political situation in Indiana. Beyond that
                    there were "some things I would say &amp; some things I would ask you to say if we were
                    together, but about which I do not care to write."<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Elkins too had
                    confidences too deep to entrust to a letter but repeated attempts to draw Harrison east for a
                    conference proved futile. Harrison never really declined to come, but the obligations of his law
                    practice always managed to interfere with his coming, even when Davis offered suitable
                    "cover" for a secret meeting at Deer Park.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> Thus from the
                    beginning Elkins got a taste of that disdain for the byways of "practical

                    the moment, however, Harrison's behavior could be passed off as the coquetry expected of
                    any potential nominee. While avoiding commitments, he was careful to respond encouragingly to
                    Elkins’ advances. Following Elkins’ advice, he spoke admiringly of Blaine in
                    public and did not oppose the selection of Blaine men as delegates to the convention.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> He detailed Louis T. Michener, attorney general of Indiana and the manager of his home
                    state "boom," to act as liaison with Elkins and other Blaine leaders.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Eventually Michener went to <placeName>

                    instructed not to make commitments, his earlier hints of the benefits to be won by the engineers of
                    a Blaine-Harrison fusion left little to imagination. "General Harrison will be nominated
                    and elected," he assured Elkins; in which case "no good friend of Mr.
                    Blaine's will have any occasion to regret it, and I do not use this language lightly, for I
                    understand its full import, and mean it to be understood in that light."<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether Elkins himself placed all his cards on the table at this point is open to interpretation. His
                    strategy required dangling the possibility of a draft before Blaine loyalists, and this necessitated
                    some deception of his Indiana friends. For example, around the end of April James S. Clarkson of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>, Richard C. Kerens of <placeName>

                    </placeName> for a series of conferences with Elkins. Kerens subsequently sent word to Harrison that
                    he and Elkins had used the opportunity to press the Hoosier's candidacy and that
                    Blaine's prospects had hardly been mentioned. This last reference was patently untrue if
                    Clarkson's version of the talks is accurate.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> At the same time Elkins
                    told Harrison that he had laid the basis for cooperation between the latter's forces and

                    the same time Elkins kept tabs on Blaine's old followers as they sought election as
                    delegates. "In general," Clarkson reported to Elkins after a leisurely tour on his

            <p>The "word" Elkins gave Clarkson may not have been the same one he gave Harrison.

                    was concerned, and he was convinced of Elkins’ loyalty. "With your

                    moment of the final ballot, by the eve of the convention he appears to have been working mainly for
                    Harrison. Besides marshalling the Blaine forces and holding them in readiness for a switch, he
                    persuaded several influential eastern conservatives to regard Havrison as Blaine's legatee.

                    arrange a conference with Harrison. But again the latter declined to come to Deer Park or to take

                    precautions for secrecy and went to the Hoosier capital to visit Harrison on June 15.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> Again he was unable to secure an explicit commitment, either on his own account or on
                    Platt's. But what he got was enough. As he later reminded Harrison, "I made use of
                    your expressed determination to stand by your friends and my knowledge from our acquaintance that
                    you would surely do so," to convert the doubtful.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> Vague assurances

            <p>The important thing about the convention was the difference between appearance and reality. From all
                    appearances it was an open convention, deliberating eight days and choosing the nominee from among
                    no fewer than nineteen candidates. In reality the result was dictated by a handful of men who
                    nominated Harrison, not because there was a widespread demand for his nomination but because they
                    wanted victory in the fall and the rewards that went with it; that required an uncontroversial
                    candidate in a campaign in which the tariff issue was expected to predominate over personal
                        appeals.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> Elkins played a critical role in producing the result; he
                    hastened to congratulate the nominee and left to Davis a direct statement of his claim on
                    Harrison's gratitude. "Perhaps it ought to come from some one else,"
                    Davis wrote Harrison on June 25, "but I know you will agree with me—that Elkins

                    general no little grief during the next four years.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although preoccupied during the preconvention period with his courtship of Harrison, Elkins had not
                    neglected the West Virginia side of his double campaign. With Davis’ help he arranged a
                    bipartisan protectionist rally at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Wheeling</settlement>
                    </placeName> on February 29. At this rally, which was thinly disguised as a promotion of industrial
                    development, Elkins made his maiden political speech in the Mountain State. He also bought into the
                    leading Republican newspaper, arranged for the construction of a summer residence near the mountain
                    village of Leadville (shortly rechristened "Elkins"), and made a nonpartisan
                    address at the state university.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> After Harrison's nomination Elkins
                    concentrated on the West Virginia campaign. Aside from Davis’
                    "passiveness," for which Elkins claimed credit and which contributed to a
                    Republican gain of some one thousand votes in the upper Potomac mining region,<hi rend="sup">50</hi>
                    Elkins’ most important achievement was the nomination of Representative Nathan Goff as
                    the Republican gubernatorial candidate. Brought about by a mixture of cajolery and pressure
                    organized by Elkins’ newfound newspaper allies, Goff's reluctant acceptance of
                    the honor promised to remove the foremost local claimant to the senatorship to which Elkins
                        aspired.<hi rend="sup">51</hi> In these circumstances the first results of the fall election
                    occasioned much joy among the members of the Deer Park circle. The unofficial vote showed Republican
                    victories in state and nation. "Your election is a source of great personal gratification
                    to the Davis family including myself," Davis wrote Harrison on November 8. To a West

            <p>The next few days brought second thoughts, however. Harrison had indeed won the national electoral

                    </placeName> carried the state by a margin of 500 votes out of 159,000. And there were further
                    complications, this time concerning Elkins’ own career. Contrary to Elkins’
                    hopes the election failed to take Goff out of the way. He continued to lead in the gubernatorial
                    count by 110 votes, but the narrow result invited a Democratic contest which was soon forthcoming.
                    The incumbent governor, a Democrat, refused to certify a winner, throwing the count into the
                    legislature. The composition of the legislature itself remained in doubt, but it eventually showed a
                    stalemate, with the balance of power belonging to three Union Labor delegates.<hi rend="sup">53</hi>
                    Thus no one could be certain how the gubernatorial matter would be settled, to say nothing of the
                    impending senatorial contest. In these unpropitious circumstances Davis and Elkins met in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, probably on the week end of November 16.<hi rend="sup">54</hi> They decided to rely on
                    their friendship with Harrison to carry Elkins over the shoals. Davis wrote the President-elect
                    recommending himself as "a discreet friend in whom you have confidence" and
                    requesting an interview that would be "of value to you &amp; the country."<hi rend="sup">55</hi> Partly because protocol demanded that the vice president-elect pay the first
                    call, partly to give the visit more "social" surroundings, Davis delayed his
                    journey to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

            </p>
            <p>Some confusion developed as to just what Elkins wanted Harrison to do. With his gubernatorial status
                    in doubt Goff remained very much a live senatorial candidate. Did Elkins want Goff taken into the
                    Cabinet, thus clearing his senatorial path; or did he want a Cabinet post himself, abandoning to
                    Goff the unpromising situation at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charleston</settlement>

                    correct; Hart and his friends appear to have double crossed Elkins, challenging his claim to
                    represent West Virginia and supporting Goff.<hi rend="sup">60</hi> Early in January Goff scotched
                        <hi rend="i">his</hi> Cabinet movement by informing Harrison that he was not interested in a
                    portfolio. By this time, however, the impression had been created in West <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>—and apparently too with Harrison—that Goff sought to block all
                    paths to preferments, an impression that naturally redounded to Elkins’ favor.<hi rend="sup">61</hi> "We all love [Goff]," John M. Hagans of Morgantown told
                    Elkins, "but it is asking too much, is it not, to expect a total surrender in all
                    directions?" With other influential leaders in the party's traditional
                    northern West Virginia strongholds Hagans began organizing a local movement in support of Elkins for
                    the Cabinet.<hi rend="sup">62</hi> But so long as the Goff faction continued to dispute his claim to

            <p>Consequently Elkins had to use an alternative basis for appealing to Harrison. His earlier career as

                    friends ever discussed whatever qualifications for executive office he may have had. His appointment
                    would have to discharge political obligations, and, aside from geography, these could be of two
                    sorts: personal or factional. Elkins could be credited to Harrison himself if the President-elect
                    sought—as Blaine had described Elkins to Garfield in 1881—"a strong
                    and valuable friend ... useful at odd times."<hi rend="sup">64</hi> In this respect Elkins
                    was hampered by the hostility of some of Harrison's Indiana advisers, especially William H.
                    H. Miller, Harrison's former law partner and future attorney general.<hi rend="sup">65</hi>
                    Elkins’ foremost qualification was thus as a factional leader. In the Cabinet he would
                    represent the Blaine wing of the party; his appointment would also recognize his role at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

                    chips Elkins had so carefully accumulated.</p>
            <p>Earlier Blaine had led Elkins and many others to believe that he did not wish to return to office
                    except perhaps as a senator from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                    </placeName>. On November 8, however, Blaine wrote Elkins that he had changed his mind. He wanted to
                    be secretary of state and expected Elkins to undertake a campaign of pressure to secure his
                    appointment. Above all he wanted him to clear up any impression Harrison may have gained that he was
                    not "available." Elkins waited until after his conference with Davis before
                    complying with this request and then agreed to do as Blaine desired.<hi rend="sup">66</hi> Blaine,
                    however, declined to reciprocate when informed that Elkins, too, was interested in the Cabinet. If
                    he were to place himself behind Elkins’ candidacy, he argued, it might be
                    "prejudicial to both of us. ... at present silence is my imperative duty on all personal
                    politics." Blaine nevertheless insisted that there was no conflict between them if Elkins
                    presented himself to Harrison on a geographic and personal, rather than factional, basis. According
                    to the Plumed Knight, West Virginia was Elkins’ "great, fruitful, decisive
                    field," while the Davis family's "years of intimacy" with the

                    such "distant recommendations" as he or others might make. In short, Blaine was
                    accepting no riders in his own drive for preferment and was leaving Elkins to make it on his own as
                    best he could.<hi rend="sup">67</hi>

                    </placeName>, Elkins elected to present his candidacy to Harrison on the basis of his personal
                    devotion and his political indispensibility to the new administration. Davis’ role was to
                    convert their long standing social relations with the President-elect into a political asset. In
                    this respect Davis’ December trip to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was moderately encouraging. The visit was a social success. Politically, he wrote,
                    Blaine's chances were good. "As to Elkins he stands well with the Gen[eral]
                    &amp; family they talk nicely about him but Gen did not commit himself." On his return
                    to the east Davis imparted three important pieces of news: Harrison would make no decision for
                    several weeks and no announcement until the eve of the inauguration; he anticipated trouble in
                    meeting the claims of <placeName>

                    </placeName> Republicans; "Mrs H" and the family generally were favorable to
                    Elkins and Blaine. On his part, Davis had informed the President-elect that "No man

            </p>
            <p>The friendliness of the family was a useful counterweight to the hostility of Harrison's
                    political advisers. Elkins’ "services at <placeName>

                    Harrison's son-in-law, in the West Virginia Central Railroad hierarchy, offering him
                    $2,500 a year and stock in one of the Davis-Elkins coal companies. Davis even offered
                    money to Harrison himself—a "draft for a few thousand to be return [sic] when it
                    suits you"—to tide him over preinaugural expenses. Probably this was going too
                    far. It appears that nothing more was said of the money, and McKee shortly thereafter turned down

                    was the appointment of Blaine as secretary of state, which position Harrison quietly tendered on

            </p>
            <p>Despite these signs of his growing influence, Elkins grew alarmed as the inauguration neared and the
                    pattern of Harrison's appointments began to emerge. With the exception of Blaine none of
                    the secretaries thus far designated were men of national experience, and none had taken a very large
                    role in the politics of 1888. It became apparent that Harrison was paying close attention to
                    geographic distribution and was seeking out men whose uncontroversial records and characters were
                    conducive, so he believed, to party harmony—men very much like himself, in other words,
                    which Elkins was not.<hi rend="sup">80</hi> He was ignoring those considerations which made
                    Elkins’ success most likely. Thus in the second week of February the latter determined to
                    buck the trend and to press his own candidacy more forcefully. Davis again appealed to Harrison, and
                    Blaine again declined to stick his neck out. The Plumed Knight did agree to ask Harrison to come to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> with his Cabinet slate unfilled, which Harrison agreed to do.<hi rend="sup">81</hi>
                    Elkins arranged for a conference with the President-elect on Feburary 27.<hi rend="sup">82</hi> On
                    February 18, however, he learned that Harrison planned to award the Interior portfolio to an unknown
                    Missourian, and this information spurred him to make a bold representation in his own behalf. By
                    letter he lectured Harrison on the danger of overlooking "the claims of friends who have
                    felt that the proprieties would not be served by forcing themselves to your attention. ... To
                    abandon them in the formation of your Cabinet would, to my mind, reach the verge of
                    injustice." Blaine's silence notwithstanding, Elkins now brought forth his
                    qualifications as a factional leader. "The appointment of Mr. Blaine was wise," he
                    stated. "But it should not follow that Mr. Blaine, standing as an individual in the
                    Cabinet, should be held to satisfy the claims upon you of all of those who have heretofore been his
                    friend, and who were loyal to you long before and during the Convention, and who were strong and
                    brave enough to say to Mr. Blaine, in case he would not consent to be a candidate, you should be
                    nominated. ..." Furthermore, he argued, the appointees thus designated, though good men
                    all, had done little or nothing for Harrison when the chips were down. "[Blaine] was <list type="footnotes">

                    spring of 1888. Finally he urged Harrison to discount the advice of his Indiana friends. "I
                    am satisfied now that many things that should have reached you, and were written to Michener and
                    others for your ear, and spoken to your friends at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, never reached you, and to some extent you do not understand what has been
                    done." Lest Harrison miss the point of this outcry, Elkins advised that of the remaining
                    Cabinet places "two or three be taken from that number who stood by you in the East and
                    elsewhere when you needed friends ... who resisted all promises from other candidates, who answered
                    all arguments made against your claims, and who in the end made enemies for a life to serve
                    you." "All this happened," he concluded passionately,
                    "—you may not know it, but it did." As proof thereof he enclosed
                    extracts from letters of March, 1888, showing how Senator John Sherman had bid highly but
                    unsuccessfully for his services.<hi rend="sup">83</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Asked to review a draft of this message, Davis advised against sending it,<hi rend="sup">84</hi> but
                    Elkins went ahead and was shortly in receipt of a reply. Harrison was equally frank. "I
                    have not set anyone aside because he was anyone else's friend," he stated; nor had
                    he "failed to think of my friends." He regarded Elkins’ loyalty as
                    proven and had paid no heed to hostile gossip. Rather it was "geographical and other
                    considerations not involving any lack of fondness or gratitude" that governed his decision.
                    Thus Harrison made it clear that Elkins’ push for the Cabinet had momentarily failed, not
                    because of factional complications or because he had failed to win Harrison's confidence
                    but because his West Virginia credentials were still too weak. Elkins would not go away empty
                    handed, however. "It is my hope," Harrison concluded, "that some of these
                    things may be accomodated [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] in other ways. ..."<hi rend="sup">85</hi>
                    On this ambiguous but encouraging note Elkins’ drive for office came to a temporary halt.</p>
            <p>As of inauguration day, 1889, the Davis-Elkins political combination had produced mixed results. The
                    tariff on coal was secure in the hands of Representative William McKinley and the Fifty-first
                    Congress. Harrison was in the White House. Davis was content to bask in reflected presidential glory
                    and to oversee Deer Park's blossoming as a summer capital. Elkins was still out in the
                    cold, however, and West Virginia still had two Democratic senators and no legally elected governor.

                    their unstable majority on a solution to the gubernatorial quarrel. They appointed a legislative
                    committee to examine the returns; meanwhile the incumbent clung to his chair.<hi rend="sup">86</hi>
                    With Democratic control of the state courts and militia there was little Goff's supporters
                    could do short of violence except wait out the Democratic maneuvers in the almost certain knowledge
                    that he would eventually be counted out. In these circumstances Goff became something of a national
                    partisan hero. When the Democrats, by further discreditable proceedings, managed to seat their
                    candidate in February, 1890, Goff became a popular feature on the Republican banquet circuit.<hi rend="sup">87</hi> With Republicans across the state and nation calling for his vindication it
                    became all but impossible to dislodge him in West Virginia until some appropriate means of
                    compensation became available. Harrison therefore found it advisable to delay the ultimate
                    recognition of Elkins’ demands indefinitely.</p>
            <p>However the President did not hesitate to make good on his promise to take care of Elkins
                    "in other ways." In supporting the latter's struggle for the West
                    Virginia leadership he stopped short only of moves that could be publicly interpreted as an affront
                    to Goff. During the first weeks of the administration Attorney General Miller promised Goff the
                    final say in West Virginia patronage,<hi rend="sup">88</hi> but Harrison promptly overrode him. The
                    first important local appointment made, that of district attorney, went to Elkins’
                    nominee. Goff and his friends presented another man, Harrison confided to Elkins, "but I
                    told them they were too late."<hi rend="sup">89</hi> Other West Virginia appointments
                    reflected Elkins’ influence, and even Davis took precedence over Goff when he extended
                    his protection over a Democratic officeholder whose place Goff wanted for one of his own followers.
                    Recognizing "the ex-Senator's kindly feeling toward our party in West <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>," Secretary Windom informed Goff that it would not be "good
                    politics" to contravene his wishes.<hi rend="sup">90</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had Elkins been in a less desperate mood he might have been grateful for these omens of eventual
                    success. But his career had been stalled too long and his expectations aroused too sharply for
                    patience to prevail. He endured Harrison's first year in office with a <list type="footnotes">

                    informed the President that the nature of his Cabinet appointments "has produced a chill
                    that is already felt, and it is feared will be followed with the same results that Hayes’
                    course brought about."<hi rend="sup">91</hi> When the administration encountered difficulty
                    securing the confirmation of Whitelaw Reid and Murat Halstead as ambassadors, Elkins traced the
                    problem to "several members of the Cabinet ... who are without experience in public
                    affairs. ..."<hi rend="sup">92</hi> "Many people think Harrison will have to look
                    out for Blaine in 1892," he remarked to Davis in August. "Had he stood by his
                    friends he would not have this to bother him." While Davis hosted the presidential
                    entourage during a two month visit to Deer Park in September, Elkins sulked in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>. He feared the President was tiring of him, he said. In October he vented his injured
                    feelings to Davis in a discussion of whether there was any point in further representations to
                    Harrison. "Not a day passes that some leading Republican does not speak of his injustice to
                    me," he stated; Elkins thought that Davis himself should feel aggrieved. "Suppose
                    the case were reversed and as your good friend I had urged you to support a warm democratic personal
                    friend—&amp; you did it in a way that could not be denied &amp; all with his
                    knowledge &amp; consent—then suppose after success, he refused to make proper
                    recognition. It seems to me I would resent such conduct &amp; treatment, &amp; signify my
                        displeasure."<hi rend="sup">93</hi> Davis’ reply to this outburst has not
                    been found, but apparently he was willing to be more patient.</p>
            <p>Another who counseled patience was Blaine. He warned Elkins that Harrison was "a man with
                    whom nothing is gained by argument or urgency at the wrong time." Blaine had sufficiently
                    roused himself to express regret to the President over Elkins’ absence from the Cabinet.
                    "His single reply was that residence alone stood in the way—<hi rend="i">alone</hi> was quite distinctly expressed."<hi rend="sup">94</hi> It is doubtful that
                    Elkins was entirely reassured by this information; he could do nothing to strenghten his geographic
                    position until Harrison found something to do with Goff. Blaine was convinced, however, that
                    Harrison would act when the time was ripe. Meanwhile he urged Elkins to do nothing that would lead
                    to an open breach with Goff in West <placeName>

            <p>Either the counsel of patience had its effect on Elkins’ relations with the
                    administration, or Secretary Windom, thinking to oblige Elkins, got his wires crossed, for the
                    spring of 1890 saw a conciliatory gesture toward Goff—the appointment of his brother,
                    Charles J. Goff, as treasury agent in the Pribilof (Seal) Islands of <placeName>
                        <country reg="aku">Alaska</country>
                    </placeName>. This was a post of dubious appeal, it would seem, but one of Elkins’ many
                    speculative ventures, the North American Commercial Company, had extremely delicate business
                    arrangements pending in the islands. With Elkins’ help the firm had recently secured a
                    twenty year license on the Pribilof fur seal fishery. Elkins thus took a lively interest in Alaskan
                    matters, but whether he gave advance approval for young Goff's appointment cannot be
                        determined.<hi rend="sup">96</hi> His subsequent disapproval would figure prominently in the
                    denouement of his West Virginia campaign.</p>
            <p>In any event Elkins did not allow the opportunity to turn a profit on furs to distract him from his
                    quest for a Cabinet post. When a vacancy occurred on the Supreme Court in December, 1890, he urged
                    Harrison to elevate Attorney General Miller, then to reshuffle his Cabinet to afford recognition to
                    those "known as Blaine men, but who became Harrison men and brought about your
                        nomination."<hi rend="sup">97</hi> The President ignored this advice, but Elkins
                    offered it again when Windom's death in January, 1891, created another vacancy. Elkins was
                    put forward by <placeName>

                    in the time consuming Treasury post. Instead he wanted Harrison to transfer Secretary of War
                    Redfield Proctor and so create the vacancy he really desired.<hi rend="sup">98</hi> The least he
                    could do, Elkins informed the President, was to give the Treasury portfolio to Whitelaw Reid or
                    someone else among those "early friends who joined the cause when doubtful and helped to
                    make success certain."<hi rend="sup">99</hi> Harrison took this much of his advice when he

                    said over their cigars was apparently not recorded, but on the President's desk were two
                    items that must have greatly interested his guest. One was Secretary of the Interior John W.
                    Noble's resignation, which Harrison apparently declined to accept.<hi rend="sup">102</hi>
                    The other was an act recently passed by Congress establishing the new circuit courts of appeal, with
                    one new judgeship in each of the nine federal circuits.<hi rend="sup">103</hi> At this point West <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s interest in the new judge-ships centered on William P. Hubbard, the

                    himself was uninterested in the post, and in any case Virginia Republicans were said to have the
                    inside track on the fourth circuit appointment.<hi rend="sup">104</hi> Elkins, however, had seized
                    on the judgeship as the means of disposing of Goff. He discussed the matter with Davis before seeing
                    Harrison and possibly also talked with C. B. Hart, who sent up a trial balloon bearing
                    Goff's name in the <placeName>

                    said to be quite willing to let some one else bear the brunt of future battles."<hi rend="sup">106</hi> There was no mistaking who that someone else might be, particularly after a
                    series of developments in April pointed toward the eventual fulfillment of Elkins’
                    ambition. On April 8 Senator George F. Edmunds of Vermont announced his resignation from the Senate,
                    to take effect on November 1. Within a few days speculation had it that Secretary Proctor would
                    resign from the Cabinet to succeed Edmunds and that Elkins would take Proctor's place as
                    secretary of war.<hi rend="sup">107</hi> This is indeed what happened, although Edmunds’
                    timetable postponed the conclusion for several months. On April 30, however, with the dismissal of
                    Charles Goff from his post in <placeName>

                    blaming the hubbub on the Democrats and disclaiming to Goff responsibility for his

            <p>The outcome of the Goff-Elkins rivalry was foreseen as early as April, but in drawing events to a
                    conclusion Harrison exploited all his talent for irritating delays—"conscious
                    non-action" as one irate Republican senator described it.<hi rend="sup">116</hi> The
                    President dawdled nine months and then nominated only six of the nine judges Congress had expected
                    to take office on January I.<hi rend="sup">117</hi> Eventually Harrison sent Goff's name to
                    the Senate along with the others on December 16.<hi rend="sup">118</hi> As for the War Department,
                    Proctor's resignation was announced in August. Elkins shortly afterwards visited the
                    President at Cape May, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName>, a move that most interpreted as clinching the matter.<hi rend="sup">119</hi> Still the
                    weeks rolled by and Harrison failed to act. Something of Elkins’ former anxiety returned
                    in November when Proctor's resignation took effect. At Elkins’ request, Russell
                    Harrison, Secretary Foster, and other insiders renewed the campaign of pressure on the President.<hi rend="sup">120</hi> Another month went by, however, before Harrison revealed his decision. He
                    sent Elkins’ name to the Senate on December 17, the day after Goff's nomination.
                    The new secretary was confirmed on December 22.<hi rend="sup">121</hi> It was three years to the day
                    since Davis had set out for <placeName>

            <p>While the significance of Elkins’ appointment for West Virginia was well understood,
                    observers at the time were more interested in its implications for the coming presidential campaign.
                    By 1891 dissatisfaction with Harrison among party wheelhorses and workers across the country had
                    produced a much talked about movement to place Blaine at the head of the ticket in 1892. The
                    favorite interpretation of Elkins’ promotion saw it as part of a deal between Blaine and

                    support the President's re-nomination. The story was attributed to Russell Harrison and had
                    it further that Elkins had resisted the President's call to the Cabinet until his

                    his energies to the renomination of Harrison. ... I mean the renomination of Harrison against

                    <hi rend="i">Herald</hi> correspondent was correct, as the events of 1892 showed. Evidence abounds
                    of Blaine's and Elkins’ continued friendship, but its earlier warmth had
                    inevitably cooled under the disappointment and frustration of each man.<hi rend="sup">124</hi>
                    Blaine had contributed nothing but advice to Elkins’ drive for the Cabinet; as late as
                    August, 1891, he was still unwilling to intervene actively in Elkins’ behalf.<hi rend="sup">125</hi> Thus Elkins attained his goal less because of Blaine than despite him and
                    had every reason to cast his lot with the President without reference to Blaine's future
                    plans. That is precisely what he did. When Blaine formally disavowed his candidacy in February,
                    1892, most of his supporters continued as they had done in 1888 to work for his nomination.<hi rend="sup">126</hi> But Elkins took him at his word and threw himself into Harrison's
                    campaign for renomination. Indeed it was said to be Elkins who carried an ultimatum from Harrison to
                    Blaine in June, 1892, instructing him either to repudiate his supporters or to get out of the
                    Cabinet. Whether or not this was true, Blaine's resignation three days before the national
                    convention and the pathetic attempt of his supporters to carry the convention by storm found Elkins
                    "sorry for his [Blaine's] sake," but his loyalty to the President was
                        unshaken.<hi rend="sup">127</hi> The price of his loyalty had less to do with the presidency

                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. Elkins assumed unchallenged control of the state Republican party during the losing
                    campaign of 1892, and when the GOP finally turned the corner to victory two years later, he went on
                    to become the first Republican senator from West Virginia since Reconstruction.<hi rend="sup">128</hi> By building the most powerful political organization in the Mountain State's
                    brief history, he retained the seat until his death in 1911, becoming a charter member of the
                    Senate's Republican "Old Guard." Harrison had won a "strong and
                    valuable friend" in exchange for the mastery of a single state.</p>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, contained the usual questions concerning political affairs at home, comments
                    about the fun he was missing in the Hoosier capital, and requests for photographs, much needed
                    clothing, and more frequent letters; it did not reflect the gloom and discomfort of the Civil War
                    camp of the Seventieth Indiana Volunteer Infantry to which Cox belonged. In fact it is in part
                    Cox’ exuberance which makes his letters somewhat unique amid the plethora of Civil War
                    manuscripts which have been published. The Hoosier soldier thoroughly enjoyed his wartime
                    experiences, whether he was guarding railroads, squiring pretty southern girls to parties, fighting
                    under Major General Joseph Hooker at Resaca, <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>

                    </placeName> to the sea.</p>
            <p>Cox’ letters to his family are typical of much Civil War correspondence: they refer to
                    such aspects of army life as infrequency of pay, mail delivery, inactivity, foraging, disease, lady
                    visitors from home, fraternization with residents of the southern states, and dissatisfaction with
                    drill, reviews, and inspections. Yet they are not routine recountings of battles and camp
                    activities. Perhaps because of his youth Cox retained throughout the war the initial enthusiasm
                    which most Hoosiers had for the conflict. The underlying excitement with which he approached all
                    experiences permeates his letters home and makes them a delightful and different commentary on a
                    soldier's life during the Civil War.</p>
            <p>Cox is typically Hoosier in many ways. His letters reveal an unshakeable faith in and loyalty to the
                    Union and a determination to restore that Union regardless of personal sacrifice. He does not like
                    Negroes. He frequently mentions his disgust for the blacks, and his comments leave no doubt that he
                    considered them inferior. Like most Indiana soldiers he was not fighting the war because of a moral
                    aversion <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName>. Patriotism does not obscure Cox’ interest in Hoosier politics. His comments
                    about partisan political battles at home denote his preference for the Republican party and a
                    belligerency toward the Democracy. And in few places are the political machinations involved in
                    military promotions more clearly revealed than in his letters to his brother-in-law, Frank B. Lord.</p>
            <p>Cox "grew up" during his three years of military service. His final letter on June
                    1, 1865, is far more mature and perspicuous than his first boyish announcement that he has
                    "gone for a soldier." Cox fell in love with the South while serving there. He
                    describes the Seventieth Indiana's camp near <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
               </placeName>, as
                    surrounded "on all sides by the finest country &amp; scenery in the world."
                    Later he writes his sister during his stay in Gallatin, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>: "The weather is fine, and the climate and scenery around here is the most
                    pleasant &amp; beautiful I ever saw ... and I ... have placed my land mark, upon which if luck
                    permits I am in hopes of some day ‘squatting.’ " Although Cox
                    sometimes complains that he has not received a letter from the "girl he left
                    behind," he also asserts: "If I ever intend to marry I shall most assuredly come
                    down to Tennessee for my Bride as there ... [are] more handsome looking young ladies ... than I ever
                    met before." In the years following the Civil War Cox realized both his wish for a southern
                    bride and his ambition for a home in the South.</p>
            <p>Cox joined the Seventieth Indiana Volunteer Infantry regiment in August, 1862, shortly before his
                    eighteenth birthday. The regiment, commanded by Colonel Benjamin Harrison—who later was
                    to become President of the <placeName>

                    of tin and sheet iron ware and also dealt in stoves. Jacob Cox later gained prominence as an artist
                    and withdrew from the firm around 1863. Charles Cox continued to do business at the shop located on

                                            Harding Cox letters have been followed faithfully in this transcription.
                                            Spacing of headings, salutations, and closings has been standardized, but
                                            the punctuation originally used in these portions of the letters has been
                                            retained. Sentences added in the margins or crosshatched across the letters
                                            have been included after the closing. Cox seemingly used commas, periods,
                                            dashes, and equal signs interchangeably, whether at the end of or within
                                            sentences. Although an effort was made to determine Cox’ intent,
                                            complete consistency was impossible, and the editor has been somewhat
                                            arbitrary in transcribing commas and periods in an attempt to make the
                                            letters easier to read. Equal signs at the end of sentences and paragraphs
                                            have been changed to dashes. It was frequently impossible to ascertain
                                            whether Cox meant to use capitals or lower case letters, to begin new
                                            paragraphs, or to write certain words as two words or one, i.e., today or to
                                            day. In such instances the editor has attempted to conform to
                                            Cox’ intent or, when a decision could not be reached, has
                                            followed modern practice. Superior letters have been brought down to the
                                            line; flourishes and obviously unintentional repetitions have been omitted;
                                            incorrect spellings have been retained and have not been indicated by a
                                            [sic] or a correction, except for a few proper names and for words which
                                            might be misunderstood.</item>

                        <salute>My dear Sister!</salute>
                        <p>Your kind letter came enclosed in one from home, on last Saturday, which were the
                                    first I have received since I have left for the wars. Our regiment is very nicely
                                    situated here at present, we have a pretty camp, and a fine set of men. it is
                                    pronounced by all the finest looking regt that has ever left Indiana, the 11th is
                                    nowhere. The streets thro camp on both sides, have been planted [with] fine large
                                    cedar trees, taken from the top of a hill on which we are encamped, and makes the
                                    camp look beautiful.</p>
                        <p>What I have seen so far of soldiers life, suits me very well, of course there are
                                    some privations and hardships, but when you get used to it, you are as much at home
                                    in camp as any where else.</p>
                        <p>I should have been very happy to have seen you before I left, but we were called away
                                    so suddenly that it would have been impossible. There are a good many folks from
                                    Ind'polis here visiting which helps make our camp in livelieness. I suppose
                                    you are aware before this that I have been appointed "Sergeant
                                    Major," of this regiment, one of the nicest positions in the reg. I would
                                    rather have it than 2nd Lieut although the pay does not amount to so much. All I
                                    have to do is to <hi rend="i">detail</hi> Pickets and Guards and keep the regimental

                                    infantry to capture. Our Regt has been up to Mumfordsville for a couple of days, as
                                    they were expecting an attack there, but yesterday noon hearing Morgan had burned a

                                    returned to Mumfordsville last evening, and as the rebels had burned the bridge over
                                    Green River several weeks ago, we unloaded the men, forded the river and returned to <placeName>

                                    one. Our regiment has been kept on the move ever since we have been here, running
                                    around the country after guerrillas &amp;c, and there is very very few spots in
                                    this part of Kentucky that we have not scoured. Col Bruce has commanded the forces
                                    stationed here, but he does not amount to much, and he is not at all in favor with
                                    the men of the 70th Gen Rosecrans army is here now, reorganizing and preparing for
                                    the move south. Our regiment intends joining in with them, and going along, we are
                                    going into Daumonts Division and will probably leave in a few days.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> The road is expected to be open through to <placeName>

                                    leave at least 150 sick here, and at least 1/3 will get sick along the road. So you
                                    see it is a pretty hard choice, whether stay or go, but the "Field and
                                    Staff" have concluded to go, and we will have to leave all the comforts, we
                                    have collected here, and probably not see a tent again for a month. It is pretty
                                    hard for us to leave this place, as we have been here so long, it seems like home,
                                    besides we have our quarters fixed so comfortable for winter, it seems a shame to
                                    leave them, to tag along with this army.</p>
                        <p>We have not seen a paymaster since we have been here, and are all dead broke. I have

                        <p>Dear Frank!</p>
                        <p>Your welcome letter of Nov 19th was reed just this morning, after a two weeks
                                    journey.</p>
                        <p>We left <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Bowling Green</settlement>
                                    </placeName> for Scottsville on the evening of Nov 10th we footed it through in 2
                                    days, being 25 miles, we remained at S[cottsville] (the most miserable hole in all
                                    Ky) until the morn of the 25 when we again took up the line of march for this place,
                                    (33 miles.) the first day we marched 20 miles, which stiffened the boys legs, so
                                    much, that they were scarcely able to <hi rend="i">swing them</hi> the next morning,
                                    but on we had to go and we arrived here at 3 P.M. on the 26th.</p>
                        <p>The boys are over thier tire [dness] now, and ready to be on the move again,
                                    notwithstanding we are now camped on one of the most bueatiful grounds to be found
                                    anywhere, and is named after my "pard" the Adjt, (Jim) who well
                                    deserves it.</p>
                        <p>We expect to leave here this week. I think for <placeName>

                                    </placeName>. We are not only 3 miles from the <placeName>

                                    </placeName>, the heavy rains we have had for the past few days, has swollen the
                                    river so much, that it is not fordable, which will give our <hi rend="i">Bridge
                                        builders</hi> an opportunity of showing thier skill.</p>
                        <p>The train due here from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> 3 hours ago has not arrived, and it is feared it has been captured by
                                    rebel <hi rend="i">guerrillas</hi>, or that a bridge has been burnt detaining it
                                    about 200 rebel cavalry came within one mile of our pickets last night, as all our
                                    cavalry were absent on a foraging expedition, they were allowed to escape, it is
                                    rumored to day that a large rebel force was advancing on this place, so the forces
                                    here are kept constantly on the alert. Genl Thomas is in command here.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> I suppose there are 20,000 troops here. Our Regt has been assigned to
                                    Wards Brig (40th) Damonts Division (12) Dept of the <placeName>

                                    </placeName>. The 70th is in good health, better than it has been for some time. We
                                    are better clothed, as well <hi rend="i">fed</hi>, and as <hi rend="i">contented</hi>, and in as good <hi rend="i">spirits</hi>, as any Regt we have come
                                    in contact with. Lt Col and Jim are all O.K. and send regards to you. It is probable
                                    that Col Harrison will be put in command of a Brigade before long, as he is the <hi rend="i">ranking</hi> Col in the division, if he <hi rend="i">is, Jim</hi> will
                                    be appointed on his <hi rend="i">Staff</hi>, and I will no doubt, get <hi rend="i">some</hi> position under him. There is some talk of our being paid off before
                                    long, but the rumor is so <hi rend="i">old</hi>, that I do not believe it. Tell

                        <salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
                        <p>Your kind and long looked for letter of Nov 30th arrived only a few minutes ago. I
                                    intended writing you to-day anyhow, enquiring the cause of your delay. I wrote to
                                    Frank several days ago, has he reed it.</p>
                        <p>When we arrived here we expected <hi rend="i">to stay</hi> only a day or so, but here
                                    we are yet, with no knowledge of when, or where we are going, this is one of the
                                    most Secesh places we have been yet, every one is a rebel, and it is a positive fact
                                    not one Union man have I seen or heard of. This is one of the most bueatiful
                                    countries, we have seen, since our departure from the Hoosier State, although <hi rend="i">war</hi> has shown its ravages in many places. Gallatin which at one
                                    time was a bueatiful and prosperous place, is now almost deserted and bussiness
                                    entirely suspended, with the merchants the only bussiness done at all, is by such
                                    men as Jews, Sutlers, Sharks, &amp;c, who sell thier articles at scandalous
                                    prices, to such as have to buy. The Field &amp; Staff had an Oyster supper last
                                    evening The Oysters we had, were of the first lot brought into Tennessee this
                                    season, it was quite a treat to us, and we went into them with a will.</p>
                        <p>There are some very large plantations around here, there is one of 2000 acres about 2
                                    miles from here, which has 250 slaves on it. I never saw so many <hi rend="i">niggers</hi> in a huddle before. Over 75 of them were less than 8 years old. I
                                    could not turn around without tumbling over some <hi rend="i">little nigger</hi>,
                                    who were laying around loose, playing in the dirt.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday we had a nice warm spring day. we could hardly think we were in the midst
                                    of winter, but today we can say winter is upon us, for we have quite a lively snow
                                    storm this morning, and in about 3 hours we had 4 inches of snow, and the boys are
                                    having thier fun, snow balling. I now have a nice warm fire in our tent, the first
                                    one since our arrival here, as it has been so warm. I have not reed a letter from
                                    home since Mr <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>
                                    </placeName> came, although I have written to Ma 5 or 6 times. I suppose that <hi rend="i">long</hi> one she wrote is to do a month or so, but I am looking for
                                    another one in the morning.</p>

                                    time although it is uncertain. Gallatin is on the L &amp; N RR, 159 miles from <placeName>

                                    along the rail road and depot at this place. 8 or 10 freight trains run each way
                                    daily from L[ouisville] to <placeName>

                                    </placeName> also a passenger and express train. We are encamped within 50 yds of
                                    the railroad and the passing trains produce about the only excitement, in camp now
                                    days.</p>
                        <p>Those men who <hi rend="i">deserted</hi> this Regt. have mostly been caught, a number
                                    are here undergoing a court martial, and I think thier sentences will all be, to
                                    work out the balance of thier enlistment in the Government prison, with a ball and
                                    chain to thier leg, and not a cents pay.</p>
                        <p>We are looking for Capt Scott this evening<hi rend="sup">25</hi> he will bring 8 or
                                    10 more deserters back, to be Court Martialed &amp; suffer punishment as thier
                                    crime deserves. My health is first rate, and the health of the regt improving.
                                    Katie! I want you to write to me oftner, I shall excuse your past negligence.</p>
                        <p>Remember me to Frank, and all acquaintances. Direct to me at Gallatin until you <hi rend="i">hear</hi> of our being elsewhere. With much love I remain Your affect

                                    write to me often, at least once a week, it will be very little trouble to you, and
                                    a great source of pleasure to me to hear from <hi rend="i">you</hi> frequently.</p>

                                    and I am afraid if it remains so very long, we will become lazy, we have very little
                                    to read, and amuse ourselves principly with music. I have plenty of time for writing
                                    letters, but as we are away out here in the woods, it is with difficulty we can find
                                    any thing else than the <hi rend="i">stir</hi> of camp life to write about.</p>

                        <p>Charlie Judson has written asking Jim to stand with him at his marriage, on March
                                    11th, but I do not think he can obtain leave.</p>
                        <p>Col Harrison is now at home on bussiness for the Regt. I could have gone home for a

                                    </placeName>, but I did not like the bussiness. Lieut Ohr took the job and is now at

                        <p>We are expecting to be ordered back to Gallatin before long, to be stationed there,
                                    but we much prefer staying where we are, as we have a healthy pleasant camp,
                                    comfortable quarters, plenty to eat &amp; nothing to do, while Gallatin is one
                                    vast Hospital &amp; of course very unhealthy, 2000 sick are at present there.</p>
                        <p>I go in every few days to make my reports, to Brig Hd Qrs.</p>
                        <p>After 2 weeks hard winter, spring has now opened, and the weather is really fine, the
                                    wheat is up and we look for the trees to blossom in a few days. We are encamped in a
                                        <hi rend="i">Sugar Grove</hi>, the boys have tapped all the trees, and we get
                                    all the Sugar Water we want, which conies very handy as the Govt has not furnished
                                    us any sugar for some time.</p>
                        <p>But, Katie it is getting late, I shall close, hoping to hear from you immediately on
                                    the receipt of this and with much love to all.</p>

                        <p>Being at leisure this morning, which is nothing new to me since we have been guarding
                                    this infernal Railroad, I shall write you a short epistle of the doings of the 70th
                                    in this wooden country.</p>

                        <p>We dont know whether to grumble or be thankful at being placed guarding these RR
                                    bridges. We have five bridges under our care between Gallatin and <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. Four companies are stationed here at Hd Qrs four above and two below.
                                    We are having an easier time than ever before, a beautiful camping ground, plenty to
                                    eat, nothing to do and any amount of handsome young ladies in the vicinity, but are
                                    not satisfied altogether, we are anxious to go to the <hi rend="i">front</hi> and
                                    endure the hardships and privations, and share the honor of our brother soldiers who
                                    have been standing the blunt of battles.</p>
                        <p>Not that there is no <hi rend="i">glory</hi> to be had guarding bridges, for we are
                                    continually under greater excitement and more danger and manifest more care
                                    &amp; watchfulness than if we were in a large army. We have no <hi rend="i">block house</hi> at this post, but each of the other posts have one. they are
                                    built of Sweet Gum logs (2 feet in diameter) in this shape [hand drawn figure] the
                                    logs are stood on ends about 12 feet high, the enclosure will accommodate 100 men
                                    and have 20 loop holes on each side.</p>
                        <p>One good company can hold it against any odds, until starved out. We have our camp
                                    surrounded by breast works and are perfectly secure against any charge of the enemy.</p>
                        <p>We have impressed about 25 fine horses which we use for scouting, a squad of us went
                                    out yesterday and captured 1 rebel Lt. Colonel 1 Surgeon 1 Capt and 1 private, they
                                    were an ornery looking set, we "took them in" about 12 miles from
                                    here, and sent them to Gallatin last evening to be turned over to the Provost
                                    Marshall there.</p>
                        <p>Four hundred rebel cavalry were encamped 7 miles up the creek, from here, last week,
                                    we were about to <hi rend="i">go for them</hi> when they <hi rend="i">skedaddled</hi>, they are trying thier best to cut the road again along here, but
                                    they will never do it while the 70th is around.</p>
                        <p>The Indiana Legislature has been playing thunder generally ever since meeting, the
                                    rebels here are highly tickled with thier proceedings, they are a meaner set of
                                    traitors than the rebs themselves, but you take care of such men at home and we will
                                    provide for them here.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

                              <hi rend="sup">29</hi> The Indiana General Assembly which convened on January
                                        8, 1863, was composed of a majority of Democrats in both houses. Bickering
                                        between the Democratic legislators and Republican Governor Oliver P. Morton and
                                        the Republican minority constituted most of the session. Democrats termed their
                                        opponents "tyrants and usurpers"; Republicans responded with
                                        accusations of treason. Democratic attempts to curb the power of Governor Morton
                                        resulted in his assuming financial control of the state government without
                                        legislative sanction. <hi rend="i">Brevier Legislative Reports</hi> (1863), VI,

                        <p>Our Regt is together once more, we marched in yesterday from our country residance to

                                    "grand" wedding and the many parties, and the fine times they all
                                    were having—If I ever intend to marry I shall most assuredly come down to
                                    Tennessee for my Bride as there were more handsome looking young ladies in the

                                    quickly fly away and the experience we shall have gained soldiering will be of great
                                    value to us. I can see no chance of obtaining a furlough and make a short visit
                                    home, but shall en-devour to be at home to spend 4th of July—</p>

                        <p>Jim has been unwell for some time, and is not at present with us. We left him at a
                                    private house in Saundersville, but will join us in a few days. I am now acting
                                    Adjutant and am kept pretty busy since the Regt is together again, having both his
                                    and my own duties to perform.</p>
                        <p>Our career as railroad guards was tended with a great deal more danger than you may
                                    suppose, or <hi rend="i">than being in the front</hi>, as we were scattered in small
                                    squads in a strong secesh country, where guerrilla bands were thick as hail, and the
                                    citizens would aid them against us at any moment, but luckily we escaped any contact
                                    with them, except some small skirmishes which our scouts had—</p>
                        <p>Our Quartermaster is issuing new clothes to the boys to day, which helps the
                                    appearance of the Regt a thousand o/o. Ma sent me a pair of high topped military
                                    boots and a shirt which completes my wardrobe and I shall not want for anything for
                                    some time—</p>
                        <p>Spring has now opened here and things in general are looking
                                    "green", the boys are becoming affected with the
                                    "fever", but are kept on duty and drilling most of the time very
                                    much against thier will.</p>
                        <p>I have very little to write that would interest you so beg be excused for the
                                    shortness of my letters.</p>
                        <p>I have no objections whatever in your sending my Phot[ograph] to the young lady that
                                    asked for it, and wish you would send me the photographs of Frank and your self if
                                    you have any. Ma sent me hers the other day.</p>

                        <p>Col Harrison has been in command of our Brigade for the past two weeks, by reason of

                                    in one of the finest residences in Gallatin, and are living in fine style. But Paine
                                    is almost well and will resume command some time this week, much to our
                                    disappointment as we should like to command a Brigade all the time, but I much
                                    prefer being in camp, as I feel almost lost living in a house again, after 7 months

                        <p>I just received your welcome missive of the 24th inst, and as it is raining very hard
                                    &amp; I nothing to do, and "punctual" my motto, hear goes an
                                    apology for an answer from your "sojer boy" brother. My last two
                                    letters home were short uninteresting affairs, as usual. My abilities as a letter
                                    writer are limited, as you know I was always a miserable hand at telling the news,
                                    but as all my letters are of the same stripe I hope you will not retaliate by
                                    answering in the same style.</p>
                        <p>I have been reading all day a novel "Lady Audley's secret"
                                    and pronounce it fine, if you are at a loss for something to read try "Lady
                                    Audley's Secret" and I am sure you will enjoy it. We have so
                                    little to read here that I have read the Regulations through most a dozen times.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>

                                    but I was so busy at the time drawing up depositions, writing muster-out rolls
                                    &amp;c and my stay home would be so short, I concluded not to go. but I shall

                                    for their respective offices at the recent nomination. I should have been glad for
                                    Geo to [have] been successful, as he always seems to have been an unlucky person.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is as much interest manifested in the regiment by those from
                                    Ind'polis, as to the nominations, elections &amp;c at home, as there is
                                    among those in the city itself.</p>
                        <p>The title of the new firm Cox, Lord and Peck seems very appropriate, and my wishes
                                    for thier success, as I can lend no help to the institution. I should like
                                    exceedingly well, to be home just at this time, not that I am tired soldiering, or
                                    am homesick, but that I express as much interest in bussiness at home, as I do in my
                                    present situation. I am confident this war will not last more than 12 months longer,
                                    the rebs are "playing out" fast in the south. Rosecrans will have

                                    to hear you have associated yourself with the firm of Cox Lord and Peck, and should
                                    like very much to be home myself to have a hand in the muss, but the good time is
                                    coming and I am in hopes a few months may find me lending a helping hand to the

                        <p>Col Burgess arrived at the Regt this afternoon and received the most hearty welcome
                                    that could be given, the boys seeing him coming made a rush for him, and as soon as
                                    he entered the guard lines he was taken from his horse and the boys carried him on
                                    their shoulders to his quarters, they were so glad to see him that they sent up <hi rend="i">cheer</hi> after <hi rend="i">cheer</hi> in <hi rend="i">welcome.</hi>
                                    He is the <hi rend="i">idol</hi> of the Regt. and a kinder hearted man cannot be
                                    found, he is sociable and his rank does not <hi rend="i">stick him up</hi>, and when
                                    off duty is a ringleader for the boys in their sports.</p>
                        <p>He speaks very highly of you and is a gentleman and soldier. Many thanks to you for
                                    those splendid cigars you sent, they are quite a treat, along side the

                                    and I sent home $50. It is pretty <hi rend="i">tough</hi> 21 a month. I
                                    do not aspire to a higher position but hope before the war is over, to obtain
                                    something better if there are to be any promotions in my line, by good behaviour and
                                    meritorious conduct. My present position is one of no little consequence. I fare as
                                    well as any officer in the Regt and have a good time generally, the whole <hi rend="i">bussiness</hi> of the Regt devolves on me, and <hi rend="i">not to brag

                                    than any man in it. Jim is as good a man <pb n="54" id="VAA4025-068-1-064"/> as I
                                    want any thing to do with, and treats me as a brother, but leaves the whole

                                    expecting an order to march to front, to help Rosey [Major General William S.

                                    should have answered sooner. Jim and I return our thanks for the interest you
                                    manifested in, and trying for our <hi rend="i">promotion.</hi> The matter has been

                        <p>The 70th is still in the same camp we were 3 months ago, &amp; such a nice place
                                    it is, we are indifferent as to whether we stay here till the summer is
                                    o'er or not, although it would not surprise us to be ordered to the <hi rend="i">front</hi> at any moment. The boys are <hi rend="i">gay</hi> and <hi rend="i">festive</hi>, happy as larks, but <hi rend="i">think</hi> it is most
                                        <hi rend="i">too warm</hi> in Dixie to agree with them, especially on Brigade or
                                    Bat drill. Just imagine the 8th Brig in the field, the 70th (ranking Regt) on the
                                    right, and the command "on the left by file into line," <hi rend="i">"double quick" march</hi>, the sun coming down like
                                    an oven of one of Cox, Lord &amp; Peck's cooking stoves, the boys <hi rend="i">sweating</hi> and <hi rend="i">cursing</hi>, and you will have a faint
                                    idea of what soldiering is. but I need not complain as I have no drilling to do (or
                                    never do any) and have an easy time in that respect, but I can sympathize with those
                                    who <hi rend="i">are</hi> so afflicted!</p>
                        <p>I suppose you must think the 70th is <hi rend="i">in love with</hi>, or interested in
                                    the welfare of Gallatin, <hi rend="i">judging</hi> from our long continued residence
                                    here. I cant say whether it is the attraction of the place, or the numerous handsome
                                    young ladies to be found here, that makes me feel so contented in remaining here,
                                    but am inclined to think it is the <hi rend="i">latter.</hi>

                                    think I am better contented than I would be at home, although a short visit there
                                    would be by no means disagreeable. <hi rend="i">Furloughs</hi> are now being issued

                                    for "one" are very slim, yet I anticipate a "few

                        <p>A few words to you to day in answer to yours of 20th May 1863. I have so little to
                                    communicate that would interest you, that I am almost ashamed to write. I am also
                                    far behind in my correspondence and wish some thing lively would happen that I might

                                    and we are expecting hourly of news of a fight between our boys &amp; them. I
                                    did not go this morning for reason that I was out on a scout with about 100 cavalry
                                    yesterday, was in the saddle all day, rode very hard and to day am nearly
                                    "played out".</p>

                                    trip South very much, but I am afraid he will have the <hi rend="i">blues</hi>
                                    pretty badly by the time he steps out side our lines, he said while here that the
                                    people of Ohio intended nominating him for next Governor and that he expected to
                                    gain the election. He is mistaken there !<hi rend="sup">48</hi>

                                    remains in camp all day and seems to enjoy herself very much. Col
                                    Burgess’ family are also here, and are all very sick, the Col is very
                                    much distressed, he is afraid he will lose his little girl.</p>
                        <p>The news from <hi rend="i">Grant</hi> to day is very flattering. Rosecrans is

                                        conflict. He advocated an armistice with the South, immediate peace, states

                                        issued by General Ambrose Burnside who commanded the Department of the Ohio and
                                        who declared he would not tolerate "the habit of declaring sympathy for

                                    across the river (Stone river) inside the fortifications, but on account of the
                                    incessant rains we have not moved yet, but think by tomorrow we will get into a
                                    permanent camp and live in a little better style than we do now. I thought at first
                                    that my present position would be an unpleasant one, as the aspirants would try to
                                    make it so, but they have all got over their excitement and everything goes on as

                        <p>Katie! only this morning did your kind letter come to hand dated Aug 7th 1863, I was
                                    aware of your absence from home and your trip to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. Ma! wrote me just after you left. I was sorry indeed to hear of her
                                    sickness hope she will soon recover. I have had but two letters from her since I was
                                    home. She used to write so often I miss her letters very much.</p>
                        <p>I just arrived at the Regt from a visit to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> of several days. I had a very pleasant time while there and had my
                                    leave of absence been 2 days longer I would have gone to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                        <p>My health is very good, but the general health of the Regt is worse than it has been
                                    since we have been in the service. Our present camp is a very unhealthy one. The
                                    continual breezes we get are direct from the battle field, and you can imagine how
                                    poisonous they are when I tell you of the thousand, dead bodies of men &amp;
                                    animals to be found half buried in every direction.<hi rend="sup">56</hi>

                        <p>Our army commenced moving at the front this week, and I think we will soon wind up
                                    affairs in this Dept. We expect to move from this post in a few days, I care not how
                                    soon, or where, I am anxious to be Moving.</p>

                                    the past 6 or 8 night [s] has been uncomfortably cool making double covering, fires

                                    believe it right to make soldiers of them and class &amp; rank with our <hi rend="i">white</hi> soldiers. It makes them feel and act as our equals. I do

                                    </placeName> I neglected being mustered (or trying to be) until a short time since,
                                    when I found that the enclosed order (No 182) from War Dept had been issued which

                                    rolls show 80 men or more. If I had reed my commission before June 20th/63 (date of
                                    order) I would have had no difficulty in getting mustered but I did not receive it

                                    my letter, I noticed in Ind'polis Journal of the 15th inst that eleven (11)
                                    new Regiments are to be raised in Indiana, I was just talking to Adjt <hi rend="i">Jim</hi> and he requests that I apply for <hi rend="i">Adjutancy</hi> of one of
                                    them. Do you think it is possible and will you assist me. I can get the
                                    recommendation of the Field officers of the 70th and the Line officers if their

                                    application is made the better. My experience in the Adjutants Dept of a Regt has
                                    been quite <hi rend="i">extensive</hi> and I feel competant to hold the position,

                                    absence. If I can get a commish as Adjt I will have no trouble to get mustered out
                                    of the 70th and return home immediately to accept it. Frank! as you have some

                                    situation, also asking your assistance in procuring me the position of Adjutant in

                        <p>I have not spoken to Col H about it as he is detached from the Regt on a <hi rend="i">Military Commission.</hi> I have not seen him for a week, but am confident he

                                    and I think his recommendation is sufficient.</p>

                        <p>By this mornings mail your long looked for letter came to hand. I had <hi rend="i">not</hi> given up all hopes of hearing from you again, as I was well aware your
                                    negligence was unavoidable. I reed a letter from Ma also this morning dated 19th,
                                    (yours was 22nd) it had been delayed on the road.</p>

                                    M[orton] in the same mail. I am in hopes with Franks influence of obtaining the
                                    place wanted. I have no fears, but Frank will do his best for me.</p>

                                    in all the particulars. Several thousand of our wounded have arrived here already
                                    and all that will bear transportation are to come.<hi rend="sup">61</hi> A great

                              <item>legislators bolted the legislative halls, leaving the assembly with no
                                            quorum to do business. Since no appropriations bill had been passed for the
                                            succeeding biennium, Democrats expected Morton to call a special session in
                                            which they could continue their partisan efforts. Instead, the governor
                                            appointed a financial secretary, set up his own treasury, and proceeded to
                                            secure funds by various means to run the state for the following two years.
                                            While Morton negotiated for money with which to pay the interest on the
                                            state debt, Democrats kept up a constant barrage of criticisms and warning
                                            that a special session of the legislature must be called. The governor
                                            refused to heed their threats and administered the financial affairs of the
                                            state without legislative approval until the Republican dominated General
                                            Assembly of 1865 sanctioned his actions. Both Morton's and the
                                            Democracy's behavior reached the depths of partisan politics during
                                            these months of bickering. For a complete discussion of these events see

                        <p>Not being in camp for near two weeks long enough to snatch a minute to write you,
                                    until to day—you will excuse my silence. This is a gloomy day in camp,
                                    raining "pitchforks" and our tent being rather aged and worn it
                                    does not afford much shelter against the storm, making it necessary for me to
                                    perform a <hi rend="i">flank movement</hi> around my table occasionally to get a dry
                                    spot to write on. I am continually on the lookout for a letter from you and expect
                                    before this hardly gets dry yours will come to hand. It has been two weeks since
                                    Ma's last was received. I shall write her again today. She told me her
                                    secret do you know it yet, if not I shall not tell you, you will learn it soon

                                    since. My fever has entirely disappeared, but my throat is still quite sore though
                                    rapidly improveing. It has been with the utmost difficulty that I could swallow the
                                    least particle of food and my appetite is greatly increasing as my throat gets

            <p>1. <hi rend="i">Certificate of Commendation.</hi> The Certificate of Commendation is given for
                    outstanding achievement by an individual or an organization in the field of state, provincial, and
                    local history, but with that achievement judged in the light of local limiting circumstances rather
                    than on a basis of overall excellence in the <placeName>

                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> as a whole. This is an award of encouragement and commendation to a person or group
                    which by great effort has accomplished something that is really outstanding within its own area. The
                    certificate is a pat on the back and says to the individual or organization that receives it:
                    "We think you are doing a wonderful job in your area, and we want to recognize you for
                    it."</p>
            <p>2. <hi rend="i">The Award of Merit.</hi> This was the original award of the American Association for
                    State and Local History and is still the backbone of its competition. It is given for excellence of
                    accomplishment or program in the field of state, provincial, and local history and is in no way
                    judged relative to local limiting circumstances. The giving of the Award of Merit is the same as
                    saying to everyone: "This is public acknowledgment by the American Association for State
                    and Local History that this accomplishment or this program, in comparison with all similar
                    accomplishments and programs in North America, deserves the adjective excellent."</p>

                    Hamilton, S. J. (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>: The University of Wisconsin Press, 1970. Pp. xv, 275. Maps, notes, illustrations,
                    appendices, bibliography, index. $10.00.)</head>
            <p>Every schoolboy knows that Jacques Marquette, a Jesuit priest, accompanied fur trader Louis Jolliet
                    on the famous French expedition of "discovery" and exploration of the upper
                    Mississippi River Valley in 1673 and wrote a chronicle of their travels. But among scholars
                    (Catholic ecclesiastics at that) there is agreement only that Marquette did indeed make the historic
                    journey. Father Francis B. Steck, an ordained Franciscan, has argued that Marquette was not a member
                    of the Society of Jesus, that the narrative of the trip is actually Jolliet's duplicate
                    journal embellished by Claude Dablon (Superior of the New <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> missions), and that Marquette has been accorded a greatly exaggerated role in the
                    expedition. According to Father Jean Delanglez the Récit was not based exclusively on
                    Jolliet's account but was fashioned by Dablon from a variety of contemporary sources.
                    Father Joseph C. Short has contended that Marquette was never ordained and thus confined his
                    missionary work to that of lay catechist. Such heresies have not gone unchallenged through the
                    years, but it has remained for Father Raphael N. Hamilton, himself a Jesuit and longtime student of
                    Marquette and the upper Mississippi frontier, to resolve the major points of contention.</p>
            <p>Much of the dispute stems from the quantity and quality of the historical record. The official log of
                    the trip and other firsthand reports were lost when Jolliet's canoe capsized; the surviving
                    evidence is scanty, vague, and at times contradictory. This is especially true of the lone extant
                    account of the expedition, the Récit traditionally attributed to Marquette. In order to
                    ascertain the authenticity and accuracy of the Récit and related documents, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> subjected every known piece of Marquette material to exacting internal and external
                    criticism, employing bibliotic and cartographic techniques in addition to rigorous content analysis.
                    The result is a work of impeccable scholarship that constitutes a resounding reaffirmation of
                    Marquette's renown as a Jesuit priest, explorer, and chronicler.</p>
            <p>Because of the nature of the problem at hand, <hi rend="i">Marquette's Explorations</hi> is
                    more a legal brief than an historical narrative. Specialists will find this fascinating piece of
                    detective work both entertaining and edifying, but the general reader will find it heavy going. This
                    narrowly focused and closely reasoned study assumes <pb n="83" id="VAA4025-068-1-093"/> much
                    familiarity with the competition among European powers for empire in North America, the intramural
                    rivalry between Jesuit and Recollect missionaries, the history of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> under Jean Talon and Louis de Buade de Frontenac, and the structure and operation of
                    the Roman Catholic Church and the Jesuit Order. Although judicious English translations accompany
                    literal transcriptions of the original French and Latin, knowledge of seventeenth century French is
                    desirable since textual analysis is the warp and weft of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s intricate scholarly tapestry. This reviewer's only substantive
                    criticism is the perhaps inevitable elevation by implication of Marquette to coequal status with
                    Jolliet when the fur trader was undoubtedly the prime mover of the pioneering enterprise. Be that as
                    it may, it is fitting that this impressive volume along with the recent biography of the
                    missionary-explorer by Father Joseph P. Donnelly assures Marquette of his rightful place in the
                    annals of history as the tercentenary of the French discovery of the Father of Waters approaches.</p>

            <p>Joseph G. Rayback's <hi rend="i">Free Soil</hi> provides an excellent account of the
                    presidential politics leading up to the election of 1848, but it is much less successful in
                    explaining the politics of the free soil issue itself. Drawing upon a multiplicity of newspaper
                    sources to trace the development of the various careers of presidential candidates, Rayback is
                    especially good in describing the ebb and flow of their political fortunes and showing how even the
                    most ephemeral of occurrences can raise or dash political prospects. In the early summer of 1846 a
                    chance sentence in General Winfield Scott's correspondence with James K. Folk's
                    secretary of war apparently destroyed his candidacy. More significantly, the book makes clear that
                    it was Zachary Taylor's victory at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Buena Vista</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the wild popular enthusiasm which it engendered, more than any political
                    consideration, that made him the Whig candidate in 1848.</p>
            <p>Rayback seems much less at home with the politics of the Democratic party, which was intimately
                    concerned with the issue of slavery in the territories in the period from 1846 to 1848. At one point
                    he confesses to being puzzled as to "why northern Democrats delayed so long in revealing
                    their [antislavery] attitude" (p. 60). Whatever their moral concern, politicians
                    infrequently take up an issue which <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-068-1-094"/> cannot be made to serve
                    their political interests, and in the 1840s the political interests of virtually all politicians,
                    Whig and Democrat alike, depended upon the maintenance of a party unity which the slavery issue
                    directly threatened. The issue emerged when an important faction of the Democratic party developed
                    interests which overrode its commitment to national party unity. Essentially it was the
                    Barnburners’ determination to use the slavery issue to advance their political fortunes,
                    coupled with the response which this evoked from John C. Calhoun and his southern Democratic
                    supporters, which precipitated the struggle over free soil.</p>
            <p>Rayback treats the Barnburners’ advocacy of the Wilmot Proviso as essentially an
                    idealistic enterprise. He maintains that "there was no evidence of an ulterior
                    motive" and goes on to say: "The Barnburners’ acceptance of the Proviso
                    was actually a logical result of their long-standing championship of the principles of freedom and
                    equality" (p. 298). The aim of their third party movement was "the advancement of
                    the principles of the Proviso" and not "the recovery of control of the party in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>" which "had become secondary" (p. 298). Regaining control of
                    the party in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> never became secondary to Martin Van Buren, as a careful reading of his correspondence
                    shows. This is not to say that Van Buren was not genuinely interested in free soil or that he was
                    unprincipled. But Van Buren was a politician par excellence, and he expressed his principles as a
                    politician does, by coordinating them with a drive for political power, in his case not his own but
                    his son's and that of his other close political associates.</p>
            <p>Rayback also misses the rhythm of the development of the free soil issue which flowed from the
                    efforts of the Democratic factions to advance their political interests. The issue emerged slowly
                    and then, after the Barnburners picked it up, developed as a series of dialectical exchanges between
                    the various factions, with the party regulars constantly seeking a synthesis which could accommodate
                    the different positions sufficiently to maintain party unity.</p>
            <p>Rayback apparently did not consult Walter L. Ferree's dissertation, "The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> Democracy—Division and Reunion, 1847–1852," which
                    skillfully traces the role of Preston King and his Barnburner friends in thrusting the Wilmot
                    Proviso "firebrand" into politics. The author also mistakenly dates the appearance
                    of the idea that slavery could not exist in the territories without a positive law introducing it as
                    August, 1848. Actually this premise was as old as the Wilmot Proviso itself, having been advanced by
                    John <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quincy</settlement>
                    </placeName> Adams on the same day that Wilmot introduced his amendment., It was specifically to
                    require the Democratic party to disavow popular sovereignty and the "positive law"
                    idea, as well as the Wilmot Proviso <pb n="85" id="VAA4025-068-1-095"/> that William Lowndes Yancey
                    introduced his Alabama Platform in February of 1848, not, as Rayback would have it, a year earlier
                    when these doctrines were undeveloped and posed no danger to the South. In his final chapter Rayback
                    describes the disintegration of the major parties which began in 1848, but one must look elsewhere
                    than in <hi rend="i">Free Soil</hi> for a complete explanation of this process.</p>

                    </placeName> have found several critics. Only Aileen Kraditor has challenged his attribution of an
                    anti-institutional bias to the abolitionists.</p>
            <p>The editor in her introduction adequately summarizes the major points Elkins made in his study and
                    briefly states the positions taken by most of the authors included in this volume. She also draws
                    attention to some works, not included, that would be helpful in assessing the total impact of
                    Elkins’ ideas. Eleven of the fourteen selections in this work have previously been
                    published.</p>
            <p>All the articles contain useful commentary and insight, but the volume contains little in direct
                    support of Elkins. A number of the authors convincingly contend that slavery was a much more open
                    society than Elkins states, some question the appropriateness of the concentration camp analogy, and
                    others present quite different points of view on the Sambo personality. Eugene Genovese says the
                    Sambo —or as he calls it, the slavish—personality existed wherever slavery
                    did, while Earl E. Thorpe thinks the Sambo personality was not the real slave personality. There was
                    much room, he says, for the development of a more complex, better rounded personality, and he feels
                    Elkins gives no real consideration to the great differences that result from being born slave and
                    being born free. Sterling Stuckey <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-068-1-096"/> maintains that, on balance,
                    folklore "decisively repudiates the thesis that Negroes <hi rend="i">as a group</hi> had
                    internalized Sambo traits ..." (p. 266). The supporters of Stuckey's assertion
                    that a large number of slaves were able to maintain their essential humanity may well be more
                    numerous than those who subscribe to Elkins’ thesis that slavery destroyed the adult
                    personality. It is probably safe to say that Elkins would not have been so sharply criticised if he
                    had contended that slavery <hi rend="i">prevented</hi> the development of the adult personality in
                    many blacks.</p>
            <p>George Frederickson and Christopher Lasch believe that prisons would have been a better analogy than
                    concentration camps and suggest the utility of Erving Goffman's various strategies of
                    accommodation that are possible in total institutions—but not in concentration
                    camps—in explaining responses of the slaves. These authors, however, quibble
                    unnecessarily over the meaning of "resistance," which to them is a political
                    concept. Roy Simon Bryce-Laporte's article (previously unpublished) uses Goffman's
                    concept of a total institution in his examination of slavery and believes the impact of the slave
                    plantation is "more appropriately understood in terms of alternative and varied behavioral
                    mechanisms used by slaves rather than [by the] prevalence of a fixed personality type derived from
                    the contrived dichotomy of choices between killing or being killed" (p. 270).</p>
            <p>These few remarks by no means do justice to this valuable collection which in many ways is more
                    illuminating than the work under discussion. Even so, Elkins should get reflected credit: it was he
                    who served as catalyst for these pieces. A new essay by Elkins concedes little to his critics. He
                    thinks the debate on slavery has taken on qualities similar to the one before his book, and he hopes
                    it may again be reoriented, this time along ideological lines.</p>

                    "letter," approximately 40,000 words, was obviously intended for publication.
                    After Haskell's death (Cold Harbor, June 3, 1864) his brother submitted the manuscript to

                    Hall, one of Frank's Dartmouth classmates (1854), after eliminating some of the critical
                    passages, included the letter in a history of the Class of 1854 published in 1898. The Massachusetts

                    And now this long publishing history perhaps comes to a conclusion with the Byrne and Weaver
                    biography which includes the original Haskell letter of July 16, 1863.</p>
            <p>As a trusted member of the staff of General John Gibbon, commander of the Second Division at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Haskell was in a strategic position to observe and participate in the defense of
                    Cemetery Ridge on the third day. According to Haskell's account he rallied General
                    Alexander Webb's Pennsylvania brigade at the crucial point of Major General George E.
                    Pickett's charge. "Acting General" Haskell also secured support from the
                    brigades commanded by N#2 J. Hall and William Harrow.</p>
            <p>Members of Webb's Second Brigade reacted bitterly to Haskell's account of their
                    retreat at Cemetery Ridge. Admirers of General Daniel E. Sickles also resented Haskell's
                    strictures. Some critics thought he magnified his own role. Yet, General Gibbon, who was in a
                    position to have an informed opinion, praised "his conspicuous coolness and
                    bravery" in his report and afterwards testified: "I have always thought that to
                    him, more than to any one man, are we indebted for the repulse of Lee's assault. His
                    personal gallantry in aiding the officers in reforming their overpowered troops was seen and
                    commented upon by many, whilst his quick judgment in using his authority as a staff officer of his
                    absent general in moving assistance to the critical point was admirable" (John Gibbon, <hi rend="i">Personal Recollections</hi>, 153).</p>
            <pb n="88" id="VAA4025-068-1-098"/>
            <p>Major General Winfield Scott, commander of the Second Corps, joined in Gibbon's commendation
                    of Haskell. And, the final pragmatic judgment in military matters, Haskell was shortly given a jump
                    promotion to the colonelcy of a newly formed Wisconsin regiment.</p>
            <p>Haskell provided a detailed contemporary account of what was probably the greatest military
                    engagement ever fought in North America. It will remain a basic document in any appraisal of <placeName>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Outcasts from, Evolution</hi> is a study of nineteenth century scientific racism in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. In this slim volume John S. Haller of Indiana University Northwest discusses the
                    anthropometric research done during the Civil War on black and white soldiers (some deceased) which
                    "proved" black inferiority, the "proofs" of physical and mental
                    inferiority of black people provided by white southern physicians and northern insurance company
                    analysts, and racial views and studies of some leading American natural and social scientists during
                    the last quarter of the nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>Haller's expressed intent is to show the manner in which scientific opinion
                    "provided a vocabulary and a set of concepts which rationalized and helped to justify the
                    value system upon Which the idea of race rested in American thought" (p. x). Unfortunately,
                    he is often unclear in distinguishing "scientific" findings from opinions on race.
                    And one can question his decision to describe as scientists individuals whose opinions were backed
                    by virtually no scientific content. The statistical proofs of the physical and moral inferiority
                    which would lead to the eventual extinction of black people provided by insurance company analyst
                    Frederick Hoffman, for instance, is about as scientific (his major source was the 1890 census) as
                    the evidence marshaled by Hinton R. Helper for his well known racist monograph, <hi rend="i">Nojoque</hi> (1867).</p>
            <p>The author is also unclear about what he means by race, for many of his scientists are shown to have
                    held strong views on the inferiority of Irishmen and southeastern Europeans as well. His <pb n="89" id="VAA4025-068-1-099"/> discussion of Nathaniel S. Shaler (pp. 171–73) illustrates
                    this lack of clarity, for here Haller suggests that <hi rend="i">Outcasts</hi> is a study of
                    scientific support for cultural inferiority as well as racial inferiority. One becomes more
                    convinced of the dual nature of this study when some of the scientists, unable to prove the physical
                    inferiority of Chinese and having some knowledge of their past accomplishments, are shown to have
                    taken to theorizing about the inferiority of Chinese culture, thus suggesting racial inferiority,
                    too. In short Haller has failed to make clear that he is writing about men who used their standing
                    in the scientific community as a platform from which they could mouth what were in fact nothing more
                    than preconceived biases.</p>
            <p>It may be that Haller is correct that these "scientific" ideas influenced a
                    generation of Americans on race and set the foundation upon which "attitudes of racial
                    inferiority have continued to plague western culture" (p. xi) until today, but one would
                    appreciate documentation of this premise. For instance, it would be helpful to know what effects
                    these opinions had at the time on college courses, national and state legislation (he points out
                    that some of these men supported lynchings), civil rights cases, and upon the masses through popular
                    journalism. One particularly wants evidence to substantiate the allegation that the idea of the
                    ensuing extinction of black people was a widely held view and that "segregation and
                    disfranchisement were the first steps toward preparing the Negro race for its extinction"
                    (p. 210). Anthropologists and sociologists may find value in this book as an introduction to their
                    science during the nineteenth century, but it presents no new information or insights into
                    understanding racial prejudice.</p>

                        American Foreign Policy, 1860–1900.</hi> By Howard B. Schonberger. <hi rend="i">Contributions in American History</hi>, Number 8. (West port, Conn.: Greenwood Publishing
                    Corporation, 1971. Pp. xix, 265. Notes, selected bibliography, index. $10.50.)</head>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Transportation to the Seaboard</hi> focuses upon the struggle waged by industrialists,
                    farmers, and merchants to secure cheap transportation across the country and the effect of this
                    agitation upon America's rise to world power. Placing the transportation issue in a broad
                    politico-economic context, Schonberger divides his work into four parts: the first section, covering
                    the years 1860 to 1880, concentrates on western farmers’ and merchants’
                    demands for regulated <pb n="90" id="VAA4025-068-1-100"/> railroad shipping rates to widen their
                    share of the world market; part two illustrates how the transportation issue figured in the debate
                    during the 1880s over federal regulation of railroads; part three analyzes the role of three
                    railroads in carrying agricultural exports to the sea and opening new foreign markets; part four is
                    a brief conclusion.</p>
            <p>The author emphasizes the effect of agricultural depression upon farmer militancy and, in turn, upon
                    foreign policy. As early as 1874 the Windom report, revealing that demands for cheap transportation
                    and wider markets abroad intensified during depression periods, recommended better transportation to
                    facilitate competition with the Russians in the British grain market. Farmers demanded that Congress
                    pass legislation beneficial to overseas commerce, reduce freight rates, and make the Mississippi
                    River navigable with an outlet on the Gulf of <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName>. Schonberger argues that they became economic nationalists dedicated to overseas
                    expansion long before the Spanish American War.</p>
            <p>Farmers were soon joined by railroad owners in the fight for wide markets. In the late 1870s and
                    early 1880s the railroads emerged battered from the rate wars and united with farmer and merchant
                    groups in calling for a subsidized merchant marine, reciprocal trade treaties, an isthmian canal,
                    and a strong navy to meet competition in European markets and to open new ones in Asia. Viewing
                    their economic survival and American expansion as inseparable, they believed that "if
                    America was to extend its economic and political interests abroad then it must lead in
                    transportation developments" (p. 239). While farmers, merchants, and businessmen agreed on
                    certain goals, they did not actively cooperate. The author never claims that the farmers’
                    and railroad barons’ search for larger markets led to the Spanish American War, but he
                    feels that their demands for governmental support in the world exchanges contributed to the growth
                    of America's empire.</p>
            <p>Schonberger has written a fine account of the American farmer in his transformation to capitalist
                    entrepreneur and of the railroads’ effort to become more than a link between Keokuk, <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Adoption of an internationalist outlook by these groups contributed to the spread of
                    American influence, but the author has difficulty showing the tangible results. Selling cotton in
                    Liverpool or kerosene in <placeName>

                    </placeName> may improve the trade balance but does not necessarily lead to imperialistic endeavors.
                    Schonberger does not show a direct connection between farmers’ demands for cheap
                    transportation and Caribbean bellicosity, but his build up leads one to expect it. <hi rend="i">Transportation to the Seaboard</hi> belongs chiefly in the realm of economic history, only

            <p>Diplomatic historians have generally assumed that during the Gilded Age America's
                    preoccupation with industrialization and western settlement preempted a vigorous interest in foreign
                    policy. <placeName>

                    </placeName>, believes such a view "needs serious qualification" (p. 13). He
                    contends that concern for domestic matters only veiled developments in foreign affairs and that
                    America's emergence as a world power did not catch the "national psyche off
                    guard" (p. 10). Rather there was a natural sequence of preparation for world involvement
                    and outward thrust that resulted from a "persistent commercial impulse" (p. 230).</p>
            <p>To substantiate this thesis Plesur explores the contemporary public attitude toward foreign affairs
                    as expressed in newspapers, periodicals, manuscripts, and official government publications. The
                    subjects selected highlight America's growing involvement overseas. Six chapters consider
                    trade and the need for markets, expansion of the State Department, literary cosmopolitanism,
                    protection of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> citizens abroad, refurbishing of the navy and merchant marine, and travelers. Five
                    chapters deal with mounting American interest in Europe, Africa, Latin America, <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, and the Pacific. This organization by topic and geographic area produces less
                    repetition than might be expected. That which exists deserves only minor criticism.</p>
            <p>Plesur obviously believes the preparation for "America's outward thrust"
                    was economically motivated: "Business expansion and a maturing economy led to the
                    quickening of interest in America's overseas economic destiny" (p. 229);
                    "the commercial possibilities the Hawaiian Islands offered American businessmen continued
                    to pull the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> deeper into diplomatic involvement in the Pacific in the postwar decades" (p.
                    205); "Shippers needed naval protection on the high seas, and real improvement in the
                    condition of the navy came only when it was successfully linked with commercial expansion"
                    (p. 95). This emphasis on commercial motivation is similar to that of Walter LaFeber's <hi rend="i">The New Empire</hi> (1963) and <pb n="92" id="VAA4025-068-1-102"/> William A.
                    Williams’ <hi rend="i">The Roots of the Modern American Empire</hi> (1969).</p>
            <p>Contemporary attitudes lead the author to conclude that the Gilded Age was a period of transition
                    between noninvolvement and involvement in world affairs. He admits America's preoccupation
                    with internal developments and its neglect of external affairs but maintains that a dynamic foreign
                    policy began to appear. The public's ambivalent attitudes reflected in his book warrant
                    this conclusion. Ideas do not change suddenly; instead old and new overlap during an intermediate
                    period. Thus, Plesur has thoughtfully, although not substantially, qualified the traditional view of
                    foreign affairs during the Gilded Age.</p>

            <p>David Healy has produced a reasonable, believable account of American foreign policy in the 1890s, a
                    task so difficult that few historians have come close to accomplishing it. The remarkably strident
                    language and ruffian behavior of the period has sometimes embarrassed its students or inspired them
                    excessively. Now and then the historian feels the need to apologize, calling the imperialistic age
                    an aberration, a single wayward step off the high road of American history. For those preferring
                    another sort of generalization, the period is described as a treasure trove of proofs and
                    precedents. Numerous special causes have been advanced, then ardently defended against other,
                    equally narrow interpretations. Some authors say that economic greed controls history, perfect
                    examples being the war with <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> and the conquest of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="ph">Philippines</country>
                    </placeName>. These same events are also said to illustrate the destructive energy of
                    America's moralistic tradition, the power of the press, or the ever volatile condition of
                    democratic life. According to other writers the true cause of American imperialism was racism, or
                    Social Darwinism, or assorted psychic phenomena left over from the Civil War or produced by the
                    internal discontents of the 1890s.</p>
            <p>Healy argues with none of these interpretations. For him all have some validity; for history is
                    complex, and seven volunteers, converging on a recruiting office, might be propelled by an equal
                    number of reasons. Chapter length studies of James Harrison Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt, Elihu Root,
                    Charles Denby, Charles A. Conant, and others show how a common policy—in this case a war
                    of <pb n="93" id="VAA4025-068-1-103"/> conquest—can result from pride, fear, desire for
                    financial profits, self-righteousness, boredom, insecurity, pugnacity, and other instincts, often
                    quite tangled in a single personality.</p>
            <p>While Healy does not attack previous efforts to explain why the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> fought <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>, he treats them as justifications (some shabbier than others) instead of causes; thus,
                    all lose some importance. The American people went to war and absorbed an empire simply because they
                    wanted to. Label it a physical urge, an animal instinct, or "nervous
                    intoxication," as Healy does on page 236. This, at least, is the implication of a work
                    wherein primitive urges are never successfully concealed by those who publicly proclaim that war is
                    necessary for reasons of commerce, security, national unity, biology, progress, or Christianity.</p>
            <p>Free of both political biases and computerized statistics, the book must depend—and most
                    successfully so—upon its author's comprehensive mastery of his period and of a
                    prose style which is clear, at times witty, and thoroughly civilized,</p>

                    index. $12.95.)</head>
            <p>This volume possesses three merits. It authoritatively delineates Woodrow Wilson's career,
                    effectively elucidates some intricacies of American progressivism, and conveniently collects
                    twenty-four major essays and papers of a distinguished historian. These articles demonstrate both
                    Wilson's and Link's development; yet, they are characterized by an implicit
                    continuity and coherence. What accounts for this unity is Link's plenary assertion that
                    Wilson represented "the apogee, of the Calvinistic tradition among all statesman of the
                    modern epoch" (p. 4).</p>
            <p>A surging sense of duty and destiny were not all that a passionate faith caused. Wilson's
                    Presbyterian inheritance instilled devotion to ordered, representative government, recognition of
                    God's sovereignty over the historical process, and repudiation of a hierarchic society
                    based upon birth or wealth. Calvinism, according to Link, "was one of the main causes ...
                    of equalitarian democracy" (p. 16) in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and was for Wilson the animating source for the certitude that all men had an inherent
                    capacity for self-government. What is not directly attributable to Presbyterianism, in
                    Link's judgment, is the enlivened Christian social conscience distinguishing <pb n="94" id="VAA4025-068-1-104"/> Wilson's thought from 1907 through 1909. Link describes a
                    structural interdependence fusing Wilson's Christianity, social reform beliefs, and
                    political program. So that when the President "crossed his political Rubicon in
                    1916" by advocating and achieving a series of reforms and "a vision of the modern
                    welfare state," it was caused by his own "broadening political experiences and the
                    social gospel, which was then running at high tide in American Protestantism" (p. 18).</p>
            <p>One of the book's impressive features is the sustained, meticulous, and expansive analysis
                    Link has brought to virtually every aspect of Wilson's beliefs and behavior. His essays
                    refine our understanding of innumerable incidents and cogently demonstrate how apparently obvious
                    evidence can often lead to dubious or erroneous conclusions. This is especially evident in the
                    assessment of Wilson as a southerner. Link finds the South's reputed significance in
                    Wilson's formation tenuous. Wilson condemned sectionalism, held advanced attitudes towards
                    blacks, and frequently decried the South's political and social inertia. Other criteria,
                    including his theories on the nature of the Union and government's meliorative
                    responsibilites, indicate that Wilson's intellectual maturation was not molded in the
                    southern crucible.</p>
            <p>If the assumption that the author's published volumes on Wilson diminish the importance of
                    his essays over the last three decades, consider that this collection includes detailed evaluations
                    of Wilson's study of political administration, his governorship and Democratic party
                    activities, his diplomacy during the ordeal of neutrality, and a provocative critique of the
                    psycho-history of Sigmund Freud and William C. Bullitt. The essays are vital both for understanding
                    this formidable President and for interpreting early twentieth century American history.</p>

                    1900–1960.</hi> By Morrell Heald. (<placeName>

                    appendix, bibliographical note, index. $9.95.)</head>
            <p>The subject of Professor Heald's book is "the idea of social responsibility as
                    businessmen themselves have defined and experienced it" (p. xi) over the course of the
                    twentieth century. But Heald's work is no simple narrative of the growth of a new corporate
                    statesmanship. The reader is advised early in the book to discount "the popular contrast
                    between the socially conscious businessman of today <pb n="95" id="VAA4025-068-1-105"/> and his
                    supposedly self-centered predecessor of a century ago" (p. 2). What is at issue here is not
                    a change in moral tone but rather the search for definitions of a new social role of business
                    appropriate to an age of corporate bureaucracy and power held by large economic units.</p>
            <p>Heald has skillfully woven together the many strands of thought developed by twentieth century
                    business leaders in attempting to elaborate a rationale for the modern corporation. Their task was
                    to develop an explicit statement, meaningful in the context of twentieth century American society,
                    elaborating the positive social value of business institutions held implicitly in the nineteenth
                    century. In part, this attempt to define the social responsibilities of business was a response to
                    forces in the socio-political environment, such as the public attack on big business and the growth
                    of large scale government. But Heald argues that expressions of the business concept of trusteeship
                    were most widespread in the 1920s and again in the 1950s, when presumably government held a
                    favorable attitude toward business. Thus the author stresses the positive need to define and justify
                    the new social role of the manager of the modern corporation—a decision maker whose
                    economic power does not rest directly upon ownership of wealth as did the power of the old style
                    capitalist. "Managerial capitalism" implies relationships between business and the
                    community different from those characteristic of the individual proprietorship, as well as changed
                    relations among those within the business firm.</p>
            <p>Heald's treatment is critical, and he bases his discussion on a wide range of the literature
                    expressing the thought of corporation executives and others professing to speak for business. As the
                    author intended, his work suggests many approaches for future investigations of business thought
                    about social responsibility. Using the methodology of the intellectual historian, he recognizes that
                    the spokesmen on whose words he rests his case do not constitute a representative cross section of
                    the American business community at any time in the twentieth century. Now that Heald has defined so
                    clearly the progression of thinking of the most articulate corporate leaders, future investigators
                    may examine more carefully the penetration of new concepts of social responsibility into the
                    thinking of the rank and file among members of the business bureaucracy as well as independent
                    entrepreneurs. Even the most cursory glance at the business world today reveals a wide range of
                    thought and action regarding responsibility, including the ideas of men with a high sense of
                    professional purpose as well as of others who conducted their operations "with just
                    sufficient honesty to keep out of jail," to use the words of Aldous Huxley, cited by Heald.</p>
            <p>Heald's careful study should take its place on the shelf of significant <pb n="96" id="VAA4025-068-1-106"/> works dealing with this aspect of the history of the modern

            <p>This volume contains some of the data and some of the stories about archaeology in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> which caught the author's interest as he read, studied, and conversed with
                    people. It was written in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> and then translated into English. The purposes of the book are to awaken interest in
                    American archaeology and to provide a framework and bibliography for readers who might be stimulated
                    to pursue various parts of the story.</p>
            <p>Kurt W. Marek (Ceram is a pseudonym) has given coverage to some of the important discoveries, frauds,
                    myths, personalities, problems, cultures, techniques, and sequences within the field of archaeology.
                    He has had the assistance of a number of notable American archaeologists who have given him guidance
                    and read his manuscript.</p>
            <p>The book begins with a short tribute to Thomas Jefferson's report of his excavation of an
                    Indian mound in Virginia and its significance in archaeological work. Next is a discussion of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the Vikings, and the possible identity of the inhabitants of the east coast, followed
                    by a description of the sixteenth century Spanish penetrations into the southern part of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, particularly the Southwest.</p>
            <p>Most of the presentation of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> archaeology is about the Southwest area from the appearance of the first known
                    inhabitants, through the period from about A. D. 500 to 1500, and up to the present day. Along with
                    Marek's interpretation of southwestern cultural growth are comments on the nature of
                    archaeology, the development and importance of dendrochronology and radiocarbon dating, the problem
                    of the physical type, and the scarcity of early man.</p>
            <p>The author apparently likes to use the word "mummy"; thus, he refers to the
                    dessicated human remains from the southwest and other places as "mummies," which
                    they are not. His story about <pb n="97" id="VAA4025-068-1-107"/> "Little Alice"
                    should be updated to record that the subject really was "Little Al" and that he
                    was relocated and studied by Professor Louise Robbins of the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. Marek also uses the word "pyramid" to refer to a pyramidal or
                    platform mound—they are quite different constructions. Marek, or his editors, evidently
                    prefers the spelling "shard" to the almost universally used
                    "sherd" in American archaeology.</p>
            <p>The personalities of archaeologists and stories about them are at least as important to Marek as are
                    the interpretations of cultural development made by archaeologists. Marek includes a chapter on some
                    of the sectarian and other unacceptable interpretations of the peopling of the New World, a
                    recounting of the Cardiff giant hoax, a version of the original development and spread of maize, and
                    even a brief mention of Piltdown man. A good yarn has a great attraction for Marek, and one of the
                    best which he recounts is the question of whether the Pueblo Indians domesticated the turkey or vice
                    versa. This reviewer found the author's tendency to shift from one subject to another after
                    a few pages distracting as well as diverting. It is, however, his style.</p>
            <p>Marek's volume has little or no coverage of the Pacific coast, the western area north of the
                    Southwest, the Plains, the Great Lakes area, or the area east of the Appalachians. The sections on
                    the Eastern <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> contain most of the author's misstatements, misinterpretations, and
                    misspellings. Careful reading of the proof by someone familiar with the East would have caught at
                    least some of them. The photographic illustrations and the drawings and maps are a fine addition to
                    the text. Footnotes are grouped together in fourteen pages near the end of the book.</p>

                    authors as scholars and their substantial ability in communicating their findings to the general
                    reader combine to make this an informative and timely volume. The Indiana Historical Society is to
                    be commended for the generally high quality of its newly established lecture series and equally for

                    even larger number of houses. Fortunately the variety is substantial, including simple houses of
                    log, frame, brick, and stone as well as better and more elaborate houses. Hopefully this publication
                    will induce additional listings in subsequent revisions. The description of the Harmonist Museum

               </placeName>, was by 1910, according to the editors,
                    "a virtual symbol of reform sentiment, a man universally respected and welcomed in
                    progressive circles" (p. xxxi). This volume of his letters takes Brandeis from the age of
                    thirteen into the midst of his career as a corporate lawyer and a progressive social reformer in <pb n="100" id="VAA4025-068-1-110"/>

                    Brandeis’ letters can help account for his greatness. The bulk of the letters considered
                    for publication are in the Brandeis collection at the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> Law School, but the editors have gathered together thousands of letters from other
                    collections and individuals. The letters selected deal little with the private man although this
                    volume contains excerpts from Brandeis’ letters to his wife during their courtship;
                    rather "the figure who stands revealed in these letters will seem, very often, the austere
                    and efficient public man" (p. xix). Overall, the collection of letters will serve as an
                    important record of reform activity in the early twentieth century, will provide some illumination
                    of American Zionism, and will provide new perspectives on Brandeis’ years

                    judiciously. Their editing is clear, and annotation is generally quite sufficient—more
                    often too much detail rather than too little information. According to the dust jacket volume II
                    (1907–1912) will appear in 1972 and subsequent volumes annually. <hi rend="i">Pamela J.

                    with discussion, of over 100 tornado like storms. The cut off date of 1870 is determined by the
                    establishment of "the first Federal weather observing and storm warning system"
                    (p. vii) and the greater systemization of meteorological reporting. The collection was limited by
                    lack of reports in sparsely settled areas and difficulty in determining whether a report really did
                    describe a tornado. One section, "Early American Thought on Tornadoes," presents
