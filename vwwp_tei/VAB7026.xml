                <p>All poems occur as DIV0. Sonnets are attributed as "type=sonnets"; the rest are
                    "type=poem". All quotation marks, hyphens, dashes, apostrophes and colons have
                    been transcribed as entity references. All &lt;lg&gt; (line groups) are
                    attributed as cantos, stanzas, couplets, verse paragraphs, etc. All poems with
                    regularly indented lines use the attribute "rend" in the &lt;l&gt; tag, with the
                    value "indent1" for one tab stop, "indent2" for two tab stops, etc. All split
                    lines are attributed as "type=i" for the initial portion, and "type=f" for the
                    final portion.</p>
                <p>All apostrophes and single right quotation marks are encoded as &amp;rsquo;.</p>
                <p>Any hyphens occurring in line breaks have been removed; all hyphens are encoded
                    as &amp;hyphen; and em dashes as &amp;mdash;.</p>

                    Windus,” March 1895, has been omitted.</p>

                        The Beeshareens are a wandering desert tribe of Upper Egypt, reminding one
                        of our Gypsies. Many of them are remarkably handsome, more particularly in
                        childhood. The grace of their movements and charm of manner must strike all
                        travellers on the Nile. The children haunt the shore where boats land, and
                        set up an incessant cry for “backsheesh,” and there are few who can resist
                        the winning smiles with which they sweeten their importunities. Conspicuous
                        among the crowd was a lovely boy of sixteen, who attracted the attention of
                        artists and photographers two or three winters ago. He had the elegant
                        proportions of a Tanagra statuette, and was<pb n="146" xml:id="VAB7026-139"/> so constantly asked to sit for his portrait that he must have thought
                        that that was the end and aim of all tourists. Finally, he was carried off
                        to the World’s Fair with other curiosities of Egypt. When the Beeshareens
                        returned to Assouan he was not amongst them, and rumour says that he got as
                        far as Marseilles, where he utterly vanished. This tribe dress their profuse
                        black hair in quite an extraordinary fashion. It is worn in countless little
                        plaits, with a high, fuzzy bunch in the centre. I have heard it said that
                        they wear it thus in memory of their descent from one of the lost tribes of

                        officers while riding in the desert round Assouan. The scene is one of
                        extraordinary desolation. The ash‐coloured sand, broken by blue‐black
                        ridges, is a chaos of scattered stones and boulders which might be part of a
                        landscape in the moon. The statue is believed to be that of Amenhotep III.,
                        to whom we owe the two Colossi of the Plain, of which one is the famous
                        “Vocal Memnon.” He was also the Egyptian Nimrod, and on one of his
                        lion‐hunting expeditions to the South is said to have met a beautiful young
                        maiden, whom he married, though she was neither Egyptian nor of royal race.
                        She was that famous Queen Thi who introduced the worship of the Sun’s disk

                        <q>“There is perhaps no phase of our history more capable of poetic
                            treatment than the sainted lives of the Irish monks who first spread the
                            Christian faith over the western shores of Scotland, and yet it would be
                            difficult to point to a single representative poem having Saint Columba
                            and the devoted band of his disciples for its heroes. An attempt at
                            filling up this gap has recently been made by Miss Blind in a narrative
                            poem devoted to the fate of St. Oran, the friend and disciple of St.
                            Columba.... Apart from the sonorous beauty of her lines, there is in her
                            diction a straightforwardness and simplicity, and an entire absence of
                            affectation and false sentiment, which, combined with considerable power
                            of characterization, make her volume a remarkable contribution to
                            English literature.”</q>

                            always a bold, and mostly a rash proceeding.... And yet so skilfully is
                            the story handled that the main incidents of the legend do not lose, but
                            gain by this disturbance of the <foreign xml:lang="fre">motif</foreign>,
                            and the character of Oran, which with the old <foreign xml:lang="fre">motif</foreign> could only have presented the single side of the

                            which modern taste demands.... Directness of style and lucidity of
                            narrative are the characteristic excellences of the poem. There are few
                            contemporary poets who could have done so much dramatic business in so
                            few lines.... In each of the sonnets there is a thought that is well

                            highest excellence. There is an ideal statuesqueness embodied in the
                            person of St. Columba such as is felt to possess a powerful appeal to
                            the imagination. The poem embraces many passions, of which the most
                            tender and beautiful finds expression in the exquisite creation of the
                            radiant golden‐haired girl for whose love St. Oran breaks his vow of
                            chastity. But the really powerful contribution to our knowledge of
                            character which this book contains is fittingly centred in St. Oran
                            himself. A dramatic instinct of high order finds utterance in his
                            struggles between opposing passions. Nor are the metrical excellences of
                            the poem less conspicuous.... If one were in need of some single phrase
                            by which to denote the ultimate effect produced by this book, one might
                            say that it seems the most <emph>mature</emph> of all recent first

                            suggestiveness is obvious, and Miss Blind has proved herself equal to
                            the occasion. She has avoided writing anything approaching to a
                            ‘tendency poem.’ She metes out justice with an equal hand to all her
                            characters. The genuine enthusiasm and religious zeal of the monks are
                            set forth in language as inspired as is the final protest of St. Oran
                            against their narrow fanaticism; and one of the best passages in the
                            book is indeed the Sermon in which St. Columba announces the Gospel of

                            complete and beautiful. There is in the volume other work which shows a
                            master’s touch.... ”</q>

                        <q>“Miss Blind has produced one of the most noticeable and moving poems
                            which recent years have added to our shelves.... As a singer with a
                            message her attempt is praiseworthy, and her performance is fairly
                            self‐consistent. It is eminently homogeneous; the passion once felt, the
                            inspiration once obeyed, the well‐head pours forth its stream in a
                            strong and uniform current, which knows no pause until its impulse
                            ceases.... The story is pathetic at once in its simplicity and in its
                            terror.... We congratulate the author upon her boldness in choosing a
                            subject of our own time, fertile in what is pathetic, and free from any
                            taint of the vulgar and conventional. Poetry of late years has tended
                            too much towards motives of a merely fanciful and abstruse, sometimes a
                            plainly artificial, character; and we have had much of lyrical energy or
                            attraction, with little of the real marrow of human life, the flesh and
                            blood of man and woman. Positive subject‐matter, the emotion which
                            inheres in actual life, the very smile and the very tear and heart‐pang,
                            are, after all, precious to poetry, and we have them here. ‘The Heather
                            on Fire’ may possibly prove to be something of a new departure, and one
                            that was certainly not superfluous.”</q>

                            clearances which stain the history of Scotch landlordism. Though her
                            tale is a fiction it is too well founded on fact.... It may be said
                            generally of the poem that the most difficult scenes are those in which
                            Miss Blind succeeds best; and on the whole we are inclined to think that
                            its greatest and most surprising success is the picture of the poor old
                            soldier Rory driven mad by the burning of his wife. In his frenzy he
                            mixes up his old battles with the French and the descent of the

                            equally sincere and equally hearty; for it is a poem that is rich not
                            only in power and beauty but in that ‘enthusiasm of humanity’ which
                            stirs and moves us, and of which so much contemporary verse is almost
                            painfully deficient. Miss Blind does not possess her theme; she is
                            possessed by it, as was Mrs. Browning when she wrote‘Aurora Leigh.’...
                            We can best describe the kind of her success by noting the fact that
                            while engaged in the perusal of her book we do not say, ‘What a fine
                            poem!’ but ‘What a terrible story!’ or, more probably still, say nothing
                            at all, but read on and on under the spell of a great horror and an
                            over‐powering pity. Poetry of which this can be said needs no other
                            recommendation, and, therefore, we need not unduly lengthen our review

                            the Highlands of Scotland. It is a strange fact that the general reader
                            knows more about the siege of Troy, the Norman Conquest, and the Wars of
                            the Roses than about such matters in the very history of our own days as
                            the depopulation of the Highlands of Scotland by the landlords. The old
                            story comes to the front just now by reason of the crofter agitation. In

                            Miss Blind passes in review some of the facts of the eviction of the
                            Glen Sannox people by the Duke of Hamilton in 1832, where, as she

                                wilderness and gladdened the solitary places of the world, has come
                                with a curse to these Highland glens, and turned green pastures and

                            Accident brings him, one evening, to a frightened group of women, one of
                            whom has just been bitten by the tarantula, and, according to the
                            popular superstition, he is implored to play, in order to drive the

                            poetical in conception (save that it is not written in metre),
                            ‘Tarantella’ is more essentially a poem than many a narrative written in
                            smooth and elegant verse.... ‘Tarantella’ is indeed full of strange
                            originality and scenic effects of uncommon powers. The dance among the
                            ruins is not likely to be soon forgotten by the most unimaginative of
                            readers, and it is rarely, we think, that in an English novel the
                            psychology of the poetic temperament has been touched by a hand so
                            delicate and at the same time so strong.”</q>

                            flag for a single moment. Thus it is only when we have laid down the
                            final volume that we have time or inclination to pause and recognize the
                            care and art which have contributed to this triumphant result; to turn
                            back... and dwell on the author’s extraordinary knowledge of the human
                            heart—extraordinary alike for its depth and its range. As for the wit
                            and humour with which the book is freely sprinkled, the poetic and
                            artistic spirit which pervades it throughout, they can only be
                            appreciated on a second or a third perusal.”</q>

                            Ogotshka, and her almost magical transformation with interest. Mina, the
                            innocent girl, her friend, is well delineated, and Emanuel Sturm, the
                            wonderful violinist and composer, for whose portrait Paganini has

                            does not end there, however. The whole of the tale, which is divided
                            into forty‐six chapters, is permeated with features of an exceptionally
                            attractive description. Not the least noteworthy character of the story
                            is its novelty. Most of the incidents, which are carefully elaborated
                            and follow in logical sequence, are conspicuous for an airy freshness in
                            nature and treatment. Every chapter has its specific purpose, there

                            incidents of a more or less engrossing description. Continental scenes
                            and customs are described with freeness and perspicuity, and the varied
                            and eventful adventures of the principal characters, pleasingly typical,
                            it may be mentioned, of the romanticism invariably associated with

                        <q>“Miss Blind traces the ‘Ascent of Man’ through successive stages, until
                            first love, and then sorrow—which is love under another guise—lead us to
                            the highest conception of human life we can hope to reach. It is a
                            brave, sad, glorious story, told with inimitable skill, and as only a
                            poet who knows man’s heart, with its hopes, doubts, fears, aspirations,
                            could possibly tell it.... The other poems in the volume are as
                            excellent in their kind as those which give a title to it. The only
                            difference between them is that one series is rich with human
                            experience, and with the results of knowledge and of high thinking,
                            while the other is all aglow with the fresh delights of the outdoor
                            world. These delights find an almost perfect expression.... A reviewer
                            who is so fortunate as to light on a book like this, lays it down with
                            regret, and fears that he has not said of it all that it deserves should
                            be said. That is my feeling; and, lest I should have omitted any note of
                            praise that ought to be sounded, I should like to add, by way of
                            suggestion to all lovers of poetry—and I hope they are still many—that
                            here is truly a book that is worth the loving.”</q>

                            From Chaos to Kosmos she hurries her reader along, breathless and
                            perspiring perhaps, but never anxious to stop. We have known her book to
                            be read on the Underground Railway, and the reader to be so absorbed in
                            its contents as to be carried unawares several stations past his
                            destination.... Miss Blind’s gift of song is genuine, and her
                            imagination powerful.... When all is said and done, ‘The Ascent of Man’
                            remains a remarkable poem, and cannot fail to increase its author’s
                            reputation as a brilliant and original writer.”</q>

                            Blind’s poetic talent. Technically the verse‐workmanship is masterly;
                            the verse is sonorous and well balanced, the diction simple and
                            unaffected, and the style marked by the essential quality of
                            distinction.”</q>

                            miniature.... For indeed Miss Blind is pre‐eminently successful as a
                            writer of lyrics. In her lyrics she is ‘simple, sensuous, and
                            passionate:’ she catches at times the heart’s own rhythm in its
                            troubled, exquisite moments. Her best work gives one the impression of
                            having been lived: it has the impromptu of nature. And for this it
                            should be prized by those who value the simpler, deeper qualities of an
                            art which must needs be so close to nature.”</q>

                            that was to be expected from the author. When we put the book down we

                            the most poetical of the gifted authoress’s productions. Miss Blind’s
                            verse is not an echo, but an original voice of diverse tones. Among Miss
                            Blind’s many gifts is a rarely equalled gift of picturing the grandeur
                            of desolation, and this ‘Song of the Will’ is an instance of it.”</q>
