                <p>All poems occur as DIV0. Sonnets are attributed as "type=sonnets"; the rest are
                    "type=poem". All quotation marks, hyphens, dashes, apostrophes and colons have
                    been transcribed as entity references. All &lt;lg&gt; (line groups) are
                    attributed as cantos, stanzas, couplets, verse paragraphs, etc. All poems with
                    regularly indented lines use the attribute "rend" in the &lt;l&gt; tag,
                    with the value "indent1" for one tab stop, "indent2" for two tab stops, etc. All
                    split lines are attributed as "type=i" for the initial portion, and "type=f" for
                    the final portion.</p>
                <p>All apostrophes and single right quotation marks are encoded as

                    criticism in others, by one of the ablest pencils of the day. I improved it as
                    far as I was able according to those criticisms, and now I feel justified in
                    offering it to the world, as the best I can do; which if it fails to please,

                    <l>And in this dayâs nigh counted hours</l>
                    <l>Thou treadest the last time on flowârs,</l>
                    <l>Perchance thou neâer again must stray</l>
                    <l>Here where thy life has left a day,</l>
                    <l>Or not till years have rollâd along,</l>
                    <l>When dried thy heart, and mute thy song,</l>
                    <l>And thou no more, with darkenâd ken</l>
                    <l>Can see the valleyâs spirit then.</l>
                    <l>It may be too, that I can see</l>
                    <l>Some change or chance reservâd for thee;</l>
                    <l>The shifting scene of human life,</l>
                    <l>The night that ends its fitful strife;</l>
                    <l>The bliss or woe, the shade or bloom,</l>
                    <l>That lights a home, or delves a tomb.</l>
                    <l>But ask not, thoâ thine eyes illume</l>
                    <l>Eager to follow throâ the gloom;</l>
                    <l>For âtis thy mortal fate to go</l>
                    <l>Blindfold alike to joy and woe.</l>
                    <l>Farewell! the hours that here have fled,</l>
                    <l>The scenes wherein those hours were sped,</l>

                    <l>From the uncertain, dark, and vain.</l>
                    <l>And oft when life has nothing bright</l>
                    <l>Onward to lure Hopeâs ready sight,</l>
                    <l>Thy soul its thoughts will backward throw</l>
                    <l>To Shapes and Scenes of long ago;</l>
                    <l>And shutting out the present shade,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">Will to the sunny Past have flown;</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">Where pleasure has been, and is grown </l>

                    <l>He ceasâd, and waited not reply</l>
                    <l>Except my fixâd attentive eye;</l>
                    <l>On that, a quiet smile he cast,</l>
                    <l>Not joy, not grief, thoâ âtwas the last.</l>
                    <l>And still intent, I markâd the shade</l>

                    <l>And flowârs and trees behind appear;</l>
                    <l>In hue and outline bright and clear.</l>
                    <l>So much akin he was to air,</l>

                    <l>Scarce knew I when he melted there; </l>
                    <l>So like his form to flitting light, </l>
                    <l>It still seemed dazzling on my sight; </l>
                    <l>I lost him not in wood or stream, </l>
                    <l>He vanishâd not in cloud or beam; </l>
                    <l>No sound as thoâ he passâd was heard, </l>
                    <l>No rustling noise of garments stirrâd, </l>
                    <l>I saw him on his wonted stone, </l>
                    <l>Until the latest line was gone.â </l>
                    <l>The haunting spirit of the spot </l>
                    <l>Was viewless, but departed not.</l>
