                <head>PREFACE</head>
                <p>It would have been pleasing, indeed, to the author of this book had he been able
                    to sit dignifiedly in his study and have had a great literary success, such as
                    other authors enjoy, come upon him. But it would <hi rend="i">not</hi> come. The
                    mountain of success would <hi rend="i">not</hi> come to this poor, literary
                    Mahomet, and so he just had to get out and hustle after it. It was ever thus in
                    this particular life, and the author has begun to believe it is almost
                    providential. And as it is with everything the good Lord orders and directs, so
                    it was with this: It was the best thing after all, that could have happened.</p>
                <p>It use humiliating to a certain extent, to get out and show one&apos;s
                    friends the plans and specifications, of the forthcoming book; but this sense of
                    humiliation soon wore away, and a sense of delight--delight in meeting old
                    friends, and re-visiting old-time scenes--took its place.</p>
                <p>We are glad to present this book to our friends and patrons. It has many defects
                    and imperfectons--we grant it. But no poet has ever written with a more genuine
                    poetical inspiration--enthusiasm--thril--whatever you may be pleased to call
                    it--than has animated the writing of these pages. Some of the utterances may be
                    gross, some may be egotistical, there may be some in which we ride the pronoun
                    &quot;I&quot; too much, there may be others wherein we shall give
                    offense to the technical, the fastidious, the over-nice. But, in some instances,
                    if we have done anything we are sorry for, we are glad of it!</p>
                <p>There are some so-called experts in music who reject the grand, old songs of the
                    people because of their harmony and cadence They are very suspicious of anything
                    that thrills the soul and pleases the ear. What they affect, what they claim is,
                    the real thing in music, sounds about as well to the average ear as the <pb
                        n="6" id="VAA3923-009"/> harmony produced by &quot;a corn-stalk
                    fiddle&quot; and a &quot;shoe-string bow.&quot; And there is a class
                    of critics in literature of the same ilk. A Riley comes along and for thirty
                    years has to combat this same critical crowd, before they recognize his superb
                    singing. But when the common sense verdict of mankid, in spite of their clamor,
                    writes the seal of approval upon his greatness, then they are ready to out-Herod
                    Herod in doing him honor.</p>
                <p>We love this class of critics and we wouldn&apos;t dispose of them if we
                    could. They constitute a sort of &quot;thorn in the fiesh,&quot; and are
                    necessary to perfect our powers and lopp off our surplus egotism. But we have
                    written in conformity to &quot;the native feelings strong,&quot; in
                    response to our own enthusiasm, and if they like it, well and good. If not, we
                    might suggest that there is a place prepared for them from the foundation of the
                    world! Here we pause. We won&apos;t even tell them to go there!</p>
                <p>The author of this book believes that there can be no charge whatever of
                    plagiarsm placed against him. A person, who, as a school boy, has conned over
                    and committed to memory hundreds of poems until they have beome a very part of
                    himself, will unconsciously use these expressions at times. But we do desire to
                    say that the poem entitled &quot;Memories suggested, etc,&quot; owes
                    much of its merit to a beautiful little poem entitled &quot;A
                    Memory,&quot; by Orth Stemn, a southern writer.</p>

                    <lg>
                        <l>The little, old church down at Waldron,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">I remember it long ago;</l>
                        <l>I used to go there in the days gone by—</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l>I made a speech there in the eighties,</l>

                        <l>I'd wonderful idees o' savin' the world,</l>

                        <l rend="ti-2">And the efforts made by me,</l>
                        <l>Did about as much good as the woman,</l>

                        <l>I can't help o' thinkin', however,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Of the radiant dreams o' youth,</l>
                        <l>And it's pleasant, too, to remember,</l>

                        <l>The shallows and ripples of older days</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Are surrounding on every hand,</l>
                        <l>The mistakes of my life have been many,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">But a few of my days have been grand,</l>

                        <l rend="ti-2">And the zeal of a loyal heart,</l>
                        <l>I say in my soul: "Oh, Father above,</l>

                        <l>We never may know though we strive and we pray,</l>

                        <l>But the Father who gathers the harvest at last,</l>

                        <l rend="ti-2">For lo! the softer twilight hour is nigh;</l>
                        <l>Serene, I watch the silver dews of age</l>

                    <head>THE LESSON OF THE SPIDER.</head>
                    <lg>
                        <l>There was a spider crawled across my way,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">A big, fat, lazy fellow, too, was he,</l>
                        <l>With gold and yellow stripes as bright as day,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And glaring eyes and horrid jaws so free,</l>
                        <l>To catch and crush the happy-hearted fly;</l>
                        <l>"I'll walk upon that ugly thing!" said I.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>But yet I did not kill that creature mean,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">But went my way and let him wander, too,</l>
                        <l>And when the morning came with lustrous sheen,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">I rambled down that self-same path to view,</l>
                        <l>The day's bright welcome on the distant hill,</l>
                        <l>And let God's pure delights my spirit fill!</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>And then upon the elder bush I saw</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">A crystal palace builded in mid-air;</l>
                        <l>With many glistening ropes each part did draw,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And lo, a spider king enthroned was there,</l>
                        <l>The abject creature that the day before</l>
                        <l>I thought to tread upon and hated sore!</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>And then I came to know that very oft</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">God's giant kings in modest stations start;</l>
                        <l>Sometimes a genius in a humble loft,</l>

                        <l>And with such knowledge in his mighty brain,</l>

                        proposed "Golden Highway" or "Golden Road" by reading the plans promulgated
                        by Mr. John A. Tindall, the <pb n="30" id="VAA3923-036"/>well-known attorney
                        of Shelbyville, whose scheme to plant trees on each side of the old
                        Norristown Pike has been the subject of considerable comment both in the
                        local papers and those elsewhere. This road is ever dear to the memory of
                        the author. He lived along the same from his fifth to fifteenth year, and,
                        boylike, knew every foot of it. Some of his boyhood's happiest associations
                        are staged, if we may so speak, along this old highway.]</p>

                    <head>THAT RAT STORY</head>
                    <p>Our Friend and Fellow Scribler, Alonzo Leora Rice, of most pleasant and
                        entertaining memory, had a most uncanny experience with a Rat. Indeed, it
                        was a thriller! He went out into the barn, it would seem, "to run a bluff"
                        on some work he had to do there, and became engaged in some sort of a
                        controversy with ye pesky rodent. And the latter, whether attacking or
                        seeking refuge, we know not, with great precipitancy and suddenness, ran up
                        the Bard's pant's leg!!</p>
                    <p>'Lonzo clutched madly at the creature at the knee "going up," and, again, at
                        the groin, but he slipped behind Mr. Rice's large and plethoric pocketbook,
                        and cavorted around into the lumbar regions, popularly known as "the small
                        of back." Here he "dug in," or it seemed so to the poet, as the Germans
                        might say, and prepared to resist any and all attempts at dislodgment.
                        'Lonzo made a few desultory and disorganized efforts to dislocate the
                        creature, but found he could reach him neither from above nor below, so he,
                        not the Rat, but the Bard, suddenly became panic-stricken, and with a mad,
                        abandoned yell, true poetic frenzy showing, fled, carrying the enemy and his
                        fortifications with him!! He rushed into the presence of his better half,
                        imploring help in iambic and trochaic polysyllables!!! And when his kind
                        consort had removed all of the garments that concealed, as was supposed, the
                        awful <hi rend="i">Mus decumanus</hi> (though that wasn't what 'Lonzo called
                        him, the word he used was fully as severe, however) had absolutely
                        disappeared. The terrible, palpitating yell, the precipitate departure or
                        something had disposed of the rodent. However, the marks were there to show
                        for themselves and a few Male Persons were permitted to make an examination
                        in order to sustain 'Lonzo's previous good reputation for truth and
                        veracity! And the poet says the marks have not left his imagination yet!
                        And, somehow or other, the story got into print, and that aroused the verses
                        to be found on the opposite page.</p>
                    <p>And yet, Mr. Rice calmly informed the reporter that while this exciting event
                        was happening, he was thinking of what a fine poem he could make of it!</p>

                    <head>THE ELECTRIC LIGHT BUG.</head>
                    <p>Mr. They Say, a particular friend of the author—possibly you know
                        him?—informs me that there is a large, scavenger, water beetle, which has
                        also the capacity of living on land, and, being provided with wings, is able
                        to fly. Before the advent of the electric light, this creature was so
                        infrequently found, that it was rarely ever noted by scientists. Since the
                        establishment of our present systems of lighting for towns and villages the
                        insect has become so abundant that it has received the name of the "Electric
                        Light Bug."</p>
                    <p>Mr. T. S. further informs me that this brilliant illumination has such a
                        weird fascination for the beetle that as soon as it begins to gleam through
                        the darkness, Sir E. L. Bug leaves his native habitat, the pond, climbs up
                        the stem of a sweet flag, and stretching his uncouth wings, sets sail for
                        the wonderful attraction at once.</p>
                    <p>This beautiful story has not as yet received the scientific approval. The
                        author sent a sketch of it to the Scientific American, and the article was
                        returned with simply a ? after it. Now, that doesn't say it isn't true, does
                        it? At any rate it is so delightful to put a little poetical inspiration
                        into a poor bug's head, that I prefer to use it!</p>
                    <p>Since writing the above, the author has found at least one competent
                        scientist, Prof. D. A. Owen, of Franklin, who corroborates the scientific
                        accuracy of the statements given.</p>

                        <l>There's an insect that lives in the water,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">But dwells quite as well on the land,</l>
                        <l>Where he spreads his dull wings in the evening</l>

                    <head>SAINT'S REST ON BRANDYWINE.</head>
                    <p>The little village of Fairland nestles in an artificial valley; for when you
                        approach it from the east, your traction car climbs a tall hill built by man
                        over the New York Central Lines, and you gaze down upon its quiet and
                        home-like domain. It was once a place that sported a "doggery" or two, and
                        then there was some immorality and law-breaking, and then it was that some
                        ingenious wit gave the village the name of Saint's Rest, and the sobriquet
                        has stuck. The wit, some say, was our old friend, T. B. Carey, and it's very
                        much like him. Since this whilom christening, the good people have made a
                        united effort and got rid of the "doggeries" and it has become a place "made
                        of all sweet accord." The now classical Brandywine runs hard by this
                        village.</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l>I wandered down the valley</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">From the lofty traction height,</l>
                        <l>And gazed around the prim, old town</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">With spirits clear and bright;</l>
                        <l>But one thing struck me, neighbor,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">As being rare and fine:</l>
                        <l>I've heard of Saints on manna fed,</l>

                        <l>But one thing still impressed me:</l>

                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Then I think of the days departed,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">The first time I heard the old song,</l>
                        <l>I sat on the knee of my father,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">A little chap, sturdy and strong.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>And he, in the full prime of manhood,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">With resonant voice strong and clear,</l>
                        <l>Sang the words of the old-time ballad,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">His voice and his tone I yet hear.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>I've heard since the music of masters</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Where gathered the worshipful throng,</l>
                        <l>But naught was to me e'er so lovely</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">As was then that simple, old song.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>He sang with no voice of rare culture,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Scant knowledge of music had he,</l>
                        <l>But then he was greatest of all men.</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And sweetest of singers—to me!</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Long, long has my dear father slumbered</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">'Neath the grass-covered mound on the hill,</l>
                        <l>And yet, from a silence unbroken,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">He speaks and he sings to me still.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>And ofttimes when quiet enfolds me,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">I could hear a pin strike the floor,</l>
                        <l>I can see him and hear him yet singing,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">As he sang in the days of the yore!</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>And I sing with the tear-drops soft flowing—</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">It is dusk and sweetheart can't see,</l>
                        <l>And I trust when she sings to her children</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">She will tenderly think then of me!</l>

                    <head>THE TREE-FROG EXAMPLE.</head>
                    <p>(These lines were written in reply to some verses written by Harold Knox

                        <l>My dear H. K., I'm sorry that,</l>
                        <l>I've got the "bob-tailed flush" so pat,</l>
                        <l>That ev'ry time I'd draw a spade</l>
                        <l>The queen of clubs appears—the jade!</l>
                        <l>For twenty years I've sat and toyed,</l>
                        <l>And drawn my cards—heart overjoyed.</l>
                        <l>But when I did my hand survey,</l>
                        <l>'T would be "bob-tailed"—no other way!</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>I've hammered like an Ajax strong;</l>
                        <l>I've hollered down the rain bar'l long;</l>
                        <l>And yet I must confess in truth,</l>
                        <l>I've failed to write in age or youth,</l>
                        <l>As well as Charlie sitting there</l>
                        <l>Who wrote the Knighthood fancies rare!</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>"There's many poets who've never penned,"</l>
                        <l>So Byron wrote—he must have kenned,</l>
                        <l>The best they had within their pates—</l>
                        <l>Perhaps, that fact to me relates.</l>
                        <l>At any rate, I must concede,</l>
                        <l>I've not grown great with startling speed!</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l>And yet, like Riley's Tree Frog bold—</l>
                        <l>You've heard how well the story's told—</l>
                        <l>That hollered morns and noons and eves,</l>
                        <l>And then at night rolled up his sleeves,</l>
                        <l>Spit on his hands—I may so speak!—</l>
                        <l>And hollered through the long night bleak!</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>And then a voice, as if in pain:</l>
                        <l>"If you'll jist hush, why, then I'll rain!"</l>
                        <l>And like the frog, dear Harold K.,</l>
                        <l>I'll holler, holler night and day,</l>
                        <l>And fair Success, to save the din,</l>
                        <l>Will have to crown me winner then!</l>

                        <l rend="ti-2">In God's rare, old vineyard place,</l>
                        <l>Happy and busy forever were we,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">As our lives ran on apace.</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l>But the hand of a heavier burden</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Fell alone on humble me,</l>
                        <l>And I like the prodigal son of old</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Left home so happy and free.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>And I wandered out among strangers</l>

                        <l>And I found there who scarcely would know me,</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l>On the anvil of fate God placed poor me,</l>

                        <l rend="ti-2">I learned all there was in scorn,</l>
                        <l>And I learned what it was to be doubted</l>

                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>But I learned that this earth-life is hollow,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">I learned that its trust is untrue,</l>

                        <l>Last they came with whispers shrill,</l>

                    <head>MEMORIES.</head>
                    <p>Suggested when revisiting Forest Hill Cemetery, Sunday, May 30, 1915, after
                        an absence of more than twenty years.</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Last Sabbath I walked down the highways</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And streets of my native town;</l>
                        <l>Two long decades since have flitted</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Its alleys and by-ways adown.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>In my ramble this early morning</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">With the freshness and breath of the dew;</l>
                        <l>I went with the throngs to the suburbs</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Where they scattered the flowers anew.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>I saw them, the sorrowing people,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">As they came to the burial ground,</l>
                        <l>With flowers and garlands in number</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And I knew in each heart was a wound!</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>And I thought of the days long departed,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">When I walked down these streets heretofore,</l>
                        <l>How many I then gladly greeted</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Have passed to the echoless shore!</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>And it seemed that the old days reverted,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And the throngs now lying so still,</l>
                        <l>Came forth from their dark, narrow chambers</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">With motion and living a-thrill!</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>The laughter I heard in my boyhood,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">The songs that were dear to my soul,</l>
                        <l>Came blessing the hours of the morning</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">As its moments began to unroll!</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>There were sorrows so long since forgotten,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">That returned with their sting and their pain;</l>
                        <l>There were wasted ambitions and longings,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">That came crowding in memory's train!</l>

                        <l>How precious, oh, God, can I measure,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Though they came with a pain and a smart,</l>
                        <l>Where these delicate wraiths of the bye-gones</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">That came surging back into my heart!</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Yet I said: Though they come and they taunt me</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Till the tears fall in generous rain,</l>
                        <l>I shall welcome, yes, kindly bid welcome</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">These forms and these faces again!</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Though quickly they rise and they vanish,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Like a phantom but dimly revealed;</l>
                        <l>Though they bring back a pang and a sorrow,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And show me a wound partly healed!</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l>I have ships that went to sea</l>
                        <l>In the days of infancy;</l>
                        <l>On the booming ocean wide,</l>
                        <l>Still, perhaps, the waves they ride;</l>
                        <l>Long ago, my hopes were lost</l>
                        <l>In these vessels, tempest tossed!</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Other ships have I that weighed</l>
                        <l>Anchor when my boyhood stayed;</l>
                        <l>Gone are they from sight and ken,</l>
                        <l>Ne'er, may be, to come again;</l>
                        <l>Lost upon the trackless deep</l>
                        <l>Where the ocean's tempests sweep!</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Then in later, saner years</l>
                        <l>Ships I launched in doubts and fears;</l>
                        <l>Better, more sea-worthy craft</l>
                        <l>Out I sent where wild waves laughed;</l>
                        <l>From a far-off, distant scope,</l>
                        <l>Tidings come that bid me hope!</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l>And I sometimes laugh and say.</l>

                        <l>Should within my harbor rage</l>
                        <l>Rage and chafe against the quay,</l>
                        <l>What would all that mean to me?</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l>"They'd bring me wives I dare not own,</l>

                        <l>They'd bring me lives I could not live,</l>
                        <l>And pray that God such lives forgive;</l>
                        <l>A pirate king I wished to be</l>

                    <p>John J. Wingate, who recently celebrated his seventy-seventh birthday
                        anniversary, may well be styled "The Printer Emeritus of Shelbyville." He
                        has been connected with the papers of "Old Shelby" since the time "Whereof
                        the memory of man run-neth not to the contrary." This can be truly said of
                        John J. Wingate in all of his dealings with the people around him: "He

                    <head>WILLIAM C. MORRISON.</head>
                    <p>There was a newspaper published away down in Texas, called the <hi rend="i"
                            >Rosenberg Herald</hi>. It was a great friend of the author though
                        published so far away. It appeared to be a case of spontaneous admiration.
                        Its editor would copy the author's productions that appeared in the public
                        press and herald them to its readers with great enthusiasm. In the midst of
                        the many jolts that a man who essays to write verse gets anyway, our Texas
                        friend would always come up smiling with a word of cheer. We learned to love
                        him, and count on his weekly message as the words of a sure friend who never
                        faltered and who never grew cold.</p>
                    <p>We noticed his name was Morrison, but what of that? One day we wrote him a
                        letter thanking him for his kindly and loyal support. In a few days his
                        reply came, and then we found that he was a Shelby county product, like unto
                        ourself, that he was one of two sons of a family of thirteen children of our
                        old classmates and friends, Harry C. Morrison and Laura Ray Morrison of
                        Shelbyville, and that he had been booming us because he felt that nearness
                        and kinship which dear, old associations give. In other words, the "Heart
                        Echoes from Old Shelby" stirred within him.</p>
                    <p>So as a compliment to him and to his paper alone, we wrote the poem, "If You
                        Knew" and sent it to him and he published it. It has never been submitted to
                        any other paper before or since.</p>
                    <p>But the saddest thing remains yet to be told: This brilliant, young man, our
                        friend, has since the events above narrated, sickened and died. Such a
                        lovely character, coming out of such a worthy home, so beloved and with such
                        a prospect before him, with the glory of the dawn almost still shining in
                        the clouds, "dropped into that dreamless sleep, that kisses down the eyelids
                        still !"</p>

                                        instant, enclosing a poem entitled "Ye Sage of Menlo," which
                                        I have read with a great deal of interest and gratification.
                                        I do not see any objection to your publishing the poem if
                                        you see fit to do so.</p>

                    <head>TO CHARLES MAJOR.</head>
                    <p>(The following lines were written January the first, 1909. A copy of the same
                        was sent to Mr. Major who was then living at Shelbyville. He responded
                        immediately with words of the most sincere thankfulness, but asked that the
                        poem be not printed at that time, but held as an expression of love and
                        sympathy between old friends. The author feels that "Heart Echoes from Old
                        Shelby" would not be complete without some reference to this sweet and
                        gentle genius who has passed away. And what could be more appropriate than a
                        message of appreciation given long before his death, and which he sincerely
                        enjoyed?)</p>

                        <l>The Watchman is old, his eyes grow dim,</l>

                    <head>THE OLD CHOIR.</head>
                    <p>(Some ten or twelve years ago, the Franklin, Indiana, M. E. church choir was
                        one of the best in Indiana. Its leader was Senator L. E. Slack, now United
                        States District Attorney, and a politician of note. Among its members were
                        Anna Laura Johnson, a very famous soprano; Mrs. Clara Hannaman, of the
                        Woman's College, Baltimore; Mrs. Daisy Strickler Lacy, now of Missouri, and
                        a number of others. This choir has long been abandoned and another has taken
                        its place. Recently there was a "home coming" in old Franklin, and the "Old
                        Choir" was gotten together. And the people were delightfully entertained by
                        their singing. That occasion has furnished the theme for this poem.)</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l>From eastern seaboard and western plain</l>
                        <l>The "Old Choir" members came home again,</l>
                        <l>And sang with sweetness and hearts aglow</l>
                        <l>The dear old songs that they used to know;</l>
                        <l>And mine eyes grew moist though not with pain—</l>
                        <l>'Twas the patter of memory's sad, sweet rain,</l>
                        <l>That came with the clouds and the sunshine clear,</l>
                        <l>That we used to love in a bye-gone year!</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>And I sat in tears, a lump in my throat,</l>
                        <l>As the old choir sang again note upon note,</l>
                        <l>And it seemed to me that each old time score</l>
                        <l>Sounded far better than ever before;</l>
                        <l>And the dear, sweet faces and silvery hair</l>
                        <l>Appeared to me never before so fair,</l>
                        <l>And I wished I could sit in a way back seat,</l>
                        <l>And hear 'em forever, it was so sweet!</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>And I prophesy now, though I'm not a seer</l>
                        <l>And the prophecy brings me a smile and a tear,</l>
                        <l>That each dear member at calling o' roll</l>
                        <l>Will find a way home to the heavenly goal,</l>
                        <l>And sing for aye in that grand, new choir</l>
                        <l>With an old-time faith but a new-born fire;</l>
                        <l>And the dear, old past, may it join a hand</l>
                        <l>With the golden future—at God's command!</l>

                    <head>A MODEL CRITICISM.</head>
                    <p>It's a good, old rule, the golden rule; "Whatsoever ye would that men should
                        do unto you, do ye even so to them." We offer this model criticism as a
                        suggestion to that tribe of dawpluckers who shall follow after the
                        publication of "Heart Echoes from Old Shelby." The selection we shall take
                        is from the pen of Mr. T. B. Garey, better known as "Gid," long time
                        paragrapher, wit and homely philosopher. Not only all these, but a poet, as
                        we shall show. We shall use but one short selection from his pen, as
                        follows:</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l>"I once possessed a Thomas cat,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">That warbled like Caruso;</l>
                        <l>A boarder threw a baseball bat;</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Now Thomas doesn't do so!"</l>
                    </lg>
                    <p>The basis of our criticism is just and kind, namely: We resolve all doubts in
                        favor of the poet. We shall concede at once that "Gid" actually possessed
                        such a feline. Though a trifle singular, we shall likewise admit that it or
                        he possessed the capacity of "warbling" like the sublime Italian tenor.</p>
                    <p>Of course, no details are given respecting any boarding house, nor how a
                        "boarder" plain and simple happened upon the scene at this unauspicious
                        interval. "Gid" barely gives us a skeleton, and leaves all the rest to our
                        own fertile imaginations! Happy thought! Felicitous faculty!</p>
                    <p>Then again, he leaves us in the dark as to whether Mr. Thomas Cat was struck
                        by the bat or simply frightened. Wise discretion! Members of the S. P. C. A.
                        are thus left undisturbed. To them, the bat simply struck the fenee
                        whereupon Thomas "warbled," and frightened him out of every note. But to us
                        who have suffered sleepless nights caused by Thomas' "warbling," we can
                        conjure up thoughts of complete annihilation, and they fill our mad,
                        abandoned souls with a savage, exultant joy! Ah "Gid," what a diplomat thou
                        art!</p>
                    <p>And then the conclusion, sublime from its very simplicity:</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l>"Now, Thomas doesn't do so!"</l>

                    <p>The old master could take his brush and with a few touches of color portray
                        the widest range of human passion, and so does "Gid," with just five short,
                        simple words, he lays before us a pen picture vivid in detail to the last

                    <p>In short, we conclude, agreeably to pur system of criticism, that the verse
                        is perfect in every detail, and we insert it in "our" book even at the risk
                        of placing another on the proud pedestal we had hoped to occupy. Moreover,
                        to show you how broad and unenvious we are toward our rivals, we insert
                        "Gid's" picture in his best "bib and tucker," so to speak, for the
                        edification of our readers.</p>

                    <head>THE OLD DEBATING CLUB.</head>
                    <p>(During the latter part of the seventies and the earlier eighties, at the
                        Morrison school house, two or three miles south of Shelbyville, in Shelby
                        township, there flourished a famous debating club. The colder the weather,
                        the deeper the snow, the wilder the wind, the better the people attended.
                        Many men since successful in the various walks of life were among its
                        members. Judge Joseph W. Thompson, the famous law book writer; Ed K. Adams,
                        David L. Wilson, prominent lawyers, were among the number of those who
                        attended its sessions. Some used good English, some bad, some none at all,
                        but "everything went." The club was democratic from the ground up, no
                        supercilious nabobs went there. A large number, both members and attendants,
                        have since gone over "the Great Divide.")</p>

                    <head>FACES OF THE YESTER YEARS.</head>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Way down in Shelby county is the place where I was born;</l>
                        <l>The sun, it seems, shines clearer there and taller grows the corn;</l>
                        <l>My early days in clear relief stand clearly cut and bold</l>
                        <l>As clouds against the evening sky all tinted up with gold!</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>I can see those scenes o' long ago,in life's sweet, precious morn,</l>
                        <l>When the roses all were bloomin' fair and hidden ev'ry thorn;</l>
                        <l>When I walked the earth with boundless faith in youth's brave fancies
                            free,</l>
                        <l>And all of life's bright vagaries seemed beckoning to me!</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>There flowed the stream close by my home, the sun reflecting far</l>
                        <l>Like bridal gown, with diamonds decked, in orient bazaar;</l>
                        <l>The trees were green and shaded o'er where birds in joyous mirth,</l>
                        <l>Sent forth their anthems to the day announcing love on earth!</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>And then the old school houses and the benches and all that,</l>
                        <l>And the teachers of those olden days who taught me "ba-ty", bat;</l>
                        <l>There was one named "Billy" Conner who was courtin' then and there</l>
                        <l>Of as sweet a little lady as had ever breathed the air!</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>In the lull of recitations that would come the foll'wing day,</l>
                        <l>The teacher to himself would smile and then we kids would say:</l>
                        <l>"He's thinkin' of Mahaly, 'cause he loves her awful well;</l>
                        <l>Right soon they're goin' to marry—that's what the gossips tell."</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Poor "Billy's" long since passed away, and sweet Mahaly, too;</l>
                        <l>How beautiful were both their lives in pattern good and true;</l>
                        <l>And thus in rainbow shadows flit the dreams of long ago;</l>
                        <l>But still I love to think them o'er and shed a tear or so!</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>And then the girls I used to love—my wife's not standing near?—</l>
                        <l>There was full a half a dozen and each one passing dear;</l>
                        <l>There was one with flaxen ringlets and a dainty, turned-up nose,</l>
                        <l>And her cheeks, in memory's picture, seem as red as any rose;</l>

                        <l>She'd come to school barefooted, and 't was pantalettes she wore—</l>
                        <l>They're clean gone out of fashion, p'raps, to come back nevermore!</l>
                        <l>But I tell ye girls and women, if men's hearts are like my own,</l>
                        <l>When I was but a little boy and only partly grown,</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Just to dress a little daisy as was dressed my Katie dear,</l>
                        <l>And put on 'broidered pantalettes—'t would beat the costliest gear!</l>
                        <l>I don't know where my Katie is, some forty years have flown;</l>
                        <l>The love that once so thrilled my heart has long since been unknown;</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>And other loves and passions have thronged into my life;</l>
                        <l>(I've got to use some caution, since another is my wife!)</l>
                        <l>But I might say, <hi rend="i">she</hi> not hearing, had I never met the
                            dear,</l>
                        <l>I might have loved sweet Katie through many a passing year!</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Ah, these pictures flit before me like the pictures on a screen</l>
                        <l>With their old-time dash and color, long the shifting years between,</l>
                        <l>And I sit in life's calm evening, while the light burns dim and low,</l>
                        <l>And watch their dear, sweet faces as they softly come and go!</l>

                        <l>Her pastor there, with voice subdued and low,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Among God's saints he prayed she might be found;</l>
                        <l>Then voices joined in singing sweet and soft,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">"Thou lover of my soul," this was the strain,</l>
                        <l>And as the precious thought was borne aloft,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">The suff'rer from death's stupor raised again.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>And with a voice as rich and sweetly clear,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">As when she sang to me in childhood's day,</l>
                        <l>And I upon her knee was wont to hear,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">She joined the singing of that old-time lay;</l>
                        <l>"Into thy haven guide!" 'twas thus she sang,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">"And, oh, my soul receive at last !" her prayer;</l>
                        <l>How grandly through my soul the music rang,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">It seemed a burst of angel song were there!</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l>And with a smile of radiant sweetness she</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Passed on from earth to stand before God's throne!</l>
                        <l>Lo, I since then have sailed life's fitful sea,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Ofttimes by waves and stormy winds o'er blown,</l>
                        <l>And question when the tide rolls wild and high</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Shall I the haven make or helm far wrong?</l>
                        <l>But of my mother doubt nor question I—</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">She went to heaven singing that blessed song!</l>

                    <head>THE VISIONS OF A DAY IN JUNE.</head>
                    <lg>
                        <l>Oh, the June-tide brings me visions</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Of a former, happy day,</l>
                        <l>When I walked in artless boyhood</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Down along life's rosy way;</l>
                        <l>Then it seems the sun shone fairer</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And the air was far more sweet,</l>
                        <l>When the day bloomed forth in glory</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">As it came my youth to greet!</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>I can feel again the rapture</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Of those far-off, sunny days</l>
                        <l>When the heat goes waving upward</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">In a distant, dreamy haze;</l>
                        <l>From the cornfields and the meadows,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">The woods and pointing spire</l>
                        <l>I can see the sun's reflection</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Like a gleam of golden fire!</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>And the highways and the hedges</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Where the roses and the Lind</l>
                        <l>Give a breath of dainty odor</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Borne away on every wind,</l>
                        <l>There the birds are chanting loudly,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And the bee's dull, sturdy hum</l>
                        <l>Keeps the time of pulsing nature</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Like the beating of a drum!</l>
