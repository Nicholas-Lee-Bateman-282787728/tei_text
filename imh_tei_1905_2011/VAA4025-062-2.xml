            <p>Baynard Rush Hall, author of <hi rend="i">The New Purchase: Or, Seven and a Half Years in the Far
                        West</hi>, was both an astute observer and active participant in Indiana pioneer life.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Born in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1793, he worked for a time as a printer and then, after graduation from Union
                    College and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName> Theological Seminary, became a Presbyterian minister. Through his printing activities
                    he had learned of William Henry Harrison, the Battle of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>, and other events associated with the western aspects of the War of 1812 and he became
                    interested in the West. Acting upon that interest he moved his family to Indiana about 1823 and
                    lived for a year or so with relatives near Gosport. Although he did some preaching in the area, Hall
                    perhaps entertained hopes of being selected to the faculty of the Indiana State Seminary, chartered
                    in 1820.</p>
            <p>When the seminary opened, about 1825, Hall became its principal and only professor, charged with the
                    teaching of Greek and Latin to a handful of young men. He remained the seminary's sole
                    teacher until 1827 when John Hopkins Harney of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> joined the faculty as professor of mathematics and natural philosophy. The following
                    year the general assembly renamed the institution Indiana College, and in 1829 Andrew Wylie, who had
                    been president of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> College in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, became its first president. Wylie and Harney were soon combatants in a faculty
                    "fight" which resulted in Harney's dismissal. Meanwhile Hall also became
                    dissatisfied with Wylie's actions, resigned his position, and returned to the East where,
                    before his death in 1863, he continued his religious and educational interests.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The New Purchase</hi>, written under the pen name of Robert Carlton, first appeared in
                    1843, somewhat over a decade after Hall's resignation from Indiana College. A condensed
                    version, in which Hall's sometimes blatant criticism of President Wylie was softened,
                    appeared in 1855; and James A. Woodburn, retaining "the original copy without modification

                    Indiana's centennial year.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Judge David D. Banta, himself one of the
                    best historians concerning early Indiana, termed the work "the best and truest history of
                    pioneer life and pioneer surroundings in Indiana that can anywhere be found."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Although the characters and places are generally fictionalized, the material in the book
                    is more history and autobiography than fiction. The title was derived from the New Purchase Treaty
                    of 1818 by which the Indian claims to nearly all of the vast and fertile central region of Indiana
                    were cleared.</p>
            <p>The two chapters which follow offer interesting samples from the book. The first is Hall's
                    warm and appreciative tribute to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s pioneer blacksmith and master craftsman Austin W. Seward. No paraphrasing
                    could do justice to his portrait of Seward who served as blacksmith, rifle-maker, marksman, artist,
                    and musician in a frontier community. The second selection presents a vivid and light-hearted
                    account of the once abundant but now extinct passenger pigeons. Both accounts are interlaced with
                    comments and observations which interpret pioneer life.</p>
            <p>Since Hall makes many references to rifles and shotguns, a brief description of the type of guns
                    mentioned and their operation seems worthwhile. The basic weapon of the period was the
                    muzzle-loading rifle. To load it, the shooter placed the butt of the gun on the ground and poured a
                    measured amount of powder into the barrel. Next he took a piece of oiled cloth or
                    "patch," placed it over the muzzle with a round ball on top, and then pushed them
                    down the barrel with his ramrod. He "primed" the gun by pouring a small quantity
                    of powder into the flashpan. When the trigger was pulled, the hammer, with a piece of flint firmly
                    clamped in its jaws, struck a steel plate creating sparks which ignited the powder in the flashpan,
                    thereby setting off the main powder charge in the barrel.</p>
            <p>The shotgun worked on the same principle as the rifle, but instead of a single bullet it used
                    shot—several chunks of lead—which, after leaving the barrel, sprayed the
                    target and so gave the shooter a greater advantage, especially when hunting birds or small game. At
                    the time Hall was a resident in the New Purchase, shotguns were still novelty items, probably the
                    best and most practical ones being those manufactured by Joseph Manton, an English gunsmith.</p>

                    of a blacksmith's shop; and, many a time in passing one, do I pause and steal a glance

                    <pb n="104" id="VAA4025-062-2-008"/> assume the form and look of my lame friend!—for he
                    was lame from a wound in his thigh received in early life. Oh! how more than willing would I stand
                    once more and blow his bellows to help him gain time for an evening's hunt, could I but see
                    anew that honest charcoal face and that noble soul speaking from those eyes, as he rested a moment
                    to talk till his iron arrived at the proper heat and colour!</p>
            <p>But let none suppose Vulcanus Allheart was a common blacksmith. He was master both of the science and
                    the art, from the nailing of a horse-shoe up to the making of an axe; and to do either right, and
                    specially the latter, is a rare attainment. Not one in a million could make an axe as Allheart made
                    it; and hence in a wooden country, where life, civilization, and Christianity itself, are so
                    dependent on the axe, my blacksmith was truly a jewel of a man. His axes, even where silver was
                    hoarded as a miser's gold, brought, in real cash, one dollar beyond any patent flashy
                    affairs from New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, done up in pine boxes and painted half black, while their edge part was polished and
                    shiney as a new razor—and like that article, made not to <hi rend="i">shave</hi> but to
                        <hi rend="i">sett</hi>; and all this his axes commanded, spite of the universal nation,
                    all-powerful and tricky as it is. No man in the Union could temper steel as my friend tempered; and
                    workmen from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Birmingham</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Sheffield, who sometimes wandered to us from the world beyond the ocean, were
                    amazed to find a man in the Purchase that knew and practised their own secrets.</p>
            <p>Necessity led him to attempt one thing and another out of his line, till, to accommodate neighbours,
                    (and any man was <hi rend="i">his</hi> neighbour) he made sickles, locks and keys, augurs, adzes,
                    chisels, planes, in short, any thing for making which are used iron and steel. His fame consequently
                    extended gradually over the West two hundred miles at least in any direction; for from that distance
                    came people to have well done at Woodville, what otherwise must have been done, or a sort of done,
                    at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Nay, liberal offers were made to Allheart to induce him to remove to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>; but he loved us too much to accept them; and beside, he was daily becoming richer,
                    having made a very remarkable discovery, which, however, he used to impart to others for a
                    consideration—viz. he had found out the curious art of beating iron into gold. My friend
                    was indeed the great "Lyon" of the West.<hi rend="sup">∗</hi>

            <p>Mr. Allheart's skill was great also in rifle-making, and also naturally enough in
                    rifle-shooting. I have compared <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Eastern and Down-eastern rifles with his, (for the one concealed in my chamber is a
                    present from Allheart,) but none are so true, and none have sights that will permit the drawing of a
                    bead so smooth and round. Does any maker doubt this? Grant me three months to regain my former
                    skill, and I stake my rifle against all you have on hand, that she beats the things, one and all,
                    eighty-five yards off-hand—or (as I shall only give back your articles) I'll try
                    you for the fun and glory alone! By the way, do you shoot with both eyes open? If not, let me
                    commend the practice, both from its superiority and because it may save you from killing your own
                    wife, as it did Mr. Allheart once.</p>
            <p>He excelled, we have intimated, as a marksman. Perhaps in horizontal shooting he could not have a
                    superior; for in his hands the rifle was motionless as if screwed in one of his vices; and thence
                    would deliver ball after ball at fifty, sixty, or seventy yards, into one and the same augur hole.
                    For him <hi rend="i">missing</hi> was even difficult; and all I had ever heard of splitting bullets
                    on the edge of axe or knife, hitting tenpenny nails on the head, and so forth, was accomplished by
                    Allheart. And his sight had become like that of the lynx; for at the crack of the gun he would
                    himself call out where the ball had struck. Nor is all this so wonderful if we recollect that many
                    years in proving rifles he practised daily; indeed target-shooting was a branch of his
                    business—and in it his skill became rare, ay! even bewitching!</p>
            <p>His place for making these daily trials was at first a large stump some seventy yards distant on the
                    far side of a hollow, against which stump was fixed his target; and along that ravine his wife, a
                    pretty young woman, used to pass and repass to get water from a spring at the lower end. Her almost
                    miraculous escape in that ravine I shall give in Mr. Allheart's own words, although his
                    idiom was slightly inaccurate and provincial.</p>
            <p>"You say, why can't we shoot across the holler agin that ole walnut stump yander? I
                    ain't pinted a rifle across thare for four year—and never intend to no
                    more."</p>
            <p>"Why so, Vulcanus? I'm sure 'tis a capital place for our mark."</p>
            <p>"Well, Mr. Carlton, I'll tell you, and then you wont wonder. One day, about six
                    months after we was furst <pb n="106" id="VAA4025-062-2-010"/> married, I had a powerful big bore<hi rend="sup">∗</hi> to fix for a feller going out West; and so I sit down just
                    here—(at the shop door) — to take it with a rest agin a clap-board standing
                    before that stump, and where I always before tried our guns. I sit down, as I sort a suspicioned the
                    hind sight mought be a lettle too fur to the right, and I wanted to shoot furst with allowance, and
                    then plump at the centre without no allowance—and then to try two shots afterwards
                    off-hand. Well, I got all fixed, and was jeest drawing a fine bead, and had my finger actially
                    forrard of the front triggur—(and she went powerful easy) — and was a holdin
                    my breath—when something darkened the sight, and my left eye ketch'd a glimpse
                    of something atween me and the dimind—and I sort a raised up my head so—and
                    there was Molly's head (Mrs. Allheart's)—with the bucket in her hand a
                    goin for water! She pass'd you know in a instant, almost afore I could throw up the muzzle;
                    but, Mr. Carlton, if I hadn't a had both eyes open or no presence of mind, she'd a
                    been killed to a dead certainty! I unsot the triggurs and went right in; and for more nor two hours
                    my hand trembled so powerful I couldn't hold a hammer or use a file. And that's
                    the reason I never fired across to that ole stump since, and why I never will agin."</p>
            <p>But another reason for shooting with both eyes open is, that a curious experiment in optics cannot
                    conveniently be made with one eye closed—an experiment taught me by Mr. Allheart. And
                    hence I would now commend both our book and the experiment to all spectacle-makers and
                    spectacle-wearers—to all ladies and ladies' gentlemen with
                    quizzing-glasses—in fact to all persons with two or more eyes, and all speculative and
                    practical opticians.</p>
            <p rend="center">EXPERIMENT.</p>
            <p>Place over the muzzle of your loaded rifle a piece of paste-board about four inches square, and so as

                    sight from seeing the diamond mark in the target placed twenty yards from you; then keep the <hi rend="i">left</hi> eye fixed immoveably on the diamond, and stand yourself without motion thus
                    for a few seconds; and then will the thick paper over your muzzle disappear, and you will see or
                    seem to see the diamond mark with your <hi rend="i">right</hi> eye and mixing with <list type="footnotes">

                    trigger and your ball is in the centre of the target. A dead rest is indispensable for this
                    experiment. N.B.—If this experiment properly done fails, I will give you a copy of this
                    work; provided, if I myself can successfully perform it, you will purchase two copies.</p>
            <p>When it is said Mr. Allheart made rifles, be it understood as certain rules of grammar, in the widest
                    sense; for his making was not like a watch-maker's a mere putting parts and pieces
                    together, but our artist made first all the separate parts and pieces, and then combined them into a
                    gun. He made, and often with his own hand, the barrel—the stock—the
                    lock—the bullet moulds, complete; the brass, gold, or silver mountings; the gravings, the
                    everything! And each and every part and the whole was so well executed, that one would think all the
                    workmen required to make a pin had been separately employed upon the rifle! He even made the steel
                    gouges for stamping names on his own work, and also for stamping type-founders' matrices;
                    he made, moreover, tools for boring musical instruments.</p>
            <p>And this last reminds me that Allheart was the most "musical blacksmith" I ever
                    knew—more so probably than our learned blacksmiths. Not only could he play the ordinary
                    and extraordinary anvil tunes with hammers of all sizes, making "sparks" and
                    points, too, of light flash out much warmer and far more brilliant than ever sprang from the
                    goat-strings of the Italian Maestro under the flagella-ting horse-hair, but Allheart played the
                    dulcimer, a monotone instrument shaped like an Æolian harp, and done with a plectrum on
                    wire strings; and could, beyond all doubt, have easily played a sackbut, psaltery and cymbals!</p>
            <p>He soon became enamoured of the flute; and on my proposing to give him lessons, he purchased an
                    instrument and attended regularly at my house one or more evenings of every week for two years, till
                    he became as great a proficient as his master, and from that to the present time (as he lately wrote
                    me) he has been the conductor of the Woodville Band. Perhaps my friend's musical enthusiasm
                    may be better understood from the following little incident. His hands and fingers were nearly as
                    hard as cast-iron; but this, while no small advantage in fingering the iron strings of a dulcimer,
                    or in playing on the sonorous anvil, was a serious disadvantage in flute-playing; for the indurated
                    points of his fingers stopped the holes like keys with badly formed metallic plugs, and <pb n="108" id="VAA4025-062-2-012"/> permitted the air to leak out. On several occasions I had admired
                    secretly the fresh and polished look of his finger-points when he came to take lessons; till once he
                    accidentally, and with the most delightful naivete, unfolded the cause in answer to the following
                    indirect query: —</p>
            <p>"You are quite late to-night, Allheart?"</p>
            <p>"Yes—ruther—but some customers from Kaintuck stopped me, and after
                    that I had to stay till <hi rend="i">I filed down my fingers!"</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My friend was besides all this a painter. And verily, as to the lettering of signs, the shading, the
                    bronzing, the peppering and salting, and so forth, I defy any first-rate glazier any where to beat
                    Allheart; for he yet does signs for his neighbours, and more from the goodness of his heart and the
                    love of the arts than for gain. To be sure, formerly he would mis-punctuate a little, placing commas
                    for periods and periods where no diacritical mark was needed —although I do believe he
                    sometimes, like a wag of a printer, only followed copy. One thing is certain, he never improperly
                    omitted a capital, though he may have put such in where it might have been omitted; but then, this
                    only rendered the name more conspicuous, and the sign itself altogether more <hi rend="i">capital</hi>,</p>
            <p>Lettering was not, however, his sole <hi rend="i">forte</hi>; he aspired to pictorial devices, such
                    as vignettes; and at last he ventured boldly upon portraits and even full-length figures. His own
                    portrait was among the very first he took, and that by means of a mirror; but, whether from modesty
                    or want of skill, or want of faithfulness in the glass, the likeness was not very flattering. And
                    yet one thing done by our New Purchase artist ought (I speak with becoming deference) to be imitated
                    by many eminent eastern portrait-painters.</p>
            <p>"What is that, sir?"</p>
            <p>Well, I am actuated by the best of motives, gentlemen, as it was a peculiarity in Mr.
                    Allheart's finish, by which, however bad the mere painting, the likeness intended could
                    always be seen at a glance if you knew how to look.</p>
            <p>"What was it, sir? we are impatient."</p>
            <p>Why, he always painted on the frame of the picture the name of the person to whom the likeness or <hi rend="i">portait</hi> belonged.<hi rend="sup">∗</hi>
            </p>
            <list type="footnotes">

            <p>But the chef-d'oeuvre of Allheart was a full-length figure of the American Goddess, Liberty,
                    done for the sign of the new hotel—the Woodville House. He was engaged at this picture,
                    during the intervals stolen from his smithery, one whole summer: and many were the wondering
                    visitors, from far and near, that favoured the artist with their company and remarks. For most
                    matters here done in private were with us then done in public,—this of course being
                    conducive to the perfection of the fine arts. And hence it is not surprising that Allheart,
                    profiting by the endless remarks and suggestions of our democratical people, should have embodied
                    all the best sentiment of the purest republicans in nature, and given to the Purchase the very <hi rend="i">beau ideal</hi> of American Liberty.</p>
            <p>I shall attempt no elaborate critique, but shall say enough to help intelligent readers to a fair
                    conception of this piece [.]</p>
            <p>The Goddess, like a courageous and independent divinity, stood, Juno fashion, right straight up and
                    down the canvass, and with immoveable and fearless eyes fronted the spectator and looked exactly
                    into his face; thus <hi rend="i">countenancing</hi> persecuted freemen, to the confusion of all
                    tyrannical oppressors! Her face, in size and feature, was a model for wholesome Dutch milkmaids to
                    copy after; but the cheeks, instead of blushing, were, I regret to say, only painted red, like those
                    of an actress too highly rouged.</p>
            <p>In the right hand was a flag-staff, less indeed than a liberty-pole or Jackson-hickory, but
                    considerably larger every way than a broom-handle; and on its top was hung, exactly in the centre, a
                    cap—thus by its perfect balance and equidistances of all parts of the rim from the staff,
                    showing that liberty is justice, and is independent and impartial. The cap had, however, an ominous
                    resemblance to one of Jack Ketch's,<hi rend="sup">2</hi> and no doubt foreign despots,
                    ecclesiastical and secular, will pull said article over Liberty's eyes, if they succeed in
                    apprehending and hanging her.</p>
            <p>On the left shoulder squatted a magnificent eagle in all the plenitude of stiff golden feathers, and
                    in the act of being-a-going to drink from a good sized bowl held up by the left-hand fingers of the
                    goddess. What was the mixture could not be seen—the bowl was so high—but most
                    probably it was a sleeping-potion, as the bird seemed settled for a night's roost. Nay,
                    this was the sentiment intended—to mark a time <list type="footnotes">

                    the eagle held in his claws no arrowy thunder and lightning, being evidently disposed to let kings
                    alone to take their naps, if they would let him alone to take his. The idea was equal in sublimity
                    to Pindar's eagle snoozing on Jupiter's sceptre at the music of Orpheus; although
                    my friend's bird was uncommonly big and heavy—but then his goddess was hale and
                    hearty.</p>
            <p>The drapery or dress was a neat white muslin slip then fashionable in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, which was the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> whence we derived fashions; and this simple attire was tied gently under the celestial
                    bosom, which was heaved far up towards the chin, as if the heart was swollen with one endless and
                    irrepressible emotion, and threatened some day or other to sunder the tie and burst right out,
                    breast and all, through the frail barrier of the frock! Yet doubtless the slip was high in the back,
                    and <hi rend="i">a là Kaintuque</hi>, well secured between the shoulders, so that if
                    things gave way in the front, there was still some support from behind—but then it looked
                    dangerous. The frock was, however, undeniably starched and rather too short—(owing maybe
                    to the upward heave of the bosom, as is the case sometimes with dresses from ill-made or too much
                    tournure and bustle,)—for the article stood forth, not from the <hi rend="i">canvass</hi>
                    but from the <hi rend="i">person</hi>, and all smooth and unwrinkled as if just from under the hot
                    smoothing-iron! And, alas! its great brevity—(and the figure up so high too)
                    —revealed the sturdy ankles away up till they began to turn into limbs!</p>
            <p>The feet, unlike Liberty's martyrs in the Revolution, and to indicate our advance in comfort
                    and security, and perhaps in compliment to a ladies' shoe-maker just established next the
                    Woodville House, were covered with a pair of red morocco slippers; while on the ankles and upwards
                    were <hi rend="i">drawn</hi> nice white stockings—so that there was no denudity of limb,
                    as a lady-reader may have feared, and the fashionable frock was not so bad after all. Some error,
                    perhaps, in foreshortening had happened as to the position of the feet, or rather the red moroccos;
                    for, while the artist designed to respresent the right foot as stepping from the other, and the
                    left, as pointing the shoe-toe at the spectator immediately in front, yet the right shoe was fixed
                    horizontally with its heel at a right angle with the other, and that other, the left hung
                    perpendicularly <pb n="111" id="VAA4025-062-2-015"/> down as if broken at the instep—a
                    marvellous likeness to the two slippers on the shoe-maker's own sign, one there with its
                    sole slap against the board, and the other up and down as if hung upon a peg.</p>
            <p>And oh! how I <hi rend="i">do</hi> wish I had not been born before the era of composition
                    books!—or only now could take a few lessons with the author of one!—so as
                    write with all the modern improvements, like the talented family of the Tailmaquers in the leading

                    putting up of our new tavern post, and the first hanging of the Goddess of Liberty! But
                    that's not for the like of me—I'm no orator as Brutus. How can I paint
                    the open-mouthed wonder of that crowd! How make you see the hunchings!—the
                    winks!—the nods!—the pointings!—or hear the
                    exclamations!—the queries!—the allowings!—the
                    powerfuls!—the uproar? And when lawyer Insidias Cutswell, candidate for Congress, mounted
                    the "hoss block" at the post, and ended his half-hour's
                    speech—oh! I never!</p>

            <p>T<hi rend="sc">HIS</hi> autumn was remarkable for wild pigeons. The <hi rend="i">mast</hi> had failed
                    elsewhere; while with us, the oak, the beech, and all other nut trees, had never borne more abundant
                    crops. The woods, therefore, teemed with hogs, squirrels, and all other nut-crackers, that, like the
                    primitive men of poetry, preferred this acorn-life.</p>
            <p>How many swine were slaughtered this fall, I never learned: but, within six weeks, our upper and
                    lower regiments of hunters, and simply by shooting occasionally around their clearings, on counting,
                    at the muster, their squirrel scalps, found the sum more than 30,000!!</p>
            <p>As to pigeons, the first large flocks attracted no unusual notice: and, yet, were they mere scouting
                    parties from the grand army! For, within a week, that army began to arrive, as though flocks had
                    never before been seen! and all the birds under the whole heavens, had been congregated into one
                    company! Had the leaves of our trees all been changed into birds, the number could have been no
                    greater!</p>
            <p>With a friend, I stood in an open space in the woods, two miles east of Woodville, from 10
                    o'clock ?.M. to 3 o'clock, P.M.—five hours—during which,
                    with scarcely thirty seconds intermission, a stream of pigeons, about two hundred yards wide, and
                    averaging two layers, flowed above us, and with the rapidity of thought! It was an endless hurricane
                    on wings, rushing innoxious, yet with such an uproar as seemed to be prostrating the forests: and
                    the deep reverberating thunder, in the distant wilds, seemed to announce the fall of their ponderous
                    and ancient trees! Never had I felt the awe and solemnity of sound thus; even in beholding the
                    wind-tempest pass over the same wilds, bowing the submissive woods, and bearing onward their wide
                    tops, as if mown off with an angel's scythe!</p>
            <p>It will readily be thought, our hunters and sportsmen were in all places firing away at the living
                    torrent: and yet, with but small loss to the pigeons. Rifles are useless in <pb n="113" id="VAA4025-062-2-017"/> firing at very distant and flying troops; and we had not more than a
                    dozen Leather-stockings in the Purchase, able to single out and kill a bird at a time.</p>
            <p>"Why not use shot-guns?" What a question! "Well—but
                    why?" Why, first and foremost, that toy could not be found in twenty houses in the whole
                    Purchase. Secondly, our <hi rend="i">men</hi> could hardly be coaxed to use the thing, both out of
                    contempt, and, what may seem strange, out of a little fear; for, as Ned said, "the spiteful
                    critter kick'd so powerful." Beside, it is unfavourable to rifle-shooting to
                    acquire the dodge taught by a shot-gun. But, lastly, the pigeons usually flew twenty yards above <hi rend="i">our</hi> trees—and that rendered the Mantons, or any best shot-guns, as
                    efficacious <hi rend="i">nearly</hi> as—a quill and a slice of potato.</p>
            <p>However, all the shot-guns and horse-pistols were sought and fixed, so feverish became the
                    excitement, and since there were half-cut backwoodsmen enough, and some degenerate natives to use
                    them. But here was the next difficulty; powder was plenty.—yet, who had shot? In our
                    store was not a pound; and it was the same almost in the others. Still, a few pounds were ferretted
                    from lurking places, and readily sold at thirty-seven and half cents for a scant
                    pound:—whence was proved, that a pound of lead in shot-shape, is not even as <hi rend="i">heavy</hi> as a pound of feathers!—the air-pump to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>
            <p>With immense persuasion, Ned and Domore consented to shoot horse-pistols: but they both utterly
                    refused to fire off "store-shot." And, like some others, they hammered bullets
                    into bars; which were then cut into cubes and triangles, this being "a sort a-shootin
                    bullets, and no inkuridjment to storekeepers to bring out their blasted baby shot!"</p>
            <p>In justice to my own manhood, it must be told, I stooped not to the shot concern till after several
                    day's failure in hitting with my rifle, a single bird, at 140 yards, and moving as near
                    like "the greased lightning" as possible: nor then, before the following accident
                    showed there may be danger in firing a rifle as well as a shot-gun. Satisfied that the rifle must be
                    fired now by the doctrine of chances, and not of "the sights;" and that the chance
                    with one bullet was a "slim chance," it seemed better to multiply chances, and
                    load with two balls instead of one. And yet the spaces between the flying birds were as plentiful as
                    birds; and, into these spaces the two balls chanced to go when they parted company, or, if they
                    stuck together, it was, after all, but one <pb n="114" id="VAA4025-062-2-018"/> chance. Therefore,
                    we at last ventured on <hi rend="i">patching</hi> the balls separately; and then, indeed, the effect
                    was considerably different; not, however, upon the pigeons, but at my end of the gun: for, at the
                    flash, I was suddenly driven partly around, and with a tingling in the fingers supporting the
                    barrel, while about me, for several yards, lay the silver mounting and ornaments of my rifle!</p>
            <p>"What was the matter?"</p>
            <p>The piece had burst; and the stock was shattered up to the spot sustained by my left hand! and, yet,
                    had I received no material injury! On the same day, and from the same cause,—(air
                    intercepted between the patched balls)—another rifle burst; and, although the owner
                    remained with its butt only in his hand, he too was unharmed midst the scattered fragments of wood
                    and iron. Ned's remark about the accidents, was paradoxical, for he "<hi rend="i">Bust</hi> his rifle, if he allowed a rifle would <hi rend="i">a-busted</hi> no how!"</p>
            <p>After this, I descended to the shot-gun. But, while I took my station in the opening already named,
                    and, furnished with two and a half theoretic pounds of different sized shot, fired away till all was
                    expended, I was rewarded with only two pigeons—these being from a small cloud that, by
                    some accident, flew a few yards below the tree-tops, and both killed at one fire.</p>
            <p>One evening, shortly after sunset, Ned Stanley brought a report into the village, that the pigeons
                    were forming an encampment for the night somewhere to the south-east. And, not long after, this was
                    confirmed by Domore, who had surprised an out-post, nestling in the woods within a mile and a half
                    of Woodville.</p>
            <p>Had a scout brought intelligence of a hostile Indian band, our town could not have been more
                    effectually roused and speedily armed. And now, verily, shot-guns and shot rose a thousand per
                    cent.—like caterpillars' eggs in the mulberry fever: and every where <hi rend="i">some</hi> body met <hi rend="i">any</hi> body and <hi rend="i">every</hi> body, legs
                    and all, full tilt in search of the article! Turkeys, sang, coon-skins,
                    ven's'n-hams, and even <hi rend="i">cash</hi> (hoarded to buy
                    land!)—were offered for guns, pistols, and shot!—and, all round, could be seen
                    and heard men and boys hammering, rolling, and cutting shot! Indeed, many intended to fire this
                    extemporaneous shot out of—rifles! And when hunters, or even semi-hunters, can so demean
                    these—the temptation and excitement must be prodigious!</p>
            <pb n="115" id="VAA4025-062-2-019"/>
            <p>Some could not procure even rifles; and these persons, by the aid of Vulcanus Allheart and his boys,
                    had old pistol and gun barrels hastily mounted on rude stocks, to be fired in partnership, one
                    holding the matchlock, and the other "touching <hi rend="i">her</hi> off" with an
                    ignited stick or cigar.</p>
            <p>"What was all this stir about?" Why, for a <hi rend="i">night</hi> attack on the
                    Grand Roosting Encampment! For, since the Purchase became a purchase, never, in the memory of our
                    oldest and most respectable squatters, had such an occurrence happened, as for the pigeons to roost
                    so near Woodville! Now, some had read in Ornithology, and others had been told by people from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>—oh! such wonders about roosts and encampments! how pigeons covered all the
                    branches; and then perched on one another, till the trees became living pyramids of feathers! And
                    how, then, all tumbled down and killed themselves, till the ground was covered with dead pigeons,
                    oh! as much as two feet!—like quails round the Israelitish camp! Yes! and the pigeons
                    slept so sound, and were so averse to flying in the dark, that you could walk up and gather birds
                    from trees like wild-plums in a prairie! Ay! and the farmers used to camp near a roost, with droves
                    of hogs; which, (after the farmers had barrelled up enough birds for winter,) were driven in every
                    morning to be fattened on dead pigeons!</p>
            <p>"Did <hi rend="i">you</hi> believe all that, Mr. Carlton?"</p>
            <p>Well—I was but mortal—beside, every body said it would be such a most mighty
                    powerful smart chance to get such a heap of pigeons! I did not, indeed, go as far as some; for I
                    never expected to find them two feet high, already dead, and, maybe, picked and ready for the
                    skillet. Beside, I <hi rend="i">wanted</hi> to go, and "who knows," says I to
                    myself, "If there mightn't be some truth in the account after all."
                    Hence, after five minutes cogitation, I hurried down after Clarence and Harwood—but, mark
                    it, reader, I was <hi rend="i">met</hi> by those learned gentlemen, hastening up to
                    Carlton's store, to consult on the same subject! For these persons, living in the edge of
                    the forest, knew well enough that the pigeons were camping, from the thunderings, like the deep and
                    solemn mutter of an earthquake, (although the nearest point of the camp proved nearly three miles
                    distant,) and hence, quite as excited and credulous as we small fry, they were posting up town to
                    join a party:</p>
            <pb n="116" id="VAA4025-062-2-020"/>
            <p>"Which way? Which way? neighbours!"</p>
            <p>"Coining up to your store,—are you going down to College?"</p>
            <p>"I was—did you hear what Domore and Ned say?"</p>
            <p>"No—but, hark! don't you hear them?"</p>
            <p>"What!—is that the pigeons?"</p>
            <p>"To be sure!—Carlton, won't you go?"</p>
            <p>"That's what I was coming down for—"</p>
            <p>"That's your sort—agreed. Going to take a gun?"</p>
            <p>"No—guess not: all Woodville is out with
                    guns—pistols—rifles—match-locks—and big keys, with
                    touch-holes filed in—let's only take things to carry back birds in."</p>
            <p>"Agreed—they say you can pick a barrel under a tree—what shall we
                    take?"</p>
            <p>"Bags?"</p>
            <p>"Yes—and a long string to tie them by the legs, and carry back on a
                    pole!"</p>
            <p>"Ready now, Carlton?"</p>
            <p>"Yes—yes—yes! let's keep on."</p>
            <p>"Well, stop at my house," said Clarence, "and there we'll fix a
                    bag and some twine, and so lose no time."</p>
            <p>All was done quick as a squirrel's jump. Then guided by the sound, we put out, regardless of
                    a course, and unable to discern objects dubious in the dim light of a waning moon, and partly
                    obscured by clouds. We were in Indian file,—now trotting, now running, and occasionally
                    walking, —here stumbling over logs—there scrambling up and down
                    gullies—then diving into sink-holes—then ripping through briar swamps! The
                    conversation was monosyllabic and suggestive, performed with no little blowing and palpitation, and
                    broken abruptly by exclamation, thus:—</p>
            <p>"Hark!"</p>
            <p>"Ye-e-s!"</p>
            <p>"Like—ooh!—thun-der!—hey I"</p>
            <p>"Ve-ry! Got—bag?"</p>
            <p>"Ooh!—yes! You—ooh!—got—string?"</p>
            <p>"Oho! <hi rend="i">ouch!—</hi>no! he's got it—ooh!"</p>
            <p>"What now? oho! <hi rend="i">ouch!</hi>—bad briars here!" &amp;c.
                    &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In about two miles, even this laconic dialect was difficult to use, being lost in the roar of
                    pigeon-thunder—mingling with which was heard, however, the artillery, the outcries and
                    shouts of our gallant village troops!</p>
            <pb n="117" id="VAA4025-062-2-021"/>
            <p>"Yes! hark!—they're pelting away! Come! come <hi rend="i">on!</hi> Get
                    that <hi rend="i">bag</hi> ready—pull out those <hi rend="i">strings—hurraw!"</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet it was curious—we had come to no outposts! —had caught no drowsy
                    sentinel pigeons on their roosts! What on earth made the thunder so late at night? How could
                    pigeons, packed on one another, and with heads comfortably stuck under wings, keep up such an awful
                    noise? Was it snoring? Ay! maybe it was the noise of pigeons tumbling down, and trees
                    breaking—</p>
            <p>Hark! a storm rushes this way! How sudden the moon is hid! Is that a cloud? Yes, reader, it was a
                    storm—but of pigeons rushing on countless wings! It was a cloud—but of
                    careering and feathered squadrons! The moon was hid—and by a world of startled birds!</p>
            <p>In vain our search that night for pigeon bearing trees! In vain our bag and three strings! We might
                    have filled a bolster with feathers; but no bird living or dead burdened either our sack or lines!
                    The myriad hosts for miles and miles were on their wings! and guns were flashing away in hopeless
                    vengeance and idle wrath! Neither shot nor ball could reach that world of wild fowl safe mid the
                    free air of Heaven! Pitiful our bag and string!—pitiful our very selves! and all
                    Woodville gazing from the dark depths of the woods upward on that boundless canopy of sounding,
                    black, and rushing pinions!</p>
            <p>To remain was worse than useless—it was hazardous; at every flash of gunpowder, showers of
                    shot foreign and domestic fell like hail on the leaves around us—and we fancied rifles
                    cracked as if speeding balls, and that we heard the peculiar whistling of their death dealing music!
                    And we turned to go home. But the way thither had now become a question. That we were about three
                    miles distant was probable; yet after turnings and windings in the dark, our puzzle was no wonder.
                    Besides the moon, as if unable to penetrate the cloud of wings, had never re-appeared; and clouds of
                    another kind had succeeded, whence heavy and frequent raindrops now pattered on us!</p>
            <p>At last we decided our course by instinct; in which we satisfactorily learned that human instinct is
                    inferior to brute: for after a trot of ten minutes, sudden torchlights crossed our way at right
                    angles, and a voice from one carrier thus hailed—</p>
            <pb n="118" id="VAA4025-062-2-022"/>
            <p>"Hilloo! whar're you a travellin?"</p>
            <p>"To Woodville—whose that?"</p>
            <p>"To Woodville!—bust my rifle if you ain't a goin a powerful strate
                    course on it—"</p>
            <p>"Why Ned, is that you?"</p>
            <p>"That's the very feller; why Mr. Carltin if you keep that course, you'll
                    reach the licks about sun-up!—why this here's the way—foller our
                    trail."</p>
            <p>"Ha! ha! Ned, I thought I was a better woodsman—keep a-head, we'll
                    follow."</p>
            <p>"Well, you're puttee smart in the day-light, Mr. Carltin—but
                    it's raythur more hardish to strike the course of a dark night."</p>
            <p>"Where's Domore, Ned?"</p>
            <p>"Foller'd arter the d—pigins—"</p>
            <p>"Don't swear, Ned, the preacher's here. Did you get any?"</p>
            <p>"Git any! Nobody didn't git none. Bust my rifle if this ain't a judjmint
                    on the settlemint for firing shot guns and shot out a rifles!"</p>
            <p>"I think myself, Ned, shot guns had something to do in scaring the birds so. But how far yet
                    to Woodville?"</p>
            <p>"Well, I can't jist about say sartinly—it taint more nor four miles no
                    how—'spose we a sorter stop talking—it hinders runnin; and here goes
                    for a fresh start."</p>
            <p>And start fresh did Ned and his party, and at a rate extremely prejudicial to easy conversation, and
                    giving us genteel folks work enough to keep in sight of the torches. In little more than an hour,
                    however, we stood in the edge of the clearings; when our course being pointed out by Ned, the
                    parties separated, and I went with Harwood and Clarence to take supper at the house of the
                    latter,—a supper ready to greet our arrival with a bag and string of pigeons!</p>
            <p>I acknowledge it—this is a very tame and spiritless end of our pigeon tale—a
                    very bad dove-tailing! Yet is it as natural as our flat and unprofitable feelings, when we sat down
                    about twelve o'clock that night at Clarence's to an overdone, burnt up, tasteless
                    supper—our poetry and romance all flown away with the pigeons, and washed out by the
                    rain! <pb n="119" id="VAA4025-062-2-023"/> However, we may add, that many followed the pigeons all
                    night; and once or twice small flocks were found settled on trees where about one hundred in all
                    were killed—but the grand body was never overtaken. It continued, perhaps, on the wing
                    till a favourite roosting place some hundred miles south was reached, that being their direction.
                    Domore got back at eight o'clock next morning, having done twenty-five miles and obtained
                    twenty-two pigeons, with his hand, however, much injured by the recoil or bursting of his horse
                    pistol. Hence shot guns were in worse odour than ever and no light curses heaped on "all
                    sich spiteful bird skerers and them what made and shot em!"</p>
            <p>Domore, indeed, soon recovered: when his first rifleshot afterward was so melancholy in its
                    consequence, as to make him abstain from his favourite weapon and hunting for many months. With that
                    account we conclude this chapter.</p>
            <p>He went out several hours before day-break and lay in wait at a salt-lick for a deer. Here he waited
                    patiently till the dawn; and then opposite his station his keen eyes discovered in the bushes the
                    cautious approach of an animal, and soon he caught a glimpse of its body. To flash his eye through
                    the sights and to touch the trigger was instinctive—and then came the cry not of a
                    wounded deer or bear, but of human agony! Domore flew to the spot; and what was his horror there to
                    see bleeding on the ground and apparently dying, poor Jesse Hardy, his intimate friend, and the
                    honest fellow who had been with us in the cave!</p>
            <p>He, too, had come to watch the lick; and had Domore been later than Hardy, their fates, perhaps, had
                    been reversed! Generally great precaution is employed by our hunters to prevent such mishaps, yet
                    sometimes with all, they do occur. Happily in the present case the wound, though severe, was not
                    mortal, and Hardy in a few minutes so recovered as to speak; when Domore, after doing what seemed
                    proper, left his friend for fifteen minutes, and then was again on the spot with the assistance of a
                    neighbouring family. The wounded man was carefully removed to the cabin; and Domore mounting a horse
                    darted away full speed for Dr. Sylvan. The Doctor came; and being a skilful surgeon, as he <pb n="120" id="VAA4025-062-2-024"/> had in that capacity served in the war a regiment of mounted
                    riflemen, he used the best means of cure; and in two months, by the divine favour, poor Jess was
                    able to return to his domestic duties. During this confinement Domore did all he could for his
                    friend, and also for the widow-mother, supplying as far as possible the place of a son; and although
                    after Jess recovered, Domore hunted again with his rifle, he never again, while we were in the
                    Purchase, went out to watch a lick.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> Library Company, founded in 1806, was an important manifestation of that cultural life.
                    An incorporated company supported by financial contributions, it gradually gained in the number and
                    variety of its holdings as well as in membership despite the impact of the War of 1812 and the loss
                    of the territorial capital to Corydon in 1813. These setbacks were but a temporary pause in the
                    company's development. Following the war the library continued to grow. It recruited a
                    number of men as members who had graduated from eastern colleges and then joined in the westward
                    migration. The background and abilities of such men as Isaac <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Jonathan Doty, and John Law made them especially valuable additions to the
                    company's roster. Barely had the revitalization gotten underway, however, when it was once
                    more checked—this time by the Panic of 1819. The effects of the depression are reflected
                    in the minutes. Book purchases declined, new memberships lagged, and delinquencies for nonpayment of
                    annual dues and fines increased. Nevertheless, as indicated in the following segment of the minutes,
                    by the end of 1823 the library had 1,080 volumes valued at $2,300 as against the 426
                    volumes valued at less than $800 in 1813.</p>

                        faithfully the spelling and capitalization of the handwritten document. The spacing of the
                        original minutes has been somewhat modified and standardized. For example, space limitations
                        have prompted the listing of members present at a meeting, results of elections, and books
                        recommended for purchase in series instead of the columns which usually appear in the minutes.
                        Paragraphs have been indented consistently even though in the document many were not indented.
                        Frequently items of business—especially motions and resolutions—were
                        recorded on separate successively indented lines; these have been reproduced in standard
                        paragraph form. The openings and closings of minutes and locations of headings also have been
                        standardized. Punctuation has been reproduced as it appeared with the following exceptions:
                        periods have been added where necessary at the ends of paragraphs, closings of minutes, and
                        after abbreviations and initials; commas and semicolons have been added when columns of names
                        are reproduced in series; a colon has been added after the word "present" when
                        it preceeds a list of members attending a meeting, after the word "viz." when
                        it introduces a series, and occasionally where it clarifies the intent of the secretary; decimal
                        points have been inserted where they were missing in prices; and hyphens have been used
                        consistently between inclusive numbers in lists of numbered books. Flourishes have been omitted
                        or translated as periods; underlining of signatures, dates, and the like has been considered a
                        flourish except where it clearly indicates italics. Raised letters have brought down to the
                        line. Unintentional repetitions of words or phrases have been omitted, as have marks in the
                        margins and words, phrases, or subtotals used in making transitions from one page to the next in
                        the original minutes. No attempt has been made to give biographical data on individuals whose
                        names appear in these minutes.</item>

            <p>For the historian, both amateur and professional, perhaps the most significant activity of
                    Indiana's Sesquicentennial Celebration will be the Manuscript Project. As a part of this
                    observance the Indiana Historical Bureau, the Indiana Sesquicentennial Commission, and the Indiana
                    Historical Society will encourage the location and preservation of valuable manuscript and privately
                    printed materials relating to Indiana history. Although this program will be emphasized during 1966,
                    it will continue as long as materials are supplied to the project.</p>
            <p>All the major libraries in the state have been invited to cooperate in this program. At the present
                    time the libraries of Indiana, Purdue, Ball State, Indiana State, and Notre Dame universities; the
                    public libraries of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>; the Indiana Historical Society Library; and the Indiana State Library are
                    participating. Each library will receive one copy of items accepted for the project. Based on the
                    similar but understandably smaller project of the Civil War Centennial observance, it is estimated
                    that between eighty and one hundred thousand pages of manuscript materials will be copied for the
                    libraries.</p>
            <p>Items received will be numbered and entered in a log. Periodically this log will be copied and
                    distributed to these libraries as a finding list for the materials received. Occasionally important
                    items will be announced in appropriate Indiana periodicals, such as the <hi rend="i">Library
                        Occupant</hi>, the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>, and the <hi rend="i">Indiana
                        History Bulletin.</hi> Material which warrants consideration for publication will be brought to
                    the attention of the Indiana Historical Bureau, the Indiana Historical Society, or other possible
                    publishers. Ultimately, the Indiana State Library hopes to prepare and publish a descriptive guide
                    to the materials collected.</p>
            <p>Examples of materials which the project is interested in locating are indicated by items recently
                    copied by the Indiana State Library. These include: the Pleasant Run Presbyterian Church, <placeName>

                    (including Viet Nam); printed keepsakes, commencement, and other programs; personal and business
                    correspondence; copies of sermons and speeches; written recollections and reminiscences, love

                    Hoosiers in times past or present (which too soon is the past) is appropriate for consideration.</p>
            <p>Such items are often dismissed as useless by their owners and so are deposited in attics, gargages,
                    and a hundred other similar locations. This is unfortunate because they are invaluable research
                    material. The season is open for hunters of Hoosier history to ferret out this material and to bring
                    it to the attention of the Manuscript Project.</p>
            <p>The commission has prepared a leaflet to publicize the copying program and to encourage statewide
                    response. This publication will be distributed during the year. Letters for special groups, such as
                    the fourth grade students, for whom Indiana history normally is a required subject, and for whom a
                    role in the collection of this material would seem to have an especial appeal, also will be
                    prepared.</p>
            <p>For most of the materials Xerox copies will be made; for over-size, bound, or material in a sequence
                    microfilm copies may be substituted. Neither process harms the original document. Although the
                    emphasis of the program is on the preservation of materials for public use in copy form, owners will
                    be encouraged to donate their material to a library. If the material is not to be donated to a
                    participating library, every effort will be made to return the loaned items to the lender by
                    registered mail within a week.</p>

            <p>Postive microfilm copies of the original Federal population census schedules for 1800–90
                    may now be purchased from the National Archives. Also available on microfilm are the volumes
                    published by the Bureau of the Census in 1907–8 giving the names of heads of families as
                    shown in the 1790 census schedules; a card index to those entries on the 1880 census schedules that
                    relate to households including a child aged 10 or under; and the 1890 special census schedules
                    enumerating Union veterans and widows of Union veterans of the Civil War.</p>
            <p>The schedules of population contain a wealth of information for genealogists as well as for
                    historians and social scientists. They are of use to the family historian and to the researcher
                    interested in such subjects as westward expansion, the status of free and slave labor, regional and
                    local history, and immigration. Often they contain evidence necessary for proving citizenship.</p>
            <p>As a rule the information given in the schedules for each successive census is progressively more
                    detailed. The schedules for the period 1790–1840 show the names of enumerated heads of
                    families only, other members of the families being accounted for statistically by age groups, sex,
                    and race (white or Negro). All subsequent enumerations, however, list each individual in a household
                    by name with the exception of the slave schedules for 1850 and 1860, which show only the name of the
                    owner and the number of his slaves by age group and sex. The 1850 census was the first to record for
                    each person enumerated his age, occupation if over age 15, and place of birth. If the parent of a
                    person enumerated in the 1870 schedules was of foreign birth, that fact is indicated. The 1880
                    schedules add the relationship of each individual to the head of the family.</p>
            <p>The card index to the 1880 schedules is only to those entries that relate to households including a
                    child aged 10 or under. The cards give the names, ages, and birthplaces <list type="footnotes">

                    head of the household in which he is listed. The cards are arranged by State or Territory and
                    thereunder by the Soundex system; that is, alphabetically by the first letter of the surname,
                    thereunder by the sound of the surname, and thereunder alphabetically by given name. The cards
                    giving the names of persons in institutions are usually at the end of a State. A guide for the use

            <p>Most of the 1890 population schedules were destroyed or badly damaged by fire; the few surviving
                    schedules have been microfilmed. The 1890 special census schedules enumerating Union veterans and
                    widows of Union veterans of the Civil War give information about the military service of each
                    veteran named and the post-office address of each listed person who was living at the time of the
                    enumeration.</p>
            <p>This list is arranged chronologically by census year, thereunder alphabetically by name of State or
                    Territory, and then, as a rule, alphabetically by county. For each microfilm publication it gives
                    the microcopy number; the total number of rolls and their price; the price of the microfilm for each
                    State and Territory; and a complete list of the microfilm rolls, showing for each roll its number,
                    contents, and price.</p>
            <p>Positive prints of one or more rolls of the microfilm listed may be purchased at the prices quoted.
                    These prices are based on a charge of 8 cents for each foot of 35-mm. or 4 cents for each foot of
                    16-mm. microfilm, with all prices rounded off to the nearest dollar. A 10-percent discount is given
                    on orders for more than $1,000 and a 15-percent discount on orders for more than
                    $3,000. Checks or money orders for microfilm should be made payable to the General

                    $4.50.)</head>
            <p>The author has attempted in writing this volume to have due regard for proportion and balance
                    concerning the numerous topics treated, and, in so doing, has devoted more space and research to the
                    somewhat neglected phases of Indiana history and less to those which have received more adequate
                    treatment. Hence, Thornbrough analyzes to a greater degree post-Civil War political developments
                    than she does pre-Civil War ones. She pays particular attention to economic changes, to which she
                    feels little research has been directed for any part of the period covered.</p>
            <p>The scope of this work is broad. On the political side, state and national issues are considered,
                    involving necessarily the career of many prominent individuals. The impact of war, in its numerous
                    ramifications, receives due attention. Such topics as internal improvements, agriculture,
                    manufacturing, banking, education, religion, libraries, newspapers, ethnic strains in population,
                    and other social phenomena consume more than half the pages in this large book. Statistical tables
                    are frequently inserted in such fashion as to be easily correlated with the narrative.</p>
            <p>Particular comment is in order on portions of this work. The author, having written the monograph,
                        <hi rend="i">The Negro in Indiana before 1900</hi>, reveals exceptionally well the ways in which
                    the Negro was a controversial factor in the state during much of the period covered. She holds that
                    disloyalty in Indiana during the Civil War has been much exaggerated and subscribes to the
                    revisionist view on that matter: "But if one accepts a recent definition of copperheadism
                    as ‘avid opposition to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> administration,’ and adds to it avid opposition to Governor Morton, the
                    number of copperheads in Indiana was large. Those who wanted to see the Union permanently divided
                    and who were ready actively to help the Confederate cause were very few" (p. 181).</p>
            <p>The temperance question, complicated by a number of factors, was second only to slavery in its
                    emotional impact upon the minds of individuals. The author is at her best in unraveling the twists
                    and turns and inconsistencies incident to the controversy over greenbacks. She portrays the Hoosier
                    Grange as not quite as politically minded as it was in other western states; and she tells us that
                    Indiana, in 1880, had fewer foreign born persons, Delaware excepted, than any other northern state.
                    The Germans and Irish, however, were present in sufficient numbers to affect the history of the
                    state in significant ways.</p>
            <p>The development of a network of railroads by 1880 is portrayed in considerable detail, and the
                    blessings and the evils incident to this development are not overlooked. Agriculture made marked
                    progress, but large scale manufacturing was not conspicuous. The origins and growth of an
                    educational system in the face of many adverse factors are the themes of the longest chapter in the
                    book. It is unfortunate <pb n="160" id="VAA4025-062-2-064"/> that in writing on educational
                    institutions, religious sects, and newspapers so many names have to be included; but the reviewer
                    realizes there would be criticism if many exceptions were made.</p>
            <p>The author is to be congratulated on the prodigious amount of work that has gone into this highly
                    meritorious, comprehensive work. The reveiwer wishes that she had indicated some of the reaction in
                    Indiana to <placeName>

            <p>This useful, informative book is a volume in the Indiana War History Series, <hi rend="i">Indiana in
                        World War II</hi>, sponsored by the Indiana War History Commission. A straightforward, readable
                    narrative with a minimum of statistical materials, it covers the fiscal side of the war as it
                    affected Indiana. It includes such matters as the financing of industrial conversion to war
                    production, price, wage, and rent controls, and the war savings program in the state.</p>
            <p>The financial role of Indiana in wartime is described within the context of a continuing conflict and
                    debate over fiscal policy participated in by both organized labor and organized business and,
                    sometimes, by organized farmers. The chief antagonists in this struggle were agencies like the State
                    Industrial Council (CIO), the State Federation of Labor (AFL), the State Chamber of Commerce, and
                    the Indiana Farm Bureau. Among the main issues in the controversy were the kind of taxes necessary
                    in order to pay for the war and the proper methods of attaining economic stabilization. In general
                    conservative forces seem to have predominated in Indiana. Only very reluctantly did the state accept
                    the increasing federal regulation and intervention which came with wartime tax collecting practices
                    and economic controls. For some reason the book fails to treat in any detail the political campaigns
                    of the period, which might have thrown considerable light on the divisions of opinion within the
                    state on fiscal questions.</p>
            <p>The author's conclusion is that war is costly, both in material losses and in lives.
                    Increased debt and taxes took their toll, but worst of all was inflation, which depreciated the
                    savings of those who put their money in war bonds and bank deposits during the war. In spite of
                    this, many Hoosiers experienced a rise in real income, especially wage earners as contrasted with
                    those dependent on rents, dividends, and interest payments. Also, farmers who were able to pay off
                    their mortgages with wartime gains profited from the higher prices and the rise in farm values in
                    the postwar years. But for the state's population as a whole, the author's last
                    lesson is that in economic terms war is waste.</p>

            <p>In American history the West is not only an area, a population, or a manner of living but an
                    expression of the love of men and women as they search for better lives. In this addition to <hi rend="i">The New American Nation Series</hi>, Francis Philbrick proposes to sacrifice the
                    romance and idealism of the West in favor of truth. The author correctly treats the early West as a
                    part of the British Empire. He examines the problems and subsequent weak solutions of British
                    colonial policy between 1754 and the Treaty of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> ending the Revolutionary War. Americans quickly discovered that independence was not a
                    panacea, and that the newly formed Confederation government had inherited many difficulties.
                    Conflicting land claims among states, the validity of individual land grants, and the controlling of
                    Indian relations pointed to the need for regulation of western land. Confederation committees chosen
                    for organization of government in the Northwest squarely faced these problems. Philbrick contrasts
                    the land ordinance of 1785 with its famous successor two years later and contends that the
                    Jeffersonian stamp of the earlier ordinance gave way to a plan by eastern conservatives led by Rufus
                    King and Nathan Dane. Philbrick's argument—previously presented by Merrill
                    Jensen—makes certain that the reader credits the Ordinance of 1787 to Nathan Dane.</p>
            <p>This book is something of a revisionist effort. The author minimizes the importance that the West had
                    in affecting democratic institutions and criticizes the scholarship—or lack of
                    scholarship—of Frederick Jackson Turner. The author declares that "Turner could
                    never even have read the Ordinance of 1787 not seemingly before 1899" (p. 368). He states
                    that the <placeName>
                  <country reg="inu">Indiana</country>, <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> territories violated the indentured servitude and slavery provisions of 1787. He
                    describes how squatters threatened recently arrived speculators attending government land auctions
                    and how commonplace was the frontier institution of lynching. Philbrick concludes that
                    "Turner's frontier was totally unreal" (p. 370).</p>
            <p>The author provides a sound analysis of the neglected relationship between Indian removal and public
                    land policy. The clamoring of land-hungry settlers had its effect upon public officials.
                    Difficulties in extinguishing Indian claims sometimes forced the government to buy parcels of land
                    several times. Through 1830 the cost of buying peace from the Indians, of purchasing foreign land,
                    and of managing the federal lands was greater than the proceeds from the land sales. Not measurable
                    were the ties created between the West and federal government. Through her congressional spokesmen
                    the West constantly worked for more favorable land laws.</p>
            <p>Despite its generally high quality of scholarship the book shows certain defects. The author stresses
                    diplomacy involving the West but omits a substantial amount of social and political history. He
                    entirely dismisses pioneer settlement beyond <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> prior to 1830. Thus the settlement and eventual admission of the large tier of states

                    </placeName> are ignored. <pb n="162" id="VAA4025-062-2-066"/> During this time questions of
                    statehood and slavery spiraled into a crisis, but the author makes no mention of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Compromise. Of the states included in the study, nine had a population over fifty
                    thousand by 1820, and their influence in the affairs of the nation cannot be dismissed. There are
                    also minor errors: Fort Harmar is misspelled; the map showing the routes of Generals Hull and
                    Harrison in the War of 1812 is incorrect (p. 267).</p>
            <p>The editors, because of ample citations in the footnotes, have deleted a bibliography and included a

            <p>It appears that many Americans suffer from an edifice complex. How else can one explain the rapid
                    rise in the number of books written on forts? At least six of them have appeared on the market
                    during the past three years, and a number of others are in the production stage. They are limited,
                    however, to military posts, to the fur trade, or to those found in a particular region of the
                    country. Forts of the American West seem to be especially attractive to writers, historians,
                    artists, photographers, publishers, and book buyers, if quantity is a valid indicator. In this
                    newest addition to the list, Bruce Grant goes one step further. He attempts to cover them
                    all—every stockade, palisade, blockhouse, redoubt, garrison, camp, mission, shack, ruin,
                    and rockpile, which at one time or another someone in wisdom or foolishness decided to dub a fort.
                    There are more than 1,200 entries, each of them a monument or a memory to the ingenuity of man.</p>
            <p>The author has a sense of balance for which we may be grateful. Descriptions vary in length according
                    to the importance of the fort. In most cases, the basic information is included. Grant usually gives
                    the dates of the establishment and the abandonment of each fort and frequently includes a statement
                    of its significance. If remains exist, they are discussed in detail. The book is also easy to use.
                    It is divided into sections by geographical area, and forts are grouped by states. The eight
                    regional maps are crowded but adequate. The drawings by Lorence Bjorklund are delightful. Although
                    lacking in detail, they capture the spirit of the times and occasionally evoke an intended chuckle.</p>
            <p>The book has a fatal flaw. One cannot depend on its accuracy. Some of the descriptions appear to be
                    correct, but others are obviously not. Take, for example, the treatment of Fort Laramie, <placeName>
                        <country reg="wyu">Wyoming</country>
                    </placeName>. Grant devotes a full page (p. 258) to the post but commits so many errors, both common
                    and uncommon, that it would take several pages to recount and correct them. One need mention only a
                    few to cast a long shadow on the research of the author.</p>
            <pb n="163" id="VAA4025-062-2-067"/>
            <p>Grant states that the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 provided for the payment of an annuity to the
                    Northern Plains Indians in return for certain lands. Actually, the Indians retained ownership of the
                    land. They simply agreed to allow emigrants to travel over the <placeName>

                    and Mormon trails free from harrassment and to permit the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Army to build fortifications along the route. Grant reports that "Old
                    Bedlam," the famous officers' quarters immortalized in a novel by Charles King,
                    cost from $60,000 to $85,000 since lumber for its construction had to be
                    hauled all the way from Fort <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Leavenworth</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
               </placeName>. Records show, however, that the lumber
                    came from trees growing within a fifty mile radius of the post. In fact, logging still continues on
                    nearby Laramie Peak. Grant declares that the State of <placeName>
                        <country reg="wyu">Wyoming</country>
                    </placeName> bought Fort Laramie and donated it to the federal government in 1927. In truth, the
                    state purchased the buildings and land in 1937. It became a part of the National Park System in
                    1938.</p>
            <p>Since the market for books on forts is a bullish one, it is quite possible that another author may
                    soon supply a volume which has all of the strengths and none of the weaknesses of <hi rend="i">American Forts.</hi> At least let us hope so.</p>

            <p>American historical scholarship has, so it seems, exhausted the Revolution and its aftermath and has
                    turned to the War of 1812, and the book under review is only one of perhaps a dozen volumes to
                    appear in the past few years. Where it differs from the others is its attempt at
                    synthesis—a short, general account of the causes of the war and the diplomacy of the
                    peace. The author, Patrick C. T. White, cites to documents in the Public Record Office of Great
                    Britain and to numerous writings of contemporary Americans, public and private. He contends that the
                    Americans faced in the British Government an enemy that was almost implacable, that the British had
                    decided that their European problems came first and that American interests had to work themselves
                    out within the larger arrangements—such as the Orders in Council—for British
                    national security. The author does not hold a brief for the diplomacy of Jefferson and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which he remarks contained too much hope and not enough practicality. But he believes
                    that the War of 1812 had a good result because it showed the British they could not step on the
                    Americans, and that "the new freedom from the Old World provided the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> with an impetus for growth that might otherwise not have existed" (p. 167).</p>
            <p>The above quotation, part of the book's penultimate sentence, points to one of the
                    difficulties of this volume—for White has written the book as collateral reading for
                    college undergraduates, and no undergraduate <pb n="164" id="VAA4025-062-2-068"/> will go through
                    this sort of prose with any feeling of interest not to mention enjoyment. For all its outdatedness
                    Henry Adams is far more interesting, a much more likely source of collateral reading. None of the
                    figures in this book comes to life: <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Jefferson, J. Q. Adams, Calhoun, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>. One recalls the lament of Theodore Roosevelt before he gave his presidential address
                    to the American Historical Association in 1912, that he was going to tell the historians that
                    history was literature and, he added, they were not going to believe it. After fifty-four years has
                    that message still failed to get through?</p>
            <p>The reviewer must make one other observation, in regard to sources. White has a curious method of
                    citing only to Foreign Office documents or to collections of letters or documents or, if he cites a
                    secondary work, it almost always is to that work as the source of a quotation. On two or three
                    occasions he remarks the books of Adams, Burt, Horsman, Bradford Perkins, Pratt, <hi rend="i">et
                    al.</hi>, but does not use his footnotes to credit their findings. This is improper, for the notes
                    should show White's sources; it is unbelievable that he ignored the secondary works or used
                    them only as mines for quotations.</p>

            <p>There were many men who, for a variety of reasons that became increasingly murky, objected to the
                    political artistry of the "demi-gods" of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> Convention. They may well have been a majority, yet they have received little attention
                    from American scholars until recently. They have been passed over, one suspects, simply because they
                    were on the losing side; but after reading these essays it seems reasonable to conclude that their
                    argumentation and debate, by and large, are no match for those of their opponents and that it is for
                    this reason that they have been overlooked. Certainly these Antifederalist essays are inferior to
                    the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
               </placeName>, and Jay productions of 1788. There are exceptions and
                    ironically the exceptions were the work of well-to-do and well-educated men like George Mason, R. H.
                    Lee, and Robert Yates. Anti-Beardians have led us to suspect as much for some time. Together with
                    Jackson Main's recent study, <hi rend="i">The Antifederalists</hi>, this collection of
                    generally tedious and repetitious essays gives us a view in depth of just what it was that stirred
                    the hearts and souls of the "un-Founders" of the Republic.</p>
            <p>The Antifederalists objected to the elasticity of the Constitution, to what they could not be
                    hoodwinked into believing was a nice balance between state and national governments, to the
                    aristocratic overtones of a long-term Senate and a monarchical presidency, and to the tactics of
                    opponents who would countenance talk of lifetime appointments behind closed doors and then publicly
                    proclaim themselves Federalists. They believed that the state governments had been set on the road

                    an excise tax would follow hard upon ratification and that armed coercion might be its concomitant.
                    They also saw with surprising clarity that the proposed Supreme Court would exercise the power of
                    judicial review of national legislation without any check upon its authority that could be
                    anticipated. If the bulk of their followers were modest farmers, the uneducated, and the politically
                    naive, the authors themselves were not.</p>
            <p>The editor has unfortunately attempted to match copy for each of the eighty-five Federalist essays.
                    The overlapping of subject matter by men who followed no concerted plan of organization or rebuttal
                    makes this a volume of something less than sustaining interest. Borden's notes are few and
                    far between, and it is regettable that the table of contents does not list the authors, either by
                    given names or by pseudonyms. "Brutus" was perhaps the best of them and should not
                    be missed. He may be located only by resort to the index. Students who would understand both sides
                    in the great debate of 1788 will want to read various of these essays, particularly numbers 1, 10,
                    17, 21–22, 32–33, 35, 38, 50, 78–82, 84–85. Despite the
                    tedium involved it will prove worth the effort of ferreting out the best arguments of the
                    Antifederalist writers.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Second American Party System: Party Formation in the Jacksonian Era.</hi> By
                    Richard P. McCormick. (<geogName>Chapel Hill</geogName>: The University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName> Press, 1966. Pp. x, 389. Notes, index. $7.50.)</head>
            <p>Richard McCormick's excellent new study of political parties during the Jacksonian era may
                    be the most significant publication on that period for many years to come. His purpose is to explain
                    the genesis and character of the second American party system—the first one having risen
                    in the 1790's and disintegrated after 1815—in the quarter century from the
                    election of 1824 to the Great Debate of 1850. He succeeds in doing this very well indeed. The
                    disarray of personal politics that brought the second Adams to power is the starting point, the ways
                    in which a vigorous two-party system developed are the main topics of interest, and the
                    intensification of the slavery issue marks the close of the story.</p>
            <p>McCormick examines the structure, the operation, the techniques of the Democratic and the Whig
                    parties, state by state, in four sections: New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, the Middle Atlantic, the South, and the West. The result is local history at its best
                    (the book won the award of the Association for State and Local History for 1964), since it shows so
                    well the indispensability of aligning generalizations about the national scene with the distinctive
                    settings in individual states. Still it also shows how fragile such generalizations are. McCormick
                    has had to rely upon secondary references a good deal because of the vast size of the canvas he
                    paints, and for some states that literature is quite inadequate. Nevertheless he has also used much
                    primary material, particularly <pb n="166" id="VAA4025-062-2-070"/> newspapers and state archives.
                    So the expert on a particular state will at once be impressed by the research and annoyed by errors
                    that may have been unavoidable. The difficulty of the project stands out most boldly as one looks at
                    the heart of the book: the compilation of voting statistics in relation to the numbers of eligible
                    voters and of adult white males. It is a matter of making an educated
                    guess—interpolating, for example, the population in 1834 from the census figures for 1830
                    and 1840. Besides, how many legitimate votes were actually cast? Plural voting, wholesale fraudulent
                    practices, faulty returns, and skimpy records, all make a statistic something less than a scientific
                    fact.</p>
            <p>In the successive sections on the growth of the two-party system in each state and in the
                    illuminating final chapter on the nature of that system, the author's findings are
                    abundantly clear. Foremost among them is the thesis that one cannot understand the character of
                    either party at any time without reference to the legal-constitutional environment of the particular
                    state in which it evolved. Thus in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, parties assumed special personalities because of severe suffrage requirements until
                    mid-century, a county basis of voting that made travel to the polls difficult, the possibility of
                    one man casting several votes in the same election, and the dominant position of Thomas
                    Ritchie's "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> Junto." Or in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> there was the persistent conflict of French and English-American groups that strongly
                    influenced party politics. Another conclusion is the close correlation of party development and the
                    intensity of presidential contests. For instance, 1828 and 1832 were years of relatively light
                    voting—and underdeveloped parties—while 1840 was the opposite. In the former
                    years about one-half of the eligibles voted; in the latter campaign, about four-fifths. By 1840,
                    then, party development was complete. Voter participation, made possible by liberal suffrage
                    requirements, rose sharply as two vigorous parties battled for the presidency. And new techniques
                    had appeared: the convention system (propounded by such leaders as Stephen A. Douglas as a
                    democratic reform), the tireless work of innumerable committees from the national level down to
                    local districts, an enlarged role of the newspapers, and colorful and popularized campaigns, best
                    illustrated by the Log-Cabin mania.</p>
            <p>Despite the book's excellence there are some prominent faults. A leading weakness is the
                    tedious style of writing that marches onward mechanically from election to election but is seldom
                    alleviated by a graceful or humorous passage. His informative research on voting statistics does not
                    come through to the reader as it might have if he had included statistical tables—really
                    an inexcusable omission. Furthermore he concentrates so heavily on party organization that he gives
                    little weight to the influence of ideas upon politics, or it may be that he thinks they had little
                    influence. Finally, he pays no attention to the proven importance of parties in the governmental
                    process. Indeed, by mere statement he says that parties do not and cannot govern in
                    America—overlooking the president's dual status as chief executive and head of
                    his party, as well as the vital functions of parties in Congress.</p>
            <p>On balance, McCormick has written a highly useful book. Nothing else in print on Jacksonian parties
                    provides such rich detail <pb n="167" id="VAA4025-062-2-071"/> and wise analysis. It builds on
                    specialized state studies, of course, but one of its most beneficial effects may be the stimulus it
                    will give to additional investigation of party history for those states so far neglected.</p>

                    William Gillette. (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName>: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1965. Pp. 181. Frontispiece, notes, tables, bibliography,
                    index. $4.50.)</head>
            <p>Until the appearance of this volume most writings on the Fifteenth Amendment contained familiar and
                    widely accepted interpretations regarding its framing, passage, objectives, and historical
                    significance. The amendment was depicted as the work of Radical Republicans whose chief concern was
                    to secure for their party the votes of southern Negroes; and it was a failure because southern
                    whites succeeded in rendering it ineffectual.</p>
            <p>Now, nearly a century after enactment, and over fifty years after the last special study of the
                    amendment, Gillette presents a fresh interpretation which falls in line with recent revisionist
                    literature on Reconstruction. He contends that the formulation and passage of the Fifteenth
                    Amendment was achieved by political and constitutional moderates. Of particular importance was the
                    work of moderate Republicans who became convinced that their party's future depended upon
                    the support of northern Negroes. Thus the enfranchisement of northern Negroes, who could control the
                    balance of political power in a number of key states, was the primary objective of the amendment.
                    The secondary objective was the protection of southern Negroes against losing the vote they had been
                    given by the newly adopted state constitutions. The amendment's wording, Gillette believes,
                    reflects the purpose of moderates to insert right-to-vote provisions into the constitution without
                    destroying state control over elections. He disagrees with those who have condemned the amendment
                    for failing to accomplish its objectives, pointing out that the weakness lay not in the provisions,
                    but in the failure to enforce them. From the vantage point of 1965 the author views the amendment as
                    a "fusion of power and justice" (p. 165) which marks a giant stride toward the
                    ultimate goal of universal suffrage.</p>
            <p>Gillette's study, the purpose of which is "to tell the story of how and why the
                    Fifteenth Amendment came to be" (p. 14), is strictly a political history. Adequate
                    attention is given to debates involving racism, states rights, and limited versus universal male
                    suffrage, but there is no attempt to analyze attitudes or activities of social, religious, or
                    economic groups. The author's research focuses primarily on the <hi rend="i">Congressional
                        Globe</hi>, records of state legislatures, newspapers, and manuscripts of leading politicians.
                    What emerges is essentially a study in practical politics, with emphasis on such factors as party
                    power, <pb n="168" id="VAA4025-062-2-072"/> legislative timing, required ratification, and
                    influential personalities. The author gives special credit to President Ulysses S. Grant, who
                    endorsed the amendment in his first inaugural address, and to Senator Oliver P. Morton, who worked
                    assiduously to secure ratification by four southern states and his own state of Indiana.</p>
            <p>Mention must be made of the author's difficult and generally graceless style, of tedious
                    repetition, and of too many long, awkward sentences. But Gillette preesnts a timely and much-needed
                    reevaluation of the Fifteenth Amendment, and his study is a significant contribution to the
                    literature on Reconstruction.</p>

            <p>The general format and the numerous illustrations of this volume suggest an official guidebook, an

                    </placeName> World's Fair. The author conducts an extensive and carefully selected tour
                    through the Spanish Conquest, emphasizing colorful episodes which took place in North America, and
                    gives his followers glimpses of colonial <placeName>

                    brief examinations of such topics as the teaching of Spanish in American schools and Spanish
                    influences on American architecture and painting. After the Conquest the topics tend to be bland

            <p>The author has set out to whitewash the "Black Legend" wherever it still remains,
                    suggesting by innuendo that, compared to the later imperialism of the <placeName>
                  <country reg="-us">United States</country>, <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
               </placeName>'s record
                    was not so bad after all. This thesis has certain merits, but Fernández-Flórez
                    has pushed it too far. Thus he disposes of the Battle of Cajamarca with a sentimental poem on
                    constancy, suggests that Las Casas was paranoiac, and remarks delicately that "some weak
                    races, such as the Carib Indians, suffered severe perturbation with the coming of the
                    conquest" (p. 32). On one page he writes of "the glorious and well-deserved
                    zenith" of the Spanish empire in the eighteenth century and on the next page of
                    "the expansionist greed of the <placeName>

            <p>The most attractive feature of the book is its numerous maps and engravings from the colonial period.

            <p>This book needed to be written, and Harold Breimyer was well-qualified to write it. The author drew
                    on his varied experiences in the <placeName>

                    volume. While much of the analysis is at a sophisticated level, the illustrations and applications
                    are down to earth. The narrative moves smoothly and the style is easy.</p>
            <p>The traditional American agriculture of a generation ago writhes under death pangs as it sheds its
                    simpler, agrarian past and emerges into the more complex forms of the technological and commercial
                    world of today. Neither the demise of the old nor the birth of the new is easy.</p>
            <p>The first section of the book deals with the concept of individual freedom in an agricultural
                    setting. The agrarian philosophy that under-girds traditional agriculture places a high value on
                    such institutions as family farm, owner-operation, low tenancy, and that poorly defined thing we
                    call freedom. A substantial body of thought has maintained in former years that these institutions,
                    expressing themselves through their traditional social and political values, have been the
                    wellspring of social and political stability in our entire society.</p>
            <p>In today's transition to commercial agriculture and concentrated agri-business, many of the
                    traditional attributes of agriculture are under pressure, and the values growing out of them are
                    shaky. Much of the struggle in agricultural policy is concerned with an attempt to preserve the
                    traditional social and political values of an essentially agrarian society, while we project our
                    farmers into the commercial pattern of our urban and heavily industrial world in which the modern
                    farmer must operate. To accomplish this trick requires more finesse than anyone has demonstrated to
                    date, or than the author suggests.</p>
            <p>Not only is the traditional on-the-farm independence of the farm operator threatened; but also
                    various groups are experimenting with new systems or organization, such as contractual
                    integration—both vertical and horizontal, new and larger cooperatives, bargaining
                    associations, withholding actions, and the like.</p>
            <p>Today's economic pressures for change in agriculture are compelling. To resist them in the
                    name of individual fredom, for example, is often to forego the chance for increased earnings and
                    higher living levels associated with modern large-scale and often integrated business organization.
                    We may one day decide that many of our most cherished <pb n="170" id="VAA4025-062-2-074"/> personal
                    values, customs, and institutions, which were essentially forged in an agrarian setting, may not be
                    very useful in our modern urban-industrial society.</p>
            <p>In another section, the author shows the growing interdependence between farmers and the economic
                    institutions of present-day agriculture. It is made clear that the concept of total independence of
                    farmers is a delusion; that the modern farm is really involved in an intricate network of complex
                    relationships. The farmer is dependent upon—and often at the mercy of—a
                    multiplicity of services outside his line fences. Some of these are performed by farmers'
                    cooperatives, some by private or corporate entrepreneurs, and some through the activities of
                    government.</p>
            <p>There is growing pressure on the small "independent" unit, in which the farmer
                    combines in one person the functions of owner, operator, and manager, and uses the market exchange
                    to conduct his relations with his suppliers and his markets. Various forms of integration and
                    contractual agreements are invading agriculture, with their inevitable erosion of some of the
                    traditional freedom and independence that have characterized traditional farming.</p>
            <p>The author does not hold these changes to be harmful or undesirable. His analysis of them against the
                    historical prospective of agrarian tradition is stimulating.</p>
            <p>The job is not necessarily to preserve traditional agriculture or its historical traditions and
                    institutions. The challenge is rather to devise a policy for agriculture which will move it into its
                    industrial age and at the same time strengthen the dignity and worth of the individual in it. The
                    author feels this goal is possible of attainment.</p>

               </hi> is a very interesting and informative volume. Lyons explains how most pioneer
                    newspapers became intensely partisan in the Jacksonian era, how printers paid their bills, the
                    sources from which material was obtained for publication, why local information was generally
                    ignored, why frontier editors offered only a limited view of pioneer society, why pioneer papers
                    generally had very meagre circulation, and the like. He also provides numerous examples of the
                    vitriolic and vituperative language which <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>'s pioneer editors, who at times were even more critical of fellow editors than
                    they were of anyone else, were prone to use. According to Lyons: "There were four agents
                    which fostered the founding of the pioneer journal: the government, which needed to publicize its
                    laws; the politician, who wished to crystallize public opinion; the literate citizenry, who sought
                    information, amusement, and intelligence; and the printer-editor, who had both altruistic and
                    personal motives. Each agent needed the press to effectively participate in society. All four agents
                    seldom, if ever, cooperated as one in establishing a public journal, but a combination of at least
                    two of them was necessary for setting up a pioneer press. It is this last agent, the printer-editor
                    (and his relations with the other three), which is the concern of this study" (P. 7).</p>

                    The regular session of the Indiana general assembly early in 1965 was noteworthy for accomplishing
                    reapportionment for both legislative and congressional districts. This concise discussion by John S.
                    Waggaman offers a useful summary of reapportionment struggles and legislation during this session.
                    Its value is enhanced by tabular data and maps containing the legislative and congressional
                    districts that resulted. The sub-title, <hi rend="i">A Continuing Struggle</hi>, is merited because
                    legislative reapportionment achieved by the general assembly in 1963 had been declared
                    unconstitutional shortly before the 1965 regular session commenced, as well as by the fact that the
                    same fate soon befell the legislative reapportionment of early 1965. (In the fall of 1965 a special
                    session of the general assembly developed reapportionment legislation which was shortly thereafter
                    approved by the federal court, but this development occurred after Waggaman's article had
                    been written.)</p>
