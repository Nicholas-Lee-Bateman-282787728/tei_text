                    passage in square brackets: "This man claims to be liberal in his political views, and
                    believes in progression generally. He also claims that he is persecuted for telling the truth and
                    being the friend of old Thompson." In a snide tone the compiler added, "If we knew
                    who 'Old Thompson' <hi rend="i">is</hi>, or <hi rend="i">was</hi>, we might help
                    our friend.—Writer."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> But "writer" simply
                    revealed an outsider's ignorance. "Old Thompson" was certainly known to
                    more people than C. L. Canine: two of his sons were in the <hi rend="i">Guide</hi> as <placeName>

                    which the patriarch of a very interesting family had fallen. "Old Thompson" was
                    Grigg Matthew Thompson, eldest son of Wilson Thompson who had been one of the most eloquent and
                    influential Primitive Baptist ministers of the Middle West.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Born on the <placeName>

                    to spend his life defending a creed which, by the time he became one of its greatest champions, was
                    already a quaint anachronism. He was the father of Maurice and Will Thompson—lawyers,
                    railroad engineers, archers, fledgling poets—a couple of dashing young ex-Confederates
                    who had captured as wives two daughters of John Lee, prominent railroad entrepreneur, and who were
                    running as fast as they could away from their Primitive Baptist heritage toward fame and fortune in
                    Methodist-Presbyterian bourgeois gentility.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            <p>So far as he is known today at all, Maurice Thompson is remembered as the author of <hi rend="i">Alice of <placeName>

                    still relish Meredith Nicholson's <hi rend="i">The Hoosiers</hi> as second only to Lew

                    simple and much more important than his current reputation would indicate. From one point of view,
                    he is a classic example of the mindless genteel, of the self-satisfied Victorian mentality. And yet,
                    against the background of his family, he can be seen as he apparently saw himself: an energetic and
                    progressive force in a progressive community. An exploration of this paradox is the purpose of this
                    paper.</p>
            <p>The story has features of a family novel by Mann or Galsworthy, with a first generation in a strong,
                    primitively heroic mold and a third generation completely alienated, looking back from a position of
                    bemused apostasy. This paper's main concern is with the generation between, a stratum often
                    weak and unimpressive, shuttling between two worlds, with periods of tremendous energy and faith and
                    periods of doubt, despair, and near-paralysis. The epic of the first generation is <hi rend="i">The
                        Autobiography of Elder Wilson Thompson</hi>,<hi rend="sup">5</hi> for a century a favorite
                    testament of the Primitive Baptists. The book's long passages of Primitive Baptist rhetoric
                    and polemic make it hard going for most readers today, but it is in part a fascinating story of
                    pioneer heroism and spiritual integrity. In 1894, Maurice Thompson, the grandson, picked up this
                    book and, for a pleasant hour or so, read it as he read Walter <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Scott</region>
                    </placeName> and <hi rend="i">Robin Hood</hi>, as a tale of heroism and romance. The reading
                    triggered some personal memories of the grandfather, "straight, broad-shouldered, deep-
                    chested, lion faced," with a "voice that might have jarred and tumbled the walls
                    of Jericho." Maurice also remembered how the old Olympian had a way of "grabbing
                    me with his iron hands; and after he had flung me on high he would jounce me with his big knee, much
                    to the danger of my bones."<hi rend="sup">6</hi> This passage, which reads like a memory of
                    being in the hands of a god or superman and barely escaping with one's delicate life, has
                    arresting psychological overtones, not relevant enough to pause upon here. Maurice Thompson,
                    however, has almost nothing to say about his father or, for that matter, about any of his blood
                    relatives except his brother Will and his grandfather. He tried to slip his Primitive Baptist
                    heritage completely except as a remote, quaint, perhaps embarrassing, even terrifying old family
                    tradition. From the way Maurice treats them, it is hard to believe that Wilson Thompson lived until
                    1866, preaching his last sermon in the town of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, a month before he died;<hi rend="sup">7</hi> and that Grigg Thompson lived
                    until 1888, fighting the good fight until the end.</p>

            <p>Wilson Thompson's stature among Primitive Baptists, even those who opposed his views, was
                    not, at any rate, a product of latter-day distortion. His books on doctrine and his long articles in
                    Primitive Baptist periodicals, usually expounding in an earthy and yet highly eloquent rhetoric some
                    complicated interpretation of a passage from scripture, were sought after and reprinted, sometimes
                    long after his death.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> He was doctrinally a primitive among primitives. To
                    Primitive Baptists generally, most churches professing Calvinism had compromised on predestination
                    and were therefore impure. In 1845, Wilson Thompson detected such an impurity in his own church and
                    proceeded to lead a militant minority in the furious Anti-Means controversy, which actually got into <placeName>

                    report of this trial, in which Thompson was a principal witness, reveals every detail of Primitive
                    Baptist faith, liturgy, rules of decorum, church government, and, of course, the flinty and
                    litigious temperaments of the church leaders. The "means" people said <list type="footnotes">

                    salvation. To Wilson Thompson this was cheating: no means whatever were effective in salvation. The
                    gospel and the ministers' preaching were for the "comfort and
                    instruction" of God's chosen. If a man felt he was chosen, he could present
                    himself before the already-chosen for examination. If they decided he was indeed chosen, he was
                    offered the right hand of fellowship and partook of the comfort and instruction.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Such extreme predestinarianism, particularly when it was combined with the Baptist
                    insistence on complete separation of church and state, came very near making superfluous any church
                    organization or activity whatsoever. Indeed the activity that separated the Primitives from the main
                    body of the church in the 1820's and 1830's was an effort usually thought of as
                    representing the energy and courage of frontier Christianity at its best—the missionary
                    movement. A crucial moment in Wilson Thompson's career came when he was on his way to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> to join Elder Isaac McCoy's mission to the Indians.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
                    "Who hath required this at your hand?" demanded a voice in the woods.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> From that moment Wilson Thompson was a strong anti-missionist. The Primitives
                    could also find no scriptural authority for Sunday Schools, Bible Societies, or colleges to train
                    preachers to preach an obvious and unequivocal gospel.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What seems to be merely stubborn obtuseness in this doctrine made much frontier sense. The Baptists
                    as a whole believed and practiced a radical democracy—the Primitive Baptists a little
                    more so. Many of the Primitives even turned their backs on the all-conquering bourgeoisie. They
                    would not be governed by the tyranny of unrestricted fellowship and the economics of city life. They
                    were nearly all independent farmers, true Jeffersonian agrarians who lived out near the county line.
                    The monstrousness of large organization was to be feared continually. There was nothing wrong with
                    being a missionary if one felt called to be one. What was wrong was taking hard-earned money from
                    God's people to support a missionary society with offices in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Temperance was fine if God called one to temperance, but God would put into the hands
                    of no man such corrupting power as a sackful of offerings for the support of a temperance society
                    with headquarters far removed from the surveillance of the contributors. There was even nothing
                    wrong with a minister's being educated—as Wilson Thompson seems to have
                    been—if by chance God called an educated man to the ministry. But the idea of taxing
                    churches for the support of <placeName>

                    </placeName> College, where money might disappear in many mysterious ways, was an idea demanding
                    suspicion. These were very logical deductions of Primitive Baptist Protestantism.</p>

            <p>In fiction and legend, the Primitive Baptist is sometimes caricatured as a
                    "hard-shell," hard-drinking, gospel-shouting misanthrope.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
                    But very few frontier Protestants of whatever sect were permanently depressed or bigoted by a grim
                    theology. Grigg Thompson's granddaughter remembered the "booming,
                    contagious" laughter which accompanied the droll stories he told about his experiences as a
                    backwoods preacher.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> Primitive Baptist association meetings were week ends of
                    big picnics and big arguments, in addition, of course, to much praying and preaching. And then there
                    was the continually lusty, enervating battle of wits and Biblical learning with the other sects on
                    the frontier. The camp-meeting revivals were more spectacular, but some glamor and certainly much
                    heat could be generated by Primitive Baptist debates with such subtle enemies as the
                    Campbellites—to say nothing of the voluble Methodists. Such was the Primitives'
                    taste for vigorous argument that worthy opponents could be cultivated as friends. In T. S.
                    Stribling's novel <hi rend="i">The Forge</hi>, old Jimmy Vaiden is a hard-shell Baptist
                    whose best friend is a Methodist circuit rider primarily because Jimmy could get into good arguments
                    with a Methodist. Jimmy didn't like the Campbellite preacher because Jimmy's
                    simple mind couldn't find enough difference between hard-shell doctrine and Campbellism to
                    argue about.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> But to Primitives like the Thompsons, the Campbellites and even
                    wayward preachers of their own church, such as die Two-Seed-in-the-Spirit Predestinarians,<hi rend="sup">21</hi> were the most challenging opponents. When this combativeness was followed by
                    splits in the church, by splits in the splits, and by congregations reduced to a few old faithfuls
                    with almost complete alienation of the younger generation, the Primitive church began to lose its
                    vitality.</p>
            <p>Grigg Matthew Thompson, as a young man, had seen his father standing tall as a civic leader and
                    pillar of the church. Thirty years later, after many wanderings and troubles, Grigg himself is
                    "Old Thompson," something of an embarrassment to his friends the Canines and
                    something of an oddity to his own children. He did not always act heroic, but he did not quit until
                    he died. Somehow, it is hard to dismiss him the way his son Maurice dismissed him.</p>

                    seem to have lived in or near Calhoun, the county seat; and Thompson's leadership of the
                    nearby Harmony Church from 1861 to 1868 was long remembered as a golden age. "Old members
                    recall," writes the county historian, "that on a memorable Sunday, forty-six
                    adherents of the faith were admitted into the church after baptism by immersion in Town Creek

                            lived only one year. Soon after the birth of Diantha came the move to <placeName>

                            including the date of Maurice Thompson's birth, which he himself placed in 1844.
                            But this is contradicted by four successive census reports (1850, 1860, 1870, and 1880).

                    Canine and Thompson's "friend" C. L. Canine were well-to-do farmers and

                    and months went by without the acceptance of a new member. Thompson was never the titular leader of
                    the church. He was elected assistant to Elder J. J. Goben, the regular preacher, at the end of 1869
                    and was continued in that office a year later.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> He preached and prayed
                    frequently in these first two years; but at the very meeting where his assistantship was continued
                    at the end of 1870, he was accused by James Long of "disorder" for taking part in

                    revealed only obliquely by the church minutes. J. J. Canine, clerk of the congregation, brought up
                    the "disorder" charge again in October of 1871; and this time, in spite of his
                    earlier "exoneration," Thompson had to ask forgiveness for making an error. The

                    and the preacher had to move on, alone. Twenty years earlier, Grigg Thompson had written, to a

                    entered into the lists for the nineteenth and presumably last time against one of the old enemies,
                    an experienced Cambellite debater who, although he was a younger man, had one more official debate
                    to his credit than Thompson had. The proposition affirmed by Thompson has a familiar ring:
                    "The giving of Spiritual or eternal life to a sinner dead in sins, is the work of God,
                    independent of the written word of Scriptures." This the Cambellite, one Wilmeth, denied.
                    It was the old Means versus Anti-Means argument once again. The country had been shaken by Civil
                    War, Reconstruction, the Greenbackers, and the Haymarket Riot; but the eternal questions were
                    inexaustible and the debates went on forever. The reporter of this Last Tournament says,
                    "It was unanimously admitted by all, except the Campbellites, that Brother Thompson
                    sustained his proposition by Bible testimony and weight of argument, and defeated
                    Wilmeth… breaking the backbone of Campbellism and literally demolishing this miserable
                    modern system of materialism."<hi rend="sup">43</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Earlier in the same year Thompson had shown the old fire in a long letter to a new Primitive Baptist
                    paper being published in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, by one of his nephews. A quotation from this letter makes a good closing
                    cadence here, not only because it is one of Thompson's last statements, but because it is
                    essentially and necessarily typical of so many others. <quote rend="blockquote">

                            leprosy, until the whole body becomes a filthy cankerous, stinking corpse. This loathsome
                            and deadly disease may start in a society to raise money for the poor and the preacher, or
                            to employ an evangelist to visit the destitute churches, or for a church college, or a
                            church publishing house, and as it advances, like the same thing started about one hundred
                            years ago, you will bring the church in union with more than a score of humanly devised
                            institutions, and Christ and his laws will be forgotten by the ministry, and you will hear
                            nothing from your pulpits but these societies lauded as the most efficient means of grace
                            ever invented, and your money demanded to sustain them; and to get this money your church
                            house, erected for God's service, will be turned into a place of speculation and
                            money-gathering, and tea parties, strawberry and ice-cream feasts, oyster suppers, tableaux,
                            and festivals. All these must be practiced under the sanction of the church, and taught and
                            encouraged by the ministry. This is no painted picture, but a simple statement of facts that

                            his theory of abject poverty and non-resistance of evil. Mr. Howells' whole
                            doctrine is that mediocrity is all of human life that is interesting—that a mild
                            sort of vulgarity is the one living truth in the character of men and women. His criticisms
                            are written to insist upon the commonplace as the one desirable element in fiction. It is to
                            clinch and illustrate this doctrine that he approves Tolstoi's course in putting
                            his daughters out to work in the fields with peasants, and putting himself at the
                            shoemaker's bench in order, as he says, to be like Christ. Realism must go to this
                            length, or it must fall. If the picturesque, the lofty, the soul-stirring, in short, the
                            ideal must be driven from fiction, then the low, the coarse, the vulgar, the commonplace,
                            and at last the immoral must take its place…. These critics… have the
                            notion that to be a Christian one must wear brogans No. 10 and refuse to live on a carpet.
                            Indeed, realism, no matter what turn it takes, ends in abject vulgarity.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>

                    appointed literary editor of the <hi rend="i">Independent</hi> in 1889, he had published articles
                    and stories in the <hi rend="i">Atlantic</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Century</hi>, and he was known to
                    readers of popular romance as the author of a half dozen novels. Recognition of another kind came to
                    him also. He was invited to speak on various occasions, and he seized the opportunity to express his
                    ideas of literary art or to read his own poetry. Three such occasions occurred in 1893. In May he
                    delivered the Carew Lectures at Hartford Theological Seminary; on July 4 he read a patriotic poem
                    entitled "The Bloom o' the World" at the Roseland Park Festival,

            <p>It is the firm conviction of Father Thomas T. McAvoy, archivist and professor of history at the
                    University of Notre Dame, that "The divorce between government and religious institutions,
                    especially outside the thirteen original states, and the tendency to write history from governmental
                    sources has resulted in an underwriting and even an ignoring of religious history in the United
                        States."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> In his own capacity as a nationally recognized authority
                    on American Catholic history, McAvoy has devoted his intellectual talents to reversing the trend
                    which traditionally has placed such study among "the most neglected subjects in the
                    curricula of American Catholic institutions through high school, college, seminary and university
                        levels."<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>Thomas Timothy McAvoy was born at <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, on September 12, 1903. There he acquired his earliest education at Saint
                    John's School from the Sisters of Saint Joseph. After completing courses at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                    </placeName> Public High School, McAvoy entered Holy Cross, one of the theological colleges

                        <region type="county">Washington</region>
                    </placeName>. Shortly after his ordination to the priesthood on June 24, 1929, the young priest was
                    assigned to organize the uncataloged historical collections which had been amassed at the University
                    of Notre Dame by the late Professor James F. Edwards. Six years later he enrolled at <placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1938, Father McAvoy became chairman of Notre Dame's department of history,
                    a position he occupied with considerable success for the next twenty- one years. Since 1942 he has
                    been co-managing editor of the university's highly respected <hi rend="i">Review of
                        Politics</hi>.</p>
            <p>As a long-time professor of the cultural and social history of the United States, McAvoy has been
                    committed to the theory that the study of history "will lead the student into the real
                    world and teach him patience, precision, and humility in the face of truth"; and this, he
                    points out, "is no mean element in any liberal education."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> In

                    philosophize inimical to historical understanding and exposition and "a fundamental cause

                    liberal arts."<hi rend="sup">5</hi> The tenor of his own writing veers away from
                    generalizations, which he considers valid only if founded "in the facts of the past and not

            </p>
            <p>The cultural enrichment that a broad knowledge of history in a pluralistic society gives to priests
                    is extremely profitable; and in this vein, McAvoy notes, few studies offer a safer antidote for any
                    preconceived notion of economic determinism regarding the theory of man.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> The
                    Notre Dame historian has long advocated a deeper appreciation of history's place in
                    seminary programs, pointing out that "if the Catholic clergyman is to function properly as
                    pastor and teacher he must not be dependent upon the weekly pictorial magazines or the partisan
                    press for his information about the past."<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

            <p>As guardian now for almost four decades of the historical collections at Notre Dame, Father McAvoy
                    has repeatedly reminded his confreres about the advantages of becoming more thoroughly
                    manuscript-conscious. By calling attention to the "need for a concerted effort by those who
                    appreciate these personal, family, society, and group records to see that they are
                        preserved,"<hi rend="sup">9</hi> McAvoy has placed new emphasis on the scientific
                    techniques for eliminating myth from fact that grows out of carefully investigating the records of

            <p>Father McAvoy has exhibited special competence in writing about historical developments in the

                        <region type="county">Jefferson</region>
                    </placeName>," was widely hailed for its keen observation that "what is common to
                    both and what is peculiarly American is the fact that despite superficial changes each made more
                    secure the established American tradition of political democracy."<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
                    Perhaps McAvoy's willingness to delve into the nation's strictly secular history
                    grew out of his conviction that "the reading of official documents and the study of the
                    lives of our American leaders offer sound proofs that recent secularist and anti-religious attacks
                    on American institutions are contrary to the American tradition."<hi rend="sup">30</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The McAvoy prognosis is an optimistic one, for he is convinced that "American Catholicism is
                    just coming of age, forming a spirit of its own, with a tradition of its own and facing problems
                    that do not exist anywhere else in the Western World."<hi rend="sup">31</hi> He is quick to

                    Catholicity patterns of the nation.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> A goodly portion of his writing has
                    centered on the history of the relations between the Catholic minority and the dominant culture of
                    the country. While he admits a proportionate lack of Catholic influence on the national level,
                    McAvoy has criticized the bitter accusations made against the church's leadership as
                    "mostly cries of anguish and definitely not intelligent attempts to analyze the real
                    position of the Catholic minority with a view to the better use of its meager
                        resources."<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his many writings the Notre Dame historian has traced the Catholic minority through the various
                    stages of its growth in American society. He has demonstrated that the essential characteristics of
                    this religious group were established during the thirty years between John Carroll's
                    arrival from England as first bishop and Ambrose Marechal's return from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rome</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1821.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> In evaluating these patterns he has relied on the
                    so-called "Le Bras Method," which endeavors to work out an analytical formula for
                    the religious activities of a people in any given period of their history based on the contemporary
                    social, political, and economic factors involved.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One interesting phenomenon that stands out clearly in McAvoy's treatises is the freedom
                    discernible among Catholics in the United States. The American hierarchy, for example, is seen to be
                    freer and more self-sustained that any other hierarchy in the English-speaking world.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> Diversity is another unexpected characteristic. McAvoy shows that "if there is
                    one note that is forever absent in the story of Catholicity in the United States it is unity in
                    either political or social activities."<hi rend="sup">39</hi> If there is a Catholic vote,
                    it is only such in the sense that a good Catholic should always seek justice and public honesty in
                    every phase of American government and vote accordingly.<hi rend="sup">40</hi> The Notre Dame
                    historian does not overstate his position when he affirms that "in the Catholic Church in
                    the United States one can detect with differences of proportion, almost all the elements which go to
                    make up this great democracy of ours."<hi rend="sup">41</hi> The divergent opinions among
                    Catholics and between themselves and their neighbors about politics and business and social
                    positions are just part of the American way of life which would be suppressed only in a totalitarian
                        state.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>

            <p>Father McAvoy regrets that Catholics of the last century failed to heed the advice of John Lancaster
                    Spalding about the proper development of the Catholic minority and especially about
                    Spalding's concept of the nature and work of truly intellectual endeavors. Had the ideas of
                    the Bishop of Peoria been accepted, "the Catholic answer to the great social problems of
                    the age would be more clearly defined in American literature and Catholic higher education would be
                    far better equipped to withstand the materialistic pragmatism which is eating away at the very
                    essence of true humanism in American life."<hi rend="sup">43</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As an expert in the American phase of Catholic development, McAvoy has noted that there has never
                    been a real heresy during the three centuries and more of Catholic life within the boundaries of the
                    present United States.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> There have been "phantom heresies,"
                    however, and the shrewd observer can easily see how certain tendencies in the American Catholicism
                    of the 1890's were wrongly rationalized by Europeans into a New World brand of Modernism.
                    McAvoy has long considered this phenomenon one of the most interesting in all of American Catholic
                    history. According to him, there were no theological overtones in the cultural conflict between

                    His essay, "Americanism, Fact and Fiction," gives "in an admirable way

                    the troubles. It also treats of the European aspects that were expressed in the newspaper
                    controversies in France and Italy" and the theological and political productions that were

            <p>After World War II, McAvoy noticed some of the misunderstandings condemned by Leo XIII again in
                        evidence.<hi rend="sup">50</hi> This time, he noted, a "false Americanism is offered as
                    an improvement of Catholicism in the United States by those who do not seem to understand the
                    reasons for its present prosperity."<hi rend="sup">51</hi> This movement McAvoy decried,
                    reminding his readers that the tendency for Europeans to misjudge American Catholicism had always
                    existed and need not be given any serious consideration. Perhaps the most unfortunate result of the
                    whole Americanism issue was the sad effect it had on historical writing, for as Father McAvoy says,
                    "There has been a too great reluctance to discuss the accomplishments of those energetic
                    leaders of Catholicism at the turn of the century, whose zeal led them into the controversy but did
                    not keep them from working tirelessly in the service of the Church in America."<hi rend="sup">52</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the dismay of current educators, Father McAvoy points out that nearly every phase of present-day
                    arguments about the Catholic school was discussed in the period between 1870 and 1900. Far from
                    being an episcopal "imposition," the noted historian recalls that the Instruction
                    of 1875 establishing Catholic schools at the parish level was championed by the laity who were
                    unwilling to accept the more modest proposals of the nation's hierarchy.<hi rend="sup">53</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As an educator himself, McAvoy recognizes the need for certain changes in the contemporary Catholic
                    approach to learning, though he is wont to suspect that "the basic reason for the lack of
                    intellectual leaders among American Catholics is closely connected with a too great attachment of
                    Catholic families to this world's comforts."<hi rend="sup">54</hi> Considering the
                    cultural background of worldly poverty and limited resources available to Catholics, McAvoy feels
                    that Catholic higher education has not failed.<hi rend="sup">55</hi> In his own analysis of the
                    shortcomings discernible in the field, he observes that the seminary curriculum, which originally
                    formed the basis of Catholic collegiate courses, failed to take properly into consideration that
                    most of the students had chosen secular professions.</p>
            <p>If there is a failure on the part of Thomistic philosophy to meet current problems, then McAvoy
                    attributes that failure to the philosophers themselves, not to Scholasticism. He goes a step further
                    by suggesting that "the historian of Catholic education in the United States has some
                    justification for questioning the dominance of philosophers in our Catholic colleges and <list type="footnotes">

                        <region type="county">Washington</region>
                    </placeName> Julian pledged himself to the task of destroying all "oppression and
                    inequality," whether it took the "undisguised form of chattel slavery, or that
                    organized cupidity which makes labor the helpless drudge of capital, or that system of agricultural
                    serfdom which rests upon the unrestricted monopoly of the soil."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> For
                    nearly half a century—from the 1840's to the 1890's—this
                    Hoosier reformer labored to make freedom and opportunity for the individual a reality in America.
                    Slaveholders, capitalists, and land monopolists felt the lash of his fiery, vituperative tongue.
                    Today, unfortunately, Julian is remembered almost exclusively as a courageous antislavery crusader.
                    Joining the Free Soil forces in 1848 and the Republican party in 1854, he was certainly one of the
                    foremost abolitionists of the nineteenth century. But Julian was also a significant and influential
                    land reformer to whom the American homesteader was much indebted. The Hoosier's place in
                    history should rest as much on his fight against land speculation, land grants to railroads,
                    military land bounties, and cash sales of federal land as on his role as an abolitionist.
                    Julian's interest in public land policy began in the 1840's, almost as early as
                    his antislavery agitation, and continued until his death in 1899.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> He
                    accomplished his most significant work, however, during the period he served as congressman from
                    Indiana's "Burnt District" to the House of Representatives.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> During those twelve years, 1849–1851 and 1861–1871, Julian greatly
                    influenced federal land policy.</p>
            <p>Julian's career as reformer can best be understood as the working out of a creed he adopted
                    in 1843 from William Ellery Channing. In a volume of Channing's essays Julian found this
                    thought: "The grand doctrine that every human being should have the means of self-culture,
                    of progress in knowledge and virtue, of health, comfort, and happiness, of exercising the powers and
                    effections of a man,—this is slowly taking its place as the highest social
                    truth." Because Channing so clearly and concisely stated the very thoughts that whirled
                    through his own mind, Julian immediately committed <list type="footnotes">

                    of the good society toward which he would labor.</p>
            <p>Channing, however, offered Julian more than a vision; he also presented a resolution to an extremely
                    vexing problem. While still a boy Julian began to question the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> faith of his parents. His search for religious truth took him from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Unitarian to free thinker; but rather than peace, his quest brought only confusion
                    and depression. When he began working for the cause of abolition and land reform, as part of his
                    attempt to make his vision a reality, he very happily discovered that "just in
                    proportion" as he gave his "heart unselfishly to the work [of reform], the
                    doctrinal doubts and anxieties that had so troubled me faded away…." He quickly
                    concluded that for him the "only safe 'plan of salvation' is that of
                    personal duty and endeavor."<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Never confident that his faith would
                    assure salvation, Julian turned to a doctrine of hard work for good causes to accomplish the same
                    objective. The need for personal strength and tranquility of mind continued to generate reform
                    activity for the rest of Julian's life.</p>
            <p>To less dedicated people reformers sometimes seem arrogant, humorless, pugnacious, and
                    holier-than-thou. Julian's unshakable belief in the righteousness of his objectives and the
                    purity of his own motives certainly made him appear this way to some of the men who wrote about him
                    at his death.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> "With truth on my side," Julian boasted,
                    "I was delighted to find myself perfectly able, single-handed, to fight my
                        battle…."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> His broad Utopian vision made politics appear
                    a moral struggle; therefore, as a politician his job was to accomplish "moral and political
                        regeneration."<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Years after his congressional career had ended he
                    could proudly state, "Step by step I saw my constituents march up to my
                        position."<hi rend="sup">9</hi> Self-righteous, impatient, and intense, he was also an
                    able, earnest, and sincere man who worked with indefatigable ardor to create a better and more just
                    society.</p>
            <p>Julian never had to fear becoming a radical without a cause, for mid- nineteenth century America
                    abounded with causes for social missionaries. One of the oldest was land reform. Roy M. Robbins has
                    described the history of the national land system as basically a struggle between two forces,
                    speculation and squatterism, the man of wealth and the poor man. From the early days of the republic
                    land reformers raised their voices in support of the squatter, but they were often drowned out by
                    the more potent spokesmen of the speculator. Generally, the speculator's position was
                    adopted by <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Julian was born in 1817 on the Indiana frontier and reared near the pioneer community of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Centerville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, located on the national road midway between the two forks of the <geogName>Whitewater
                        River</geogName>. His own family could have benefited from a homestead policy had it been in
                    effect in 1823. In that year, when Julian was only six, his father died. His mother scraped together
                    what was left of the family money to purchase a fifty-acre farm.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Julian
                    remembered these lean years as a "struggle for survival."12 Land reform was a
                    familiar subject to people in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Centerville</settlement>
                    </placeName> area. The local paper frequently carried articles supporting the cause and favoring the
                    adoption of a homestead law.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> The persuasive arguments of the French political
                    economist, Jean- Baptiste Say, were also familiar to Julian. In his <hi rend="i">Political
                    Economy</hi> Say showed that unused land was valueless, but land that was farmed benefited both the
                    individual farmer and the nation as a whole.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Individual ownership of land became the crux of Julian's own maturing plan for universal
                    human freedom. Through his reading and personal experience he came to believe that no man could be
                    truly free as long as he had to till another man's soil. Land ownership was the traditional
                    trademark of American democracy, and the fact that the country was entering a new industrial era did
                    not alter Julian's concepts. It made him more adamant in his convictions. Like Thomas <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jefferson</region>
                    </placeName>, he had a horror of the effects of the industrial revolution on America.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> The Hoosier declared that industry "tends to aggregate our people in towns and
                    cities, and render them mere consumers, instead of dispersing them over our territory, and tempting
                    them to become the owners of land and the creators of wealth." Moreover, it fostered
                    "the taste for artificial life and the excitements to be found in great centers of
                    populations, instead of holding up the truth that 'God made the country,' and
                    intended it to be peopled and enjoyed." Julian dreamed of men with their families, working
                    for themselves on their own farms, depending neither on capital nor slaves, developing those
                    "characteristics called virtues."<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

                    </placeName>, Julian was concerned with the political implications of the nation's land
                    system. In Julian's mind the impact of the land policy on the nation's development
                    could not be overstated. "Laws regulating the ownership and disposition of landed
                    property," he said, "not only affect the well-being but frequently the destiny of
                    a people." The land system, in fact, directly determined the political system of a country.
                    Real political democracy depended on democratic land holdings.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> If the
                    nation's democratic institutions were to be preserved, the United States needed
                    "small farms, thrifty tillage, compact settlements, free schools, and equality of political
                    rights," and not "large estates, slovenly agriculture, widely-scattered
                    settlements, popular ignorance, and a pampered aristocracy lording over the people."<hi rend="sup">18</hi> Large landed estates, therefore, were antithetical to both economic and
                    political democracy. Like many men from the agrarian West, Julian adhered to a philosophy that would
                    not be appreciated by a new, rising breed of industrial capitalists.</p>
            <p>The idea that government should give land outright to actual settlers, surrendering entirely the
                    seeking of revenue, had been presented to Congress as early as 1814; but until Thomas Hart <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName> introduced his Graduation Bill in 1825, which provided for outright grants of refuse
                    lands, nothing approaching this idea received action by the national government. By the early
                    1850's, however, the West was almost completely won over to homesteading;<hi rend="sup">19</hi> and, as the expansionist and slavery issues temporarily slipped into the background after
                    the Compromise of 1850, new advocates of free land for the landless went into action. Andrew <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Johnson</region>
                    </placeName>, friend of the poor white class of the South, had previously introduced his cherished
                    homestead bill in Congress but had received no favorable action. In the short session of 1850-1851, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Johnson</region>
                    </placeName> again introduced his bill, this time gaining the support of a freshman representative,
                    Free Soiler George W. Julian.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

            <p>On January 29, 1851, the thirty-three-year-old "Burnt District" representative

                    the Compromise of 1850, the "final settlement" of the slavery issue, by combining
                    with his advocacy of the homestead principle an out-and-out abolition argument. Julian told the
                    House that the homestead bill would make a "formidable barrier" against the

                            antislavery elements of both major parties bolted in 1848 to form the Free Soil party, which
                            was dedicated to keeping slavery from expanding into the territories. Antislavery sentiment
                            had long been strong in the "Burnt District," in part because of the large
                            population of Quakers. Julian, running as a Free Soiler, owed his election to the strong
                            antislavery forces in his district and to the votes of many Democrats, who entered no
                            candidate of their own. Riddleberger, <hi rend="i">George W. Julian</hi>, 45-50.</item>

                    acres, and because slavery needed extensive estates to flourish, Julian explained that slavery could
                    never establish a foothold in the public lands under such a policy. The outspoken Hoosier was
                    convinced that the homestead principle offered far greater protection against slavery than Daniel
                    Webster's "ordinances of nature."<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Julian did not advocate the homestead measure just because it was a handy and effective tool to use
                    against southern slavery. To him, it was a great humanitarian effort which fulfilled his dream that
                    every family would have the opportunity to earn a home on the public domain. Homes kept men from
                    crime and almshouses, he declared, and gave them a surrounding conducive to "virtue, to the
                    prosperity of the country, and to loyalty to its government and laws." Not only would the
                    homestead bill aid the poorer classes, he claimed, but all classes would benefit. In a plan somewhat
                    reminiscent of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>'s American System, Julian contended that homesteads would create markets for
                    eastern manufacturers and produce foodstuffs for eastern cities. At the same time it would draw off
                    from urban centers surplus laborers who were the source of crime and poverty.</p>
            <p>He insisted, furthermore, that the government's coffers would not suffer by giving land away
                    rather than selling it. Instead of diminishing public revenue, the homestead bill would actually
                    increase it. Governmental revenues were chiefly derived from duties on imports, he explained; and
                    because home- steading would increase national production, the nation's exports would
                    increase. He predicted that the rise in exports would be matched by a corresponding rise in imports.
                    Thus, under the homestead principle, he said, "Humanity and the dollar will go
                        together."<hi rend="sup">22</hi> The homestead bill was more to Julian than an
                    antislavery measure or a humanitarian effort or an economic enterprise; it was a national panacea.
                    His coupling of free land with free soil, however, did not help the chances of the measure; and both
                    the Senate and the House failed to approve the homestead bill.</p>
            <p>More than a decade lapsed before Congress passed the Homestead Act. It was almost that long before
                    Julian returned to Congress. Defeated for reelection in 1851, he resumed his seat in Congress ten
                    years later, quickly becoming important in the radical Republican faction. Because of his hatred and
                    disgust for the institution of slavery, he returned to <placeName>

            <p>As long as slaves were chained to southern plantations, Julian's primary goal was the
                    extinction of Negro slavery. This crusade, however, did not preclude spirited work for land reform,
                    the emancipation of the American farmer. When Speaker Schuyler A. Golfax, in December, 1861, offered
                    him an appointment to the important House Committee on Public Lands, the Indiana representative
                    leaped at the chance. Reforming the "undemocratic" and
                    "monopolistic" land system had long been a "pet project";
                    indeed, it would become no less a missionary effort for the Indiana crusader than freeing the

            <p>Because of the overwhelming problems accompanying the outbreak of the Civil War, it was not until
                    early in 1862 that Congress concertedly attempted to deal with other questions. Just as the cries of
                    the emancipationists were reaching a shrill pitch, there arose a demand to implement other planks of
                    the Republican platform of 1860. That platform protested against, among other things, "any
                    sale or alienation to others of the public lands held by actual settlers," and against
                    "any view of the free-homestead policy which regards the settlers as paupers or suppliants
                    for public bounty…." In short, it demanded a "complete and satisfactory

            <p>During the debate on this measure Justin Morrill, the vigorous <placeName>

                    stating that he favored the bill in principle., he asserted simply that the war made it inexpedient
                    to pass such a sweeping measure. Seeing a chance to enter the fray, Julian jumped to his feet to
                    rebuke Morrill. Even though the <placeName>

                    castigate him for believing that vacant land had value or in any way aided the northern war effort.
                    Harking back to his theme of 1851, he advocated settlement as the best way for the public lands to
                    bring in revenue and fill the <placeName>

            <p>On May 20, 1862, President Lincoln signed the Homestead Act. At the time Julian was as joyful and as
                    sanguine as any of its supporters. "It was a magnificent triumph of freedom and free labor
                    over the slave power," he thundered, and "its final success is among the blessed

                    through which speculators and monopolists could squeeze. He then began his determined effort to plug
                    these holes. By 1883 events had forced Julian to admit that there were fatal mistakes in the bill.
                    The "half-way measure," he said grimly, furnished "a remarkable
                    commentary upon the boasted friendship of the Republican party for the landless poor."<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In less than a month after Congress approved the Homestead Act, another plank of the Republican
                    platform was on the statute books. On July 1, 1862, Julian joined with his fellow congressmen to
                    incorporate the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Union</region>
                    </placeName> Pacific Railroad Company, endowing it with 30,000,000 acres of public land, the most
                    liberal land grant in history. Within a few years Julian would become the most outspoken critic of
                    railroad land grants in Congress, but it was not until after the Civil War that he finally realized
                    the extent of this threat to the homestead principle. In 1862, in the heat of the war, he believed
                    that the nation's defense demanded that the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Union</region>
                    </placeName> be tied together with the black steel ribbons, whatever the cost.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The settlers' watchdog, however, was not completely asleep; for when Morrill presented his
                    bill granting public lands to states and territories for the purpose of establishing agricultural
                    and mechanical colleges, Julian sprang to the settlers' defense. He branded the plan
                    "legalized plunder" which vitiated the homestead principle passed barely two weeks
                    earlier. The new bill provided that those states with no public lands in their borders would receive
                    shares of college scrip, or land office money, which could be sold. These grants, Julian declared,
                    would be nothing more than "monopolies" donated to states which would dispose of
                    them with only revenue in mind and without a second thought for the settler. What good would the
                    Homestead Act do, he queried, if the eastern states looted the West of its broad domain? He
                    prophesied that MorrilPs bill would not be successful in endowing colleges; for when the college
                    scrip flooded the market, its price would drop to a fraction of what the land was worth. Thus, in
                    the end, only the speculator would benefit.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> Few congressmen were impressed
                    with the Hoosier's reasoning, and on July 2, 1862, the bill became law. Eventually under
                    the Morrill Act nearly 11,000,000 acres—an area slightly less than half that of
                    Indiana—passed into the hands of the states, much of which in turn went to land
                    speculators. Scrip land sold at prices as low as fifty cents an acre, and as a result in many states
                    school funds were low.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>

            <p>During the Civil War none of the bills passed concerning public land permitted the states in
                    rebellion to partake of any of the benefits. The seceded states received no grants of land for
                    railroad construction or for agricultural colleges, nor were they able to take advantage of the
                    Homestead Act.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> Rather than offering the areas in rebellion additional land,
                    some northern congressmen ached to appropriate existing southern holdings. Just before Congress
                    adjourned in the spring of 1862, Julian joined the radicals in passing the Second Confiscation
                        Act.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> As originally framed it demanded the confiscation of all property of

                    </placeName> would sign the bill, he insisted that Congress approve a joint resolution which
                    softened the measure. The resolution declared that confiscation would not be retroactive and that

                    </placeName>'s plan of limited confiscation as shortsighted and a disgusting
                    "anti-republican discrimination" just when "the nation was struggling for
                    its life against a rebellious aristocracy founded on the monopoly of land and ownership of
                    negroes." Unlike <placeName>

                    </placeName>, he envisioned <hi rend="i">permanent</hi> confiscation of southern lands. Permanent
                    confiscation was, in fact, a necessary prerequisite to the plan which crystalized in
                    Julian's mind. His plan combined confiscation, homesteading, and military bounties. After
                    the rebels had forfeited all lands in the insurgent districts, Julian wanted the land divided into
                    free homesteads for men who had served in the military service or who had otherwise aided in putting
                    down the rebellion. Julian wanted Negro laborers specifically included as eligible. To make it a
                    genuine homestead bill instead of a pure land bounty, a residence of five years would be
                        required.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> When Congress reconvened in December, 1862, Julian began

                    speak on the business before the House. Joshua Reed Giddings, in a January, 1863, letter to Julian,
                    had prodded, "Why don't you give us a speech that shall shake that old
                        capital?"<hi rend="sup">37</hi> Perhaps the Hoosier accepted his friend's
                    suggestion, for he gave his most vigorous and bitter speech yet. Reaffirming his view of the war as

                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>

                    plantation land was brief, but it served notice of what would be one of the Hoosier
                    representative's main concerns for the remainder of the war.</p>
            <p>The appointment of Julian to the chairmanship of the Committee on Public Lands in December, 1863, was
                    the official event that marked the new era in his career. Happily he asserted that "it
                    opened a coveted field of labor" on which he "entered with zeal." The
                    chairmanship continued for eight years and gave him a decided advantage for presenting measures
                    bearing on the land question. He made the most of his position.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> Julian had
                    always emphasized the close relationship between the homestead principle and the destruction of
                    slavery. During the fifties he had preached that homesteading would render the plantation system
                    impossible on the public domain. With the outbreak of the war and the actual passage of the
                    Homestead Act, he had won the battle which he thought would save northern territories from slavery.
                    He was then able to ask, could not the homesteading of southern land effectively destroy the
                    plantation—the breeding place of slavery? He believed that only by drastically reforming
                    the whole land system of the South could the emancipated slave be truly and forever free.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Even while the Civil War raged, Julian made tremendous efforts in Congress to weld land reform and
                    reconstruction together. He contemplated the genuine emancipation of the slaves by breaking up once
                    and for all the large agricultural estates of the South, thereby destroying its landed aristocracy
                    and punishing it for its rebellion against the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Union</region>
                    </placeName>. Thus, homesteading in the South would become a two-edged ax, chopping at both land
                    monopoly and the old slaveholding aristocracy. Unfortunately for Julian and his program, the Civil
                    War was, in part, a contest for supremacy between southern agricultural capitalists and northern
                    industrial capitalists. As long as the northern railroad, mining, and lumbering interests were
                    convinced that land legislation was a means of remolding and controlling the South, Julian received
                    powerful support and won some success. But when it came into conflict with those northern interests,
                    Julian found himself brushed aside. In the end he battled both northerners and southerners in his
                    attempt to reconstitute southern society.<hi rend="sup">41</hi>

            <p>On March 18, 1864, Julian presented to the House a bill which represented the culmination of his
                    ideas on homesteading confiscated southern lands.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> In its final form the bill
                    provided for eighty-acre tracts for soldiers, while other loyal persons, without regard for race or
                    color, could procure half that amount. "The bill is novel," the Hoosier admitted
                    in his accompanying speech, but the "civil war in which we are engaged is one of the
                    grandest novelties the world has ever seen."<hi rend="sup">43</hi> Julian declared that one
                    of Congress' greatest responsibilities was the protection of the Homestead Act. This act
                    was already endangered, he claimed, by those who insisted that the public lands would have to be
                    sold to pay the war debt. Julian explained that even more threatening were the lavish grants of land
                    to railroads, agricultural colleges, and female normal schools. Speculators were "cheating
                    the government out of their productive wealth, and the poor man out of the home which else might be
                    his at the end of the war." If Congress did not want the nation to return to the
                    "Jewish darkness of land speculators and public plunder," it had to pass an
                    immediate and effective remedy.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The cure Julian prescribed was his scheme of confiscating and homesteading. Millions of acres of
                    additional land would be made available to faithful soldiers and loyal landless poor. More
                    immigrants would be tempted to put "land to the plow and make it pay and produce."
                    The freedman's wistful dream of "forty acres and a mule" would be
                    fulfilled. This rebellion had been considered a "slaveholders'
                    rebellion," but, he declared, it was also a "landholders'
                    rebellion." Julian claimed that the slaveholders owned five- sixths of all the land in the
                    South while constituting only one-fifteenth of the population. The bill, therefore, sought no
                    sweeping confiscation of land, only restoration to the people of their "inalienable
                    rights." It would do no more than break up and distribute the vast land monopoly of the
                    South.</p>
            <p>The Hoosier reformer turned next to a consideration of the legality of his confiscation measure. The
                    act of rebellion, he asserted, was an act of "suicide," which meant that the
                    traitors had no constitutional rights. "For them the Constitution had ceased to
                    exist." He declared that the "honest refusal" of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> to allow Congress to touch the real estate of the rebels "was the saddest and
                    grandest mistake of his life."<hi rend="sup">45</hi> Julian pleaded with Congress to repeal
                    the joint resolution passed the previous year protecting rebel land. He explained to the House that
                    Lincoln had changed his mind about the right of Congress to confiscate the landed estates of rebels.
                    He did not elaborate his claim; but two decades later when he wrote his <hi rend="i">Recollections</hi>, Julian explained that one day while he was visiting the President, <placeName>

                    bill, he had not examined the matter thoroughly and that after further reflection and study he
                    thought that he would then sign a bill striking at rebel property.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether or not Congress allowed rebel land to be appropriated, Julian continued, millions of acres in
                    the South would fall into its hands in other ways, such as military seizures and forfeitures for the
                    nonpayment of taxes. Congress, therefore, had to choose between two courses: either the land must be
                    placed under the jurisdiction of the government "in trust for the people," or it
                    would fall into the grasp of speculators. The rich lands of the South, Julian asserted,
                    "have been cursed by this evil [land monopoly] from the beginning; and without the
                    interposition of Congress the system will be continued and vitalized anew by falling into fresh
                        hands."<hi rend="sup">47</hi> If the "loyal millions" were to have
                    homes on the land, the government would have to guard them from the "remorseless exactions
                    of capital," and from the "pitiless rapacity for avarice." By thus
                    throwing down the gauntlet to northern capitalists, Julian courted and eventually won the enmity of
                    a most powerful interest. "Mr. Speaker," he said in conclusion, "nothing
                    can atone for the woes and sorrows of this war but the thorough reorganization of society in these
                    revolted States."<hi rend="sup">48</hi> Making perfectly clear the dual purpose of his
                    bill, he demanded that Congress see to it that the South was "studded over with small farms
                    and tilled by free men."<hi rend="sup">49</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the next two months Julian battled to get his bill through Congress. On May 11, 1864, he again
                    forced debate on the measure.<hi rend="sup">50</hi> Representative Fernando Wood, Peace Democrat
                    from <placeName>

                    </placeName> and staunch opponent of the bill, declared his belief that there was a motive other
                    than home- steading the South in Julian's proposal. Julian's extraordinary zeal in
                    presenting the measure, he explained, first made him wary. "I suspected there was an
                    African somewhere," Wood said, "and after some search I have found him."
                    The bill specifically stated that there would be no distinction between races in its operation.
                    "There is the nigger, sir," he cried. The New Yorker claimed that Julian was
                    trying to aid "his black friends" under the "pretext of doing a patriotic
                    and humane act in behalf of our soldiers and sailors…." Wood's greatest
                    objection to the bill was its assumption that the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Union</region>
                    </placeName> would never be restored; for if it were to be restored, each state must come back with
                    its territory intact. All confiscated property would either have to be paid for or returned.<hi rend="sup">51</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Evidently Julian did not care to dispute the charge that he was the Negroes' friend, but he
                    did disagree with the charge that his bill would be <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName> and Julian over the question of who—southern plantation owners or itinerant
                    northern schoolmasters—was responsible for the white blood in mulattoes, Congress voted
                    on the bill. It passed the House by the close vote, largely along party lines, of 75 to 64. Before
                    the Senate could take up the act, Attorney General James Speed stopped confiscation in the South by
                    ordering that all property seized by the federal authorities be restored to its owners.<hi rend="sup">53</hi> Julian's hope for confiscation did not end with this defeat. He
                    hoped that the 1864 national Republican platform would endorse his measure. A platform subcommittee
                    favorably reported such a plank, but it failed to pass the general resolutions committee.<hi rend="sup">54</hi> Although Julian did win some success in opening the South to homesteading in
                    1866 when Congress approved his Southern Homestead Bill, which extended the Homestead Act of 1862 to
                    nearly 50,000,000 acres of public lands in the South, his defeat in 1864 marked virtually the end of
                    his agitation on the confiscation question.<hi rend="sup">55</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In March, 1864, during the heat of the battle for his confiscation act, Julian asked, "Of
                    what avail would be an act of Congress totally abolishing slavery, or an amendment of the
                    Constitution forever prohibiting it if the old agricultural basis of aristocratic power shall
                        remain?"<hi rend="sup">56</hi> Julian maintained this sentiment throughout his long
                    life, but on January 31, 1865, his skepticism about the efficacy of a constitutional amendment to
                    abolish slavery temporarily dissolved under the flood tide of emotion generated when Congress began
                    balloting on the Thirteenth Amendment. When the amendment became law, Julian felt that he
                    "had been born into a new life" and that "the world was overflowing with
                    beauty and joy." He was "inexpressibly thankful" for the privilege of
                    recording his name on "so glorious a page in the nation's history."<hi rend="sup">57</hi> Even though Julian continued to believe and to preach that the newly freed
                    men needed free land, he felt relieved enough to turn his full attention for the first time to the
                    thorny problems in land policy that had no direct relationship to slavery.</p>
            <p>Almost immediately Julian was back at work on land reform, this time advocating a complete overhaul

            <p>Although Julian labored in the whole spectrum of social reform, reforming the nation's land
                    system was his most persistent and perhaps his most significant activity. He established his basic
                    position on public land policy early in his career; and once established, he held to it tenaciously.
                    "It may be taken for granted as a general truth," he said in 1851, "that
                    a nation will be powerful, prosperous, and happy, in proportion to the number of independent
                    cultivators of its soil."<hi rend="sup">59</hi> Julian fought to bring about the United

                    career proved, however, that no other man had the homesteader more at heart, spent more energy
                    protecting him, or more loved the world he symbolized than George W. Julian.</p>

                    helped with the family business of weaving. In. 1818 the Kellogg family—including Miner,
                    two older brothers, and a younger sister— left <placeName>

               </placeName>, where it was hoped a less rigorous
                    climate might improve Mrs. Kellogg's health. When they arrived in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, friends persuaded them to remain; and the trip to Tennessee was
                    abandoned. Mrs. Almira Kilbourne (Harris) Kellogg, Miner's mother, died in December, 1820,
                    probably of tuberculosis. In March, 1822, the boy's father, Charles Fraser Kellogg, married
                    Miss Elizabeth Gazley. Charles Kellogg was apparently quite a successful tailor in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>

                    family returned from southern Indiana, Miner's stepmother, who had helped to raise him and
                    whom he greatly admired, also died. Although Charles Kellogg was eventually married a third
                    time—to Mrs. Eliza (Smith) Downes—Miner remained in the home of James W.
                    Gazley, brother of the second Mrs. Kellogg.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

                    finally set up a studio of his own. Kellogg eventually gained considerable renown as a painter and
                    copier of portraits. His copy of a Gilbert Stuart picture of George <placeName>

                    turn brought an appointment to West Point—not as a cadet but as a student of science and
                    design. After his study there Kellogg did portraits of President Martin Van Buren, Governor James K.

                    extensively in Europe and the Near East. In 1858 the forty-four-year-old Kellogg married Celia

                    Virginia Somers Kellogg, born April 25, 1860. Throughout the rest of his life Kellogg traveled and
                    painted widely in the United States and abroad. Today many of his works may be seen in the

                    Say, he developed an interest in zoology—his self-constructed straw hat becoming
                    "a general receptacle of specimens." Kellogg also mentioned his first venture in
                    portrait painting, a "pretty fair" sketch of Robert <placeName>

                    prominent place in the new community. Occasionally an old man's bitterness interrupts the
                    child's memories. Writing in 1886, Kellogg often appears to deride his father for following <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Owen</region>
                    </placeName> "in an experimental effort to benefit the 'human

                    dissatisfaction with a scholar's supposed leisure; but only an elder Kellogg would have
                    concluded, "In other words the drones became the masters of the hive, and it was only a

                    clouded—of two important years in the history of southern Indiana. His descriptions of
                    school life, the famous people he met, the teachers who encouraged him, and the amusements of a boy
                    amid the workings of a "new society" are interesting and valuable.</p>

            <p>Up to this time [1825] my father had supported himself by his trade that of a tailor and was one of
                    the most excellent and fashionable of the City [<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>]. Had he been content to follow up his business he might have laid by a
                    competence—but he had no love of money, his heart was in some way inclined another way
                    which lead his mind to the contemplation of those abstract subject[s] which could be of little
                    service in the accumulation of means of immediate and direct benefit to himself. He scarcely ever
                    discussed commercial matters though he did political economy because it was of general concern, or
                    of benefit to the community at large. This wavering between the choice of a line of personal benefit
                    or a line of general good to humanity—kept his mind in just that unsettled condition as
                    prepared it for the reception of any plausible doctrines that promised a revolution in the accepted
                    order of things and which would create an entirely new System in the organization of society for the
                    good of the human race!</p>
            <p>This was just that condition of thought which was ready to receive the ideas of a <hi rend="i">new

                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi> In editing this portion of Kellogg's autobiography every
                            effort has been made to retain the author's spelling, grammar, punctuation, and
                            style. Kellogg frequently omitted periods after abbreviations and sometimes failed to place
                            them at the end of sentences. His spelling was not always perfect, and occasionally he did
                            not begin his sentences with capital letters. These lapses and idiosyncracies have been
                            retained and have not been indicated by a [sic] as long as the meaning remained clear. In
                            many instances it was impossible to distinguish between Kellogg's capital and lower
                            case letters and between his periods, commas, and dashes. His intentions regarding
                            paragraphing were also difficult to ascertain. Decisions in these cases were necessarily
                            arbitrary, but whenever possible modern usage prevailed. In several instances additions
                            and/or deletions and erasures were made in what appeared to be the original manuscript.
                            Although it was impossible to tell whether Kellogg or someone else made the changes, what
                            seemed to be the most recent version was used. The following items have been standardized:
                            all raised letters have been brought down to the line; all flourishes or embellishments have
                            been removed; obvious repetition of words and phrases has been deleted; underscored words
                            have been italicized. With only four exceptions, Mr. Parsons, Gilmore, Ran Boss, and Ethan
                            Williams, all individuals mentioned in the document have been identified in footnotes. The
                            original autobiography is located in the Indiana Historical Society Library, <placeName>

                    colt and I was placed behind him and we made the journey through the uninhabited forest in great
                    glee, everything was fresh and joyous the bids plentiful gay in colors and musical. This in the
                    month of April 1824 The end of our journey took us by surprize from a hill overlooking the beautiful
                    village lying silent, clean and inviting in the plain below, with the silvery stream of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> encircling it in the distance with the bright green canebrakes and prairies of <placeName>

                    </placeName> in the far distance. It was indeed the picture of Paradise to me and I was loth to
                    descend the hill for a nearer view. But we had to move on to our destiny. The village was laid out
                    symetrically in squares bounded by wide streets, clean and white, but not a soul or animal to be
                    seen. It was Sunday—every body within their domiciles. We rode slowly through the street
                    fronting us not knowing where to find Mr. Owen. But noticing a goodsized house painted red differing
                    from all others we concluded it to be for public uses and rode towards it—no one yet in
                    sight from whom to get information—when we noticed a man emerge from the house and await
                    us before the door in expectancy. We saluted him and Parsons told him who we were "<hi rend="i">from <placeName>

                    aspect—bade us welcome in quiet and Fatherly tones, and reaching up for me took me in his
                    arms to descend—greeting me with a kiss, placed me upon the ground with the remark that I

                    the future. He was entirely alone not a member of his family had yet arrived, and Mr. Parsons soon
                    became the recipient of the projects to be carried out in the immediate future for establishing of
                    the Colony.</p>

            <p>A sufficient number of the followers of Rapp had been left in Harmony to take charge and care of

                    consisted principally of the manufactories, dwellings and stationary property— and of
                    horses, cows, and other live stock which ranged the fields. There had been left a supply of
                    everything necessary for the convenience and temporary support of the New Comers. Some of the
                    factories were still running with the old hands, mostly women, who were to be withdrawn after being
                    supplemented by new ones. Families on arriving were distributed in various abodes now vacant and put
                    into some employment suited to their qualifications, such as farmers, mechanics and teachers. My
                    Father took a leading part in this labor of organization. It was not long before he was in some

                            the Harmony Society. Dissatisfied with the teachings of the Lutheran Church, Rapp broke away
                            and preached to a group of his own followers in Germany. Later he and his associates moved
                            to America; established a community, Harmony, near <placeName>

                            </placeName>, Pennsylvania, in 1804; and founded the Harmony Society in 1805. In 1815 Rapp
                            moved his community to Indiana, founding the town of Harmonie on the <geogName>Wabash

                            work, equality, and celibacy was the rule. In 1825 the Harmonists sold their town to Robert <placeName>

                    <pb n="50" id="VAA4025-064-1-056"/> a vivid recollection of a scene occurring in our visit through a
                    large woolen Factory then in operation. As soon as it was made known that a distinguished foreigner
                    was visiting it—the machinery was stopped—and the spinners [Rappites] grouped
                    in their different rooms in respectful silence to receive the guest. These operatives were all women
                    and girls in their tidy simple dresses, and modest agreeable countenances. After a few words of
                    greeting from the Visitors as they passed into the different rooms, these working girls almost
                    seized me in their arms one after another, and embraced and kissed me as something entirely new and
                    pleasant to their lives. This attention was more agreeable to them than to me, for I knew not what
                    to make of it nor how to return it with grace, it became a little too much of a good thing and
                    embarrassed me greatly. I learned however afterwards to account for the scene. There had been no
                    children in their community since their families had departed for their distant abodes, hundreds of
                    miles away! But the Prince and Mr <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Owen</region>
                    </placeName> were evidently pleased at this exhibition of womanly tenderness and instinct.</p>
            <p>We made excursions daily, and I walked between these two agreeable men, each taking me by the hand
                    whilst they observed and chatted. The Prince remained several days and on his departure thoughtfully
                    left with me as a <hi rend="i">souvenir</hi> of his visit, a merry, knowing little poodle full of
                    tricks that he had brought all the way from Germany and who had been my jolly playmate in our walks
                    about the village. His name was <hi rend="i">Pico</hi>, and I shall never forget him. He died in a
                    few weeks of distemper and it was a long time before I ceased to weep for him—<hi rend="i">Poor Pico</hi>!</p>
            <p>As soon as enough children had arrived to form into classes, schools were established for their
                    reception and care. There was one large boarding school which was conducted on the Military Mess
                    system with two long tables parallel in one room. Into this the scholars were marched with military
                    precision to their allotted places, and thus marched out together to the playgrounds where they were
                    dismissed. Indeed the whole exercises were carried out in a prescribed and regular military manner.</p>
            <p>Into this school I was placed. The food was of the simplest and cheapest kind—no meats, no
                    eggs, no pies—Nothing in fact but corn mush and milk. This was good and healthy to those
                    that liked it—but I didnot—it so disagreed with me that I could not touch the
                    mush, the milk only was sipped up, hence I was nearly starved. Whenever I could do so after
                    dismissal I would slip into the kitchen door and beg for something to eat— and I was
                    often gratifies [sic] by the kind old cook giving me a good sized piece of the hardbaked mush which
                    adhered to the large iron pot. There seemed to be a determined effort to starve me out of my
                    fastidiousness and to keep up the principle of equality among the scholars—all must be
                    treated alike. In the playground—quite a field behind the school, were erected swings

                    to us all: and here also we were regularly <pb n="51" id="VAA4025-064-1-057"/> drilled in squads and
                    companies in all military movements by experienced men. Our recitations were conducted in so
                    agreeable a manner that all were interested and studied faithfully—there was no need of
                    severity in any case. In fact the established order of government was one of kindness—
                    persuasion and love: an order more acceptable to the scholars, than agreeable to the
                    teachers—for the latter were compelled to keep a check on their impatience, and to govern
                    their own tempers when sorely tried. I recall one laughable instance of this. One of our best
                    instructors was an Irishman of fine abilities named <hi rend="i">Gilmore</hi>. He was marching us
                    down a broad street for exercise and drill formed into one long line across the street. We could
                    keep a line well dressed but for one gawky lazy overgrown boy named Ran Boss, who would persistently
                    fall a step behind. Gilmore would frequently touch him up from behind with a long fishing pole of
                    cane—still he lagged behind—at last Gilmore lost all patience and temper after
                    exhausting kind words—then he brought his long pole suddenly to his aid by a swishing
                    sweep across the back of Ran who found his proper place very quickly. But the whole line broke as if
                    by one impulse—the boys scattering in all directions with the cry of "Old
                    School"—Old School"—with Gilmore in great passion following
                    those he could reach with his pole—uttering his malediction as he ran. "<hi rend="i">I'll</hi> give you old school, <hi rend="i">I'll</hi> give you old
                    school," but he never got us together again that day—and we were never called
                    upon to make any apologies for such rudeness to our teacher—it was so well understood
                    that he had himself violated the Golden Rule of the school. This was the only violation of <placeName>

            <p>I will note some of the severities of our duties. We were allowed neither shoes nor
                    stockings—even in the worst of winter weather, and were marched about with ice beneath us
                    and snow around us. This was to harden our systems! Even our bare heads were not shielded from
                    storms at any tune. In summer our heads had a better time of it, we were allowed straw
                    hats—but we were obliged to weave the straw ourselves, and leave wide lines of openwork
                    around the crown for ventilation. I made some very fanciful hats and was delighted with such a
                    pleasing labor, and study of ornamental forms of the shining material. We had to take a morning
                        "<hi rend="i">Constitutional</hi> before breakfast no matter what the weather. In
                    summer our route was down to the <geogName>Wabash river</geogName> into which we took a good plunge
                    bath, this was to give us strength to undergo the risks and effects of the more rigorous exercises
                    of the winter months. In this season we had to take the same Constitutional over the same
                    course—breaking the ice at times that we might gain free entrance to the exhilirating and
                    placid waters beneath! Yet all this dangerous trial of our systems was not in any degree prepared
                    for by a more generous and proper diet than was permitted in. the school we had so gladly left
                    behind. Yet I myself was zealot enough to be <hi rend="i">proud</hi> of having submitted without

                            Pestalozzi, a Swiss reformer in the field of education. Pestalozzi believed that the child

                            potentialities. Unlike the harsh schools of the nineteenth century, however, the
                            Pestalozzian system did not hold with severe corporal punishment but emphasized discipline
                            based on love and understanding. Thus Gilmore, who had apparently been trained in
                            "old school" methods, could not control his unruly charges. It is

                    society increased in numbers various trades were established by competent tradesmen and the boys
                    were placed under their tuition and guidance. In the mean time men of learning arrived and took
                    positions as professors of higher branches of study such as botany and natural
                    history—even of languages and Philosophy and they did not lack for students before the

                    that many of the brightest intellects in the United States found their way to this new social

                    an eminent success. Among these accomplished scholars a few may be named as examples, because they
                    have been widely known and acknowledged as such. <hi rend="i">Say</hi>, the Naturalist, William
                    Maclure the "Father of geology." etc etc Other men of more than ordinary
                    intelligence came into this charmed circle. There was Phiqepal D'Arusmont, afterwards the
                    husband of Fanny Wright who often visited and encoraged the movement by her eloquence and engaging
                    language and noble manners. She had been a very noted and acceptable lecturer on free thought and

                    women who has ever graced the lecture room in the United States. She undoubtedly led the way and
                    gave courage to those of her sex who afterwards enforced their views and sentiments however peculiar

                    way of getting one but to make one. So I went across the river into a cane brake where I selected a
                    suitable piece of cane took it to the black smith shop and with a redhot piece of iron burned out
                    the holes at proper distances and really made a very good fife—upon which I learned to

                    passed swiftly ahead of me, frightening me so badly that I turned around to return to the Indiana
                    shore the boys screaming out to me that the snake would get me yet before I landed. Such was the
                    strength of the current that I was taken far beyond my starting point, but with great exertion
                    succeeded in landing soon enough to escape the rapid "cut-off in which had I entered I

                    It was not navigable for steamers—they took the current around outside the island which
                    still maintained the original growth of forest trees, and the birds and animals native to the
                        district.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> At certain seasons at high water a raid was made by the
                    Harmonites upon the game—scows canoes and small boats carrying the raiders into every
                    part of its forest with their firearms—returning with the boats laden with splendid
                    ducks, squirrels and other wild game. On one of these expeditions I was made pilot of one of the
                    barges. It was a difficult, tiresome service for a little boy. the current was so
                    strong—rushing around the great trees, and over the tangled undergrowth—the
                    overhanging wild grapevines dropping from great heights imperilled our course—for to be
                    swept into this swirling tide would have been next to being lost; for there was no earth visible
                    upon which a footing could be obtained. Yet such an experience I enjoyed, and derived such knowledge

                            in order to control both sides of the river. They hoped to avoid annoyance and to follow
                            their own way of life in peace without disturbing others, but this situation frequently

            <p>I became very fond of the study of zoology—and made excursions into the woods in search of
                    birds, insects and reptiles. Professor Thos Say, was our Instructor. My straw hat was a general
                    receptacle of specimens. Sometimes the outside was pinned full of beautiful and rare
                    insects—butterflies and beatles on which I received lessons whilst they were still
                    living. I was taught how to detect venemous from innocent reptiles and how to safely catch and
                    examine them—carrying the innocent ones, alive home in my pockets without fear. They
                    became great favorites from their grace of movement varied and lovely colors—the garter

                    amusement to children. Its lines were formed of vines grown upon light fences and about four ft
                    high, converging as they reached the centre. Here the visitor came upon a circular hut made of the
                    ends of rough logs cut to a point externally leaving one window—&amp; a blind door
                    which had to be sought out—&amp; only found by pushing at the walls. I remember well
                    my first visit to this hut, after a long &amp; tedious run back and forth through the labyrinth.
                    On seeking for the door a large snake took a look at me from between the logs, laughing at me with
                    its long red tongue. I got back out of the labyrinth much sooner and easier than I found my way in.

                        be emblematical of his society. The hedgerows represented te difficulty of arriving at harmony.
                        The temple had a rough exterior, indicating that at a distance harmony had no allurements. It
                        was, however, beautifully finished within to show the beauty of harmony once attained. Arndt,

                        two naked human footprints. Apparently Frederick Rapp, George Rapp's adopted son,

                        </placeName> in order to preserve it. Enemies of the Rappites circulated a story that Father
                        Rapp used the strange rock to hoax his followers. According to the legend Rapp told his people
                        the footprints were Gabriel's, made when the angel came down from heaven to advise him
                        about the conduct of their affairs. Despite proof that St. Louis residents had known of the
                        existence of the limestone slab for many years and that Frederick Rapp probably bought it only
                        because of an interest in natural history, the myth persists today. A further indication that
                        Rappites did not believe the Angel Gabriel legend is their sale of the rock to <placeName>

            <p>In the Public Square was a large church and a town Hall, leaving about half the square for play
                    ground—in its centre stood a large pump and its trough before it. this trough furnished a
                    basin which served the boys for ablutions, and was a constant resort.</p>
            <p>The Church was used on Sundays for religious services by believers of every doctrine—and
                    even by Atheists when they wished to confute the believers in Holy Writ. The Town Hall was used for
                    public meetings. Mr <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Owen</region>
                    </placeName> often lectured. At one of these lectures I took a seat in the gallery directly opposite
                    to him, and with a paper on my hat-crown made a first attempt at drawing a likeness. It seemed a
                    pretty fair attempt as the boys recognized it immediately, and made quite a talk after the
                    lecture—Hearing of it Mr <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Owen</region>
                    </placeName> sought me out as I was washing my hands at the pump, and asked to see it. I was so
                    mortified at his having found me out that I declined his request—but his words were so
                    kind and encoraging that I took off my strawhat and pulled out the drawing for his examination. He
                    smiled at it, and said he thought it might be very good, and added, patting me on the shoulder,
                    "proceed—proceed, my son and you will make an Artist one of these days"
                    These words from so great a man impressed me for a very long time and were the first to give me
                    corage to "proceed" in making attempts of a similar character. Mr. Parsons
                    assisted me in my labors. He had learned drawing at West Point. Here was a new source of delight and
                    I drew upon it often in trying to copy the outlines of birds butterflies and other beautiful
                    subjects. I cannot imagine a region richer in birds of splendid plumage or insects of greater rarity
                    and variety. The paroquets were so plentiful that flocks of them passed through the thick woods with
                    lightning speed shrieking like a steam whistle—in their rapid flight—their
                    brilliant greenish &amp; goldish tints fitfully flashing across amid the sombre shadows of the
                        forest.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Very little time was occupied in this study of art—so many other duties were forced upon
                    me in the varied trades and exercises demanding attention. But it served the purpose of turning my
                    attention and taste to the beautiful arts.</p>
            <p>After four oclock in the afternoon our school hours terminated for the day; then we strolled around
                    and played in the woods as we liked. One day <list type="footnotes">

                                southern Indiana at this time. Another visitor to the state describes them as follows:
                                "though they have become so familiar; and though they excell all the birds of
                                this country in beauty of plumage,— their scream is so discordant, and their
                                fierceness of disposition so apparent, as to preclude every sensation of attachment.</p>
                            <p>"These birds build their nests in hollow trees. The strength of their necks is
                                remarkable; and we are assured that when both wings and feet are tied they can climb
                                trees by striking their bills into the bark." David Thomas, <hi rend="i">Travels through the Western Country in the Summer of 1816</hi>, in Lindley, <hi rend="i">Indiana as Seen by Early Travelers, 80</hi>.</p>

                    <pb n="57" id="VAA4025-064-1-063"/> I was walking with Mr Parsons, and stopped to look upon some
                    work men laying the foundation for a new building. One of these work men saluted Mr. Parsons and
                    ceased his work to have a chat. "Well Professor, you have an easy time of it this hot day,
                    but you get just as much pay as we do, and yet we work from daylight till dark, whilst you can stop
                    work at four oclock."</p>
            <p>"This <hi rend="i">does</hi> seem wrong that's true," said the teacher,
                    "but there are different kinds of labor, some physical and some mental: each has its value
                    in the social economy. Would you like to change places with me?" "No I thank you,
                    but it dont seem altogether fair any how" and turned sullenly away again to his labor. Here
                    was the beginning in men's minds of the workings of the idea of <hi rend="i">equality</hi>
                    which they had acknowledged in joining the community. This idea soon took root and was being freely
                    discussed as new recruits came into camp. And it was not very long before men sought the easy
                    positions—many were dissatisfied to labor under the guidance of others and to do the
                    duties of subordinates. This pernicious notion grew to such proportions that the most inefficient
                    persons pushed forward claims to the superintendency of factories and mechanical establishments, and
                    when rejected would sulk away and shirk those duties which were within their capacities. Hence the
                    result was that, the most important labors for the ultimate success of our experiment were by
                    degrees avoided or only half performed by unwilling or wrongheaded men. As long as the intelligent
                    and honorable men who founded the society were its guides all went on happily and prosperously and
                    made its name known widely, drawing in members from every quarter. Had there been a proper
                    regulation for the admittance of those only who might become useful and devoted to its future
                    success— the experiment would have had a longer trial. Without such a wise method of
                    initiation it soon became apparent that the drones were fast taking possession of the hive and there
                    could be found no method by which to drive them out. They were beginning to eat up the resources of
                    the Community. Factories were mismanaged and the quality of their goods falling in the markets where
                    they had once stood superior to all others. Cattle and sheep were neglected in the fields and even
                    fences were being used for firewood notwithstanding the unlimited supply lying in the adjacent
                    woods. The streets became unclean and buildings needed repairs. It seemed that it was
                    nobody's especial duty to attend to such matters—and no force of law could be
                    brought to bear on delinquents. In other words the drones became the masters of the hive, and it was
                    only a question of time when the whole fabric would collapse and then would come <hi rend="i">the
                        end</hi> which the wiser men began to fear but dared not openly predict.</p>
            <p>Whilst Father was in his laboratory in Cin. he made some experiments on the quality of the white clay

                    If it turned out as expected Father was to be compensated for his discovery by having a right to all

                    </placeName>. The principle was barter on the cooperative plan. One store alone sufficed for all the
                    traffic—each purchaser paid in the value of his labor. There was an excitement among us
                    boys one day when some coin was received at the store. It had been a strange object in the town and
                    we were gratified by the opportunity afforded by the storekeeper to handle some few cents of the
                    currency of the outer world! Towards the end of the experiment the exports fell short of the imports
                    needed for our sustenance—and want and trouble stared us in the face—crowds
                    sometimes surrounding the store clamoring for the actual necessities of life. This fact I well
                    remember for I witnessed it in great astonishment and fear. Only think of such a dire result to such

                    "Bloomer"—short skirts and pantalettes. It was graceful and pretty
                    enough—but above all convenient—and it lasted as a fashion long after the

            <p>There was one fact deserving notice in that society of comparative strangers to each
                    other—met here from every quarter—there was no thieving nor
                    crime—consequently no police or courts. There were no drinking saloons. I dont think
                    there was an instance of inebriaty known—nor do I believe there was any intoxicating
                    liquor in the place.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> It was peaceful—every man respecting his
                    neighbor. Religious observances were confined to those whose faith exacted them, but they were not
                    enforced on others—even by general opinion. Free thought on such matters was equally
                    respected, hence no unpleasant collisions of sentiment. Mr. Owen himself did not believe in the
                    inspiration of the Scriptures, nor did his sons, and I suppose many others held that view, but there
                    were no contentions. Every one quietly enjoyed his own belief. <hi rend="i">Sunday</hi> was by
                    common consent kept as a holiday—and was enjoyed as each person liked—in
                    repose, in work or in study—in music or in games of recreation.</p>
            <p>The church building in the public square was held sacred on Sunday for the uses of religious
                    people—so that when they occupied it on that day the square in front of it was not used
                    for any species of amusement which might disturb worshipers within. There was no law but public
                    sentiment to control such things. There being no Church or other bells, the Sunday was as silent in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> as it is in any Mohammedan town. It impressed me very greatly the beautiful Sabbath day
                    on which I entered it. It did not appear to be inhabited, and was as silent as Pompeii itself.</p>
            <p>The town was laid out in squares enclosing four brick dwellings one at each corner—the
                    inner space was given up to gardens for the families residing in the houses—one family to
                    each. Factories and workshops were placed in the suburbs. Wood only was then used and therefore no
                    black smoke was seen and the atmosphere always clear and healthy—every thing as clean and
                    inviting as a parlor floor.</p>
            <p>In bad weather of course the streets were exceptions, as in all such unpaved towns without water
                    works or hydrants. Pumps supplied drinking water, good and plentifully. There were no accidents by
                    fire during the two <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>rather longer, and also to have the sleeves long." Mrs. Pears also discussed the
                            men's apparel, "The pantaloons are extremely full, also tied around the
                            waist with a very broad belt, which gives it the appearance of being all in one….
                            They are tied around the neck like the girls' slips, and as many wear them with no
                            collar visible, it is rather difficult to distinguish the gentlemen from the
                            ladies." Thomas <placeName>

            <p>In time the evidences of the ultimate failure of this humane but ill-advised project of bettering the

                    maintained however that had there been a proper organization at the first, it must have ultimately
                    succeeded. Of these believers my father was one, and longed for an opportunity to establish another
                    society in some other quarter on a new basis—eliminating all the evils which experience
                    had shown to be pernicious and destructive in the present attempt to ameliorate the ancient
                    condition of the civilized world. After a quiet conference with a few of his old <placeName>

                    </placeName> friends in the community and with Mr. Owen it was arranged to take a "New
                    departure". Father was fortunate enough to obtain enough money to help him in this
                    enterprize—he got <hi rend="i">twenty dollars</hi> and it was all that Mr <placeName>

                    confidence enough in the result of such an enterprize as to bless it and lend a hand.</p>
            <p>This new party of confidential friends quietly took their departure for fresh fields and pastures
                    new, so as not to alarm the old members and create a sudden and complete break down of the

            <p>The date of our removal I forget, say in 1827, nor do I remember our departure, but it was back over

                    a Steamer from below. Our luggage of the whole party was placed at the waters edge while the
                    families stopped up in the village—leaving some of us to care for our property and watch
                    for a steamer to take us away. It was my turn one night. The river was very low—the night
                    clear and a steamer could be seen several miles off—but her paddles could be heard before
                    she could be discerned. I often placed my ear to the water to catch the first notice of her approach
                    and at last she was heard and I joyfully gave the signal to our party to hurry down. <list type="footnotes">

                    days more for the next steamer. She noticed our fire and as the river was too low for her to reach
                    the shore, she awaited us in midstream. By the aid of her yawl and some ferry boats ourselves and

                    high up along the river. For many reasons we were detained some days, I suppose while some
                    arrangements were entered into with the farmer who was to receive and conduct us to his country
                    home. I knew we wandered about the town almost pennyless—for I at last parted with my
                    only pocket piece, a "fipenny bit", and it distressed me; but I could not withold
                    this small contribution for a pail of Milk needed by the women to get us up a frugal meal! This
                    seemed to me the most pitiful condition we had ever known—and it was. The farm was about
                    ten miles out from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName> in a very rich country, and our courage was stimulated by the promises of plenty of
                    good things and nice times when we settled in our new home! Such was undoubtedly the belief of our
                    brave leaders—nothing could quell their faith in the "good time
                    coming". To shelter our party in the meantime an untenanted deserted old house in the
                    outskirts of town was taken; and what still reminds me of the fact is that there were some loud
                    complaints from the owner who feared we would remain there too long <hi rend="i">gratis</hi> so were

                    abounded, corn cribs kept them in good health and fearless of man. They too became at last among the
                    pets of the household. I was literally in clover and celebrated these happy times by the piercing
                    notes of the old fife and attempts to get out of the new and wonderful flute the oft studied strains
                    so dear to my father's heart—of Robin Adair"—Charlie over
                    the Water" and "Auld Lang Sine". The Scotch blood was innate, and he
                    joined in my festal exercise by the most dexterous use of his favorite <hi rend="i">Jewsharp</hi>
                    which often astonished me.</p>
            <p>The snakes were kept safely in a little box with a sliding lid which my Aunt Jane had given me, and
                    was hidden away in an outhouse among other baggage—and here I quietly looked over
                    &amp; handled them always alone. Aunt Jane had occasion to visit the place to look after trunks.
                    One day I heard the piercing scream of a woman in that house and Aunt Jane burst out of the door in
                    a spasm of fear, screaming unceasingly until she reached the homestead door into which she rushed
                    and fell upon my mother's lap in convulsions. I well knew what was the cause and made quick
                    steps to the snakehold where my pets were fast crawling over the sides of their box from which the
                    cover had been partially drawn by my Aunt. I soon secured them and knowing what would be the result
                    of the fright, I carried the box out of a back door and secreted it among the weeds in the corner of
                    a worm fence—I was never allowed to use that house for alike purpose. After this I kept
                    the box in an empty corncrib some distance away in a field where I went when I wished some fun with
                    the snakes. One day I missed them. My greatest surprize was how it was possible they could escape,
                    the key hole was too small and there was no other exit possible. After Aunty's fright I had
                    placed a tiny lock upon the cage and carried the key in my pocket for safety. The lid was still
                    locked. But how those snakes ever escaped is a mystery to this day! I saw a man <hi rend="i">wink</hi> as I told my conumbrum [sic] but what's a wink? But this ended my enjoyment of
                    snakes forever—and I have never been able to look at them except with a <hi rend="i">crawling</hi> horror.</p>
            <p>Amid the joyful activity of all hands a sudden halt was called—Mr. Phillips was in
                    trouble. The Sherif came with writs against him from Creditors who had heard of the changes now
                    going on for the destruction of his property and his probable bankruptcy as a result. I never knew
                    the rights in question. I heard them energetically argued by the leaders pro and con without the
                    least understanding the points. But I soon knew that we were <pb n="64" id="VAA4025-064-1-070"/>
                    peremptorily ordered to stop work and move off the premises. Whether Mr. Phillips really owned the
                    farm I do not know. Having no means to spend in a lawsuit it was thought best to follow orders and
                    vacate at once. This was done and we all packed up again and moved back to Jeffersonvillej <hi rend="i">en route</hi> to some other more hospitable place. Then it was arranged <hi rend="i">to
                        disband</hi>! All the families but one took the next steamboat for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> leaving me in care of Mr. Westcott the shoemaker who was soon to follow the others to

                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>!</p>
            <p>This was the end of all hopes of planting a happy community of Socialists in that quarter of the New
                    World!</p>
            <p>After seeing the "beginning, rise and fall" of this noble experiment, the next
                    steamboat took my guardian and his little ward back towards <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>. I was thus not only the first but the last of this band of moral heroes sacrificed for

            <head>April as Hoosier History and Heritage Month</head>
            <p>At its regular biennial session in 1967 the Indiana General Assembly approved a resolution, sponsored
                    by Senator Robert P. O'Bannon of Corydon and Senator J. J. Bailey of Anderson, declaring
                    April of each year to be Hoosier History and Heritage Month. The resolution's suggestions
                    about relevant historical programs and observances should be helpful to students, teachers,
                    librarians, and citizens generally. During April, schools, historical societies, libraries, museums,
                    newspapers, luncheon clubs, and the like should sponsor educational programs or exhibits concerning
                    some topic or aspect of Indiana's history and heritage. Moreover, as indicated in the
                    resolution which follows, April is a particularly pleasant time of year to visit historical sites
                    and to enjoy the beauty to be found in most of Indiana's countryside as well as in many of
                    its towns and cities.</p>
            <p>The legislative declaration of April as Hoosier History and Heritage Month was one of various
                    by-products of the Indiana Sesquicentennial. Having such a month annually affords a helpful reminder
                    that the study of state and local history merits constant attention and encouragement. Since this
                    year is the first since the legislative resolution became effective, the <hi rend="i">Indiana
                        Magazine of History</hi> is especially pleased to be able to include the proclamation of
                    Governor Roger D. Branigin formally calling upon Hoosiers to observe April as Hoosier History and
                    Heritage Month. Governor Branigin is himself unusually well informed about Indiana history and is an
                    avid collector of valuable books, manuscripts, and other material about all aspects of the
                    state's history, making it particularly appropriate that this initial proclamation should
                    come from him.</p>
            <p>The legislature of 1967 also took another important step concerning state and local history. It
                    directed the Indiana Department of Natural Resources to make a statewide study of historical sites
                    and buildings. Dr. I. George Blake, professor of history at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> College, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana 46131, has been appointed director for this study. In cooperation with an
                    advisory committee he is collecting information about historical sites and buildings and will
                    subsequently suggest guidelines and priorities concerning their preservation and maintenance to the
                    next general assembly. Representatives of historical organizations and other individuals who have
                    useful information about Indiana's historical sites and buildings should make it available
                    to Dr. Blake.</p>

            <p>TO ALL TO WHOM THESE PRESENTS MAY COME, GREETING:</p>
            <p>WHEREAS, the State of Indiana has a rich historical heritage which has produced an image distinct and
                    unique among the fifty states: and</p>
            <p>WHEREAS, this image reflects the courage of Indiana's early settlers, the stability of the
                    principles of its government, the varied character and talents of its citizens, and the pride and
                    patriotism of all who call themselves, Hoosier: and</p>
            <p>WHEREAS, it was in April, 1816, when President James Madison signed the law authorizing
                    Indiana's admission to the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Union</region>
                    </placeName>, and it was on December 11, 1816, when formal statehood began: and</p>
            <p>WHEREAS, it is fitting that today's generation of Hoosiers demonstrate their appreciation of
                    this heritage and rededicate themselves to its traditions and ideals:</p>
            <p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, Roger D. Branigin, Governor of the State of Indiana, in accordance with Chapter
                    362, Acts of 1967, do hereby proclaim the month of April, 1968, as</p>

                    </placeName>]: Rand McNally &amp; Company, 1967. Pp. 216. $4.95.)</head>
            <p>In <hi rend="i">We Came Rejoicing</hi> Harvey Jacobs shares his recollections of his boyhood in rural
                    Indiana. Jacobs is an alumnus and former faculty member at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> College and now heads the Journalism Department at <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="xxx">New Mexico</region>
                    </placeName> State University. He writes with skill and discrimination.</p>
            <p>It was a good time and a good place to be a boy. The place was a prosperous <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Johnson County</region>
                    </placeName> farm; the time was the 1920's. Apparently, it remained a pretty good place
                    even after the onset of the great depression. The author recalls his eager anticipation of the
                    opening of the sugar camp, the special savor of sugar-camp meals, the never-ending boy's
                    job of carrying wood, and the warm sweet taste of fresh syrup. Educational experience is relived at
                    the "consolidated" one-room school. What it lacked in plumbing, it made up in
                    teaching: Jacobs learned to write. The country church was a vital institution, and Harvey joined via
                    the immersion route along with a dozen other boys during a "protracted meeting."</p>
            <p>The rising tide of technological change is treated extensively. There was a Fordson tractor which
                    Harvey drove before his mother thought he should. The costs and characteristics of cars are
                    discussed, and it is clear that the social pattern was being altered by the internal combustion
                    engine. The exciting advent of radio is described in "Don't Jar the
                    Catwhisker." And Harvey had his first airplane ride, flying with a <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Shelby County</region>
                    </placeName> barnstormer from the Jacobs hayfield.</p>
            <p>Other essays deal with the wheat harvest and threshing, the general store with its varied wares and
                    smells, and the excitement engendered by train traffic at the local station. Tribute is paid to Dr.
                    Carl, the country doctor, and that venerable social-educational mechanism, the Farmers'
                    Institute. Harvey recalls the thrill of buying the right pie in the pie auction, which carried with
                    it the privilege of sitting with the right girl. And there was the weekly visit to the county seat
                    on Saturday night, an event of considerable social and economic significance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">We Came Rejoicing</hi> is rich in nostalgia, but it is also good social history. For
                    over a century the independent small farmers were the dominant element in Indiana society. Jacobs
                    pictures this way of life just as cumulative technological change, shifting agricultural economics,
                    urbanization, and the impact of the great depression combined to destroy it. This Hoosier yeomanry
                    built a strong society. While its agricultural efficiency compares unfavorably with the large scale
                    commercial farming that has supplanted it, it produced generation after generation of good citizens.
                    It merits remembrance.</p>

            <p>A strong argument can be made that the single most important political institution in the complex
                    American system of government is the state legislature. In spite of the growing role of the central
                    government, the national Congress and the President still function in only limited areas; and even
                    then often through programs which are modified and differentiated by state decisions. All local
                    governments, at the other end of the spectrum, do only those things authorized by state legislation.
                    The General Assembly of a state is a key institution, involved directly or indirectly in many
                    national and all local activities, as well as those of the states themselves.</p>
            <p>Like most political institutions, especially those deeply rooted in history, the form and functioning
                    of most state legislatures have lagged behind the rapidly changing needs and urgencies of the times.
                    This report, produced by an official <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> commission composed of a dozen legislators and ten citizens, includes eighty-seven
                    recommendations for substantial and significant reforms and renovations in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> legislature and its procedures. The recommendations are clearly and persuasively
                    presented and justified; it is hard to escape the conclusion that the Assembly would be far more
                    effective if the proposals should be adopted.</p>
            <p>In spite of (or perhaps even because of) its extensive proposals for change, the report is basically
                    a conservative document. It aims at the preservation and strengthening of an historic institution,
                    and it envisions essentially the same role for the institution which the state's first
                    constitution-makers had in mind—a role for which its present structure and practices are
                    not very adequate. The recommendations are for substantial changes, but not radical ones. Combining
                    the two houses into one is not even considered, though joint interim committees and a joint
                    committee on rules are proposed. The commission specifically rejects the concept of a full-time
                    professional body in favor of the traditional citizen, part-time, representative assembly. To enable
                    such a body to deliberate effectively, the commission proposes annual sessions; one-year
                    appropriation bills; greatly enlarged and improved staff services in drafting, summarizing,
                    indexing, and publishing bills; reductions in the number of committees; full-time professional staff
                    for the important legislative committees during the sessions and interim committees between
                    sessions; modern mechanical office and secretarial services; and revised procedures and schedules.</p>

            <p>The thirteen papers in this volume were given at a conference in 1965 at Southern <placeName>

                    </placeName> University, Edwardsville Campus. As the editor says, a complete survey of the frontier
                    was not the intent of the conferees. The nearest approach to any thematic continuity comes when some
                    of the authors measure Frederick <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson</region>
                    </placeName> Turner by their own findings and conclusions. The essayists suggest overlooked or
                    neglected areas for investigation or interpretations that need revision, or they survey and analyze
                    studies already made.</p>
            <p>Although the editor asserts in the foreward that to "attack" Turner was not the aim
                    of the papers, as author of the first chapter he charges that Turner was "ignorant
                    of" or "ignored" four basic matters: the prevalence of class distinction,
                    the dominating types of men, the prune importance of business, and the presence of amenities on the
                    very brink of the savage world. McDermott is making a case for the importance of the urban frontier.</p>
            <p>Merrill J. Mattes pleads for more research into the role of the frontier towns, especially the
                    "jumping-off places" along the <geogName>Missouri River</geogName> for the
                    overland transcontinental trails to <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>. Although Turner and his disciples either ignored or unwittingly by-passed many
                    opportunities for research in transportation history, Oscar O. Winther reminds present historians of
                    their responsibility to rectify this situation because of their advantages of hindsight and of a
                    rich harvest of source materials.</p>
            <p>One of the least investigated phases of the American frontier is the territorial
                    process—the collection and preservation of the federal and territorial records as well as
                    research and writing. Oliver W. Holmes contends that Turner's generalizations on
                    territorial development are too smug for what closer study of the records reveals. Herman R. Friis
                    catalogs a sampling of rich cartographic and graphic records and pointedly indicates their sad
                    neglect on the part of historians, including Turner, and geographers. John C. Ewers makes a similar
                    case for pictorial documents which are sometimes "more significant" as historical
                    documents than written descriptions.</p>
            <p>Turner's clarion call to look to the frontier for the secrets of American history inspired
                    many able studies of the mountain men in the trans-<placeName>

                    Evidence proves quite the opposite. Anthropologist Preston Holder illuminates some unclear corners
                    of time with provocative archeological studies to determine the Indian view of the fur trade in the
                    early days of the Indian- European exchange of gifts, goods, and ideas.</p>

                    as her "interior provinces." Ralph E. Morrow reaffirms that religious
                    organizations did not participate creatively in the frontier process in the early nineteenth century
                    because they were too deeply involved with internal problems as emergent denominations. Joe B.
                    Frantz attempts to articulate a cowboy philosophy. It is evasive and elusive, but Frantz chooses to
                    continue his search even though the spoor is cold.</p>
            <p>A pair of studies considers fiction and the frontier. In the four pre-Civil War decades, according to
                    Jules Zanger, the image of the frontiersman in popular fiction changed from "savage
                    simplicity and primitive depravity" to one of a heroic, self-made, independent, and
                    democratic representative American. George R. Brooks analyzes the American frontier image in German
                    fiction, especially in the works of four early nineteenth-century writers who spent some time on the
                    frontier. It is curious that seventy-novel Karl May, who never saw the setting of his stories and
                    who is sometimes called the James Fenimore Cooper of Germany, is not even mentioned.</p>

                    activities of civil and religious officials in France, New France, and the colony itself, which
                    formed part of the Diocese of Quebec. Although the two powers were separate, the state, in the
                    person of the king, had vital powers over the Gallican church; and for the church national ideals
                    were linked with religious ones in the ancient spirit of <hi rend="i">gesta Dei per Francos</hi>. As
                    a result, Father O'Neill concludes: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            In colonial planning, ideals and expediency were rivals; in missiology, theology stood
                            vis-À-vis nationalism; on the general social scene, the design for a spiritual
                            New France was confronted by the lawless corruption that followed forced immigration into an

            <p>The church-state confrontation in Louisiana was even more marked than in New France. It was
                    complicated from the first by rivalries, which are perpetuated today by Franciscan and Jesuit
                    historians, among the secular priests and the religious orders; and the Jesuit author deserves much
                    credit for holding the balance so fairly amid the welter of conflicting interests and personalities
                    which produced more paper than progress in the colony. The <pb n="73" id="VAA4025-064-1-079"/>
                    ecclesiastical quarrels were complicated by factional disputes among the colonial officials and at
                    the court, which in the end had to settle both. If the religious element was indeed strong in French
                    colonial policy under Richelieu and Colbert, as the author perhaps too uncritically believes, the
                    missionary motive was not even mentioned in Antoine Crozat's charter of 1710 and figured
                    only in the fifty-third paragraph of the letters patent for John Law's Company of the West
                    in 1717. While some of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> clergy were dedicated to the evangelization of the Indians and the maintenance of
                    morality in the French settlements, they received scant support from the court or companies for the
                    former, even though it was in the interest of trade, and found the latter an uphill task in a
                    society which Governor Cadillac characterized as "the piled up dregs of Canada…
                    without any subordination to Religion or to Government, steeped in vice" (p. 91).</p>

                    </placeName> clergy never obtained the influence of the Canadian and that Louisiana never attained
                    the religious fervor of New France. The record of endless petty quarrels between rival lay-clerical
                    factions revealed in this book does much to explain the failure of the southern French colony to
                    achieve the same economic as well as spiritual development as the northern one.</p>

            <p>Professor Young has written an excellent study of political conflict and organization in <placeName>

                    </placeName> between 1777 and 1797. His years of diligent effort are revealed in the depth and
                    detail of this volume, which must be considered a major study of an important state during a
                    critical period. Many will disagree with certain conclusions, but no student of the early republic
                    will be able to ignore this book.</p>
            <p>Young has gone to the sources—newspapers, legislative records, personal correspondence,
                    pamphlets, records of political clubs, and even the Red Hook Society for the Detection of Horse
                    Thieves. Carl Becker's question, "Who shall rule at home?" is one of the
                    fundamental themes of this book, as Young describes the struggle of various groups for dominance in

                    the 1790's. The conservative Whigs of 1776 became the Federalists of 1788 and the
                    Federalist party after 1790. The popular Whigs became followers of Governor George <placeName>

                    after 1790, then a "Republican interest" by 1793, and soon thereafter <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-064-1-080"/> Democratic Republicans. The <placeName>

                    rather, it reflected state as well as national issues, with state issues dominant.</p>
            <p>Young's careful analysis of the complex interrelation of state and national political
                    questions is sometimes marred by his vague usage of the word <hi rend="i">party</hi> (pp. 208-209,
                    282, for example), and at times this failure blurs the continuity he finds in <placeName>

                    </placeName> politics. The author is at his best in analyzing the unexpected Federalist strength on
                    the <geogName>Mohawk Valley</geogName> frontier and in describing the changing allegiance of the
                    Manhattan mechanics. He is very much interested in organized groups, from the famous Democratic
                    Society to the obscure Society of Associated Teachers, established in 1794 to debate political
                    questions as well as the distribution of state school money.</p>
            <p>In twenty-six solidly documented chapters, Young réexamines twenty years of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>

                    </placeName> Federalists did not admire the common people, but they did seek votes. The
                    "liberalism" of the Democratic Republicans is exaggerated, for Young concedes that
                    many of them opposed abolition of slavery and other reforms which received Federalist support. This
                    lengthy volume is well written, but the author is overly fond of unnecessary direct quotations. The
                    bibliographical essay is a masterful review of an extensive literature. Young's treatment
                    of his subject far surpasses anything done previously. Those planning to write the political history
                    of other states would do well to make this book a model; it sets a high standard and deservedly
                    received an award from the Institute of Early American History.</p>

            <p>This is the definitive edition of the diary kept by John James Audubon during those months in 1826
                    when he left <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>

                        Birds of America</hi>. Parts of the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> were edited and published in an
                    earlier work on the life of Audubon, but only in this scholarly edition by Alice Ford do we have
                    most of the original entries reassembled in original form and language and supplemented by drawings
                    made at the time.</p>
            <p>Alice Ford is our principal authority on the life and work of Audubon. She is the author of a
                    definitive biography of Audubon (1964) and has edited <hi rend="i">Audubon's Animals</hi>
                    (1951), <hi rend="i">Audubon's Butterflies</hi> (1952), and <hi rend="i">Bird Biographies
                        by John James Audubon</hi> (1957). These books cumulate to an impressive contribution to art, to
                    natural history, and to the social history <pb n="75" id="VAA4025-064-1-081"/> of nineteenth-century
                    America. The greater part of the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> of 1826, however, was written in England
                    and Scotland. Apart from the interest a reader may have in Audubon's efforts to publish his
                    drawings in almost life size, the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> provides a portrait of life among the
                    upper classes of British society at the beginning of the second quarter of the nineteenth century.
                    And it contains profiles of notable men and women whom Audubon met and saw with the perceptive eye
                    of an artist. The economist John R. McCulloch, the critic and writer Francis Jeffrey, merchant and
                    civic reformer William Rathbone IV of Liverpool and members of his family, the historian William
                    Roscoe, and Lord Stanley (Earl of Derby) are among the many members of British society whom Audubon
                    described.</p>
            <p>Audubon had a curious trait, often apparently in all innocence, of being unable to distinguish fact
                    from fancy. With respect to details of his own early life he was frequently a harmless but, to the
                    scholar, an annoying prevaricator. Miss Ford has identified and often clarified these slips between
                    fact and fiction. Few of these lapses, however, pertain to the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> of 1826.</p>
            <p>To the social historian and the student of Anglo-American relationships, the Journal affords a
                    valuable documentary case of friendships and interactions between Britons and
                    Americans—in business, natural science, and scholarship in the early nineteenth century.
                    Audubon's wife (Lucy Bakewell) had many well-placed relatives in England, and Audubon was
                    himself an unusually interesting personality. But these do not appear to have been the factors that
                    were of greatest assistance to his mission. There is evidence throughout the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> of a great interest in America among the British upper classes and in the notable
                    artistic achievement in natural history represented by Audubon's portraits of birds and
                    animals. Without this interest and sympathy, expressed in tangible support, the monumental <hi rend="i">Birds of America</hi> might never have been more than a rare and highly perishable set
                    of drawings; and its influence on American attitudes toward nature could never have reached the
                    extent permitted by the printed reproduction.</p>
            <p>The volume concludes with a set of letters by Audubon written during the period of the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> and with letters of introduction written on his behalf by Henry Clay, Vincent
                    Nolte, Thomas Stewart Traill, and others. The book is published with the high-quality design and
                    typography that distinguishes the work of the University of <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName>—gradually narrowed to the vast stretch of land between the present- day
                    upper boundary of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>, the forty-second parallel, and the present-day southern boundary of the Alaskan
                    panhandle, the line of "fifty-four-forty." There was not much Anglo-American
                    argument over the land below the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which was deemed probably American, and that above the forty-ninth parallel, which
                    American negotiators usually considered British. The essence of the problem was the land to the
                    north and west of the <geogName>Columbia River</geogName>, the present-day western two-thirds of the
                    state of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington</region>
                    </placeName>. The British sought this latter territory, and the Americans repeatedly offered the
                    forty-ninth parallel, in 1818, 1824, 1826–1827, and 1845. When extremists in the United

                    1845–1846 seemed at first to join them; but he backed off and took the forty-ninth
                    parallel, almost the same line proposed by Albert Gallatin and Richard <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Rush</region>
                    </placeName> in the negotiations of 1818.</p>
            <p>The "fifty-four-forty men" were enraged at the prospect of a compromise, so they
                    thought, in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName>; and not least of the President's critics was Senator Edward A. Hannegan of
                    Indiana. In 1846 the senator already was addicted to alcohol, which problem later proved his
                    complete undoing; and it may be that its baleful influence drove him into the following remarks
                    about Polk: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>So long as one human eye remains to linger on the page of history, the story of his abasement
                            will be read, sending him and his name together to an infamy so profound, a damnation so
                            deep, that the hand of resurrection will never be able to drag him forth. He who is a
                            traitor to his country, can never have forgiveness of God, and cannot ask mercy of
                            man…. I have only to add, that so far as the whole tone, spirit and meaning of
                            the remarks of the Senator… are concerned if they speak the language of James K.
                            Polk, James K. Polk has spoken words of falsehood, and with the tongue of a serpent (p.

                    the details—without which the Big Ideas are invisible.) Merk's fascination with
                    his grand subject shines through these pages.</p>

            <p>The edited papers and diaries of important American leaders are being published in generous fashion,
                    and the first two of four projected volumes of the diaries of James A. Garfield are a welcome
                    addition to such scholarly efforts. Not all of the entries included were in Garfield's
                    handwriting, and the editors have taken care to indicate the role played by a part-time secretary,
                    George U. Rose.</p>
            <p>The editors' sixty-page introduction analyzes carefully the diaries' chief
                    contributions to an understanding of the religious, social, economic, educational, and political
                    life of nineteenth-century America. Garfield was a rather introspective person whose comments on his
                    own motives and efforts are often very revealing. His early commitment and his lifelong attachment
                    to the Disciples of Christ are thoroughly indicated; though, with his years at Williams College and
                    his entry into sophisticated <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington</region>
                    </placeName> society, a more ecumenical spirit developed. He, furthermore, became increasingly
                    distressed by "stupid" sermons from many pulpits.</p>
            <p>As a congressman Garfield was caught up in the Credit Mobilier and Salary Grab scandals, and he
                    suffered deep distress from the criticisms of his actions. The editors conclude that, in regard to
                    the Credit Mobilier affair, "his real offense was that he denied to the House investigating
                    committee that he had either agreed to take the stock or received a dividend" (I, xlvi).</p>
            <p>The notes have been prepared in meticulous fashion and offer a mine of information relating to the
                    third quarter of the nineteenth century and in particular to the Western Reserve of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington</region>
                    </placeName>, D.C.</p>
            <p>Any scholar realizes the difficulty of avoiding minor errors, a few of which may be noted. Jacob D.
                    Cox was not "of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>" in 1860 (I, 348), for he located there after his term as governor ended in
                    1867. It is not accurate to state that in 1867 in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> "the customary Republican majority in the legislature nearly
                    disappeared" (I, 429), for Democratic control meant the retirement of the arch-Republican,
                    Benjamin Wade, from the United States Senate. Congresswoman Frances Payne Bolton is not a niece of
                    Senator Henry B. Payne (II, 242), but a granddaughter. The pastor of the First Presbyterian Church
                    in Washington was Byron (not Bryon) Sunderland (II, 301).</p>
            <p>In a few cases significant details seem to have been overlooked. The editors point out that in 1852,
                    Mary Hubbell, who for a time was one of Garfield's romantic interests, addressed him as
                    "Leo" because a phrenologist had associated him with the constellation, Leo (I,
                    147). But Miss Hubbell had a keen sense of humor, and she may have had in mind a second reason for
                    the appellation, since Garfield had recently played an important role, that <pb n="78" id="VAA4025-064-1-084"/> of Pope Leo X, in a college colloquy (I, 142). It is indicated that in
                    1858 Garfield was offered a position as head of the "Hopedale School" (I, 330). It
                    might have been pointed out that this was to be for decades one of the leading normal schools in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and that the position was taken by Garfield's former mentor and colleague,
                    Amos S. Hayden. (See Roscoe H. Eckelberry, "The McNeely Normal School and Hopedale Normal
                    College," <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>

                        </placeName> State Archaeological and Historical Quarterly</hi>, XL, 86–119.) Charles
                    Sanders Peirce is identified as "an assistant in the Coast Survey,
                    1872–1884" (II, 116), but no mention is made of the fact that he was one who
                    laid the foundations for the later pragmatic philosophy of William James and John Dewey. It is
                    recorded that Garfield dined in 1873 with "Ben Holladay of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>" (II, 152), but it is not indicated that he was the well-known founder of the
                    noted "Holladay's Overland Stage." The editors might also have corrected
                    Garfield's error in stating that Salmon P. Chase was chosen to the United States Senate in
                    1848 (II, 330); actually it was February, 1849.</p>
            <p>Typographical confusion is found in misplaced lines in I, 356; II, 116; and II, 282. The volumes,
                    however, will prove indispensable to any scholar dealing in depth with the political, social, and
                    cultural life of the United States during the generation prior to 1875.</p>

            <p>Who in fact was Elisha Douglass Perkins, and what does his diary add to our knowledge of the widely
                    chronicled "forty-niner"? Ohioan Perkins was descended from six generations of
                    Yankee forebears. This twenty-six-year-old optimist, apparently the leader of the "Marietta
                    Gold Hunters," has left us both a beautifully written and zestful journal. Of course he was
                    fascinated by those same passing scenes which intrigued other sojourners. Perkins, like most, had
                    only separated himself from his eastern hearthside to scoop up the yellow stuff on the Pacific
                    Slope, then to return to his <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName> home. His last entry tells us what
                    actually occurred. "During the late pleasant weather John and myself… have made
                    something over 100 dollars—better than nothing, though small wages" (p. 154).

            <p>It is sad that the diarist, rich with recollections and maybe even capital, was never able to rejoin
                    his wife. However, as his vividly penned record makes clear, he had lived the great adventure.</p>

            <p>Helen M. White's study leaves little doubt that for many argonauts of the decade of the
                    1860's blood and gold had not lost its lure. Mrs. White has laid bare a chapter of
                    migration history heretofore largely uncovered: the overland trek of Minnesotans into <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mtu">Montana</region>
                    </placeName> and the Great Northwest during <pb n="80" id="VAA4025-064-1-086"/> and shortly after
                    the Civil War. She has not only brought together documents related to the various Fisk and Holmes
                    expeditions of those years, but after an assiduous search the compiler has collected extensive wagon
                    train rosters for these <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>-launched trains. Genealogical societies will mine her information for years to come.</p>
            <p>Much of this collection is built around a nineteenth-century western prototype, James Liberty Fisk.
                    Fisk is almost too much the stereotype to be believed. However, as one document after another makes
                    patently clear, this dreamy-eyed frontier dynamo was no abstraction. Thanks to Mrs. White, James
                    Liberty and the three Fisk brothers have now obtained the historical recognition too long denied
                    them. Despite his effervescent, "My spirit never droops" (p. 161), James Fisk
                    certainly suffered his share of pioneer oscillations. With a middle name like
                    "Liberty" Fisk had to be con troversial. Few Northwest Indian episodes received
                    more unsavory notoriety than the deliberate strychnine poisoning of two dozen Sioux with which he
                    was connected. Actually he appears considerably more prudent than many of his wagon captain
                    contemporaries. To eager but ill-prepared <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName> gold seekers he counseled, "None who have <hi rend="i">homes</hi> and a
                    reasonable means of livelihood should be incited by big stories, however true they may be, to
                    emigrate to far off territories after a phantom fortune" (p. 11). And the manner in which
                    he armed one expedition with a twelve-pound mountain howitzer, advanced them into hostile country,
                    and held the wagons together in the face of repeated attacks by Sioux invites Hollywood's
                    prevaricators to turn to nonfiction copy.</p>
            <p>Most important, Mrs. White has compiled a great mass of social history dealing with the pioneers of
                    the 1860's. Her study is larded with information on their hopes, their daily activities,
                    and even the tools with which they mastered their environment. The Minnesotan's
                    achievement, and it took twenty years to amass, is unquestionaby the best single summation of the
                    northern overland wagon trains during the decade of the 1860's.</p>

            <p>The ubiquitous John A. Logan, <placeName>

                    </placeName> congressman and Civil War general, has often been portrayed as an opportunist of the
                    deepest dye. Like many others of his political generation who were caught up in the maelstrom of
                    sectional conflict and war, Logan was converted from an outspoken Democrat to a Radical Republican.
                    As a member of the <placeName>

                    that state's Negro exclusion law; yet, by the end of the war he had become a champion of
                    abolition. The story of Logan's conversion and the motives behind it provide a theme for
                    this book. An opportunist Logan undoubtedly was; but there was a good deal more integrity in the man
                    than he has been given credit for, as this generally sympathetic portrait reveals. A resident of the
                    pro-southern counties of <placeName>

                    district; but he also exerted considerable influence on it. Southern <placeName>

                    </placeName>' devotion to the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Union</region>
                    </placeName> during the war may be traced in large measure to his efforts.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the most puzzling period in Logan's career has been the crucial months of the
                    secession crisis. A follower of Douglas and an advocate of compromise, Logan was widely reported to
                    have counselled secession, only to make a complete about-face later when he declared his support to
                    the government and joined the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Union</region>
                    </placeName> army. Jones, in an able and well-documented chapter, has finally set the record
                    straight. Far from being a secessionist, Logan merely reflected the predicament of many Douglas
                    followers. Douglas' urgent support of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> administration following Sumter was more than they could immediately appreciate. After
                    months of soul searching, some Douglasites in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, like William A. Richardson, became Peace Democrats; others, like Logan, chose the path
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Union</region>
                    </placeName> and became War Democrats. Resigning his congresisonal seat, he took the field as one of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s abler political generals and emerged from the war as one of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>' great war heroes. Undoubtedly, the realities of the postwar political
                    situation as well as the popularity he had achieved in the war contributed to his affiliation
                    ultimately with the Radical Republicans, but Jones also credits Logan with deeper motivations.</p>
            <p>Jones has not chosen to produce a full-scale biography but rather has concentrated on
                    Logan's immediate prewar and wartime record, "an attempt to present a man of
                    divided loyalties leading an equally divided section in days of national crisis" (p. xvi).
                    In doing so, he has produced a first-rate study. He has combined a painstaking and critical
                    examination of a wide range of sources with a persuasive analysis of a most difficult figure during
                    an equally difficult period. The story of Logan's role in the military campaigns of the
                    war—from the effort to clear the <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> of Confederate
                    resistance to the sweep through the Carolinas—to which most of the book is devoted is
                    detailed with clarity and suspense. A native Floridian, Jones has added significantly to the story
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>

                    a self-sustaining "Black Metropolis." In <hi rend="i">Black <placeName>

               </hi>, Allan H. Spear contends that Chicago's Negro ghetto developed
                    gradually, stimulated by the population shifts of the war years, but resulting primarily from white
                    hostility toward the Negro's quest for better jobs and decent housing.</p>
            <p>Spear traces the growth of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Negro population from the 1890's, before the ghetto really
                    appeared. Though concentrated on the south and west sides, Negroes comprised more than 10 per cent
                    of only two wards in 1900 and as late as 1910 were less highly segregated from native whites than
                    were Italian immigrants. After the turn of the century, efforts by Negroes to move into all white
                    sections met with increasing hostility, and they were forced to find housing within areas partly
                    inhabited by Negroes. The ghetto began to take shape, spreading over <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s south side as black immigrants poured in from the South and white residents
                    fled to segregated sections of the city. Segregation did not solve the city's problems; it
                    exacerbated them. Separation bred continuing suspicion and hatred, which in turn led to racial
                    violence. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> race riot of 1919 was the ultimate result of white racism and "destroyed
                    whatever hope remained for a peacefully integrated city" (p. 221).</p>
            <p>Paralleling this population shift was a change in the direction of Negro thought. During periods of
                    increased hostility the Negro American has consistently turned to a philosophy of self-help, be it
                    the mild, accommodating version advanced by Booker T. Washington or the militant cry of
                    "Black Power." Prior to 1900 <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Negro leaders were committed to a policy of total integration; but as the
                    ghetto took shape and white hostility mounted, Negro businesses emerged to serve the growing black
                    population. These new Negro businessmen, while still demanding equal rights for Negroes, focused
                    their efforts on building a strong black community, politically powerful and economically
                    self-sufficient. But <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Negroes possessed neither the experience nor the resources to create a
                    viable community of their own, and "Black Metropolis" proved to be "a
                    woefully inadequate, vastly inferior version of White <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

                    encroachment; Negroes working at menial, low paying jobs with little opportunity for advancement;
                    and white politicians courting the Negro vote when running for office and perpetuating slum

                    ghettoes all over the country are exploding in outbreaks of racial violence, this is also a very
                    important book. Spear's urgent message is that oppressive conditions in the Negro ghetto
                    are real, and they have existed too long. The period of time for white America to do something about
                    them is running out.</p>

            <p>Sherwood Anderson's career was often marked by flamboyant attempts to exorcise frustrations
                    by escapes into over-simplification. Such attempts include, at thirty-six abandoning his family and
                    a solvent business in <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> artists and writers; his four marriages and attendant divorces; a streamlined
                    Freudianism as a direct route to the secrets of human problems; flirting with sentimentalized
                    Marxism for social reform; and typically, as demonstrated in this new and valuable anthology, his
                    flight in 1925 from pressures of the city and literary success to country quiet in southwest <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and a try at rural journalism.</p>
            <p>In October, 1927, Anderson bought a printing business in <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Marion</region>, <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName>, together with
                    its rival weeklies, one Democrat, one Republican. Caught up in the excitement of what seemed simpler
                    and more natural writing and in an experiment that hinted of redemption for a decadent American
                    press, he poured all his professional energies for a time into editing his two papers. Then, with
                    complexities multiplying as usual, he turned most of the labor over to his son and fled back to his
                    major world of fiction, general writing, and lecturing.</p>
            <p>Of this interim journalism only the items Anderson chose for his unsuccessful <hi rend="i">Hello
                        Towns</hi>! (1929) have been generally available. Now, <hi rend="i">Return to Winesburg</hi>
                    brings a balanced, well-edited sampling of eighty-seven pieces from November, 1927, through
                    December, 1931. They provide a coverage that will be very useful to both biographer and critic.</p>
            <p>Anderson obviously reveled in the variety his papers gave him. Early locals show him getting
                    acquainted, cultivating a chatty, folksy manner, and inevitably doing more editorializing than
                    straight reporting of Kiwanis meetings and courthouse business. In a revered American humor
                    tradition, he creates a fictional Buck Fever who writes rustic dialect letters to the editor. Better
                    worked are sketches of the countryside, revealing the sensitive impressionism <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-064-1-090"/> of a frustrated landscape painter and recalling fine moments in
                    Anderson's best short stories. Other pieces report sorties to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington</region>
                    </placeName> and elsewhere in the outside world.</p>
            <p>To students of the man, especially interesting are the various evidences of Anderson's
                    intense involvement with this journalistic experience. Here was a new field, he insisted, that
                    demanded the best brains in the country: From it could come a fresh expression of popular will that
                    would counter the standardizing tyranny of cities, industrialism, and big business.</p>
            <p>There is much more—nothing, however, that reaches the stature of <hi rend="i">Winesburg, <placeName>

                    chapters. Style ranges characteristically from best to worst. Childlike sentences and
                    ellipses—often intensely appealing—alternate with sloppy verbosity. But all of
                    it lives. Highest notch is reached, for this reviewer at least, in a few memorably indignant
                    paragraphs of April 12, 1928, reporting the unspeakable conditions of the men's cages in
                    the county jail. In moments like these one meets the man that helped give direction to the
                    generation of Hemingway and Faulkner.</p>

            <p>In the past two decades oral history projects have provided one of the most encouraging new
                    developments in the study of twentieth-century United States history. By making available important
                    data which otherwise might be lost to posterity, these programs in many cases have produced
                    important source materials. The volume edited by sociologist Rita James Simon is another example of
                    oral history. She invited eight individuals who played an active role in social and political
                    movements of the 1930's to describe their experiences. In particular, Professor Simon asked
                    them to discuss their purposes and goals, their followers, and their successes and failures. The
                    resulting lectures were given between October, 1965, and April, 1966, at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> where they were also transcribed. Together with brief introductions they constitute the
                    substance of this book.</p>

                    causes. <placeName>

                    </placeName> Hicks, and former United States Senator Burton K. Wheeler need no introduction. On the
                    other hand, A. J. Muste (pacifist), Max Schachtman (founder of the American Trotskyist movement),
                    and Hal Draper (an organizer of the American Youth Congress in 1934) are more obscure. Each,
                    however, receives equal space.</p>
            <p>Thomas comments on the Socialist view of the United States in the Roosevelt era; Browder explains the
                    perspective of American Communists; and Schachtman supplies a Trotskyist appraisal. Smith recalls
                    Huey Long's <pb n="85" id="VAA4025-064-1-091"/> crusade; Muste speaks of labor struggles;
                    Draper dwells on student movements; and Wheeler focuses on his years in the Senate during the New
                    Deal. Hicks confines his remarks to writers of the decade.</p>
            <p>The editing of the volume reveals at least three weaknesses. Mrs. Simon has reproduced the lectures
                    as they were presented and has not provided needed explanatory footnotes to illuminate or correct
                    casual or offhand comments by the visitors. Nor do the brief introductions to each talk help readers
                    to place a particular speaker in historical context. In her introductory remarks concerning Smith,
                    for example, the editor curiously omits any mention of Smith's long career as one of
                    America's most rabid anti-semites. Surely his great admiration of Nazi genocide programs is
                    relevant to an understanding of his views on social justice. Finally, the conceptual framework of
                    the book is very loose. Although Mrs. Simon posed some worthwhile questions for her guests, the
                    participants did not consistently use her frame of reference. Indeed, they display a propensity to
                    ramble.</p>
            <p>The contribution of this work to an understanding of the 1930's is not profound. With the
                    exception of discussions by Browder and Schachtman the essays tend to be superficial. They add
                    little to what is already known, whether fact or insight. In the vast literature about the New Deal
                    this book will take its place as a collection of brief reminiscences.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Editor:</salute>
                        <p>On pages 322-23 of the December, 1967, issue of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of
                                        History</hi> there is a review of the <hi rend="i">History of the United States
                                        Rubber Company</hi>. The critical judgments of the reviewer appear to have been
                                    formed from the viewpoint of the general reading public. However, as indicated in
                                    the Foreword and more specifically in the Introduction, this work was designed as a
                                    case study in corporation management, primarily for use in a graduate course in
                                    business administration. The assignment to develop such a study determined the
                                    choice and organization of the material.</p>
                        <p>From the general reader's viewpoint, proportion may seem
                                    "askew," as it did to the reviewer. For example, much more space
                                    has been taken in detailed discussion of financial operations than would be
                                    considered advisable in the usual business history. Serious financial problems
                                    dominated the <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-064-1-092"/> policies and actions approved by
                                    the corporation's management during many years. After the First World War
                                    almost every other major rubber company underwent either receivership or some other
                                    form of financial reversal and reorganization. United States Rubber survived only
                                    after massive infusion of capital by the du Ponts, who also supplied sorely needed
                                    administrative acumen at a crucial time.</p>
                        <p>Which treatment of the steps taken by management to meet the various situations would
                                    be more helpful to students? A brief statement that certain obligations had been
                                    refunded on such a day? or a detailed explanation of the manner in which the
                                    operation had been carried out? Members of the faculty of the Graduate School of
                                    Business, Indiana University, who were consulted, unhesitatingly chose the more
                                    detailed analysis.</p>
                        <p>There are other instances in the narrative where the needs of the advanced student
                                    have dictated what might well be considered disproportionate elaboration of subjects
                                    of lesser interest to the general reader. The reviewer deplored the absence of
                                    historical perspective. The aim was to present each decision or action by management
                                    in the light of such knowledge as the executive may be presumed to have had readily
                                    available at the time those decisions or actions occurred. They did not possess the
                                    advantage of knowing what has since transpired. Similarly, executives now
                                    responsible for decision- making must act without benefit of the hindsight of 1969
                                    or the 1970's, to say nothing of that clarity of perspective which may have
                                    become commonplace by the year 2000.</p>
                        <p>Graduate students for whom this study is designed may be expected, and properly so,
                                    to have acquired previously a good working knowledge of the basic elements of our
                                    country's industrial growth. Therefore no space has been allotted for
                                    relating many aspects of that growth. The discussion of external developments,
                                    industrial, economic, technical, political, and so on, has been focused instead on
                                    those factors which most significantly influenced the corporation's
                                    progress. This highly selective approach made it possible to deal with them in
                                    sufficient depth.</p>
                        <p>The reviewer concluded with the statement that "questions tumble endlessly
                                    into the reader's mind." He also indicated that "the
                                    'why' of specific company actions" should have been
                                    spelled out. In view of the precise purpose of the history, what he has judged to be
                                    shortcomings actually seem to enhance the merit of the work. Since the reviewer had
                                    these reactions, participants in a doctoral seminar or other course in business
                                    administration may find the account equally provocative.</p>
