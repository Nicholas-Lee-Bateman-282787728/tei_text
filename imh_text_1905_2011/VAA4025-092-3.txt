            Few American families in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries had much economic
                    security. Inadequate life insurance and the absence of unemployment compensation and Social Security
                    meant that the death or sudden unemployment of the husband and father could plunge even a
                    middle-class family into financial crisis. For working-class families the low wages of an unskilled
                    workman could make life a daily struggle. To meet such crises families often turned to the paid work
                    of wives and children. Three income-generating strategies were available to supplement or substitute
                    for the wages of husbands: (1) the wife could take a job, (2) the wife could care for boarders or
                    lodgers at home, or (3) the children (including adult sons and daughters) could seek employment.
            In addition to the economically important but unpaid contributions that wives and children made to
                    their families by doing such household tasks as cooking, canning, gardening, making and laundering
                    clothing, cleaning, and caring for children, they could bring in income through taking in boarders
                    and paid employment. The income they earned was usually far less than the wages of an able-bodied
                    husband, yet it could be enough to tide a working-class family over a financial crisis or to allow a
                    middle-class or affluent family to pay for their children's education, purchase a home, or
                    maintain a higher standard of living. In 
                        Indianapolis
                    , the focus of this article, women working in manufacturing from 1850 to 1880 earned
                    from two-fifths to one-half the wages of men.1 A wife could earn $150
                    annually from taking in one boarder, and more from

                     lodging a family.2 Boys and girls working
                    in the city's shops and factories earned only one-third of men's wages, the boys
                    earning slightly more than the girls.3 As children grew older, their wages
                    gradually approached those of adults of their sex.4
            
            The roles that wives and children played in families were fluid, changing with the "life
                    cycle" position of the family. Just as individuals experience life cycle transitions such
                    as birth, school entry, work entry, home leaving, marriage, family formation, retirement, and
                        death,5 so the family may be conceived as having a life cycle of
                    transitions, including marriage; the birth of children; the children's attending school,
                    entering the work force, marrying, and leaving home; and the parents' retiring from work
                    and dying. These transitions do not occur in the same order and at the same pace for all individuals
                    or all families; nonetheless, their regularity across families suggests that the economic
                    circumstances of families, as well as the availability of family members to carry out economic
                    strategies, depends on the family's position in the life cycle.6
            
            American families in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were at a crossroads of broad
                    changes in the economy and society, changes that demanded considerable resourcefulness and
                    flexibility in economic strategies. Children were becoming less an economic asset and more a
                    liability as state after state adopted child labor and mandatory schooling laws.7 Employment opportunities for women—including married women—were
                    opening up in the nation's factories, shops, and offices.8 Concerns
                    about family privacy and the dangers that male boarders presented to the daughters of the family
                    transformed boarding from a practice that affluent and middle-class families undertook out of a
                    charitable spirit to one that working-class and poor families relied on to make ends meet.9 Faced with declining opportunities for some family members to

                     bring in income and better opportunities for other family
                    members, families began to shift primary responsibility for generating income from children to
                    wives, thus reversing the pattern of early industrialization.
            Analyzed in this article are two samples of approximately five hundred individuals each that were
                    drawn from the 1860 and 1900 federal censuses of 
                        Indianapolis
                     and followed for twenty years in later censuses. The following examples of lives
                    reconstructed from these censuses illustrate the resourcefulness of families and the roles that
                    wives and children played in the family economy:
                        In 1860 Mary Bennett,10 twenty-eight years old and born in 
                                New York
                            , lived on West 
                                Washington
                             Street with her husband, George, a thirty-two-year-old milliner from 
                                Massachusetts
                            , their nine-year-old daughter, and five-year-old son. Mary took in a
                            twenty-year-old boarder, who was also a milliner. Ten years later Mary Bennett, now divorced
                            from George and working as a milliner herself, lived with her two children, both of whom
                            were still in school, and her mother, aged sixty-five. The family took in a
                            nineteen-year-old domestic from 
                                Ireland
                             as a boarder. A decade later, in 1880, Mary was still a milliner and was living
                            with her son (now twenty-four and working as a clerk); her daughter and son-in-law (a
                            thirty-year-old clerk from 
                                New Jersey
                            ) and their two young children; her mother (now seventy-six); and a
                            fourteen-year-old female servant from 
                                Germany
                            .
                        Henry Weiss, a German-born grocer aged forty, lived on Noble Street in 1860 with his wife,
                            Mary, aged thirty-eight and also born in 
                                Germany
                            , and their two daughters aged six and four and son aged one. Mary cared for a
                            fifteen-year-old boarder from Baden, 
                                Germany
                            , Henry's birthplace. A decade later all three children were still
                            living at home, along with a twenty-one-year-old relative of Henry's who worked as
                            a painter. Henry himself was now unemployed, perhaps due to illness, and the oldest daughter
                            worked as a seamstress. The Weiss household in 1880 included only Mary and her
                            twenty-one-year-old son Henry, who worked as a laborer, the elder Henry having died in 1878.
                        At the turn of the century, Annie Schroeder, forty years old and from 
                                Ohio
                            , and her husband, Joseph, a thirty-nine-year-old engineer from the same state,
                            lived with their eleven-year-old son and eight-year-old daughter on Gale Street. By 1910 the
                            family had grown to include another son. The two older Schroeder children were employed, the
                            son, now twenty-one, as a bookkeeper at his father's coal dealership, and the
                            daughter, now eighteen, as a saleswoman at L. S. Ayres & Co. Ten years later, in
                            1920, George's coal business was still in operation, with Annie now working as
                            assistant manager for the dealership. Only the youngest son, Forrest, now seventeen, still
                            lived with his parents, and he was working as a helper at a garage.
                        Dennis Williams, a twenty-nine-year-old black hostler born in 
                                Kentucky
                            , and his wife, Sallie, twenty-five years old and from 
                                Tennessee
                            , lived in 1900 on West 12th Street with a boarder, Robert Williams, who was no
                            relation to Dennis but also worked as a hostler. A decade later, Dennis, now working as a
                            street laborer, and Sallie, now doing housework for a family, remained childless. Ten years
                            later in 1920, the Millers were still living alone and were both employed, he as a laborer
                            and she as a day worker.

            Analyses of many such families living in 
                        Indianapolis
                     from 1860 to 1880 and from 1900 to 1920 suggest that families were remarkably flexible
                    in adapting economic strategies of wives and children to their changing needs and opportunities as
                    they grew in size, as other kin moved into or out of the household, as the parents became too old
                    for work or died, as the children reached employment age, and as the older children moved away.
                    Families also responded to their economic and social environment as opportunities for employment
                    increased for some members and declined for others and as the social acceptability of these
                    strategies changed.
            Research in this article builds on earlier research on the "family economy" that
                    views the family as "the mediating institution between individuals and processes of large
                    scale structural change in which they found themselves."11 The
                    industrial family economy involved the family's pooling its wages and services for mutual
                    survival, putting the collective economic requirements of the family above individual needs and
                    goals, adjusting its composition by encouraging children to leave home or marry or by bringing in
                    other relatives to help support the family, and using income-generating strategies of wives and/or
                    children to supplement or replace husbands' earnings.12
            
            Researchers on the family economy have demonstrated in a number of settings that income-generating
                    strategies were used by families in economic need. Families headed by men in unskilled jobs were
                    more likely to rely on wives and/or children for income than those headed by proprietors and
                        professionals.13 Researchers have also uncovered important cultural
                    differences in the use of these strategies. Studies of Italian, Irish, German, and French-Canadian

                     were less likely than families of the native-born to employ
                    wives and more likely to employ children.14 Black families were more likely than
                    white families to employ wives and take in boarders but less likely to send their children out to
                    work. African-American women may have taken jobs so that their children could stay in school or
                    because there were few job openings for their children.15 Other researchers have
                    documented the importance of life cycle processes in the family economy. Michael Haines's
                    study of working-class families in 1889-1890, for example, suggested that taking in boarders and
                    children's employment increased in response to the decline in the husband's income
                    as he aged.16
            
            While much has been learned from research on the family economy, earlier work usually examined only
                    one or two income-generating strategies, focused on a single time period, and failed to follow
                    families over time. The data for 
                        Indianapolis
                     analyzed here are unique in that they allow analyses of (1) how families'
                    social class, race, and nativity affected the economic strategies they adopted, (2) how families
                    changed strategies as they moved through the life cycle, and (3) how these strategies were used by
                    families in periods forty years apart that differed in their economic, social, and demographic
                    climates.
            As Robert G. Barrows has noted in several articles in the Indiana Magazine of
                    History, the manuscript schedules of the federal censuses contain a wealth of information about
                    who lived in a household, their age, sex, race, occupation, place of birth, marital status,
                    relationship to the head of household, etc.17 The two samples analyzed in this
                    article were drawn from the manuscript schedules for 
                        Indianapolis
                     in 1860 and in 1900. The data were gathered by the author and twenty-eight graduate and

                        Bloomington
                    , as part of the Sociological Research Practicum. Only men and women aged eighteen to
                    forty were selected for the samples, so that individuals and families could be studied from the
                    early stages of family formation. Each of the individuals in the 1860 and 1900 samples, their
                    spouses (if they were married), and any children were followed in the two succeeding censuses (1870
                    and 1880 for the 1860 sample and 1910 and 1920 for the 1900 sample). City directories, business
                    directories, marriage records, birth registrations, death certificates, wills, cemetery records, and
                    probate records were used to refine and check information in the censuses and to help link
                    individuals across censuses.18 The censuses give a "snapshot"
                    of these individuals and their families at ten-year intervals. Although the decennial censuses miss
                    many changes in the families' composition and use of economic strategies between censuses,
                    they contain enough information to suggest clear patterns.
            Over the sixty years from 1860 to 1920, the economic, social, and demographic climates in which 
                        Indianapolis
                     families lived changed dramatically. 
                        Indianapolis
                     moved from its first hesitant steps toward industrialization to become one of the
                    nation's most important manufacturing centers. The city in 1860, with 18,611 inhabitants,
                    was the forty-eighth largest in the nation.19 In the Census of Manufactures for
                    that year, 
                        Indianapolis
                     ranked ninetieth among the nation's cities in the value of its manufactured
                    product ($780,955).20 While the pace of industrialization was far
                    from constant and several panics and booms hit the city over the next sixty years, by 1919 
                        Indianapolis
                     firms were putting out almost $400 million in manufactured products, rising
                    to a rank of nineteenth among the nation's cities.21 The
                    city's population grew to 314,194 in 1920, making it the twenty-sixth largest city in the
                        nation.22
            
            
               
                        Indianapolis
                     as a setting for a study of the family economy is advantageous because it provides a
                    different regional focus from all previous work. From the nearly exclusive focus of prior research
                    on the towns and cities of the Northeast, researchers have concluded erroneously that findings based
                    on that region are generalizable to all regions of the country. The northeastern mill towns were
                    often dominated by a single industry (textile manufacturing) and single

                     mode of production (the factory). In contrast, 
                        Indianapolis
                    , like cities outside the Northeast such as 
                        Philadelphia
                     and Milwaukee,23 had a wider range of industries (including
                    clothing manufacturing, lumber and wood, meat packing, machine tools and hardware, among others) and
                    a broader range of forms of production (including small artisan shops, larger hand-powered
                    manufactories, and water- or steam-powered factories).24 Rapid industrialization
                    in the textile towns of the Northeast often meant expanded opportunities for women and children as
                    mechanization allowed their unskilled labor to replace the skilled labor of men.25 No such replacement of skilled men by unskilled women and children occurred in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . From 1850 to 1880, when employment in the city's factories rose from
                    one-quarter of all employees in manufacturing to two-thirds, industries that used factories rarely
                    substituted women or children for men. In 
                        Indianapolis
                     opportunities opened up for women, but these were in industries that did not initially
                    rely on factory production {e.g., men's clothing, dressmaking, and
                    millinery work).26 Since midwestern cities such as 
                        Indianapolis
                     have thus far escaped the attention of researchers on the family economy, the study of
                    the Hoosier capital city helps to extend knowledge of the economic strategies of families to a
                    different economic, cultural, and social milieu.
            In addition to the different course that industrialization took in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , the character and pace of social and cultural change in the Hoosier capital were
                    distinctive in several other respects that may have affected the family economy. Throughout the
                    period considered here no "protective" legislation limited the hours or industries
                    in which Indiana women could work.27 In contrast, by 1914 twenty-seven other
                    states had regulated women's employment.28 Even though women's
                    employment was not legally constrained, from the 1860s until the 1890s it was widely regarded as
                    socially unacceptable for a married woman to be employed. The "cult of True

                    wives who lived on their husbands' wages.29 This message was brought
                    home to Hoosier women in such magazines as The Ladies Own Magazine, published in 
                        Indianapolis
                     until 1873, and The Christian Monitor, published in 
                        Indianapolis
                     after 1863. Yet largely in response to increased employment opportunities for women and
                    to changes in family structure described below, wives' employment became far more
                    permissible, if still not desirable, as the period progressed. In 1870 (the first census to report
                    occupations separately for males and females), females aged ten years and older made up 16.6 percent
                    of the city's employees, a figure slightly higher than that for the nation as a whole (14.7
                        percent).30 Over the next fifty years opportunities for women's
                    employment grew in the clothing industry, laundries, teaching, sales, and clerical work. The
                    percentage of the city's work force made up of women and girls increased to 24.7 percent in
                    1920 (20.5 percent nationally).31 The expanding job opportunities for women and
                    girls in 
                        Indianapolis
                     had a profound effect on which members families turned to when they needed income.
            
               
                        Indianapolis
                     was also distinctive in its racial and ethnic composition and in the ways this
                    composition changed between 1860 and 1920. The city had only a small percentage of
                    blacks—2.6 percent—in 1860.32 The black population
                    increased gradually over the next sixty years to reach 11.1 percent in 1920, an increase that gave
                    the city a higher percentage of African Americans than all neighboring cities except 
                        Louisville
                    . While the immigrant populations of many northeastern cities swelled in the late
                    nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as Italians and East Europeans entered in large numbers, 
                        Indianapolis
                     had a declining percentage of foreign-born citizens over time. It has been estimated
                    that at least 20 percent of the city's population was foreign-born in 1860. Early
                    immigrants to the city were primarily Germans, who arrived after the revolutions of 1848, and the
                    Irish, who arrived after the potato famine. The proportion of foreign-born citizens increased
                    slightly to 22.1 percent in 1870 but declined steadily thereafter to only 5.4 percent in 1920, a
                    lower percentage than all neighboring cities except

                     after 1900, did not come to

                     in large numbers.33
            
            The declining influx of foreign-born people may also be responsible for another distinctive feature
                    of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , one which more directly affected opportunities for families to use economic
                    strategies. It has been argued that an abundance of cheap foreign labor was the motivation behind
                    much of the early child labor legislation.34 Since Indiana and its principal
                    manufacturing city 
                        Indianapolis
                     had a declining immigrant population, there was little incentive to legislate children
                    out of the labor market, and state legislation on child labor and mandatory schooling lagged behind
                    that of other states. Through a series of laws passed from 1867 to 1893, child labor in Indiana was
                    restricted in ages or hours of employment in several industries, but none of these laws was strictly
                    enforced. In 1897 the General Assembly prohibited the employment of children under the age of
                    fourteen in manufacturing. Two years later this law was extended to include mercantile
                    establishments, laundries, bakeries, and printing shops. A 1911 law expanded the restriction on
                    employment of children under fourteen to include all occupations except agriculture and domestic
                    service. Mandatory school legislation in 1897 required children between the ages of eight and
                    fourteen to attend twelve consecutive weeks of school. In 1913 the age of mandatory attendance was
                    increased to sixteen, but employed children aged fourteen and older who had passed fifth grade were
                        exempted.35 The reluctance of Indiana legislators to pass and enforce laws
                    on children's work and schooling suggests that child labor in the Hoosier state may have
                    been an important element in family strategies much longer than it was in states with stricter child
                    labor and mandatory schooling statutes.
            Dubbed the "City of Homes" by Hoosier author Meredith Nicholson, 
                        Indianapolis
                     was promoted by local boosters as place where even working-class families could afford
                    a home. From 1870 to 1920 
                        Indianapolis
                     was well below the national average for cities in the number of excess persons per
                    dwelling—the difference between the number of persons to a family and the number of
                    persons to a home or apartment. The number of excess persons declined from 0.9 in 1870 to 0.5 in
                    1920 locally versus 1.7 and 1.8,

                     respectively, nationally.36 The tendency of
                    families in 
                        Indianapolis
                     to limit their households to family members suggests that boarding may have been a less
                    common means of generating extra income in 
                        Indianapolis
                     than in other cities of the period. That 
                        Indianapolis
                     households were also less likely as this period progressed to include people outside
                    the family hints at the decline in the practice of boarding that has been observed in other cities.
            In addition to these economic and social changes, profound changes in family structure and living
                    arrangements took place between 1860, when the first sample of 
                        Indianapolis
                     residents was interviewed by census canvassers, and 1900, when the second sample was
                    interviewed. These changes also had important implications for the economic strategies used by
                    families. Paralleling a long-term national trend toward smaller families,37
                    married people in the 1900 sample had fewer children than married people forty years earlier. Table
                    1 shows some household characteristics of the married people in the 1860 and 1900 samples. In
                    reading this table one can make comparisons across the two samples by comparing the 1860 sample with
                    the 1900 sample, the 1870 follow-up with the 1910 follow-up, and the 1880 follow-up with the 1920
                    follow-up. There were fewer families with children living at home in the 1900 sample and its
                    follow-ups than in the 1860 sample and its follow-ups. The mean number of children living at home,
                    as calculated from the 
                        Indianapolis
                     data, was also considerably smaller in the twentieth century (1.2, 2.1, and 1.6 in
                    1900, 1910, and 1920, respectively) than in the nineteenth century (1.9, 3.2, and 2.7 in 1860, 1870,
                    and 1880, respectively).
            The smaller family sizes after the turn of the century had implications for the family economy. Fewer
                    children at home meant that wives were freed to seek employment and that fewer children were
                    available to substitute for their mothers in the labor market.38 Smaller family
                    sizes may also have led families to hold on to their sons and daughters longer in order to extract
                    the most income from them and may also have meant that taking in boarders became for wives a less
                    appealing alternative to taking a job since there was less need to remain at home
                    caring for children.
            Counterbalancing the tendency for families to have fewer children after the turn of the century was a
                    tendency to have more rel-atives living at home (see Table 1). Nearly one-quarter of

                  SOURCE: Samples drawn from the U.S. Census of 
                                Indianapolis
                            , 1860 and 1900, followed at 10 and 20 year intervals in the census.
               
                     households in 1900 included kin outside the nuclear family of
                    the husband, wife, and their children, up from less than one-fifth of households in 1860. Twenty
                    years later, in 1920, nearly one-third of these families had other relatives living at home compared
                    with just over one-quarter of families in 1880. Twice as many families had parents of either the
                    husband or wife living in the home after the turn of the century as did so forty years earlier. That
                    parents were more likely to live in the households of their adult sons and daughters after the turn
                    of the century may reflect the longer lifespans of people in this period, yet the incorporation of
                    other kin in the household may itself have been in part an economic strategy that had important
                    implications for the family economy. Although such relatives meant more mouths to feed, they could
                    free a wife to take a job by helping with housework or childcare. At the same time, however,
                    relatives took up space in a home and could preclude the option of taking in boarders. Since some
                    resident kin worked, they might allow a child to stay in school and out of the work force longer.
            Another change in family living arrangements, as shown in Table 1, is the decline in the number of
                    families employing servants in the early twentieth century relative to families forty years earlier.
                    Expanding opportunities for women in clerical and sales work and in factories made domestic service
                    less attractive to the immigrant women for whom this had been the only employment option.39 The availability of laundry services, factory-made clothing, and prepared
                    foods reduced the need for servants. At the same time, new household technologies, such as sewing
                    machines, wringers, and washing machines, shifted the burden of duties performed by servants in some
                    homes to housewives themselves.40
            
            The living arrangements of single people in the 
                        Indianapolis
                     samples also suggest broad social and demographic changes that affected the family
                    economy. Single people represented a cusp in family economic strategies. Some lived at home with
                    their parents and brought income into their families, thus were part of the family economy of their
                    family of origin. Others lived away from home as boarders or servants in other families before they
                    married and began their own families. Table 2 shows the relationship of the single men and women in
                    the 1860 and 1900 samples to the heads of their households. The percentage of single people living
                    at home with a relative (usually their parents) increased dramatically from 1860 to 1900 (from
                    two-fifths to nearly two-thirds). In their classic

                    that, with industrialization, "a new phase had entered the life cycle: a prolonged period
                    of time spent with parents between puberty and marriage." These authors speculated that
                    sons and daughters had begun to live with their parents for a longer time than at any previous time
                    in Western history. Far from breaking up families, industrialization, at least initially, bound
                    families together. The increased residence of adult children at home was not, however, entirely a
                    matter of choice or of closer family ties as Katz and Davey suggest.41 It may
                    also reflect a tendency for parents to hold on to their smaller number of children longer in order
                    to draw the maximum income from their employment.
            In 1900 only half as many single men and women boarded with another family as did so forty years
                    earlier (23.0 percent and 13.7 percent, respectively, in 1900 versus 52.3 percent and 27.3 percent
                    in 1860). This decrease suggests a preference of adult sons and daughters for remaining in their
                    parents' households or at least a willingness to continue contributing to the family
                    economy and reflects no doubt as well the declining popularity of boarding as a
                    "respectable" means of generating income (see Table 2).42 In
                    both 1860 and 1900 boarding was far less common among single women than among single men. For single
                    women, working as a servant for another family served a similar function to boarding in affording

                     them some independence from their families.43 Reflecting the decline in the use of servants seen above as well as increased opportunities
                    for employment in other occupations is the fact that less than half as many single women worked as
                    servants in another household in 1900 (12.6 percent) as in 1860 (32.5 percent).
            The best overall sense of how 
                        Indianapolis
                     families adapted their economic strategies to the changing social, economic, and
                    demographic milieus in which they lived can be seen in Table 3. Over the forty-year period between
                    the samples, the employment of wives increased by two- or threefold. In the initial samples 2.9
                    percent of families used wives' employment as an income-generating strategy in 1860 versus
                    7.7 percent in 1900. Twenty years later, in 1880, 7.2 percent of the families relied on
                    wives' employment compared to 18.3 percent of the families in 1920. Married
                    women's employment increased in a context in which the "cult of True
                    Womanhood" was fading in popularity, in which smaller family sizes meant that women spent
                    less time on childcare at home and had fewer children to substitute for them in the labor force, in
                    which the greater number of relatives at home could provide childcare, thus allow wives to take
                    jobs, and in which employment opportunities for women—both married and
                    single—in Indiana grew unimpeded by "protective" legislation.
            Acceptance of boarders in the home declined in popularity after the turn of the century, as is
                    indicated above in the analyses of single people. Of the two strategies available to wives to bring
                    in income, however, taking in boarders was generally more common than entering the labor force, as
                    other researchers have also found.44 The preference for boarding over employment
                    was especially true of wives in the 1860 sample. The larger family sizes in the nineteenth century
                    meant that there were more children to take care of at home and that there was more incentive for
                    wives to care for boarders at home. The greater number of relatives in the home after the turn of
                    the century may have prohibited taking in boarders and allowed the wife to take a job. Not until
                    1920 did wives' employment surpass taking in boarders as the preferred strategy. Comparison
                    of the levels of boarding in 
                        Indianapolis
                     with levels in other cities suggests that 
                        Indianapolis
                     families were somewhat less likely to undertake this practice than families in other
                        cities.45

            Child labor and mandatory schooling legislation should have reduced the employment of children in the
                    1900 samples relative to the 1860 samples, yet levels of children's employment as a
                    strategy of families in 
                        Indianapolis
                     rose somewhat from 1860 to 1900 and from 1870 to 1910. Not until 1920 did the
                    employment of children fall off relative to that of forty years earlier. Several elements that help
                    to explain the shift in levels of children's employment need to be elaborated. First, few 
                        Indianapolis
                     families employed children under age fifteen in any of the sample years. Most of the
                    employed "children" in families were children only in the sense of being offspring
                    and were well beyond the ages at which they would have been considered children in the contemporary
                    sense of the word.46 The average age of employed children in these samples was
                    over seventeen in all years. It is not surprising, therefore, that child labor and mandatory
                    schooling legislation had little effect on overall levels of children's employment.
            Second, state legislation on children's employment and education initially did little to
                    limit the employment of young children. As noted above, a driving force behind such legislation in
                    other states was an ever-increasing pool of cheap immigrant labor. In states with large supplies of
                    foreign-born workers, child labor was not

                needed, and children were legislated out of the labor market by social reformers.47 Indiana and its capital city had a declining number of
                    immigrants from 1860 to 1920. There was little economic impetus to restrict children's
                    employment, and the state lagged behind other states in legislation on children. Spotty enforcement
                    made the laws that were enacted ineffective. The state's Department of Factory Inspection,
                    created in 1899, consisted of one factory inspector and two deputies, a fact that allowed only one
                    inspection per factory each year at best. In 1904 Harriet 
                        Van
                     Der Vaart, a special investigator for the National Child Labor Committee, observed
                    extensive misreporting of children's ages on affidavits intended to prevent underage
                    employees from working, as well as inaccuracies in the inspector's reports on
                    children's employment in specific factories.48

            Third, reflecting the growing job opportunities for women in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , the employment of daughters actually increased in the post-1900 period relative to the
                    post-1860 period, even as the employment of sons declined (see Table 3). Three times as many
                    families relied on sons' employment as on daughters' employment in 1880 (48.6
                    percent versus 15.9 percent, respectively), yet in 1920 only a slightly higher percentage of
                    families depended on sons' employment than depended on daughters' employment (30.5
                    percent versus 24.4 percent).
            The increasing reliance of parents on daughters' employment can also be seen among the
                    single men and women in the 
                        Indianapolis
                     samples. Parents may have made up the income gap caused by the smaller number of
                    children born after the turn of the century by holding on to their children longer, by sending more
                    of their children living at home out to work, and by encouraging them to marry later. Table 2
                    indicated that single men and women were far more likely to live at home after the turn of the
                    century. In the first decades of the twentieth century single people were also more likely to be
                    employed than were their counterparts forty years earlier. The percentage of single men at home who
                    were employed rose from 84.9 percent in 1860 to 90.0 percent in 1900, while the corresponding
                    percentages of single women at home who were employed jumped from 27.6 percent to 43.1 percent.
                    Greater employment opportunities for daughters meant that their employment increased more over these
                    forty years—by over 50 percent—than did the employment of sons (6 percent).
                    Given daughters' increased economic value to their parents after the turn of the century,
                    it is not surprising that women married later in 1900 (ages twenty-two to twenty-four) than in 1860
                    (ages eighteen to twenty) while men married at roughly the same ages in 1900 as in 1860 (ages
                    twenty-five to twenty-seven).49 While research on American families today
                    suggests that coresidence of adult children with parents is largely to the children's
                        benefit,50 coresidence in the early twentieth century may have been at least
                    as much to the parents' benefit as to the children's.
            The use of specific economic strategies by 
                        Indianapolis
                     families across the periods considered here shifted away from the use of boarding and
                    sons' employment and toward the use of wives' and daughters' employment.

                    families in 1880 but by 12.3 percent and 38.2 percent of families in 1900 and 1920, respectively.
                    The use of wives' and daughters' employment increased from 2.9 percent of families
                    in 1860 and 21.0 percent in 1880 to 10.6 percent and 42.0 percent in 1900 and 1920, respectively.
            As earlier research on the family economy suggests, wives' employment, boarding, and
                    children's employment were not random occurrences but were structured by the
                    families' economic circumstances, racial or ethnic origin, and composition. Tables 4, 5,
                    and 6 show how characteristics of the families of married people in the 
                        Indianapolis
                     samples affected whether or not they adopted income-generating strategies.
            The economic status of families conditioned their use of economic strategies. Wives in families that
                    had servants were generally less likely to take jobs than wives in families without servants (see
                    Table 4). The unemployment, absence, or death of a husband made a wife more likely to take a job;
                    yet, in several years, wives of men in white-collar and professional jobs were more likely to work
                    outside the home than wives of men in other occupations. In his study of the Union Park community in 
                        Chicago
                     in the late nineteenth century, Richard Sennett also found a tendency for greater
                    employment of wives in middle-class than in working-class families, a condition he said arose
                    because an employed wife presented less of a challenge to the authority of a white-collar husband
                    than to a blue-collar husband.51
            
            As others have observed, boarding appears to have changed over this broad period from being a common
                    practice of affluent families, who may have taken in boarders out of a sense of charity, to a
                    strategy of less well off families, who probably undertook the practice out of economic
                        necessity.52 In the 1860 sample and its follow-ups, families employing
                    servants were more likely to take in boarders than those without servants (see Table 5). In the 1900
                    sample and follow-ups, however, families employing servants were generally less likely than those
                    not employing servants to accept boarders. The husband's occupation was less clearly
                    related to taking in boarders, but there is some tendency for boarding to be more common among the
                    higher-paying occupations in 1860 and 1870, and among the lower-paying occupations in the 1900
                    sample and its follow-ups.
            Children's employment was also affected by some aspects of the family's economic
                    status. Levels of children's employment tended to be higher in families not employing
                    servants than in those with servants (see Table 6). In several census years, children in

                     families with an absent, unemployed, or deceased husband were
                    more likely to be employed than children in families with an employed husband. Otherwise, however,
                    the husband's occupation was not consistently related to children's employment.
            Analyses of the economic characteristics of the families of single people who were living at home
                    shed further light on children's employment (see Table 7). Sons of fathers who were absent,
                    deceased, or unemployed were generally more likely to be employed than sons of fathers who were
                    employed. Employment of sons also tends to increase as one moves down the occupational scale. The
                    likelihood of a daughter being employed had little to do with the occupation of her father. Both
                    sons and daughters of families that had servants, however, were considerably less likely to be
                    employed than children of families without servants.
            Thus the economic circumstances of families in 
                        Indianapolis
                     tended to affect their use of income-generating strategies, a conclusion borne out by
                    other studies of the family economy.53 The preceding tables further indicate,
                    however, that not only poor or working-class families used these strategies but also some
                    middle-class and affluent families who hoped to enhance their economic position.
            By any standard, blacks in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were far worse off
                    economically than whites. The economic disadvantage of African Americans should have made them more
                    likely to adopt income-generating strategies, but cultural factors probably led them to choose some
                    strategies over others. There were, unfortunately, too few blacks in the 1860 sample to say whether
                    they were more likely than whites to adopt income-generating strategies. Black families in the 1900
                    sample and its follow-ups were generally more likely to use both of the strategies of
                    wives—employment and taking in boarders—but less likely than white families to
                    send their children out to work, findings which are consistent with prior research on other cities
                    (see Tables 4, 5, and 6).54 It is not clear whether African Americans made this
                    choice because of poor employment opportunities for black children and young adults or because of
                    the willingness of black mothers to sacrifice in order to keep their children in school.55
            
            Foreign-born people tended to be less advantaged than native-born people, thus might be expected to
                    have used income-generating strategies disproportionately. As studies of the Irish and Italians in
                    other cities have found, however,

                     with a foreign-born husband or wife had lower rates of
                    wives' employment than those in which both were native-born (see Table 4).56 There was little difference by nativity in the use of boarding as a strategy (see Table 5),
                    but families of foreign-born individuals as compared to those of natives were generally more likely
                    to put their children to work (see Table 6).
            Separate analyses of the single men and women living at home show that daughters of foreign-born
                    people were somewhat less likely than those of native-born parents to be employed in both 1860 and
                    1900 (see Table 7). The fact that nativity differences in employment were greater for daughters than
                    for sons suggests that cultural traditions viewing women's place as in the home may have
                    been partly responsible for the slightly lower employment rates of daughters of foreign-born
                    parents. Families of foreign-born individuals apparently relied on strategies involving children,
                    but especially employment of sons, to keep wives at home yet maintain their standard of living.57
            
            Other relatives living in the home made it more likely that a wife would be employed, probably
                    because these kin relieved the wife of housework so that she could take a job (see Table 4). Such
                    relatives, no doubt because they occupied space in the home, generally made it less likely that a
                    family took in boarders (see Table 5). Relatives in the household had no consistent effect on
                    children's employment in the 1860 sample but, as Claudia Goldin found for 
                        Philadelphia
                    ,58 had a strong effect in freeing children from the obligation to
                    work in the 1900 sample (see Table 6). Since children's employment was probably viewed less
                    favorably after the turn of the century, some of the relatives in the homes of the 1900 families may
                    have been taken in with an eye toward keeping children in school and out of the labor market.59
            
            Earlier research on the family economy suggests that one of the most important factors affecting the
                    use of income-generating strategies is the family's position in the life cycle. As families
                    "aged," the age distributions of the husband, wife, and children changed, a fact
                    that created greater economic need in some stages of the life cycle and greater opportunities for
                    employment of family

                     members in other stages. The life cycle position of families
                    may be most succinctly described by the age of the wife (or husband). Table 8 shows the age
                    distribution of children in the 1860 and 1900 samples for three broad age cohorts (groupings) of
                    wives and indicates the ways this distribution changed as the wives (and families) aged ten and
                    twenty years. This table can best be read by following the same cohort of wives as they aged. For
                    example, families of the youngest cohort of wives, who were aged 15-24 in 1860, can be followed
                    across the table to 1870, when the wives would have been aged 25-34, and to 1880, when the wives
                    would have been aged 35-44. Simply put, as they aged, families had more children; the children grew
                    older; and more and more of them reached peak employment ages of fifteen and over.
            These shifts in composition as families moved through the life cycle had important implications for
                    the family economy. Table 9 shows how each of the strategies was used by the cohorts of wives. All
                    three income-generating strategies tended to follow a rise-and-fall pattern as families moved
                    through the life cycle. Wife's employment, for example, rose among the two youngest cohorts
                    of wives (aged 15-24 and 25-34) in the 1860 sample as they aged ten and twenty years but declined
                    among the oldest cohort of wives (aged 35 and over) as they aged. When families were young, the only
                    income-generating strategies available to them were those of wives. Taking in boarders was preferred
                    over taking a job because it allowed a wife to work at home with her young children. Several factors
                    created greater economic need as the family aged: (1) the number of children grew (see Table 8); (2)
                    the earnings capacity of husbands began to fall as men reached their thirties and early forties;60 and (3) the number of families without income from the husband because of his
                    death, absence, or unemployment increased (see the distribution of husband's occupation in
                    the Appendix Table). As need increased, wives made up the gap between their husbands'
                    income and what was needed by taking jobs or, more likely, taking in boarders. Once the children
                    were old enough to work, however, their employment became the preferred alternative to their
                    mothers' employment or taking in boarders, and the two latter strategies fell off. Later,
                    as the children began to leave home or marry, use of children's employment as an
                    income-generating strategy also fell off.
            One exception to these rise-and-fall patterns is that wives' employment did not fall off in
                    the 1900 sample. The growing employment opportunities available to women as the twentieth century
                    progressed must have kept some wives in the labor force

                                Indianapolis
                            , 1860 and 1900, followed at 10 and 20 year intervals in the census. See Table 8

                     longer than their counterparts forty years earlier. The
                    twentieth-century wives also had fewer children to care for at home or to take their places in the
                    labor market and more relatives who could care for their children while they worked. No doubt some
                    of these wives, especially the better educated among them in clerical, sales, and professional jobs,
                    enjoyed the intrinsic rewards of employment as well as the power and independence that their jobs
                    afforded them.61
            
            Another exception to the rise-and-fall patterns is that children's employment rose but did
                    not fall in the 1860 sample. Had these families been followed for a longer period than twenty years,
                    children's employment would certainly have fallen as the children moved out of their
                    parents' homes.
            Families living in 
                        Indianapolis
                     in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries stood at a crossroads of dramatic
                    changes in the economy and society. Falling family sizes and growing opportunities for
                    women's employment meant that wives and daughters came to play far larger economic roles in
                    the survival or advancement of their families than they had before. As boarding and domestic service
                    declined in popularity, adult children lived with their parents longer, possibly so that their
                    parents could garner as much income as possible from their smaller number of children. Moreover, the
                    larger number of parents, in-laws, and other relatives living with families after the turn of the
                    century freed wives to take jobs in the labor market, limited the possibilities for taking in
                    boarders, and helped to keep children out of the labor market. Although few families relied heavily
                    on the labor of very young children, child labor laws and mandatory schooling legislation, once they
                    began to be more strictly enforced, took away the option of young children's labor for some
                    families. Later, as the educational and skill requirements of jobs escalated, as the demand for
                    unskilled child labor diminished, and as children stayed in school longer, fewer and fewer families
                    could count even on older children for much income.62 The flow of income between
                    generations reversed direction. Whereas in the nineteenth century children were sent out to work to
                    support their mothers, in the twentieth century a new pattern began to emerge as more and more
                    mothers took jobs outside their homes to support their children. In what historian William
                    O'Neill called "the most significant event in the modern history of
                        women,"63 a revolution was occurring in women's roles in
                    both the family economy and the local or national economy.

                     In 1990 fully 73.0 percent of 
                        Indianapolis
                     women with children under eighteen at home were employed.64
            
            Were much the same changes occurring in other cities across the nation? Since this is one of the
                    first studies to compare family strategies in the twentieth century with those in the nineteenth
                    century, it is difficult to say. In terms of its implications for the family economy, the most
                    important sense in which 
                        Indianapolis
                     was distinctive was the reluctance of state legislators to restrict either
                    women's or children's employment. The lack of "protective"
                    legislation for women and the foot dragging on child labor laws meant that opportunities for
                    women's employment—including that of married women—rose unchecked
                    throughout this period and that young children's employment was used by some 
                        Indianapolis
                     families after this strategy had declined in communities with stricter state laws. Yet
                    the broad outlines of change in 
                        Indianapolis
                     were probably true of other communities as well. Today it is wives and not children who
                    are the principal earners in the family beyond the husband, and few families take in boarders to
                    help support themselves.
            The two samples of married and single people in this study were captured in time for only twenty
                    years of their lives; yet through this score of years they showed remarkable flexibility in adapting
                    to changing times and to the inevitable ebb and flow of family life as children were born, came of
                    working age, married, and left home and as mothers and fathers aged and died. Over the brief periods
                    in the lives of the married people and their families portrayed here, most families used at least
                    one of the three strategies to support themselves or to enhance their social position.65 The single people, many of whom were still contributing economically to their families
                    of origin, typically went on to marry and form families of their own.66 No doubt
                    their families as well had to respond creatively to good times and bad, to birth, growth, aging, and
                    death, just as did the 
                        Indianapolis
                     families portrayed in this study.

                    The 
                            Indianapolis
                         Samples
                
            To ensure random samples every nth67 man or woman, aged eighteen to forty years,
                    was selected from the 1860 and 1900 schedules. This selection resulted in initial samples of 516
                    individuals in 1860 and 492 in 1900. The analyses in this article were conducted separately for
                    ever-married men and women and their families (309 cases in 1860 and 284 cases in 1900) and single
                    men and women (207 cases in 1860 and 208 cases in 1900).
            Individuals were linked across censuses by closely examining and tracking their name, address, age,
                    occupation, family members' names, place of birth, and parents' place of birth. To
                    facilitate making linkages across censuses at ten-year intervals, individuals were also followed
                    year by year in the city directories for 
                        Indianapolis
                    . All linkages were independently reviewed by at least two members of the research team
                    for accuracy, and ambiguous linkages were not included in the follow-ups. In 1880 and 1920 the
                    Soundex indices, which group similar sounding names together, were used to locate individuals and
                    family members in the 1860 and 1900 samples, respectively. Soundex indices were not available for
                    1870 and 1910. The 1870 census of 
                        Indianapolis
                     was searched twice by the research team for members of the 1860 sample, as was the
                    second enumeration of this census in 1871.68 In locating individuals in the 1900
                    sample in 1910, addresses, as determined from the city directories for 1909, 1910, and 1911, were
                    cross-referenced with the location of addresses in the census to narrow down the location of
                    individuals in the census. The 1910 census was then scanned twice by the research team to locate
                    individuals who had not already been found. While researchers were very thorough in attempting to
                    locate individuals in the 1870 and 1910 censuses, undoubtedly some were missed who might have been
                    picked up had there been Soundex indices for these censuses.
            Because it proved more difficult to follow single people across censuses and because most of the
                    single people who persisted in the city for ten or twenty years had by then married, the analyses of
                    single people in this article are limited to the initial samples for 1860 and 1900. Married people
                    in the 1860 sample are followed in 1870 and 1880, and those in the 1900 sample are followed in 1910
                    and 1920. In the decade after the two initial sample years, 46.6 percent of the 1860 sample of
                    married persons and 50.7 percent of the 1900 sample remained, the rest having either moved from the
                    city 
                  
                     67 N was chosen to yield samples of approximately 500 individuals in
                            each census year. The selection of each sample was begun with a random start from 1 to n.

                     or died. Twenty years after the initial samples were drawn,
                    44.7 percent of the 1860 sample and 46.1 percent of the 1900 sample could be found. These
                    persistence rates are within the range of what has been found for other cities of the period
                    although they are not as high as Barrows found for male heads of household listed in the city
                    directory for 
                        Indianapolis
                    , men who were probably more geographically stable.69 The follow-ups
                    of married people consist of 144 cases in 1870, 138 cases in 1880, 144 cases in 1910, and 131 cases
                    in 1920.
            The most likely reason that individuals dropped out of the initial samples is that they moved on to
                    seek their fortunes elsewhere. A small percentage of individuals died before the next
                    census." A tendency for some types of people to persist more than others could affect
                    findings based on the "stayers" in 1870,1880, 1910, and 1920. In this study a
                    selectivity model was estimated by using a logistic regression equation in which persistence to each
                    of the follow-ups (versus nonpersistence) was regressed on the social characteristics of individuals
                    in the initial samples (sex, wife's age, race, nativity [foreign- vs. native-born],
                    husband's occupation71 and employment, the presence of servants, and
                    the use of each of the income-generating strategies).72 These regressions
                    (available on request from the author) showed that none of the characteristics of married
                    individuals in either initial sample was significantly related to persistence ten or twenty years
                    hence. Either the follow-ups are random samples of the initial samples, or biases, if they do exist,
                    do not arise from the social characteristics included in the selectivity model.
            The income-generating strategies are measured as follows: Wife employed indicates
                    whether the wife, widow, or divorcee reported an occupation in the census or did not report an
                        occupation.73 Since not all wives or husbands would feel comfortable
                    acknowledging the wife's employment and since some informal forms of employment in the home
                    such as taking in sewing or laundry

                            sample were either listed in the death records for the city or, in the case of men, their

                            1860 sample reportedly died. Of the 1900 sample, 2.8 percent were reported as dying between
                            1900 and 1910, and 4.6 percent reportedly died between 1911 and 1920. These figures
                            understate the percentage of sample members who died because they include only those who
                            died in the city.

            Indiana's First Woman in Congress: Virginia E. Jenckes and the New Deal, 1932-1938
            
                    Edward K. Spann∗
               
                
            In 1932 Virginia E. Jenckes of 
                        Terre Haute
                     became the first woman ever elected to Congress from the state of Indiana. She was to
                    win two more terms, serving for six years, a notable achievement since she was a New Deal Democrat
                    from a conservative congressional district in a generally conservative state; in winning, she
                    defeated a total of three incumbent congressmen. That she was a woman seems not to have been a major
                    handicap, probably because she had been anticipated by a previous generation of women, especially in
                    the Populist movement, who had combined crusades against purported enemies of the public good with
                    eventually successful demands for women's right to participate in the political process.
            Jenckes cannot be identified strongly with modern feminism, coming of age as she did after the
                    triumph of women's suffrage and before the most recent phases of the feminist movement. As
                    a woman politician, she was sui generis, the product of the special circumstances
                    of western Indiana and the special times of the Great Depression. She did represent, however, an
                    important American political tradition, one that could be summed up in her case by the glib but not
                    inaccurate formula of populism, patriotism, and paranoia.
            In describing her background Jenckes gave much attention to her pioneer ancestors but little to her
                    own childhood. Born in 
                        Terre Haute
                     in 1878, the daughter of druggist James E. Sommes, she was educated in 
                        Terre Haute
                     schools, entering Wiley High School when she was eleven and finishing her education at
                    Coates College in the city. She later said that she wanted to be a professional woman, a physician,
                    but received no support for her dream. Eventually she married Ray Jenckes, a successful grain dealer
                    some thirty-four years her senior.1

                        Virginia
                     Jenckes's public life began with the death of her husband in 1921, a change
                    that left her with a young daughter, 
                        Virginia
                    , and a large farm as well as her husband's grain business. Managing the farm
                    soon made her aware of the problems common to Hoosier agriculture, especially the periodic flooding
                    of the Wabash River. At one point in the 1920s, as she recalled, the river
                    flooded nine times in fourteen months, causing millions of dollars in damage. When she and
                    neighboring farm owners lost one fight against flooding, they formed the
                        Wabash-Maumee Valley Improvement Association to lobby
                    for public flood control measures, and Jenckes became its secretary. Within a short time the
                    association had some ten thousand paid-up members, providing her with contacts throughout a large
                    area of western Indiana.2
            
            By the late 1920s Jenckes had become involved with Democratic party politics. In June, 1928, a 
                        Terre Haute
                     newspaper published a photograph of her and another local woman Democrat standing
                    beside an automobile with a large "AL SMITH" plate on its front; the two were
                    headed to the Democratic national convention in 
                        Houston
                     to lobby for the inclusion of a flood control plank in the party platform. In 1930 she
                    considered running for Congress, but she was distracted by a major flood on the 
                        Wabash
                     and contented herself with efforts to persuade women to get out to vote for the
                    Democratic ticket.3 Two years later, when she did run, circumstances had shifted
                    strongly in her favor.
            By 1932 a deepening depression persuaded many voters that a change in representation was needed.
                    Moreover, the state was forced by the loss of one of its congressional seats under the census of
                    1930 to remap its congressional districts; the result was a new Sixth Congressional District that
                    stretched northward along the 
                        Wabash
                     from 
                        Vigo County
                     to 
                        Warren County
                    . This change undoubtedly worked to Jenckes's advantage when she ran in the
                    Democratic primary against the incumbent congressman, Court-land C. Gillen. Even though it was less
                    than fifteen years since women had achieved the right to vote, there was no serious objection to her
                    standing for Congress, in part because women had already gained some political prominence within the
                    party; the vice-chairperson of the 
                        Vigo County
                     Democratic Committee was Emma May, who herself ran in the primary for a state position.
            Gillen's position was weakened not only by the reshuffling of his district and by changing
                    times but by his identification with a failed and increasingly unpopular Prohibition. In contrast,

                     had long favored repeal of the Great Experiment on the grounds
                    that it had denied Hoosier farmers an important market for their grain and produced what she saw as
                    a catastrophic drop in grain prices. In 1932, in the face of collapsing farm incomes, her stand had
                    much popular appeal, and she won the primary with a substantial majority. Gillen, who lived in 
                        Greencastle
                    , blamed an unwanted endorsement by the Anti-Saloon League for his failure but accepted
                    his defeat with some grace, calling Jenckes "a nice girl [she was then forty-four years
                    old] and a scrappy scrapper."4
            
            In the fall general election Jenckes ran a strong campaign against her Republican opponent, Fred S.
                    Purnell of Attica, who was also an incumbent congressman (in a district lost in the reorganization).
                    She pledged to support the national Democratic party's promise to cut federal spending by
                    25 percent, adding that she also would work to remove the meddlesome presence of the federal
                    bureaucracy from people's lives. Overall, she called for "a new deal, common
                    honesty in government, and an end of bureaucratic spending" as well as a program to
                    eliminate what she saw as the twin evils afflicting local farmers, namely floods and Prohibition.5 Accompanied by her daughter, she roamed the district, giving some two hundred
                    speeches in nearly every township in the ten-county area, the whole campaign costing, by her later
                    estimate, a grand total of $1,500. Shortly before the election she said, "I
                    campaigned in my own auto and planned my own speeches. If I'm elected, I'll
                    continue to be my own boss."6
            
            Jenckes easily won the election, taking nearly 60 percent of the vote in populous 
                        Vigo County
                     and carrying six of the other nine counties in the district. Her election evoked
                    considerable attention, some of it from the national press, including the 
                        New York
                    
                    Times. In January, 1933, Minnie H. Williams of 
                        Massachusetts
                     predicted that Jenckes would soon be a "woman of national interest,"
                    and an 
                        Indianapolis
                     man declared, "most of the women who have gone to 
                        Washington
                     had neither your pep nor your brains, and you have in you to make a hit with the
                    American people." Conscious of the importance of her new role for women, she declared soon
                    after election that she was determined to make "such a record that any member of my own sex
                    will point with pride to the fact that a woman helped to solve the most difficult
                        problems."7
            
            Not all went smoothly. On her first day in the House of Representatives Jenckes provoked a minor
                    crisis by wearing her favorite

                     red hat, unwittingly violating a House rule against wearing
                    hats. On the whole, however, she won favorable notice both in 
                        Washington
                    , D.C., and back home. In June, 1933, she attracted attention by flying back to 
                        Terre Haute
                     to lend her support to the repeal of Prohibition, landing at the city's
                    airport with Eleanor Roosevelt, who was flying on to 
                        California
                    . Later, she was to say that the president's wife was "a peculiar
                    person. I never liked her." On the other hand, she was charmed by the president himself and
                    attempted to win his notice. In September, 1933, after seeing a picture of FDR seated at a desk on
                    which an elephant stood, she sent him a little pottery rooster, declaring proudly that in the last
                    election "the rooster had put the elephant out of business," a bit of partisan
                    symbolism that won her some national attention.8
            
            Jenckes planned to get her congressional career off to a fast start. In her campaign she had pledged
                    to give her special attention to the relief of the depressed farmer in the conviction, as she put it
                    later, that "no nation can be a great nation until that nation protects the producers of
                    the food." Deciding that the problem was not overproduction but inadequate demand, she
                    began to consult with experts on such matters as the use of cornstalks in the production of paper
                    and on the mixture of grain alcohol with gasoline to produce motor fuel. In March, 1933, she
                    attempted to organize "The National Committee for Development of Greater Use of Farm
                    Products," declaring that she had "assurance of support from powerful national
                    interests" and that the committee's work "will be a big thing for our
                    Indiana farmers as well as corn farmers throughout America." Nothing came of this, however,
                    because she could not persuade key people to serve on her committee.9
            
            Jenckes's efforts to find new uses for agricultural commodities essentially ended at this
                    point. She showed far greater persistence in her efforts to protect Wabash
                    Valley farmers and other interests from the menace of flooding. In the summer of 1933 she
                    began a push for an $18,000,000 appropriation for flood control, telling President
                    Roosevelt that the government "can make no greater contribution for the permanent
                    Industrial Recovery of the State of Indiana." She backed her effort by getting her
                    constituents to blitz the president with telegrams supporting flood control. In arguing the need for
                    a federal program, she said that the local levee-building efforts of farmers like herself had been
                    defeated because

                     no systematic effort had been made to control flood waters
                    above their projects.10
            
            Jenckes was able to persuade the Army Corps of Engineers to support a comprehensive plan of flood
                    control for the 
                        Wabash
                     and White rivers, a combined drainage area that she said included "22,000
                    square miles of the richest and most productive country in America." When in June the House
                    began consideration of the appropriation for the 
                        Wabash
                     region, it chose Jenckes to preside over the session. Eventually, after a disappointing
                    defeat in the Senate, a bill containing the $18,000,000 appropriation was enacted into
                    law. By 1938, in her last term, Jenckes was attempting to use flood control as the basis for a new
                    appropriation to improve navigation on the 
                        Wabash
                    .11
            
            Jenckes's campaign for flood control was one of her various efforts to meet the needs of her
                    constituents. Besides using her influence to get government money for the construction of post
                    offices and other projects, she supported policies suited to the varied needs of people within her
                    district. In 1933, for instance, she gave some special attention to veterans by fighting to have the
                    Indiana contingent of the Bonus March on 
                        Washington
                     provided with government housing and announcing that she favored government assistance
                    for destitute and handicapped former soldiers. To protect the dairy industry she fought to retain a
                    duty on imported coconut oil used in oleomargarine, and she also intervened to prevent the
                    foreclosure of an Indiana farmer's mortgage by the Federal Land-Bank.12
            
            Although Jenckes was particularly anxious to establish herself as a champion of agriculture, she also
                    sought the support of organized labor, especially the railroad brotherhoods and the American
                    Federation of Labor. Among other things she insisted that "Indiana mined coal" be
                    used in federal relief work in the state. Since 
                        Vigo County
                     had a substantial black minority, she gave some thought to them as well, citing as an
                    example her effort to save a "colored" orphanage in 
                        Washington
                    , D.C., as well as her support of programs which benefited all races. Overall, she
                    promised to get "the story of our Sixth district before Congress, the terrible plight of

            During her three terms Jenckes was a loyal supporter of New Deal policies. She voted with the
                    substantial majorities in the House of Representatives that passed bills for work relief, farm
                    supports, public housing, organized labor, banking regulation, the Civilian Conservation Corps,
                    Social Security, and other basic components of a "new deal" much different from
                    the one she had favored in 1932. Generally, she was indistinguishable from the mass of Roosevelt
                    Democrats, but a few of her votes signaled some special aspects of her future. In her first term,
                    for instance, she voted against the majority for an investigation into the alleged immoralities of
                    the motion picture industry and against subsidies for tobacco growers. Later, she joined with
                    majorities in supporting bills to outlaw lynchings and to investigate sit-down strikes.14
            
            By 1935 Jenckes had developed two themes that were to define the rest of her congressional career.
                    The first was her self-identification as a champion of women's interests and as someone who
                    could bring special feminine insights to national legislation. During her campaign for renomination
                    in 1934, she had won the endorsement of the National Woman's party and, after her primary
                    victory, she responded by observing that since women had helped her win she would especially work
                    for them. In Congress she advocated complete political equality for women, including the opportunity
                    to be president, and frequently reminded her colleagues that women were half of the American
                    electorate. On a more personal level, during the summer of 1935 she protested strongly the removal
                    from the House gallery of a spectator who was nursing her baby in public, joining with Senator
                    Hattie Carroway of 
                        Arkansas
                     to point out that Congress had no rule against the public nursing of babies.15
            
            By later standards, though, Jenckes was not a radical feminist. She seems to have had no interest,
                    for instance, in the Woman's Division of the Democratic National Committee, which under the
                    lead of Molly Dewson lobbied for women's interests within the party. Generally, she
                    stressed traditional gender distinctions, notably that women had long played a special role in
                    civilization as

                             accompanying this International News photograph, dated December 8, 1934,
                            indicated that Jenckes "wore this gold and silver gown representing bi-metallism at
                            a costume party" given by Eleanor Roosevelt for the "forgotten
                            wives" of officials attending the males-only annual Gridiron Dinner. This party was
                            "strictly feminine and was the first costume party in the history of the White
                            House." Of further interest, although not pointed out by the press, is the fact
                            that Jenckes is holding the rooster symbol of the Democratic party that she gave to
                            President Franklin D. Roosevelt soon after she arrived in 
                                Washington

                     spiritual influences and as "caretakers of the
                    home." In 1937, on the occasion of Susan B. Anthony's birthday, she argued that
                    women's natural disposition for domestic roles gave them distinctive insights beneficial to
                    public policy, including "an inborn instinct to judge value" (they were
                    "natural shoppers") in every kind of public activity from housing to national
                    defense. In 1938, at the National Woman's party convention, she said that women were less
                    partisan than men and, having the vote, would no longer simply "hope for good government,
                    they will vote for good government."16
            
            Jenckes used this view of women to support policies suited not only to them but to consumer and
                    business interests. During her third term, for instance, she urged that the canning industry be
                    exempted from legislation limiting working hours on the grounds that it was every woman's
                    interest to have the cheapest canned goods, and she opposed efforts to protect small retail stores
                    from the competition of large retail chains on similar grounds. She made an especially notable
                    effort to reduce taxes on cosmetics, arguing that cosmetics were not luxuries but necessities for
                    many working women. She also warned her colleagues in Congress that women had started to cast more
                    than 50 percent of the votes and that they voted "with a distinct idea of protecting their
                    own pocketbooks." Although she emphasized the theme of discrimination against women, she
                    also mentioned that she, the daughter of a druggist, had been persuaded by members of the drug
                    industry to support their campaign against cosmetic taxes.17
            
            By the mid-1930s Jenckes's advocacy of women's interests was overshadowed by her
                    involvements in the realm of fanatical patriotism. Like many others who had come of political age in
                    the World War I era, she had an intense devotion to symbols of national loyalty and an equally
                    intense suspicion of foreign radicalism. In 1935, for instance, she won national attention by
                    complaining that no American flag had been flown in front of 
                        Washington
                    's Union Railroad Station for the previous ninety days, a "deplorable
                    disregard of our national emblem." A few months later she suggested that American
                    international shortwave broadcasts be required to sign off with the "Star-Spangled
                    Banner," noting that other nations played their anthems and urging that Americans be given
                    the same "big thrill" of hearing their anthem on the international airwaves.18
            
            This disposition helped make Jenckes one of the most vocal opponents of Russian communism in the
                    mid-1930s. Anticommunism

                     was certainly not new to these times. Even in the early 1930s,
                    when concern over the Great Depression had weakened the anti-red movement of earlier days, both the
                    Radical Right and conservative business interests often attacked the New Deal as leaning toward
                    Moscow, but these attacks came from outside the Democratic party. What was distinctive about Jenckes
                    was that she was a Democrat who combined her anticommunism with support for the New Deal. This
                    attitude can be traced back to her early days in Congress when in the spring of 1933 she intervened
                    on the side of "right wing" members of the Veterans Bonus Army from Indiana, whom
                    a 
                        Terre Haute
                     newspaper described as being "bitter foes" of what they considered
                    communist elements within the Bonus Army. Her work for those whom she considered the patriotic part
                    of the Bonus Army won her support from veterans groups back home.19
            
            Jenckes's hostility, however, grew more directly out of her work as a member of the House 
                        District of 
                                Columbia
                            
                  
                     Committee, work which led her to suspect that subversive elements were gaining control
                    of the 
                        Washington
                    , D.C., Board of Education. During her second term she launched a furious attack on the
                    board, declaring in February, 1936, that as an "American Mother," she was
                    appealing "to every mother in the 
                        District of 
                                Columbia
                            
                  
                     and throughout the Nation to open your eyes, become informed concerning the
                    indoctrination of communism in the public schools of our Nation's Capital as well as the
                    schools throughout America." In support of her warning she soon was condemning the board
                    for supporting the repeal of a prohibition against the teaching of communism in the schools and for
                    refusing to permit police observation of a character education class that she claimed was being
                    taught "under the direction of a professor who was associated with the University of
                        Moscow."20
            
            Although Jenckes took care to say, "I am not a ‘red baiter,’"
                    she believed that she had found a plot to subvert the American Way, one that involved the schools in
                    "the use and distribution to children of books and references containing vile and filthy
                    literature, and also literature which directly and indirectly taught and advocated
                    communism." When pressed to substantiate her complaints, she charged that the board had
                    allowed the circulation in the schools of the Scholastic National High School
                    Weekly, one issue of which included a review of a book containing "filthy, lascivious,
                    and irreligious utterances"; the book proved to be Boy and Girl

                     publisher.21
            
            Jenckes's crusade against the Red Menace soon spread beyond the schools. As a member of the
                    District Committee, she had also spotted what she believed was a radical plot to prevent the
                    patriotic display of the American flag on public buildings in the nation's capital, and in
                    early 1935 she urged Congress to pass legislation requiring that the flag be so displayed. Declaring
                    that she was speaking on an issue "of most vital importance to every citizen of our
                    Nation," she warned her colleagues that "the Star-Spangled Banner [is] removed by
                    reason of vile propaganda," this by way of the design of recently constructed federal
                    buildings that she said made it nearly impossible to display the flag. Eventually, as proof of her
                    charge, she was to tell the Twelfth Women's Conference on National Defense in early 1937
                    that "there is a marked similarity of our new buildings on 
                        Pennsylvania
                     Avenue and the buildings in Red Square, Moscow." Many years later she told an
                    interviewer that the Russians offered "me two hundred thousand dollars and a free trip for
                    myself and daughter to Russia if I stopped my fight against communism."22
            
            Jenckes thought that communism was spreading its poisons even in her own home town. In 1935 
                        Terre Haute
                     was paralyzed by a general strike, one of only a few total labor stoppages in American
                    history. Many years later she said that she offered to return to her city to help mediate the
                    dispute but that local bankers and employers "wouldn't let me." While the
                    strike was soon crushed, it attracted the attention of the Communist party, which in 1936 sent its
                    presidential candidate, Earl Browder, to 
                        Terre Haute
                    , where he was promptly arrested for vagrancy and thrown into jail. The mayor had
                    already warned that he would not permit a communist to speak in his city and "would go to
                    any length to protect the lives and property" of citizens from the Red threat.23
            
            A year later Jenckes charged in a speech to the Daughters of the American Revolution—of
                    which she was a member—that Browder had been sent by his party, "backed up with
                    plenty of money," to defeat her for reelection. If that were the case, Red money at least
                    did not speak loudly: not only did Jenckes easily win a third term in 1936 with a
                    fifteen-thousand-vote majority over her opponent

                     but presidential candidate Browder polled a meager sixty-two
                    votes in her entire congressional district.24
            
            Jenckes's patriotic crusade did not stop with communism. By 1937 she was convinced that 
                        Washington
                     was, as she told Congress, "the hot bed of international
                    propagandists." In November she repeated the charge before a national meeting of the
                    Daughters of the American Revolution. In this case she gave special attention to the Japanese, who
                    she warned had used their gift of cherry trees to open the way for their spies and propagandists:
                    "If we Americans were alert in the maintenance of a true national defense, we would,
                    through proper legal action, root up every Japanese cherry tree on Federal property, saw them up for
                    firewood, and replant them with American cherry trees…."25
            
            Aside from the American Legion, people gave little attention to Jenckes's crusade until 1938
                    when the Sixth District chapter of the Indiana Federation of Clubs condemned her "proposal
                    to slaughter the cherry trees" as ridiculous and as antagonistic to the newly fashionable
                    interest in conservation. Jenckes bore this attack of local club women in silence, but when her
                    cherry tree proposal was mildly ridiculed on national radio by a commentator, Boake Carter, she did
                    not hesitate to blast away. In a congressional speech she attacked Carter personally (as "a
                    Russian immigrant pretending to be of British birth") and then lashed out at the Federal
                    Communications Commission for allowing him to use "the facilities of 59 broadcasting
                    stations, which reach millions of people, in order that he might untruthfully distort and change the
                    meaning of utterances of a regularly elected Member of our Nation's Congress."26
            
            Not surprisingly, Jenckes was an ardent supporter of J. Edgar Hoover and his Federal Bureau of
                    Investigation. She urged Congress "to keep faith with American mothers, American parents,
                    and American womanhood" by granting all the money that the FBI needed for its work, which
                    she said included protecting "millions of young girls and women from the horrors of white
                    slavery." In 1936, as part of what was described as a "whirl-wind effort"
                    to suppress the criminal counterfeiting of medicinal drugs, this daughter of a druggist demanded
                    what she called a "saber-toothed" law with which the FBI could "crush
                    gangsters and racketeers" engaged in that dangerous business.27
            
            At the same time Jenckes also supported a strong military in all its branches as necessary for
                    American security, declaring that

                            Jenckes to Harold Butcher, February 15, 1936, Box 2, Jenckes Papers.
               
                     in taking this position she was representing American women in
                    general. She argued that a strong defense was the best way to keep the 
                        United States
                     out of war, which she believed had a particularly harsh effect on wives and mothers.
                    This led her to strong support of the defense policies of the Roosevelt administration. As early as
                    January, 1936, she refused to give a speech at the Eleventh Woman's Patriotic Conference on
                    National Defense because that organization had not rebuked a previous speaker for criticizing
                    Roosevelt's defense program, a rebuke she thought necessary if women were "to
                    assume the responsibility for the maintenance of American patriotic ideals." Two years
                    later, in Congress, she opposed a proposal to require a popular referendum on any war measure on the
                    grounds that while it was a noble idea it threatened to embarrass Roosevelt: "Let us stand
                    by the President, and follow his divinely inspired leadership."28
            
            It is doubtful, however, that Jenckes would have eventually followed Roosevelt's
                    "divinely inspired leadership" into support for Great Britain, Lend-Lease, and
                    eventually war. Although she was active in condemning both communist Russia and militarist 
                        Japan
                    , she took an isolationist view of Europe and said nothing about Nazi 
                        Germany
                    , an attitude that showed little sympathy for America's old allies in World War
                    I. In 1937 she made her first trip to Europe to represent the 
                        United States
                     (along with three male 
                        United States
                     senators) at the annual conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in 
                        Paris
                    . As the first woman ever appointed to attend the conference, she declared it her
                    special mission to "arouse the women in every Nation to become militant against
                        war."29 Despite this glint of internationalism, though, it was
                    evident that Jenckes spoke primarily for American women, particularly for those who were basically
                    isolationist-minded believers in America First.
            Promising that the Americans would "always prevent" their nation from entering
                    another conflict, Jenckes gave special attention to urging her foreign sisters to pressure their
                    governments into paying what she estimated to be an eleven-billion-dollar debt that they owed the 
                        United States
                     from World War I, governments that, she said, "were buying armaments while
                    failing to pay." She did not appear to consider that what she condemned as a dangerous and
                    selfish rearmament was being carried out by America's old allies to confront the new threat
                    of Nazi 
                        Germany
                    . After the conference Jenckes spent some time in Europe trying to persuade her sisters
                    to back her debt demands. Upon her return to the 
                        United States
                    , she declared, in 1938, that "the loss of these eleven billions of American

                    the money that should have been used to pay it off was being spent to prepare for another
                    destructive war.30
            
            Jenckes's crusades against alien enemies did not entirely distract her from trying to
                    satisfy the more mundane expectations of her constituents. After two terms in office she could claim
                    that she had fought not only for the interests of farmers like herself but also, increasingly, for
                    the welfare of local workers. She pointed with pride to her efforts to provide work in her district
                    through such federally funded construction projects as 
                        Terre Haute
                    's new city hall and through support for small, job-producing private
                    industries such as the National Tile Company, for which she had obtained a federal loan.31
            
            Such claims highlighted Jenckes's basically conservative views of labor and welfare matters.
                    In 1936 she told a British journalist: "I am opposed to the dole, and I am opposed to the
                    permanent relief which will pauperize our workers. I believe that the federal government should stay
                    out of industry and not compete with industry, but the federal government should make it possible to
                    encourage industries." To that end she proposed that the canning industry be exempted from
                    wages and hours regulations in order to maintain jobs for canning workers, and she had also tried to
                    eliminate an appropriation to buy labor-saving machines for the Social Security Board, declaring
                    that "this detestable provision" would throw hundreds of needy government clerks
                    out of work.32
            
            In 1938 Jenckes submitted to Congress a petition from local craft workers urging that the Works
                    Progress Administration (WPA), the federal make-work agency, be barred from construction projects in
                    order to prevent its cheap labor from competing with the building trades. The WPA, she told her
                    colleagues, represented one line of federal relief efforts, a line "directed by social
                    workers who are trained in giving away other people's money" whereas she stood for
                    the other line that tried to get workers off the relief roles and back into productive employments:
                    "The time has now come when all relief agencies should begin to think of returning all of
                    our unemployed to permanent jobs rather than be a continued burden on the taxpayers by permanently
                    keeping our unemployed on a relief basis."33

            In such ways Jenckes generally reflected her district's underlying conservativism, a
                    conservativism that dreamed of individualism and scorned dependence on government. She was not
                    conservative enough, however, to forestall her defeat in 1938 for a fourth term in Congress. Two
                    years before she had run an exceptionally strong campaign to win a third term. Besides identifying
                    with Roosevelt's New Deal, she had campaigned as a defender of
                    "Americanism," pointing to her efforts to have the flag placed on public buildings
                    and "to stamp communism from American life." Among the groups to which she
                    appealed for support was the Indiana Brewers Association, which she reminded of her work for the
                    repeal of Prohibition and urged "to call upon every worker and every voter" to
                    support her campaign.34
            
            Such efforts proved to be unnecessary since Jenckes was one of numerous Democrats who benefited from
                    Roosevelt's landslide victory over Alfred E. Landon in the presidential election, a victory
                    that helped elect Democrats to eleven of Indiana's twelve seats in Congress. Although she
                    ran a few hundred votes behind the president, she swamped her Republican opponent, Noble J. Johnson
                    (who also resided in 
                        Terre Haute
                    ) by a nearly two-to-one majority. Immediately after the election, she telegraphed the
                    president: "I have been re-elected by a very large majority, despite the opposition of a
                    group of selfish interests who while praising my service to the district, decreed that 
                        Virginia
                     was to be defeated in order that their representative might go to the Congress to
                    harass Roosevelt."35
            
            The victory in 1936, however, had a bitter taste. A few weeks before the election, her daughter and
                    only child, 
                        Virginia
                    , died in her early twenties from tuberculosis. Especially since 
                        Virginia
                     had been her close companion in her earlier campaigns, this loss took much of the heart
                    out of Jenckes's interest in politics. Moreover, she had made enemies within her own party,
                    reportedly calling some state leaders "a bunch of yellow bellies" at a party
                    meeting held in French Lick soon after the election; she was later to complain that Governor Paul V.
                    McNutt tried to "read me out of the party." And there were signs of discontent
                    among some of the chairmen of county Democratic organizations in her district; eventually she
                    decided

                     that she lost in 1938 because politicians in 
                        Terre Haute
                     "took the ballots out of the box."36
            
            Beyond these factors Jenckes also encountered opposition from the WPA in her district, in part
                    because of her criticisms of it but also because in the rural counties direction of the WPA work
                    force had fallen under the influence of Republican foremen. This fact probably helped inspire her to
                    complain after the election that the Roosevelt administration had unwisely allowed the appointment
                    of Republicans to important patronage positions, thereby giving these "political
                    termites" the opportunity to work against Democratic candidates. When it came to such
                    matters, she was a strongly partisan Democrat who had convinced herself, as she once told a group of
                    women, that "we women owe our right of sufferage [sic] to the Democratic
                        party."37
            
            Jenckes's defeat for reelection, however, owed far less to the manipulations of politicians
                    or anyone else than to general trends. Most basic was the fact that west central Indiana outside of 
                        Terre Haute
                     was normally heavily Republican. Months before the election the 
                        Terre Haute
                    
                    Spectator had observed that in 1936, even with the Roosevelt landslide,
                    Jenckes's opponent had carried five counties in the district and had estimated that the
                    district was normally Republican overall by at least fifteen thousand votes. Whatever the accuracy
                    of this arithmetic, the Sixth Congressional District, like many other congressional districts in the
                    state and nation, was ripe for a reaction against the New Deal. In support of Jenckes's
                    opponent, Noble J. Johnson, the Republicans mounted a strong campaign against the Roosevelt
                    administration, urging voters (in a rare reference to gender) to "send a MAN to Congress,
                    who will be YOUR representative and not the willing tool of the most powerful political machine
                    America has ever known."38
            
            It was evident that Jenckes faced a close race. The Roosevelt administration, anxious to maintain its
                    strength in Congress, sent some of its most influential spokesmen, including Speaker of the House
                    William B. Bankhead, to Indiana to support her. The net effect of such efforts, however, appears to
                    have been to reenforce Republican charges that she was simply a rubber stamp for the New Deal. When
                    the November ballots were counted, she carried 
                        Vigo County
                     by nearly six thousand votes but lost all the agricultural

                     counties and the election. Statewide, as historian James H.
                    Madison has pointed out, the election was a "disaster" for the Democratic party
                    and administration, with more than half of the Democrats elected to Congress in 1936 being rejected.
                    Nationally, Jenckes was one of seventy House Democrats defeated for reelection, a loss that brought
                    New Deal legislation to a virtual halt.39
            
            Jenckes said that she did not contest the election because "if I raise a rumpus they will
                    say women can't take defeat. I'm not going to hurt other women by weeping
                    now." Perhaps her refusal had some effect, since, when her victorious opponent retired from
                    Congress in 1948, her old congressional district elected to replace him with Mrs. Cecil M. Harden, a
                    conservative Republican who won several consecutive terms. Whatever, Jenckes had plainly lost the
                    election and, despite rumors that she was planning a comeback, was satisfied not to return to
                    Congress. During her three terms she had become attached to 
                        Washington
                    , D.C., and had moved her home there from 
                        Terre Haute
                     after the death of her daughter. Like many other defeated members of Congress, she
                    tried to get a government appointment, hinting in a letter to President Roosevelt in the summer of
                    1939 that, as "your loyal supporter," she hoped to be given a "useful
                    place" in government. Although nothing came of this, she stayed in 
                        Washington
                    , living for many years on Kalorama Road in the city.40
            
            Besides her income from substantial properties in the 
                        Terre Haute
                     area, Jenckes may have benefited from work as a lobbyist for various groups including
                    the Red Cross and the Catholic church (a cousin was a member of the Sisters of 
                        Providence
                     headquartered at 
                        St. Mary-of-the-Woods
                     College within her former district). As a Red Cross volunteer, she worked in the first
                    blood bank in America. In 1956 she became involved with the cause of Hungarian freedom when she
                    helped five priests, who had escaped from 
                        Hungary
                    , to gain admittance to the 
                        United States
                    ; for a time she served as a conduit between Hungarian Freedom Fighters and the American
                    government. Finally, after she had reached ninety years of age, she returned to Indiana, first (in
                    1969) to 
                        Indianapolis
                     and then (in 1971) to 
                        Terre Haute
                    . In 1975 she died in a 
                        Terre Haute
                     nursing home at the age of ninety-seven.41

                    Americans should do by declaring that they should "get back to the Ten
                    Commandments" and that especially they should honor their country, which she proclaimed the
                    greatest in the world.42 It was an appropriate response from someone who, in her
                    extreme and often irrational anticommunism, can be said to have been a Cold War warrior even before,
                    officially, there was a Cold War.

            Indiana in the Civil War Era

            The momentous events and developments of the mid-nineteenth century mark both a period of transition
                    for Indiana and a time when the state's residents established a political, economic, and
                    cultural identity that lasted well into the twentieth century. It should be no wonder, then, that
                    the Civil War era has been intensely studied by Indiana historians of all backgrounds and commands
                    great interest among readers of the Indiana Magazine of History. This second
                    installment of the journal's Indiana Archives series seeks to encourage further research
                    into what, therefore, seems at first glance to be an already well-worked field. Contributors survey
                    the rich primary materials currently held by archives, libraries, and historical societies across
                    the state and elsewhere. They also note the particular research challenges that face students of the
                    era: the withholding or actual destruction of letters, diaries, and other personal papers; the
                    documentary impact of the era's bitter political struggles; the scarcity of significant
                    manuscript collections revealing the experiences of women and African Americans; and the dominance
                    of the Civil War itself on the scholarship of the period.
            The attention devoted to the Civil War is in part the product of Indiana's disproportionate
                    involvement in the conflict. Second among northern states in terms of relative manpower
                    contribution, Indiana contributed approximately two-thirds of its military-aged men to the Union
                    army. Regiments from the state fought in both the eastern and western campaigns and in many of the
                    war's major battles. Over twenty-five thousand men died, most from disease; many thousands
                    more suffered traumatic losses. The hardships of the war took their toll on the home front as well.
                    The household and labor responsibilities of women expanded; questions regarding the

                     legal and political status of black Indianians attained added
                    importance; and fierce debates over the powers of the state and federal governments helped create
                    one of the most vigorously partisan and evenly divided political systems in the nation.
            The drama of the Civil War also took place in the midst of several long-term trends that were
                    gradually moving Indiana beyond its pioneer stage of development toward the challenges posed by a
                    modernizing nation. Between 1850 and 1880 the number of cities and factories in the state increased,
                    farm mechanization accelerated, labor unions started to form, and a broadening railroad network
                    connected Indiana to regional and national markets. Black migrants from the South and immigrants
                    from Europe established their own presence in some towns and cities, resisting racist and nativist
                    hostility with varying degrees of success. These changes, along with those generated by a growing
                    population, prompted some expansion of governmental services and support in areas such as education,
                    though public school improvements came slowly and unevenly. All these transitions occurred within a
                    state whose citizens continued to prize the character and values of a rural and small-town society.
            The following essays offer a number of archival avenues to study this complex, sometimes
                    contradictory, yet certainly critical era in Indiana history. Examining primary sources that are
                    available for research in several regions of the state, they are intended to be suggestive rather
                    than exhaustive. Moreover, valuable Civil War—era documents can be found in libraries and
                    archives in other regions of the state, including the 
                        Allen County
                     Public Library and the Louis A. Warren Lincoln Library and Museum, also in Fort 
                        Wayne
                    . As Stephen E. Towne clearly establishes, however, the starting point for any serious
                    study of the political and military dimensions of the Civil War is the Indiana State Library and
                    Historical Building. Nancy K. Turner reveals the personal importance the Civil War assumed for
                    families, religious groups, and communities in east-central Indiana. Thomas E. Rodgers describes the
                    creativity needed to research west-central Indiana's participation in the Civil War. And
                    Saundra B. Taylor identifies the military, political, and economic connections between Indiana,
                    particularly its southern residents, and national developments. Together these contributors show
                    that if much of the state's mid-nineteenth-century history has been well chronicled, there
                    still exist numerous areas for further exploration.
            
                    Civil War-Era Sources in the Indiana State Library and Historical Building
                
            Civil War—era research constitutes approximately 20 percent of the total patronage of the
                    Indiana State Archives. Indeed, the  study of the Civil War
                    attracts enormous numbers of curious minds. Although one might conclude from the large outpouring of
                    publications dealing with the period that all avenues of research have been exhausted, ongoing
                    historical debates and the availability of extensive primary sources mean that much new and
                    significant work remains to be done. Many heretofore untapped sources await serious perusal by
                    scholars; many new questions about the nature of the conflict and its myriad ramifications remain to
                    be addressed.
            The three major records repositories currently housed in the Indiana State Library and Historical
                    Building in 
                        Indianapolis
                     together constitute an "enterprise zone" for historical researchers
                    studying the Civil War era. The Indiana State Library, the Indiana Historical Society's
                    William Henry Smith Library, and the Indiana State Archives are essential stops for any serious
                    study of Indiana's role in the great national struggle.
            Private manuscript collections of participants in the Civil War are especial strengths of the Indiana
                    State Library (ISL) and the Indiana Historical Society (IHS). Both repositories hold numerous
                    collections of letters and diaries of soldiers who fought in the war, most in Indiana volunteer
                    regiments that participated in nearly all of the important campaigns.1 The
                    collections offer noteworthy eyewitness accounts of battles and other events. Some are quite well
                    known and have been published in books and historical journals.2 Given the
                    current increased interest in the publication of Civil War letters and diaries since the recent
                    airing of the Ken Burns Civil War television series, these collections have great potential. Both
                    repositories also have the papers of men and women who remained at home during the period. Two
                    examples are the Allen 
                        Hamilton
                     papers (L 62) in the ISL and the Calvin Fletcher papers and diary (M 108) in the IHS.
                    Both men were bankers, active in Indiana politics, and well connected with important state and
                    national political figures. Fletcher's diary is singularly useful, covering over fort 
                  
                     1 Researchers should consult Eric Pumroy, with Paul Brockman, A Guide to Manuscript Collections of the Indiana Historical Society and Indiana
                                State Library (
                                Indianapolis
                            , 1986). Though a second edition update would be helpful, the core collections
                            of both repositories are listed. The guide is well equipped with a detailed index and full
                            annotations for each of the many collections listed. Collection identification numbers found
                            in the guide will be used in this essay. Another useful resource is Ann Turner, Guide to Indiana Civil War Manuscripts (
                                Indianapolis
                            , 1965), which lists manuscript collections by unit. This guide is greatly out
                            of date, and a new edition would prove of great worth to researchers.

                     years of Indiana's early statehood. His daily
                    observations during the war provide key insights into important events and developments from war
                    excitement in Indiana to disloyalty and fears of insurrection.3 Several
                    collections, including the John Lewis Ketcham papers (M 173) and the Rufus Dooley papers (M 383) at
                    the IHS, document women's war-related duties and participation in the conflict.
                    Regrettably, no significant central Indiana African-American manuscript collections from the Civil
                    War era are currently available.
            Broader trends in mid-nineteenth-century politics are well represented in the private manuscript
                    collections of Conrad Baker, Godlove S. Orth, Schuyler Colfax, Henry S. Lane, Robert Dale Owen,
                    Albert G. Porter, and other Hoosier political leaders and their numerous correspondents. Recent
                    interpretations regarding nativism, the collapse of the Whig party, the emergence of the Republican
                    party, and other trends occurring at national, state, and local levels in the 1850s have yet to be
                    applied to Indiana during the period. The origin of the antebellum Democratic conserva-tivism that
                    fed antiwar sentiments in Indiana merits attention, as does the debate on southern Reconstruction
                    following the Civil War.
            An interesting, perhaps telling, note is the preponderance of collections of Indiana's
                    Republican politicians over those of their Democratic counterparts. Historians, for example, do not
                    have access to the papers of such important Indiana Democrats as Thomas A. Hendricks, Daniel W.
                    Voorhees, and Jesse D. Bright. This imbalance may be explained by the fact that the Democratic party
                    in Indiana did not fare well during the Civil War. Accusations of disloyalty and party divisions
                    between peace and war factions led to Republican success both during and after the war. Democrats
                    who advocated compromise and peace during the war may have been embarrassed later by their earlier
                    positions. The intentional destruction of private papers by historical figures or their families in
                    order to sanitize their reputations for posterity has been all too frequent.4
            
            On the other hand, the newspaper section of the ISL constitutes a gold mine of information on all
                    aspects of Indiana history in the mid-nineteenth century. Hundreds of newspapers of extraordinary
                    variety (political, religious, foreign language) were published in nearly every 
                        Indiana county
                    . Some had large circulations, many

                            papers toward the end of his life. See Michael Devine, John W. Foster: Politics

                     a tiny readership; some survived only briefly. Important and
                    useful data of all sorts can be gleaned from their pages, from county and township political
                    platforms, court news, local agricultural commodity prices, and marriage and death data to social
                    events, commercial news and advertising, railroad schedules, and community gossip. During the Civil
                    War hometown newspapers published countless letters written by soldiers away at the front, letters
                    that often provided startlingly frank accounts. Most of the known surviving Indiana newspapers from
                    the period have been collected at the ISL either in the original or on microfilm.5
            
            The ISL and IHS both house large collections of pamphlets dating from the Civil War period, some of
                    which may be lone surviving copies. The collections also include Indiana state government
                    publications and reports. An indispensable source for information on the activities of the Indiana
                    General Assembly is the Brevier Legislative Reports? Published in twenty-four
                    volumes covering legislative sessions from 1858 to 1887, the semi-official Brevier
                        Reports constitute the only effort made to record the floor debates in the General
                    Assembly.
            Records of the Indiana state government's participation in the Civil War housed in the
                    Indiana State Archives (ISA) are abundant. The organization of these records remained haphazard for
                    many years; however, the ISA staff has worked in recent years to reorganize them and has produced
                    finding aids to facilitate research and microfilmed a number of the more important record groups.
            Oliver P. Morton ranks as one of the most important Union leaders during the rebellion. A governor of
                    indefatigable energy and irrepressible talent, if not low cunning, Morton ran the state, controlling
                    all aspects of its war effort. His voice in the halls of power in 
                        Washington
                    , D.C., with President Abraham Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton among
                    others, was no less authoritative. This power and influence is borne out in the records located in
                    the ISA.7
            
            
               
                  5 The standard source for identifying and finding Indiana newspaper titles
                        is John W. Miller, Indiana Newspaper Bibliography … (
                            Indianapolis
                        , 1982). Miller lists all known newspaper publications by county, provides a brief
                        history of each, and indicates where copies may be read. While significant effort went into the
                        project and the volume remains indispensable, errors abound in the guide. The researcher should
                        exercise some caution when trying to locate extant copies of newspapers.

            Extensive documentation of Morton's administration survives. Included are many thousands of
                    letters written to the governor and his staff during the war years in Indiana. Extensive files from
                    the adjutants general of Indiana under Morton also exist. Perhaps central to this group are the
                    seventeen volumes of telegraphic correspondence between Morton, his staff, and important military
                    and political figures throughout the country. These communications, together with wartime
                    telegraphic dispatches to and from the adjutants general of Indiana, constitute nearly thirteen
                    thousand messages. A newly created computer index to the telegrams can currently be found on the
                    ISA's internet world wide web home page: (http://www.ai.org/acin/icpr/index.html).
            Persons undertaking regimental or unit histories or doing genealogical or biographical research
                    should consult the regimental files on each Indiana volunteer unit. These records include the
                    regimental and battery muster rolls, which list each soldier who served in a unit.
            An important tool in this research is the ISA's microfilmed alphabetical list of all troops
                    on the rolls. The files list all the data found on the muster rolls, including when and where the
                    soldier joined the unit and was mustered out or discharged. An entry also notes if the soldier was
                    killed in battle or died of wounds or illness. Depending on the thoroughness of the regimental
                    clerks in filling out the muster roll forms, physical description, place of birth, and occupation
                    are given. Such information is quite useful in learning about enlisted men for whom there are no
                    informative letters of application or recommendation as is the case for the commissioned officers.
                    Thus it can be determined that a private soldier named Ambrose G. Bierce of the Ninth Indiana
                    Volunteer Infantry Regiment had light hair and blue eyes and was employed as a printer before the
                    war. Regimental records also include extensive files of letters of application and recommendation
                    for the field and staff officers for each unit. Addressed primarily to Governor Morton, who
                    exercised the power to appoint regimental officers, these letters often provide telling details
                    about the activities of the regiment in the absence of battle reports and other after-action
                    documentation. The ISA also has regimental records of the 28th 
                        United States
                     Colored Troops, the majority of whom were recruited in Indiana.8
            
            Frequently overlooked is the important service of the Indiana Legion, the state militia, during the
                    Civil War. The Legion played

                     an important role in defending the state from rebel raids and
                    guerrilla incursions, especially along the Ohio River. On a few occasions the
                    Legion crossed the state line to fight in 
                        Kentucky
                     or to chase fleeing guerrillas. Legion units also acted as provost marshal detachments,
                    patrolling their localities in search of draft dodgers and deserters. The surviving records of the
                    Indiana Legion offer many clues concerning matters on the home front. Included are reports of
                    activities of clandestine groups such as the Knights of the Golden Circle and the Sons of
                        Liberty.9
            
            While the Civil War—era documentation found in the Indiana State Library and Historical
                    Building is vast, many more records pertaining to Indiana subjects reside elsewhere. The National
                    Archives at 
                        Washington

                  Chicago, Illinois
               , where nineteenth-century federal district court records are held,
                    contain many records pertaining to the Indiana Civil War experience. These include post-battle
                    reports written by Indiana commanders, regimental order books, muster rolls, and pension files. The
                    records of the Provost Marshal Bureau, various regional military commands, and Cabinet departments
                    also offer significant information on affairs in the state during the war.10
            
            
                    Civil War-Era Primary Materials in East-Central Indiana
                
            East-central Indiana in the 1850-1880 era was a region in a period of change. Because of a rising
                    birth rate, an increase in settlers from other states, particularly 
                        Ohio
                    , and an influx of immigrants, especially from 
                        Ireland
                     and 
                        Germany
                    , the population grew rapidly. The area remained primarily rural and agricultural, but
                    the building of a network of railroads across the state set the stage for its entry into the
                    national economy.
            The Civil War, with all its bitterness, proved to be the benchmark of the era. Many of the young men
                    from east-central Indiana who enlisted—most of them in the Union
                    army—initially considered the war as something of a lark. As the soldiers were exposed to
                        
                  
                     9 A number of scholars have studied the extent of dissent in the North
                            during the Civil War, and a few have focused on Indiana. It appears, however, that none has
                            looked at the records of the Indiana Legion and other recently organized records in the ISA.

            One significant focal point of research in this area is the Archives & Special Collections in
                    the A. M. Bracken Library at Ball State University, 
                        Muncie
                    . The nucleus of the archives' current holdings for the mid-nineteenth century
                    are government records rescued by a Ball State professor of history, Dr. Althea Stoeckel, when the
                    old county courthouse was torn down in 1966. These include veterans' enrollment records;
                    regimental records, including mustering-in certificates; militia records; and papers dealing with
                    relief for soldiers' families. Also available are marriage and deed records from the
                    beginning of the county; tax duplicate records; and will packets, probate records, and a variety of
                    civil court records. Other government records of interest for those researching the time period
                    include inventory and sales lists, as well as naturalization records.
            Family papers, diaries, and church records from the Civil War era are also located in the Stoeckel
                    Archives. The Fred and Penny Prow Family Collection (Mss 158) contains the papers of seven
                    generations of one 
                        Delaware County
                     family and includes family correspondence from the 1820s through the Civil War period,
                    with interesting references to life on the home front. The Cassidy-Nelson Family Papers (Mss 23)
                    include correspondence, account books, photographs, and the Civil War letters of D. W. (Derastus)
                    Nelson. Featured in the papers of the Stradling, Ryan, and Tuhey families (Mss 127 and OVB9) are the
                    Civil War letters of John Stradling. The Buckles Family Papers (OVA 32), which were found in the
                    wall of a 
                        Muncie
                     home, reveal the family's 
                        Delaware County
                     roots.
            F. E. Putnam, a local merchant who also served in various county offices, made daily entries in a
                    diary (Mss 2) that he began in 1842 and continued until just before his death sixty years later. The
                    diary is an invaluable source as there were no newspapers for the time period. Thomas Neely moved to 
                        Muncie
                     in 1839 and opened a blacksmith shop. He served six years as member of the board of
                    commissioners and later opened 
                        Muncie
                    's first photography studio. Neely was another important local diarist (Mss
                    105) who commented on many aspects of community life. He began his entries in 1860 and continued
                    them until his death in 1901.
            One of the earliest churches in the area was the Unitarian Universalist Church. Known in the
                    nineteenth century as the Uni-versalist Church, its collection (Mss 101) includes board minutes
                    starting in 1859 and the diary of 
                        Marion
                     Crosley, local minister of  the church, who kept a
                    diary (part of Mss 101) between 1855 and 1865. Part of the Church of the Brethren (Mississinewa,
                    Union Grove, Shideler) Records, 1850-1965 (Mss 30) shows the membership, baptisms, and transfers
                    from 1850 to 1897. The photocopied records of the First Baptist Church (Mss 81) include minutes of
                    meetings and membership rolls, with a concentration of records from the 1859-1874 period.
            Earlham College, founded in 1847 and located at 
                        Richmond
                    , Indiana, is known for its extensive coverage of the Society of Friends. Probably the
                    two largest collections of interest are the records of Indiana and Western Yearly Meetings of
                    Friends. These contain the transactions of the monthly meetings, the basic business unit of the
                    Society of Friends. The carefully kept records of births, deaths, and marriages, along with the
                    minutes of business meetings, are the most complete materials for any denomination in Indiana.
                    Although the monthly meetings were mainly concerned with disciplinary matters, there are often
                    records of dealings with Friends who had enlisted in the Union army or who attempted to aid
                    freedpeople in the South. Several monthly meetings made up the quarterly meetings, which were
                    supposed to maintain a Committee on the Concerns of the People of Color. These records are often an
                    invaluable resource for black history in Indiana. The same can be said for the records of Indiana
                    Yearly Meeting's Freedman's Aid Committee.
            A variety of personal papers from the Civil War era are in the Earlham collections. The diaries of
                    Oliver Albertson, a 
                        Quaker
                     nurseryman of 
                        Washington County
                    , Indiana, cover the years from 1846 to 1874 and are a rich source for information on
                    Quaker family life in southern Indiana in that period. Elijah Coffin, the father of Charles F.
                    Coffin, was a 
                        Richmond
                     banker and clerk of Indiana Yearly Meeting of Orthodox Friends from 1827 to 1857. The
                    centerpiece of his collection is his diary for the period 1848-1862, with considerable information
                    on religious and political affairs. The 1866 diary of Lizzie Edwards, a Friend who lived in 
                        Spiceland
                    , Indiana, includes the time she spent teaching in a freedmen's school near
                    Vicksburg, 
                        Mississippi
                    . The diary of Margaret Jones, a 
                        Quaker
                     who lived in 
                        Rush
                     and 
                        Howard counties
                    , is an often moving account of the life of a single woman from 1845 to 1893.

                     artist Marcus Mote, best known for his portraits and painting of Indiana
                        Yearly Meeting of Friends, 1844, completed numerous diaries containing his reflections on
                    local and national events. The collection of Francis W. Thomas, a prominent 
                        Quaker
                     minister who lived in 
                        Wayne
                     and 
                        Henry counties
                    , includes a diary for the period 1861-1865 with considerable comment on public events.
            Complementing these diaries are family papers. The Charles F. and Rhoda M. Coffin Collection provides
                    basic information concerning  the response of Indiana Quakers to
                    the Civil War and the reform and philanthropic work of Charles F. Coffin (1823-1916), a 
                        Richmond
                     banker and clerk, or presiding officer, of Indiana Yearly Meeting of Orthodox Friends
                    from 1857 to 1884, and his wife Rhoda M. (Johnson) Coffin (1826-1909). The Hill-Hudelson Papers
                    include the correspondence and business papers of Henry B. Hill (1804-1874) of 
                        Carthage
                    , Indiana, and his son William Penn Hill (1830-1894) of 
                        Knightstown
                    , Indiana. Although a 
                        Quaker
                    , Henry B. Hill served as a colonel in the Union army. Also included in the collection
                    are a number of letters written by William Penn Hill's sister-in-law, Jane M. Hudelson
                    (1832-1904) while she was teaching in a freedmen's campus in 
                        Mississippi
                     in the 1860s. The Huff Family Papers consist largely of material relating to the life
                    of Daniel Huff (1816-1899) and his wife, Emily Jane (Nixon) Huff (1821-1889), Quakers of 
                        Fountain City
                     (formerly 
                        Newport
                    ), Indiana. The collection is rich in material on politics, antislavery, and abolition.
                    The large Eli and Mahalah Jay Collection contains extensive materials on the response of Indiana
                    Quakers to the Civil War. The Carpenter-Wright Family Collection includes considerable
                    correspondence with family members for the 1850-1870 period.
            Other collections at Earlham include the papers of Levi Coffin (1798-1877), a 
                        Fountain City
                     merchant and abolitionist known as the "President of the Underground
                    Railroad"; the collection of Job Hadley (1816-1895), a Friend living in 
                        Hendricks County
                    , Indiana, who left a long reminiscence about slavery in 
                        North Carolina
                     and his work among the freedpeople in 
                        Mississippi
                     and 
                        Tennessee
                     in the 1860s; and the 
                        Dublin
                    , Indiana, Good Templars Minute Book covering the activities of this temperance
                    organization from 1863 to 1868.
            Taylor University, founded in 1846 and located at Upland, Indiana, also serves as a repository for
                    some Civil War correspondence. The Bernie Smith Collection contains letters of civilians during the
                    Civil War period, including one from James A. Garfield to Joseph Knight, Esq. In addition, the
                    university archives at Taylor also hold the muster-out roll of Captain Nathan Walkens, Company D,
                    5th 
                        Maine
                     Infantry, and materials from the 1855-1890 era under the school's former name
                    of Fort 
                        Wayne
                     College.
            The Minnetrista Cultural Center in 
                        Muncie
                    , Indiana, has only been open since 1987, but it, too, is acquiring family papers that
                    contain references to this turbulent era in Indiana's history. The W. W. Cline Papers,
                    covering the 1850-1860 period, primarily document the life of W. W. Cline of 
                        Hartford City
                    , Indiana. Cline was a teacher, justice of the peace, temperance advocate, secretary of
                    the local Young Men's Christian Association, and director of the 
                        Hartford City
                     brass band. The Civil War is covered in letters to Cline's future wife,
                    Harriet Chaffee, from her brothers during the years  1861-1863,
                    in which the siege of Vicksburg is discussed as well as what is happening to other members of the 
                        Hartford City
                    , Indiana, volunteer regiment. 
                        Muncie
                     native Thomas Jefferson Brady served as a general during the Civil War. His letters to
                    his parents span the years 1860-1865; other letters cover General Brady's term as 
                        United States
                     consul to St. Thomas, 1872-1873. The Minnetrista Center also has several other
                    collections with smaller pieces of Civil War documentation, including tintypes, letters, and
                    discharge papers.
            Local historical societies have long played a significant role in the gathering, preserving, and
                    cataloguing of historical materials. Many times families are more willing to share their memorabilia
                    with these community-oriented and volunteer-staffed organizations than to donate them to state or
                    federal agencies. For example, the 
                        Delaware County
                     Historical Alliance owns a significant collection of Civil War-era materials at the
                    Moore-Youse Museum, built around 1849 and home to three generations of the same middle-class family.
                    The museum's Civil War-era correspondence is centered around three family collections. The
                    Pittenger/Shroyer Collection includes Civil War correspondence and the diary of Absalom Shroyer, as
                    well as deeds for the purchase of land by Anthony Shroyer. The 
                        Poland
                     Collection contains the Civil War letters of John W. Poland and various funeral notices
                    of the time period, and the Davis Civil War Papers are centered around the Davis family of
                    Mooreland, Indiana, especially the correspondence of Lucinda Clapper.
            Another local historical society holding Civil War—era materials is the 
                        Henry County
                     Historical Society in 
                        New Castle
                    . Founded in 1887, the society continues to collect materials relating to the
                    area's history. Among its materials are the diaries of Cyrus 
                        Van
                     Matre, a first lieutenant in Company E, 8th Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment. The
                    diaries begin on January 1, 1864, and continue through the year until 
                        Van
                     Matre's return home in November. They contain daily accounts, monetary
                    transactions, poetry, and a list of persons who wrote him letters. Other 
                        Henry County
                     materials include an autobiographical account written November 23, 1878, by Dr. John
                    Rea, a physician born in 
                        Virginia
                     in 1819, who was a volunteer physician during the Civil War; a letter by George W.
                    Rader, Company E, 8th Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment, and three from his sister to him; and
                    numerous Civil War discharge papers and legal letters and a handbill written by a local poet on the
                    occasion of the passing of Lincoln's funeral train on April 30, 1865.
            The members of the 
                        Blackford County
                     Historical Society at 
                        Hartford City
                     also strive to preserve the history of their area. A sampling of their holdings for the
                    1850-1870 era includes the 1854-1880 diaries of Joseph 
                        Van
                     Cleve, who with his brother Asher was an early 
                        Blackford County
                     pioneer. 
                        Van
                     Cleve, owner of a general  store located on the
                    southwest corner of the courthouse square and known as "The Old Fort," was a
                    strong Union supporter. He was also a large property owner and served as a banker of sorts before
                    any other local banking institutions existed. Also available are the official war records of 916 
                        Blackford County
                     Civil War veterans obtained from the Indiana adjutant general's office; they
                    are indexed from Samuel Arnold to Jacob Yoder.
            Public libraries in the east-central Indiana area usually contain only copies of historical records,
                    but the Anderson Public Library holds some diaries and correspondence from the 1850—1870
                    period. There are typescript copies of the 1863 diary of DeWitt Markle of Adams Township; the
                    1864-1865 diary of Hugh D. Galli-her, 35th Regiment; and the undated but contemporary diary of James
                    Henry Harris of 
                        Jefferson County
                    . Original documents at the library include the diary of James Reed, the letters of
                    Elizabeth and Benjamin Gage, who served in the 68th Indiana Infantry, and Isaiah Hutchinson, a
                    member of the 120th Regiment.
            
                    Civil War-Era Primary Materials for West-Central Indiana
                
            West-central Indiana, as defined in this article, stretches from 
                        Lafayette
                     in the north to 
                        Vincennes
                     in the south and at its center from the 
                        Illinois
                     border on the west to 
                        Putnam
                     County on the east. The Civil War-era primary sources available for the region are many
                    and varied and are located in a variety of places within the area and in some archives outside of
                    it. Three good places within west-central Indiana to begin a search for materials are
                            
                  Terre Haute, Greencastle
               , and 
                        Crawfordsville
                    .
            The primary materials available at the 
                        Vigo County
                     Public Library include original manuscripts, copies of materials that are privately
                    owned or are in other archives, and some printed materials from the mid-nineteenth century. While
                    many of these items concern 
                        Vigo County
                    , there are also materials from nearby counties. Many of the letters and diaries are
                    those of Civil War soldiers, but there are also some of local businessmen. Other items of note are
                    local church records; the general Civil War folders; and the records of the Ladies' Aid
                    Society, which began during the Civil War and then continued as a women's welfare
                    organization after the war. The library holds society records only as far back as 1870.
            Civil War-era materials in 
                        Greencastle
                     are all currently housed in the DePauw University Archives. Many of the Civil War
                    letters relating to 
                        Putnam
                     and nearby counties, however, will eventually be moved to the new public library
                    building that is currently under construction. Most of the soldier letters and diaries at the
                    archives are by 
                        Putnam
                     County men, but there are also some by DePauw alumni from other parts of the state. The
                    archives also contain a large number of local church records (most but not all are  Methodist) and the records of the two Methodist conferences in Indiana
                    during the mid-nineteenth century.
            Primary sources in 
                        Crawfordsville
                     are located at 
                        Wabash
                     College's Robert T. Ramsey, Jr., Archival Center and at the 
                        Crawfordsville
                     Public Library. The archives have a few sets of Civil War letters of alumni from
                    west-central Indiana. Also of interest are the letters of Edmund O. Hovey, the founder of 
                        Wabash
                     and for many years a trustee of the college. Some of Hovey's letters are at
                    the Indiana State Library, but most are at 
                        Wabash
                    . An unusual primary source at the archives is the 
                  
                            Wabash
                         Magazine, a literary magazine whose stories, essays, biographies, and poems
                    were written by local residents and 
                        Wabash
                     students, many of whom were from west-central Indiana.
            Most of the extant newspapers of west-central Indiana for the Civil War era are available at the
                    Newspaper Division of the Indiana State Library. Notable exceptions are the two 
                        Crawfordsville
                     newspapers (one Republican and one Democratic) that are available at the 
                        Crawfordsville
                     Public Library. In addition to these two newspapers, the library has copies of a few
                    letters and diaries from the period.
            One can also find useful primary sources in 
                        Lafayette
                    , Vin-cennes, and 
                        Bloomfield
                    . The 
                        Tippecanoe County
                     Historical Society's collection contains a few sets of Civil War letters and a
                    local farmer's diary from the mid-nineteenth century. The Byron R. Lewis Historical Library
                    at 
                        Vincennes
                     University has a few sets of Civil War soldier letters (some originals and some
                    copies), a number of businessmen's letters and records, and a variety of county records.
                    Many of these sources relate to 
                        Knox County
                    , but a number of them come from the other counties of 
                        Illinois
                     and Indiana in the 
                        Vincennes
                     area. The 
                        Greene County
                    
                    Southern Indianan, one of the few extant Democratic newspapers from the region,
                    has not yet been microfilmed and is available only at the county recorder's office in
                    Bloom-field. Its outspoken anti—Lincoln and anti—Morton stands make it well
                    worth the trip to the 
                        Greene County
                     Courthouse.
            Almost all county libraries in the region have materials that can be of use to researchers. Among
                    such items are locally produced county indices to the manuscript federal censuses, copies of and
                    indices to some local government records, locally published histories related to the Civil War era,
                    copies of letters and diaries held by the Indiana Historical Society or other archives, and cemetery
                    records.
            In addition to the manuscripts held in archives in the region, it is very probable that a large
                    number of Civil War-era diaries and letters are currently in the possession of descendants in
                    west-central Indiana and elsewhere in the nation. No one knows how many private collections exist,
                    but some idea of how large a number there might be is illustrated by a collection of such materials
                    from 
                        Owen County
                     recently assembled by local historian Vivian Zollinger. She  has discovered nearly two dozen different privately held collections of
                    Civil War soldier letters in the county.11
            
            There is no sure way to locate privately held manuscripts, but a researcher who is beginning a search
                    for such items in any given county should check the acknowledgments and bibliographies of any
                    locally written and published books on the Civil War in the county library. One should also attempt
                    to identify, through the library or local historical society, the most knowledgeable genealogist in
                    the county. Almost every county has one or a few individuals who are extremely well versed in their
                    county's history. They will often know "who has what" within the county
                    and will frequently know, probably as a result of genealogical inquiries, about privately held sets
                    of letters that are in other parts of the country.
            Of course, many important primary materials relating to important regional political figures are
                    located in major archives outside of west-central Indiana. The papers of Godlove S. Orth, a major
                    Know Nothing and Republican politician, and Joseph A. Wright, an antebellum Democratic governor and
                    a wartime Republican 
                        United States
                     senator and an ambassador, are at the Indiana State Library. Richard Thompson, an
                    important Whig, Know Nothing, and Republican politician, has left a voluminous correspondence that
                    is spread about several archives, including Indiana University's Lilly Library, the Indiana
                    State Library, the 
                        Vigo County
                     Public Library, the Lincoln Library in Fort 
                        Wayne
                    , and the Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Library in 
                  Fremont, Ohio
               . The
                    collections at the Lincoln Library contain an especially large number of letters from political
                    figures around the region and the state. The papers of Henry S. Lane, a major Whig and Republican
                    leader, are at Indiana University's Lilly Library and the Indiana Historical Society. The
                    papers of John P. Usher, Republican politician and secretary of the interior, are at the 
                        Kansas
                     State Historical Society, 
                        Topeka
                    . John Givan Davis, a Democratic congressman, whose huge correspondence reveals a great
                    deal about the workings of politics in the 1850s, has papers at the Indiana Historical Society and
                    the State Historical Society of 
                  Wisconsin,
                            Madison
               . Daniel W. Voorhees, the major
                    wartime Democratic figure in the region, did not leave a collection of his own, but a number of
                    letters written by or to him are in the Davis Papers in 
                        Wisconsin
                     and the Carrington Family Papers at Yale University, 
                        New Haven
                    . The Indiana State Library has a number of pamphlets containing his speeches. Lyman
                    Abbott, a wartime 
                        Terre Haute
                     pastor and Republican activist, has material relating to this period at the Bowdoin
                    College 
                  
                     11 Transcriptions of these sources will eventually be available at the 
                                Owen County
                             Public Library in 
                                Spencer
                            , and selections from the collection are scheduled for publication in the June,
                            1997, issue of the Indiana Magazine of History.
                  
               
                     Library in Brunswick, 
                        Maine

                    magazine (1914).
            The Indiana State Library and Indiana Historical Society have a number of the diaries and letters of
                    soldiers from west-central Indiana. The large collections are listed in Pumroy's A Guide to Manuscript Collections, but for the smaller manuscript collections one
                    must consult the Guide to Indiana Civil War Manuscripts. While most of the
                    material in such collections concern conditions and events at the battlefront, it should be noted
                    that a significant amount of information about the home front can be gleaned from them. This is
                    especially true of collections that contain large numbers of letters from friends and relatives back
                    home or letters of soldiers who wrote instructions to their wives on how to run the farm. Such
                    collections as the Rufus Dooley Papers (IHS), the Ransom Hawley Papers (ISL), and the recently
                    acquired Alford Papers (IHS) contain information on politics, the operation of the draft, farming
                    techniques, work routines on farms, women's work, women's war-related activities,
                    religion, agricultural marketing procedures and conditions, attitudes on childrearing, and much
                    more. In short, a great deal of social, political, gender, and economic history can be distilled
                    from the correspondence of Civil War soldiers.
            Most sources of federal, state, and local government information are fairly well known, but a few
                    observations should be included here. Access to and availability of local government records vary
                    from place to place. Most exemplary perhaps is 
                        Owen County
                    , where local historian Roger A. Peterson has begun an extensive indexing of local
                    government materials from the nineteenth century. Rarely used federal sources of information are the
                    Civil War federal income tax returns (available on microfilm at the Indiana University main
                    library). In these returns one will find annual income figures for well-to-do citizens, luxury items
                    owned by local residents, and information on professionals and businesses that had to pay licensing
                    fees. Other rarely used federal sources are the reports of the district provost marshals available
                    on microfilm from the National Archives. Many of these reports, which were prepared for each draft
                    district at the end of the war, are perfunctory, but the reports for the Seventh and Eighth
                    districts in west-central Indiana are quite informative about drafting procedures, draft resistance,
                    and so forth. Finally, disputed elections can be interesting sources of information. The records of
                    the disputed Voorhees congressional election of 1864, for instance, contain lists of Republican
                    voters in four different townships and other useful information.
            Much useful primary information can also be found in the accounts of travelers who passed through
                    west-central Indiana during the period. Many such works can be located at the ISL, the IHS, and the
                    libraries of Indiana University. One good example of such a 
                    source is the English traveler J. Richard Beste's The 
                            Wabash
                        
                (2 vols., 1855). This book contains many interesting observations on the
                    people of 
                        Vigo
                     and 
                        Putnam
                     counties, an election in 
                        Vigo County
                    , transportation by land and canal, and the unsuccessful medical efforts to save the
                    life of his daughter.
            There are relatively few primary sources for the women of west-central Indiana. Occasionally, one
                    finds letters from one woman to another, such as Mary Hovey's letters to her daughter Helen
                    in the Hovey papers at 
                        Wabash
                    , that provide a glimpse into the everyday world of women. There are also some records
                    of Ladies' Aid societies and of the nursing duties carried out by the nuns of 
                        St. Mary-of-the-Woods
                    . Much of the information that is available about the region's women, however,
                    has to be extracted from letters written by or to mothers, wives, sisters, and girl friends in the
                    soldiers' letter collections.
            There are no significant collections of letters or other primary items for black Hoosiers living in
                    west-central Indiana during the Civil War period. Given the small size of the region's
                    black population and the exclusion of black males from the region's military companies
                    during the war and from voting and officeholding before 1869, it is perhaps not surprising that
                    black sources are so sparse. Still, both 
                        Knox
                     and 
                        Vigo counties
                     had unusually large concentrations of black population by Indiana standards, and it is
                    to be hoped that some significant black primary sources will be discovered in these or other
                    counties of the region.
            
                    Civil War-Era Primary Materials in Indiana University's Lilly Library
                
            For the last several years one of the most frequently researched subjects in the Lilly Library at
                    Indiana University has been the 
                        United States
                     Civil War and Civil War era. While much of the increased interest may be attributed to
                    the Ken Burns public television series first broadcast in 1989, that hardly accounts for the
                    long-standing, continued interest in and use of the library's Civil War collections.
                    Indeed, when the Lilly Library came into being in 1960, Indiana University already had substantial
                    holdings relating to the war, documenting not only Indiana but also national activities and
                        participation.12 The library has continued to build on these collections, so
                    that presently a scholar, researcher, or even Civil War re-enactor has access to more than sixty
                    different collections that will be of interest. Everything from muster lists; clothing and equipment
                    issues; pay accounts and disbursements; discharge papers; diaries; individual letters to family,
                    sweethearts, and politicians; 
                  
                     12 See Turner, Guide to Indiana Civil War
                            Manuscripts, for descriptions of fifty-nine items and/or collections in the Lilly
                            Library at Indiana University, 
                                Bloomington
                            .
               
                     and much, much more may be found relating to forty-six Indiana
                    regiments; five 
                        Ohio
                     regiments or companies; soldiers in 
                  Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin
               , and 
                        New York
                     regiments; and even regiments of the Confederate States of America.13 Most of the Hoosier participants present in these collections are representative of Gibson,
                            
                  Hamilton, La
                        Porte, Marion, Monroe
               , and 
                        Owen counties
                    , and the professions include those of chaplain (Eli P. Farmer), nurse (Elizabeth A.
                    Tuttle), physician (George 
                        Washington
                     Bryan, William Baldwin Fletcher, Nathan Kimball, Edwin McGann, and Ira Noris Noland),
                    and surgeon (James Bradbridge Hunter and Joseph Goodwin Rogers).
            Of these "participant" collections the Lilly Library's most recent
                    acquisition is that of William Allen Clark's letters to his family from August, 1862,
                    through the first part of 1865. Published in the 1995 issues of the Indiana Magazine of
                        History, these letters were donated to the library by Mrs. August F. Voss, Jr., of Webster
                    Groves, 
                        Missouri
                    . Consisting of more than eighty letters written during the marches and battles of the
                    war, it is one of the largest such collections in the library. Smaller collections and individual
                    diaries present in larger, often family collections are of equal interest and research value. One
                    particularly notable, albeit small, file is that of Eduard Ochsner's letters. Written in
                    Old German script and containing just five items, it sets down in some detail and passion the
                    reasons why a recent immigrant working in a 
                        Wisconsin
                     mill would take up arms against one group of Americans in support of the Union cause.
                    Ochsner also provides a vivid comparison of Union and Confederate military equipment on the western
                    front, specifically 
                        Arkansas
                     and 
                        Missouri
                    , in 1862.
            Five collections help document activities on the national scene and the federal administration during
                    the war. The Abraham Lincoln collections consist of letters and documents signed by President
                    Lincoln, an extensive group of photographs of Civil War officers, politicians, and Lincoln family
                    and friends, and copies of most of the documents, broadsides, and newspaper articles produced during
                    the late 1850s through Lincoln's death and well into the Andrew Johnson administration. 
                        Montgomery
                     Blair's papers include items dealing with the 1860 election, Cabinet changes
                    before and during the war years, the economic effects of the war, Robert E. Lee's
                    surrender, and Lincoln's assassination. A strong opponent of slavery, Blair left the
                    Democratic party to join the newly formed Republican party, was a delegate to both the 1856 and 1860
                    Republican National Conventions, served as chief counsel in the Dred Scott case, and was a member of
                    the defense team during the trial of John Brown. Blair was appointed postmaster general 
                  
                     13 See Appendix, p. 273, for a list of regiments represented in the
                            Lilly Library's holdings.
               
                     in Lincoln's Cabinet as a reward for his unstinting
                    party service. The papers of Hugh McCulloch, a Fort 
                        Wayne
                     banker, 
                        United States
                     comptroller of the currency, and later secretary of the treasury in the Lincoln and
                    Johnson administrations, provide a particularly fine cache of information about financial dealings
                    in Indiana and at the national level before, during, and after the war, while the correspondence of
                    Indiana congressman James Addison Cravens from 1861 to 1865 relates to national and state politics,
                    the progress of the war, army hospitals, and prisoners of war. At least half of the small collection
                    of the papers of Henry Smith Lane, governor of Indiana and later a congressman and a member of the 
                        United States
                     Senate from 1861 to 1867, detail both national and state politics during the Civil War
                    era.
            Several Hoosier family collections include Civil War—era letters and documents relating
                    both to Indiana and to other states of the union. John Barron Niles of 
                        La Porte
                    , Indiana, was a lawyer, judge, delegate to the Indiana Constitutional Convention of
                    1850-1851, member of the state Senate from 1864 to 1868, and one of the organizers of the First
                    National Bank of 
                        La Porte
                     in 1864. The Niles Family Papers of more than 32,000 items contain correspondence and
                    records relative to all these activities, including many legal, mostly railroad, cases dating from
                    the 1850s through 1870, as well as correspondence from son William, who served in Company B of the
                    138th Indiana Volunteer Infantry in 1864. Niles's son-in-law, Emmet Hoyt Scott, who grew up
                    and was educated in 
                        New York
                     state, moved west during the war while involved with railroad construction. The Scott
                    family papers detail first Emmet's efforts to raise his own volunteer 
                        New York
                     regiment, then his determination to avoid the draft in 1863 by taking employment
                    outside the state. Meanwhile, two of his brothers did serve in local regiments, and letters from
                    both of them describing campaign actions and camp activities are present in the collection, as well
                    as letters from a third brother who lived in West 
                        Virginia
                     in 1859 and witnessed firsthand much of the activity around, and after, John
                    Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry.
            Business archives are also important sources of information about the Civil War era. The 
                        Cannelton
                     Cotton Mills collection documents a unique cooperation between southern and northern
                    capital and between cotton planters and Yankee industrialists, cooperation that came to an end with
                    the firing on Fort Sumter. A smaller but closely related collection consists of the personal and
                    business papers of 
                        Hamilton
                     Smith, one of the organizers of the 
                        Cannelton
                     Mills. In his papers can be found letters and other materials relating to the American
                    Cannel Coal Company between the 1850s and 1870, tariffs on cotton between 1850 and 1869, and
                    emigration from the eastern states to 
                        Cannelton
                    , Indiana, in the years just before the war.
            
            Another Ohio River business of significance during this period was the Howard
                    Ship Yards of 
                        Jeffersonville
                    . A very large collection dating from the late 1840s through 1950, it includes several
                    hundred letters, orders for boats, cash books, and account journals covering the Civil War period.
                    Also involved with boats during the war itself was Thomas Gaff of 
                        Aurora
                    , Indiana, who furnished steamboats and supplies for the Union cause. He and his brother
                    James owned the steamboat Forest Queen, which successfully ran the blockade at
                    Vicksburg. Papers relating to these activities as well as to Gaffs war claims against the 
                        United States
                     government after the war are in the Gaff collection.
            Looking to the "other side" in the war, the Lilly Library has three collections of
                    Confederate participants. Major Flavel C. Barber of 
                        Tennessee
                     began a retrospective diary while a prisoner of war on Johnson's Island in
                    Sandusky, 
                        Ohio
                    . After being "exchanged," he returned to the front and continued his
                    diary until his death in battle in 1864. The four volumes here have been edited by Professor
                    Emeritus Robert H. Ferrell and were recently published by 
                        Kent
                     State University Press.
            Joseph Lane was an Indiana state legislator from the 1820s to the 1840s, territorial governor of 
                        Oregon
                     and later 
                        United States
                     senator from that state, and a southern sympathizer. His papers include correspondence
                    from one of his sons who left West Point to fight for the Confederacy, as well as materials relating
                    to his own campaign for vice-president on the John C. Breckinridge ticket in 1860 and his proslavery
                    and secessionist sentiments. A small collection of John Archibald Smith, who served in the 3rd
                    regiment of the Confederate army, 1864-1865, and the more extensive files of the law firm of Hughes, 
                        Denver
                    , and Peck, which handled many Confederate claims before the 
                        United States
                     Court of Claims for the return or reimbursement of property seized or destroyed during

               Hampton Court: Growing Up Catholic in 
                            Indianapolis
                         Between the Wars. By Lawrence S. Connor. (
                        Indianapolis
                    : Guild Press of Indiana, 1995. Pp. ix, [151]. Illustrations. $19.95.)
            In his sentimental journey back to the days of his youth, Lawrence S. Connor focuses on family, his
                    Hampton Court neighborhood, and his Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral parish. Nicholas, his father,
                    was secretary of Holcombe & Hake Manufacturing, effectively running the company, but the
                    Great Depression reduced his salary by two-thirds. But while the 1930s were economically the worst
                    of times, socially they were among the best of times, pulling an already tightly knit family even
                    closer. In contrast to her stern, somewhat remote husband, Agnes Peelle Connor was a warm, caring
                    focal point for the religiously Catholic, politically Democratic household. Its Hampton Court
                    apartment was always full of friends and relatives enjoying generous hospitality. Nicholas died in
                    1939 at age fifty-one while watching his son Bob play football for 
                        Butler
                     University. Agnes's brother, Bob, moved into the Hampton Court apartment and
                    functioned as a surrogate father for the six younger Connor siblings.
            In 
                        Indianapolis
                    , like 
                        Chicago
                     and some other American cities, Catholic ethnics, particularly the Irish, viewed the
                    parish as the religious, social, and educational center of their lives. Connor pays tribute to the
                    Sisters of 
                        Providence
                     who taught him in parochial school and his sisters at St. Agnes Academy and to the Holy
                    Cross brothers in charge of Cathedral High School. Nuns and brothers not only educated, they also
                    instilled discipline and values that persisted over a lifetime.
            Unlike most other midwestern cities, the antiblack, anti-Catholic, and anti-Jewish Ku Klux Klan
                    flourished in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . Connor indicates that it had little impact on his consciousness but suggests that the
                    Klan might have instilled in his parents the notion that Catholic outsiders "in a
                    Protestant world" had "better not get too pushy and vocal" (p. 90).
                    Connor also suggests that this attitude might have delayed Catholic ethnic progress. The Connors,
                    however, were exceptional among pre-World War II Irish-American Catholics in that their three eldest
                    sons attended university: Nick had to drop out of Notre Dame during the depression; Bill and Bob
                    earned degrees at 
                        Butler
                    .
            In World War II Nick and Bill Connor were army officers, Lawrence served as a radio operator in the
                    Army Air Corps, and his sister, Sally, was a WAVE. Taking advantage of the G.I. Bill, in 1949
                    Lawrence earned a journalism degree at Notre Dame. He then joined the staff of the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Star and after forty-one years retired as its managing editor.
            
            Connor's well-written reminiscences, a useful addition to the bibliography of
                    America's urban Catholics, evoke fond memories of a country unified by the crises of war
                    and depression, nickle fourdip, twin-headed ice cream cones, dime movies with bank nights and free
                    dishes, popular music with lovely melodies and lyrics that sometimes reached the quality of minor
                    poetry sung by people with pleasant voices who could articulate the words, innocent romances, strong
                    families, harmonious parish neighborhoods, and safe city streets. But Hampton
                    Court contains little about the numerous disadvantaged African Americans in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . Connor mentions his mother's kindness to a black woman who worked for the
                    family but admits that blacks were almost invisible to his eyes, at the time a situation true for
                    white middle-class people in most American cities.

               From Needmore to Prosperity: Hoosier Place Names in Folklore and History. By
                    Ronald L. Baker. (
                        Bloomington
                    : Indiana University Press, 1995. Pp. 371. Notes, bibliography. Cloth-bound,
                    $29.95; paperbound, $15.95.)
            Building on previous works on Hoosier jokelore and folk legends, Ronald L. Baker continues to
                    establish himself as a dean of Indiana folk culture. In his latest work, From Needmore
                        to Prosperity, Baker argues that stories are as important as facts as he encyclopedically
                    compiles Indiana's colorful assortment of place names. His aim, he writes, is not
                    "merely the compilation of facts to discover a single vision of formal culture"
                    but rather the presentation of "the diverse thoughts and feelings of a community"
                    through interdisciplinary investigation. Folklore is joined with history (à la Richard
                    Dorson) because the former "presents other voices and other visions and provides a
                    context" for place-name research (p. 1). In short, Baker maintains, folklore humanizes
                    place names.
            In the introduction Baker points out that historically folklore has been of scant interest to
                    place-name scholars largely because the popular usage of the term folklore
                    (especially by historians) implies falsehood. Other scholars have taken interest in etymological
                    approaches, leaving little room for folkloristic details. Folklore, in Baker's
                    understanding, can reveal the function of place names: "Since names are so extremely
                    important in human culture," he writes, "place-name researchers should examine
                    what they mean to all people who know them and use them as well as what they meant at the time of
                    naming" (p. 6).
            H. L. Mencken notwithstanding, many Indiana place names are imaginative, and some are even more
                    imaginatively enshrouded  in legends that some people still
                    believe to be true. Hoosier is the most obvious example, but there are others.
                    Hymera, for example (pronounced, mind you, High Mary), is thought by some to have
                    been named for a prostitute with absurdly expensive prices and not for the Sicilian counterpart,
                    Himera. Galveston (gal-VES-tuhn), some maintain, came not from 
                        Texas
                     but from founder James Carter in 1852, who, gazing out a window trying to think of a
                    name, saw a girl walk by wearing a vest. And lest the reader think that only the illiterate or
                    provincial create place-name legends, Baker is quick to point out that highfalutin folk do, too. For
                    example, some say that Gnaw Bone is from 
                        France
                    's Narbonne. The big picture is that people create etiological stories when
                    facts are forgotten or unknown, and From Needmore to Prosperity is chock-full of
                    them.
            In an alphabetical list Baker includes place names, some long gone, followed by (locally accepted)
                    pronunciation, county, and a short explanation. Clearly a compromise between scholars and local
                    history buffs, the book includes folk legends and anecdotes but always clearly identifies them as
                    such. Unfortunately, there is no map, and one wishes that even a map of counties had been included

               Indiana Negro Registers, 1852-1865 and Reclaiming African Heritage at 
                            Salem
                        , Indiana are interesting companion pieces that provide a close look at small
                    Indiana towns in the early nineteenth century and place them in a national context.
            
               Indiana Negro Registers is a description of fifteen Negro registration lists that
                    resulted from a state law designed to enforce the thirteenth article of the state constitution of
                    1851 which called for  the exclusion of Negroes from the state.
                    Thirty-one counties are known to have kept registers of their black population, but only fifteen,
                    all in southern Indiana, have been located. The book contains the name, age, place of birth,
                    residence, witnesses, and date of the registration of all Negroes in selected communities. The pages
                    are brought to life by such descriptive details as registrants' complexion, height, scars,
                    and other outstanding features, as well as their relationship to others on the list. Some of the
                    descriptive phrases are as open to individualistic interpretation as can be imagined. One Negro was
                    described as "peaceable and inoffensive"; another was called "free
                    soilish in his politics"; another, "intelligent looking." One very
                    telling description of a small child depicted him as "a plump little chap …
                    [who] bids fair do well if he lives long enough." The witness list is composed of
                    "reputable" citizens who verified that information in the register was correct.
            The second text, Reclaiming African Heritage at 
                            Salem
                        
               , at first glance is a re-creation of local history that one might assume to be
                    of little interest beyond a particular small community. Not long into the text, however, it becomes
                    obvious that the book is multidimensional. The emotional, legal, and social faces of the African
                    presence in southern Indiana are placed in a historical context. The maps, charts, appendix,
                    bibliography, and index make the text useful as a reference source.
            The book provides insight into several facets of black life in Indiana Territory and the state of
                    Indiana prior to the Civil War. There is information about Negroes who participated in the War of
                    1812, about the origins of the African Methodist and African Methodist Episcopal churches in
                    Indiana, and about the evolution of Indiana school law. There is also a section describing John
                    Williams, the black landowner in 
                        Washington County
                     who left scholarship money to help educate black youth in the state. The author fills
                    the gaps between Williams's death and the creation of the scholarship fund. Robbins also
                    delves into the mythology surrounding operation of the Underground Railroad, giving evidence of much
                    greater participation by blacks than has previously surfaced.
            Taken together, these two texts give a clear view of black life in 
                        Washington County
                    , Indiana, and the growing reaction to the presence of blacks in the state prior to the
                    Civil War. Their greatest value may lie in the data each provides. There is a wealth of specific
                    genealogical information as well as many general trails that could lead to information about
                    families living in various parts of the state. Clues abound for anyone interested in free blacks
                    from 
                  North Carolina, Kentucky
               , or 
                        Virginia
                    . Several family names are highlighted.
            Much has been written about blacks in the major cities in Indiana and somewhat less about life in the
                    early black settlements in the state, but few authors have attempted to write about the life  of blacks in small-town Indiana. Coy D. Robbins sets a very
                    difficult task for himself but has managed to do it very well.

                    index. $30.00.)
            Kerry A. Trask's goal in Fire Within is to describe the experiences of the
                    inhabitants of Manitowoc, 
                        Wisconsin
                    , during the Civil War. He tells the stories of the men who fought and of the people who
                    remained on the home front. Manitowoc was a port town located on the western shore of Lake
                        Michigan. It was founded in 1837, but it was not until the 1850s that it and the
                    surrounding county passed beyond the frontier stage and experienced rapid population growth, the
                    expansion of its lumber milling operations, and the development of shipbuilding and other new
                    manufacturing activities. The town's 1860 population of 3,065 consisted primarily of
                    Yankees and a large number of foreign immigrants.
            While Trask draws on a rich and varied collection of letters, diaries, newspapers, and local
                    histories, there are two sources that are central to the book. One consists of the letters and diary
                    of James S. Anderson, who was a member of Company A, Fifth 
                        Wisconsin
                     Volunteers, the first company raised in Manitowoc. Trask follows Anderson through
                    training camp, his journey to 
                        Washington
                     and the eastern front in 
                        Virginia
                    , his experience of camp life, and his participation in virtually all of the major
                    battles in the east from those of the Peninsular Campaign in 1862 to the Battle of Cold Harbor that
                    was fought shortly before Anderson's enlistment ended in July, 1864. Trask's other
                    major source is the diary of Rosa Kell-ner, a serious, sometimes melancholy, young woman in her late
                    teens. Kellner worked at a hotel located in the middle of Manitowoc and owned by some of her
                    relatives. The Williams House Hotel was an excellent vantage point from which to observe the life of
                    the town, the comings and goings of its inhabitants, the political battles over war policy, and the
                    public ceremonies surrounding recruiting and burials, observances in which the townspeople tried to
                    make sense of the war and its meaning.
            General readers and Civil War buffs will probably find this book to be quite engaging and enjoyable.
                    Trask consciously adopts a  story-telling literary style.
                    Historiography is relegated to the footnotes, demographic and electoral statistics are unobtrusively
                    woven into the narrative, analysis rarely interrupts the flow of the story, and human drama
                    permeates the lives of the book's main characters. Academic historians will find the
                    book's concept of telling the wartime story of an entire community to be fascinating and
                    potentially rewarding but will probably be somewhat frustrated by the way in which the author
                    carries out his task. Trask tantalizes the scholarly reader with passing notice of ethnic tensions,
                    socioeconomic divisions, and political conflicts but refuses to abandon his narrative long enough to
                    provide the kind of analysis necessary for such readers to understand fully what was going on in
                    Manitowoc and relate it to other mid-nineteenth-century community studies.
            
               The Alford Brothers is a collection of 196 letters written primarily by the members
                    of the family of 
                        Franklin
                     Alford during 1861 and 1862. The Alfords lived in southeast 
                        Daviess County
                     near the town of Alfordsville, which had been founded by Franklin's father
                    when he immigrated to the state from 
                        Virginia
                    . The Alfords were an affluent, market-oriented farm family who were prominent and pious
                    members of the local Christian church.
            
               
                        Franklin
                     Alford's three oldest sons volunteered for military service. 
                        Warren
                    , the eldest, joined the Fourteenth Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment in May, 1861,
                    while 
                        Wayne
                     and 
                        Lafayette
                     enlisted in the Sixth Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment in October of the same year. 
                        Warren
                    's regiment went to Camp Vigo, near 
                        Terre Haute
                    , for training and then was sent into action in western and then eastern 
                        Virginia
                    . The other two brothers fought in western 
                        Kentucky
                     and 
                        Tennessee
                    . 
                        Lafayette
                     became ill just before the Battle of 
                        Shiloh
                     and died at home in May, 1862. 
                        Wayne
                     became ill after 
                        Shiloh
                     and died in June, 1862. Warren died in September, 1862, of a bullet wound he received
                    during the Battle of 
                        Antietam
                    .
            Because this collection includes letters going to as well as coming from the front, the reader not
                    only learns about army life but also about life in rural Indiana in the 1860s. The collection
                    contains information on the resistance to the war by some 
                        Daviess
                     and 
                        Martin county
                     residents, in-fighting between members of the local church, the efforts of 
                        Franklin
                     to get a relative committed to the state mental asylum, plowing and planting,
                    harvesting crops and slaughtering hogs, market conditions, borrowing from and lending money to
                    neighbors, illness and death, the schooling of the younger children, and the ways in which the
                    family's political and religious values shaped its reactions to the loss of three of its
                    members.
            Like Trask's work, the Alford letters, albeit on a more limited scale, tell the story of a
                    community and its soldiers. Because the collection contains letters to and from home, it portrays
                    the interplay of soldiers and the family and friends they left behind in a more  intimate and profound way than Trask's sources allow him to do
                    with any of his book's major characters.
            Skidmore divides the letters into five chapters. Each chapter includes a background essay, maps, and
                    numerous photographs of people, places, and things germane to the letters in the section. The essays
                    are based on government records, local history sources, a wide array of secondary sources, and
                    manuscript collections of soldiers who served in the same units as the Alfords. Most of the letters
                    were penned by Franklin's nuclear family, but some were written by family friends and
                    extended kin. The editor has retained most of the original spelling in his transcriptions.
                    Individuals, places, and other references in the letters with which the reader might not be familiar
                    are identified by parenthetical remarks within the text.
            While scholars might quibble with some of Skidmore's interpretations, they and general
                    readers alike will delight in the informative detail he provides on everything from Union army tents
                    to the logistics of the mailing of letters to and from the army. The book's 120 photographs
                    have not been reproduced very well, but Skidmore's industry in locating so many pictures
                    from so many different sources is impressive.
            For years the mountains of Civil War letters and diaries have been productively mined by military
                    historians. What both of these works suggest is that social historians may very well profit by going
                    prospecting in these same hills.

               A More Perfect Legacy: A Portrait of Brother Ephrem O'Dwyer, C.S.C.,
                        1888-1978. By Brother Philip Armstrong. (Notre Dame, Ind.: University of Notre Dame Press,
                    1995. Pp. xxii, 402. Illustrations, notes, index. $29.95.)
            The legacy of Brother Ephrem O'Dwyer, CSC, lives on in A More Perfect
                    Legacy by Brother Philip Armstrong, also a member of the Brothers of the Holy Cross. The
                    author, former assistant general of the Congregation and provincial of the Midwest province, is a
                    step ahead of any other member of the CSC community who would attempt to write this book. The
                    biography is one of the several publications commemorating the sesquicentennial of the Congregation.
            The methodology used by the author also serves as a guide to the records created by Brother Ephrem in
                    directing the community's affairs from 1931 to 1956. Brother Philip relies heavily on the
                    provincial correspondence and quotes extensively from these documents. Another facet of the
                    author's research is his use of inter views  oral and
                    written, to flesh out the reader's understanding of Brother Ephrem.
            Major superiors early on saw in Ephrem leadership qualities that went beyond his teaching skills, and
                    they gave him community appointments to develop these attributes. It was the author's
                    stated intention in A More Perfect Legacy to show through Brother
                    Ephrem's official correspondence that he was the right person to serve the community as its
                    leader during a very challenging period of its history.
            After vows, Ephrem taught high school for eight years (1911–1919). Through a governmental
                    error, he and three other CSC brothers were drafted into the 
                        United States
                     army on July 23, 1918, and managed to get released from the military on September 7,
                    1918, just in time to re-enter the classroom. From 1918 until 1931 he served in the high schools as
                    teacher, principal, and religious superior. In 1931 he was assigned to the University of Notre Dame
                    du Lac as treasurer, and by 1933 he was serving on the provincial council. From 1933 he enhanced the
                    community leadership skills that would lead the brothers through the canonical, legal, and economic
                    channels which were necessary to become a separate province.
            Following the general chapters of 1926 and 1932, there was a movement on the part of the clerics to
                    separate the brothers from the community. Part of the planning of the generalate officials concerned
                    the serious and sensitive issue of separating the clerics and teaching brothers into two separate
                    provinces. The provincials, in turn, would report to the father general. This reviewer suggests that
                    terms such as "lay religious" and "community steward" be defined
                    in future publications to assist the reader.
            For several years, then, prior to the General Chapter of 1945, Ephrem was engaged in preparing
                    documentation for discussion on the various points needed for the General Chapter in regard to the
                    separation of the clerics and brothers. As he was well known by the clerics and brothers and had a
                    deep love for Holy Cross, he was ideal for this position. Time and again he reminded his
                    correspondents that all should have a deep love for Holy Cross, which would result in a just
                    separation of the properties and finances.
            This reviewer was happily surprised that the apostolic delegate at that time, Archbishop (later
                    Cardinal) Amleto Cicognani, took a personal interest in the creation of the two provinces. Father
                    Edward Heston, CSC, a fine canonist, was also helpful to Brother Ephrem in drawing up the documents
                    of separation in correct canonical style.
            With the promulgation of the decrees, both provinces could move on with their respective apostolates.
                    It was only natural that Ephrem be appointed the first brother provincial of the newly formed
                    province. According to the author of this volume, very little 
                    correspondence exists with religious of other congregations on school issues. The provincial files
                    covering Brother Ephrem's educational directives therefore merit further study.
            Brother Philip Armstrong deserves great credit in presenting Brother Ephrem O'Dwyer to a
                    wider audience without placing him on a pedestal. Finally, this book confirms Ephrem as the second
                    founder of the Congregation of the Holy Cross.

               A Community of Memory: My Days with George and Clara. By Jeff Gundy. (

                        Illinois
                     Press, 1996. Pp. xvi, 158. Illustrations. Paperbound, $14.95.)
            "What is here is not complete, not satisfactory, not to be trusted" (p. xvi), Jeff
                    Gundy warns at the end of his preface. His statement simply recognizes that some information about
                    his subject, his family's migration from Alsace to America and its experiences here, eluded
                    him. Undaunted, Gundy opines that absent facts, such as the dates when people left Alsace and got to 
                        Illinois
                    , are "mere history" (p. 11), and his book is not confined by
                    history's factual limits. The volume makes considerable use of historical research but also
                    belongs to imaginative literature. Gundy is a professor of English and a poet, not a mere historian.
                    The facts that his research dug out of family papers and the General Conference Men-nonite Archives
                    share his book with reminiscences that he wrote for ancestors who left some facts about their lives,
                    but too few to tell their stories fully. Mere historians may sometimes be hard put to distinguish
                    facts from the author's inventions, but careful reading offers both factual and literary
                    rewards.
            The book concerns Amish-Mennonites of Swiss descent whose search for farmland and fear that French
                    military service would be forced upon their young men in Alsace took them to America. John Struber,
                    whose invented recollection begins the first chapter, reports being sent to the 
                        United States
                     in 1826, when he was eighteen. After working in 
                        Ohio
                    , he walked to central 
                        Illinois
                    , looking for farmland. He crossed Indiana, where he learned that his co-religionists
                    were present but had settled well north of his route. Rather than hiking up to 
                        Elkhart
                     and 
                        Lagrange
                     counties, he continued west, which placed his story, and the stories that fill later
                    chapters, outside of Indiana history but very much in its cultural neighborhood.
            Approximately the last third of the book is devoted to George Gundy and Clara Strubhar Gundy, two of
                    the author's great-grandparents. Born in the 1880s, they spent long lives in 
                        Illinois
                    , where George Gundy farmed and, beginning in 1906, was a minister serving  congregations in Congerville and then, for twenty-five years, in
                    Meadows. Photographs, which adorn this book, show that the Gundys were extraordinarily attractive
                    people; sermon notes, some of which also grace this book, show that Rev. Gundy was deeply concerned
                    about the moral hazards that endangered his flock in the 1920s. His recollections, written by his
                    great-grandson, describe a dedicated ministry and a modest, happy life.
            All of the imagined ancestral recollections here, and the author's interspersed reports on
                    his research, provide lively, readable descriptions of Amish-Mennonite settlement in the Midwest,
                    the Americanization of that community, and some of its people's movement into the Mennonite
                    mainstream. Readers who need more historical information about those subjects may do well to consult
                    Willard Smith's Mennonites in 
                            Illinois
                        
                (1983), which is one of the few bibliographical suggestions that Gundy offers,

            Anthropologist Jane Adams's study, The Transformation of Rural Life: Southern 
                            Illinois
                        , 1890-1990, explores the complexities of rural change by focusing primarily on
                    seven family farms representative of the diversity of ecological zones and settlement patterns of 
                        Union County
                    , 
                        Illinois
                    . Work is the central theme of this book, for "work, more than any other
                    activity, organized and gave meaning to people's lives" (p. 4). Work is embedded
                    in the dual narratives that Adams heard repeatedly in her fieldwork: one of poverty and hardship and
                    one of "the plenty provided by living on a farm: never wanting for or worrying about food,
                    the closeness of neighbors and family, the generosity and honor with which people treated one
                    another, and the respect for hard work" (p. 1). Work is also the pivotal element in
                    understanding 
                        Union County
                     women's relationships to farming during the last one hundred years.
            Through skillful use of her oral interviews, Adams provides eloquent and evocative descriptions of
                    what anthropologists term "balanced reciprocity." Early twentieth-century farm
                    families in southern 
                        Illinois
                    , like those in Indiana, were dependent on kin, neighbors, and hired hands for their
                    survival. In the depictions of these dense networks, readers will find patterns identical to those
                         described in the Indiana Extension Homemakers
                    Association's oral history series, Hoosier Homemakers. Adams recognizes
                    the importance of churches and schools in 
                        Union County
                     communities, but because they "did not have much to do directly" with
                    household subsistence, they "were not a central focus" of her research (p. 57).
                    Since rural church activities in Indiana delineated and reinforced bonds of friendship and
                    reciprocity, this seems a regrettable decision.
            Adams's conclusions about women add to knowledge of the differences between regions of the
                    country in expectations of women's roles in farming. In southern 
                        Illinois
                    , Adams argues, women "seem to have seen themselves as farmers who were proud
                    of the work they did and … felt ‘ownership’ in many agricultural
                    processes" (p. 96). They worked in fields, in homes, and in poultry and dairying operations
                    and were not receptive to the efforts by policy makers and land grant home economists to turn them
                    into full-time home-makers. When mid-twentieth-century changes in agricultural markets and
                    technology eliminated women's work in agricultural production (most notably in poultry and
                    dairy), farm women did not become solely homemakers and consumers but sought paying jobs off the
                    farm.
            Adams notes that much of her book "has been told as if the world stood still for thirty
                    years, from 1890 to 1920" (p. 132). She acknowledges that "history did not
                    stop" but contends that "a distinctive social pattern solidified in 
                        Union County
                     by 1890, a pattern that remained dominant through 1920" (p. 132). Although
                    Adams's conclusion that the pace of change was relatively slow in this period is probably
                    accurate, more attention to the economic, social, and technological changes during these years would
                    have made her analysis more convincing and enabled her to avoid one of the pitfalls of oral
                    reminiscences: a sense of timelessness.
            The second half of this book explicitly addresses rural transformation. Adams terms the New Deal a
                    "watershed in 
                        Union County
                    " (p. 144), and her discussion of its impact provides a valuable case study of
                    the variety of ways the federal government affected rural life and the role of the county extension
                    agent in mediating between federal programs and local institutions and individuals. She pays less
                    attention to the impact of World War II but concludes that "between the beginning of the
                    New Deal and the end of World War II a sea change occurred in the country and in the
                    county" (p. 160). Although most 
                        Union County
                     farmers did not realize it at the time, a new order in agriculture was in place by the
                    end of the war. With the increased role of government in agriculture and large-scale production and
                    marketing systems, a series of changes took place in 
                        Union County
                    : women lost their role in agricultural production, small farms were unable to compete
                    with large operations, increasing numbers of rural men and women moved entirely or commuted to jobs
                    off the farm, "rural communities shrank, and  support
                    networks were shredded" (p. 220). It is in telling the particular details of these
                    developments in one 
                        Illinois County
                     that Adams makes her most important contribution to study of rural life in the
                    twentieth-century Middle West.

               Dearest Wilding: A Memoir. By Yvette Eastman, with love letters from Theodore

            Important ostensibly for what it has to tell about Theodore Dreiser, this book is intrinsically
                    interesting for what readers learn about the life and times of Yvette Szekely Eastman, whom Dreiser
                    seduced in 1930 when she was sixteen and he was fifty-nine and at the height of his literary fame.
                    Among the author's numerous inamoratas, Eastman has been little mentioned. She surfaced
                    briefly in Richard Lingeman's 1990 biography as a defender of Dreiser against charges that
                    he exploited women, and she did not appear at all in W. A. Swanberg's classic 1965 work,
                        Dreiser, though her mother, Margaret, did. In Dearest
                    Wilding Eastman emerges as a clear-eyed, articulate memoirist whose personal portrait of the
                    complex Dreiser is at once sympathetic and unsentimental.
            Hungarian immigrants, Yvette and her younger sister, Suzanne, attended Dreiser's Thursday
                    evening soirees at his Rodin Studios apartment in 
                        New York
                     with their divorced mother. They were part of a Hungarian contingent that added
                    international flavor to the gatherings of writers, critics, actors, producers, artists, physicians,
                    lawyers, scientists, revolutionaries, and swamis that might show up as guests of Dreiser and his
                    more or less constant companion Helen Richardson. At one of these parties Yvette also met the man
                    whom she would eventually marry, the radical intellectual Max Eastman. In 1931, as a
                    forty-eight-year-old married man, he also seduced her.
            Separated from her father, who lived in Budapest, Yvette grew increasingly alienated from her
                    eccentric and jealous mother, eventually discovering to her surprise that Margaret was not her real
                    mother at all. Dreiser became surrogate father as well as lover, and his letters to Yvette continued
                    until his death in 1945. "I leaned like water toward this substitute for a
                    father's ‘guidance and protection,’" she confides (p. 51),
                    and Dreiser, self-interested though he was, gave her what she needed.
            Dreiser's extraordinary capacity to live amid intrigue and deceit and to engage in numerous
                    romantic entanglements simultaneously  is well documented. The
                    money he received from the success of An American Tragedy only enhanced it. What
                    looks strictly like self-serving philandering from the outside, however, has a bit different look
                    from the perspective of Yvette Eastman. Her memory of Dreiser is "loving and
                    wistful," and the letters he wrote to her reflect his genuine concern for her well being as
                    well as offer new insights into his restless and multifaceted personality. "Life is so
                    strange. Its [sic] such a show—gay & bleak by turns,"
                    Dreiser ended a letter to Yvette in 1933. "And if death is really the end, what a
                    fantastic, almost unbelievable series of experiences" (p. 137). Dearest
                        Wilding is a welcome addition to Dreiser editions emanating from the University of 
                        Pennsylvania
                     Press, and it heightens anticipation for Eastman's forthcoming, complete
                    autobiography.

               Gentle Warriors is an impressive book that seeks to document the contributions of a
                    particular woman, Clara Hampson Ueland, to the suffrage movement in the state of 
                        Minnesota
                     and in the nation. The focus is largely on the last phase of women's struggle
                    for the vote under the leadership of Ueland as president of the 
                        Minnesota
                     Woman Suffrage Association (1914-1920). The book is, however, much more than an account
                    of one woman's part in the women's suffrage movement. Barbara Stuhler skillfully
                    interweaves individual biography and social history by examining Ueland's life and work
                    (and to a lesser extent those of a number of other individual women) in the context of local, state,
                    and national collective efforts to gain suffrage for women. Throughout the volume she repeatedly
                    shows the intricate connections between activists, their work, and strategies at all these levels so
                    that the reader gains a thorough understanding of how the suffrage movement was able to obtain the
                    passage and ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution.
            As president of the MWSA, Ueland successfully organized suffragists in over five hundred 
                        Minnesota
                     towns, planning and staging marches and fund-raising events, as well as lobbying
                    legislators. Politically astute, highly competent, and widely respected, her success was the result
                    of many factors, including a firm sense of justice, a supportive family, and a high socioeconomic
                    standing. In addition she lived in a relatively progressive state and was able to draw on the
                    resources of a national suffrage movement.  By following
                    Uelan's (and others') actions from local to state and national groups, Stuhler
                    traces the vital connections between grass-roots efforts and the national campaign.
            This book makes several important contributions to the extensive body of literature on
                    women's suffrage. While much has been written about the first generation of activists, the
                    women who carried the suffrage struggle to its victory in 1920 have been, for the most part,
                    forgotten. Stuhler brings them back to life and thus fills in an important chapter in the history of
                    the first wave of the women's movement in the 
                        United States
                    . Gentle Warriors also documents (better than any other work to date)
                    the complexity of the organizational efforts of suffragists, especially in regard to the formation
                    of coalitions and alliances across counties and states. The reader also learns that the suffrage
                    movement in 
                        Minnesota
                     was much more diverse in terms of race, ethnicity, and social class than has generally
                    been assumed. Suffrage groups of black, Scandinavian, working-class, and college women were
                    affiliated with the MWSA (pp. 80-81) and jointly worked to get women the vote.
            Finally, Stuhler shows that during the first few years after the ratification of the Nineteenth
                    Amendment the forces responsible for its passage were successful in obtaining important legislation
                    in favor of women and children by capitalizing on the expectations of legislators that women would
                    form a significant voting bloc. Contrary to popular belief, the women's movement did not
                    rest after 1920 but continued in other guises. The legacy of Ueland and her contemporaries continues
                    to this day, as Stuhler points out in her final chapter entitled "Reflections," in
                    the work carried out by state and national organizations of the League of Women Voters.

                            St. Paul
                        , 1920-1936. By Paul Maccabee. (
                        St. Paul
                    : 
                        Minnesota

                    index. Clothbound, $45.00; paperbound, $24.95.)
            In a genre dominated by hagiography, Paul Maccabee has succeeded in writing an interesting and
                    important book that does not wink at his subjects' criminal behavior or offer a
                    "good boy gone wrong" justification of their careers. Maccabee instead places the
                    bloody crime wave that struck the Midwest in the 1920s and 1930s in the larger context of political
                    and police corruption that protected  criminals such as John
                    Dillinger and Alvin Karpis for substantial parts of their careers.
            Like most crime reporters, Maccabee is at his best when dealing with his home town, in his case
                            
                  St. Paul, Minnesota
               . He provides the first systematic history of a corrupt
                    bargain between 
                        St. Paul
                    's police and the urban underworld, tracing its origins to the city's
                    chief of police at the beginning of the twentieth century. He offers a wealth of supporting detail
                    in describing the evolution of this corrupt bargain through the mid-1930s, when police reformers and
                    businessmen finally combined to end the bargain.
            Using a wealth of local sources and previously unpublished materials from the files of the Federal
                    Bureau of Investigation, Maccabee documents how the corrupt bargain quickly enabled 
                        St. Paul
                     to acquire a reputation as one of America's safest cities for criminals.
                    Although Maccabee adds very little to the John Dillinger story, he does offer readers a great deal
                    of very useful information on the careers of some equally notorious bandits as well as a wealth of
                    detail on the careers of 
                        St. Paul
                    's major underworld figures. Important criminals who are not currently
                    household names, such as bootlegger Leon Gleckman and fixer Harry Sawyer, receive as much (deserved)
                    attention as their more notorious contemporaries. Maccabee's treatment of this local
                    underworld is in fact one of this book's most important contributions. There has been a
                    lamentable lack of historical work on twentieth-century underworlds outside of 
                        Chicago
                     and 
                        New York
                    , and Maccabee's account of 
                        St. Paul
                     helps fill an important need in that regard.
            Maccabee's most serious, if understandable, flaw is to attribute omniscience to these shady
                    characters and their protectors. In doing so, he implicitly indicts 
                        St. Paul
                    's entire police force, the public, and all local politicians as
                    co-conspirators in the corrupt bargain. This implication creates a major problem for the reader
                    because Maccabee cannot then adequately explain the origins and success of the reform movement that
                    emerged in the 1930s. And while Maccabee recognizes that St. Paul was only one of several midwestern
                    cities whose police and politicians developed corrupt relationships with criminals, he argues for 
                        St. Paul
                    's preeminence in such corruption without adequate proof.
            Despite these flaws John Dillinger Slept Here is an important book which
                    demonstrates that scholars can indeed get beyond the legends of Al Capone and John Dillinger in
                    their search for a better understanding of crime in this interesting era.

               Flatheads and Spooneys: Fishing for a Living in the Ohio River
                        Valley. By Jens Lund. (
                        Lexington
                    : University Press of 
                        Kentucky
                    , 1995. Pp. xiv, 209. Illustrations, maps, figures, appendices, bibliographical essay,
                    index. $24.95.)
            "The river gets in your blood," says lower Ohio River
                    fisherman Roy Lee Walls. "It's just something you don't believe in giving
                    up" (p. 6). In Flatheads and Spooneys folklorist Jens Lund describes the
                    fascinating culture of those who fish for a living in the lower Ohio River
                    valley. "River fishing is a folk occupation," Lund writes. "River
                    fishermen are an identity-conscious group who share occupational customs, beliefs, and
                    expressions" (p. 154). Fishing knowledge, technique, and custom are orally transmitted by
                    fisher folk who share character traits such as individualism, innovation, nomadism, coarse behavior,
                    a love of the natural world, and a disdain for those modern folk who pursue less adventurous
                    lifestyles on "the bank."
            
               Flatheads and Spooneys is based on Lund's extensive field research in the
                    1970s and 1980s among fishermen, marketers, cooks, boatbuilders, netmakers, musselers, pearl and
                    shell dealers, and their families, from 
                        Evansville
                    , Indiana, to Cairo, 
                        Illinois
                    . These recorded oral histories enable Lund to let fisher folk do their own talking much
                    of the time, an approach that enlivens and authenticates this pathbreaking scholarly work. While
                    Lund is interested in oral traditions such as songs and folktales (including the "giant
                    catfish" motif), his forte is researching and describing material culture. Much of Flatheads and Spooneys thus details the making and use of hoop nets, jumper
                    lines, fish traps, mussel brails, and fishing boats, as well as the different kinds of fish and
                    mussels that fishermen catch. Quoting liberally from firsthand accounts, Lund follows the fishing
                    process from dawn to dusk, through the cleaning, marketing, and cooking of the catch. Initiates to
                    dietetically incorrect foodways can even learn how to batter and fry a "fiddler"
                    properly and how to serve it up with "hot corn sticks" just as they do at
                    Kaylor's Cafe in Cave in Rock, 
                        Illinois
                     (p. 131-33).
            Lund's narrative provides a wonderful relief from the jargon-laden mantra that dominates
                    contemporary "folkloristics." A solid analytical thread runs throughout and
                    enhances this highly readable book. "Differential identity" (p. 156) is the
                    theoretical tool Lund uses to characterize and analyze fisher folk culture and myth. Why do
                        Ohio Valley fishermen endure the "insecurity, low return, and
                    adversity" that characterize their trade? Because, writes Lund, fishing provides them
                    "the satisfaction of being independent and feeling close to the river and its
                    environment" (p. 152). It also provides them with a rural mystique, and in a modern,
                    industrialized society such a mystique is priceless. Thus, alongside its many other  accomplishments, Flatheads and Spooneys provides yet
                    another example of the ubiquitous Turnerian frontier myth in modern North American folk culture.
            
               Flatheads and Spooneys is a well-researched and important book about a heretofore
                    unexplored midwestern occupational folk group. It obviously is and will remain the best scholarly
                    description and analysis of Ohio Valley fisher folk, and every university
                    library in the trans-Appalachian West should possess a copy. Because it is also a well-written and
                    engaging narrative, many Ohio Valley residents and other interested laypersons
                    will want to order a copy for their local library or purchase one for the bookshelf of their fishing
                    cabin or houseboat.
            And, in case you were wondering: A "spooney" is a paddle-fish (Polydon
                        spathula). "Flathead" is a moniker for the yellow
                    "mudcat," a name that also served to describe (derogatorily) some of those early
                        Ohio Valley folk who feasted on the succulent Pylodici-tis
                        olivaris.

            This book consists of twenty-three articles based on papers delivered at a conference held in 1989 to
                    commemorate the founding of the millenarian community in 
                        New Harmony
                    , Indiana, by Johann Georg Rapp and his followers 175 years earlier. A keynote address
                    by the late Günter Moltmann, an eminent historian of German immigration to America, is
                    accompanied by a useful introduction by the editors.
            The articles range widely within the field of German communal life in America. Grouped somewhat
                    artificially in seven chapters, they treat, for example, religious sects, church-based settlements,
                    secular communities, regionalism in settlement patterns, and the role of socialism. Some are broad
                    in scope, such as an overview of German settlements in 
                        Canada
                    ; others are narrowly focused, such as the founding of a Lutheran congregation of
                    Osnabrückers in White Creek, located south of 
                        Columbus
                    , Indiana.  Two articles deal with immigrants from
                    the Netherlands—one on Dutch, another on West Frisians. One examines music in Bonduel, 
                        Wisconsin
                    ; another traces the origins of the Amana colonies in 
                        Iowa
                    . Only one essay specifically treats the Rappite colony in 
                        New Harmony
                    . Although the editors chose not to identify contributors by their academic fields,
                    about half are formally trained in history, the others in German literature, American studies,
                    sociology, political science, and perhaps other fields. About half are German, the rest American and
                    Canadian.
            Inevitably in a volume of this kind there is a wide range in the quality of the essays. One wonders
                    what standards, if any, were used by the editors for inclusion. The first article, by Aaron
                    Fogleman, is among the best. Through a careful analysis of statistics, he demonstrates that nearly
                    half of the colonial population at the time of the American Revolution in 1775 was first- or
                    second-generation immigrant. Another useful contribution is the sensibly balanced and clearly
                    organized survey, by Stefan von Senger und Etterlin, of German colonization schemes in the 
                        United States
                    , most of which were failures. Agnes Bretting's piece on German-American

                     effectively contrasts bourgeois and socialist attitudes toward women in the late
                    nineteenth century. In a splendidly researched article Bettina Goldberg argues that the language
                    transition from German to English in 
                        Missouri
                     Synod Lutheran schools long predated the advent of World War I, a fact well understood
                    but not well articulated by Missouri Synod historians. Through the use of atypical information
                    gathered by a census taker in 
                        St. Louis
                     in 1860, Walter Kamphoefner demonstrates the heterogeneity of origin among urban
                    immigrants. Emigrants from southwestern 
                        Germany
                     often resided in eastern cities before moving to 
                        St. Louis
                    , in contrast to northwestern Germans who more often migrated directly to 
                        Missouri
                    .
            No doubt the editorial task was daunting, but there is no index, no list of contributors. Awkward
                    usages (e.g., "editress," p. 296) and inconsistent or incorrect
                    capitalization suggest that the publisher failed to employ the services of a professional copy
                    editor. The editors might have strengthened the book notably had they dropped about one-fourth of
                    the contributions—the most ineptly written and filiopietistic. Still, even those essays
                    that treat the most trivial of subjects may serve as building blocks for broader studies of German
                    immigrant societies in the 
                        United States

            Building on an erudite, somewhat theoretical explanation of the fundamental differences between the
                    British and American rail systems, James E. Vance, Jr., discusses 
                        United States
                     and Canadian rail development from an economic geographer's viewpoint.
                    "It seems that little more than track gauge was successfully carried across the
                    Atlantic," he writes, "much to our ultimate disadvantage in that case"
                    (p. 10).
            Vance contends that British roads were built to serve existing communities in densely populated areas
                    and that capital was spent heavily on infrastructure rather than on motive power. In America, he
                    writes, the opposite was true. Once beyond the East Coast the railroad was developmental and built
                    cheaply into unpopulated areas, with the hope that settlers would follow. Because capital was
                    limited and the distances were great, American roads spent relatively less on rights of way but
                    heavily on motive power.
            Vance discusses urban mercantilism and details the competitive efforts of various East Coast ports to
                    stay alive. Even as the canals versus railroads debate flourished, 
                        Boston
                    , which lacked water connections inland, turned to railroads to hold its market share.
                    Some ports were misplaced, Vance writes, and only rail construction limited by geographical
                    restraints could solve the problems. Rail development followed in a steady progression from
                    intercity lines to regional railroads to subcontinental systems.
            Before railroads adopted the standard gauge of 4 feet, 8 1/2 inches, they used varying widths as a
                    means of protection. As the rail network expanded, however, those roads that used a nonstandard
                    gauge to keep traffic on their lines eventually realized that the same variation prevented incoming
                    interchange traffic from reaching them.
            The Pacific Railroad Survey that led to rail construction from ocean to ocean is discussed at length
                    with particular attention to projected routes, grades and curvature of each, and reasons for
                    choosing the ultimate location. Construction work is described in detail. Vance also speculates on
                    reasons why the 
                        United States
                     has never had a truly transcontinental railroad. He touches on land grants, which he
                    erroneously perceives as government giveaways when in reality the railroads have paid for the
                    privilege many times over by granting reduced government rates. In addition to directing settlement
                    by land grant construction, railroads influenced physical expansion of the country in such
                    annexations as the Gadsden Purchase in southern 
                        Arizona
                    .
            
            Vance also develops a theory of natural territory and monopoly in which the geography of competition
                    eventually substituted for the geography of terrain minimization. The book's final chapter
                    discusses Canadian rails in depth and describes how developing Asian markets have reversed the
                    normal traffic flow and extended the developmental phase.
            Once the reader cuts through the heavy vocabulary, he finds a fascinating collection of theories and
                    descriptions of America's rail development. Many clear, attractive, and excellently drawn
                    maps enhance the book and add to its understanding; but, unfortunately, they contain numerous errors
                    of chronology, geography, and nomenclature. On balance, however, the book is an important addition
                    to railroad literature.

               The Jacksonian Promise: America, 1815-1840. By Daniel Feller. (

                    Clothbound, $38.95; paper-bound, $13.95.)
            Daniel Feller has contributed a well-crafted addition to the interesting series, The
                        American Moment, edited by Stanley Kutler and now available in twenty volumes on periods
                    and topics of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In synthesis and interpretation
                    Feller's view of Jacksonian America is informative and attractively written. Clearly the
                    book will be a welcome resource for general readers as well as for professors and students.
            The key word in the title is "promise," which announces the author's
                    theme. Feller has probed the literature on the age of Jackson to consider many
                    perspectives—democratizing politics, reform movements, industrialization, presidential
                    leadership, and a number of others. He finds the current emphasis upon a market revolution, as
                    illustrated by Charles Sellers's recent publication, to be useful but too negative. Indeed
                    Feller argues that despite its merit Sellers's work represents a trend that itself must be
                    reexamined; so, after looking extensively into the evidence, he contends that too often scholars
                    have seen the Jacksonian years as a time of approaching disaster, whether political or moral. He
                    therefore calls for a retreat from historiographical presentism, of emphasizing what was tragic or
                    destructive in the offing. Instead, he depicts the years, 1815-1840, as an era of optimism, of
                    constructive change, in terms of those who were contemporaries of Old Hickory.
            An effective focus of the discussion is a description of the celebration of the jubilee year 1826,
                    the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration  of Independence.
                    The creativity, the enthusiasm associated with digging the Erie Canal, which had been completed the
                    previous year, reflected the temper and beliefs of the nation, Feller believes.
            Perhaps he is too generous about the role of Andrew Jackson himself. He sees the path of Jacksonian
                    individualism toward social and economic improvement to be superior to the American System of
                    governmental promotion of economic growth. A critic might find the Democrats' position
                    negative, too. It would have been helpful to the reader if the author had gone past 1840 a bit to
                    examine the duel in 1841—the decisive year for the declining Whig
                    party—between Henry Clay (the more active author of the American System than John Quincy
                    Adams) and the states' rights President John Tyler. But the author has the right to select
                    his own boundaries.
            In any case, this is an excellent examination of a significant topic.

               The Life and Legacy of Annie Oakley. By Glenda Riley. (
                        Norman
                    : University of 
                        Oklahoma
                     Press, 1994. Pp. xvii, 252. Illustrations, note on sources, index. $24.95.)
            Often confused with Calamity Jane, who merely donned buckskin to tell tales of her "daring
                    exploits," Annie Oakley was a highly skilled markswoman who delighted audiences with her
                    sharpshooting talents. Born in 1860, the fifth child of an 
                        Ohio
                     farm family, Oakley endured a girlhood marred by poverty, backbreak-ing labor, and,
                    possibly, sexual abuse. In a feminine reversal of a typically male success story, she rose to
                    material comfort and national prominence as a performer in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show.
                    Ironically, a child of the Old Northwest became a symbol of the Far West.
            In this intriguing biography Glenda Riley seeks to illuminate both the person and the legend, both
                    the myths surrounding Oakley and the reality of her life. Separating the two, as Riley shows, is far
                    from easy; in a fascinating concluding chapter on her subject's enduring legacy, she shows
                    how each successive era has remade Oakley in its own image. Riley's Oakley emerges as an
                    enigmatic, contradictory figure: a devoted wife but a shrewd businesswoman dedicated to her
                    sharpshooting career, a "feminist" but also a "lady" who took
                    pains to distance herself from the suffrage movement and the "new woman."
            One wishes, however, that Riley had explored these contradictions more fully, for in the end she
                    presents a strangely uncomplicated view of Oakley's life and image. One wonders, for
                    example, if  "feminist" adequately describes
                    Oakley, her opposition to woman suffrage notwithstanding. Riley stakes her claim on two related
                    arguments: that Oakley supported women's right to gainful employment, especially in the
                    performance arena, and that she encouraged women to bear arms. She offers little evidence for the
                    first assertion except to note that Oakley's example spawned numerous imitators (indeed,
                    Riley describes her interactions with other female performers as hardly congenial). In the final
                    analysis Oakley appears to have been less a supporter of any "movement" than an
                    entrepreneurial individualist dedicated to her own advancement. This does not diminish her
                    historical significance, but it calls for a more complex rendering of her personal politics.
                    Riley's second claim is more convincing: Oakley did encourage other women to take up arms
                    for exercise (although not necessarily for profit) and self-protection. In analyzing the import of
                    these actions, however, Riley needs to do more than assert that guns represented a masculine culture
                    (surely Oakley was not the only farmgirl to carry a rifle). A more thorough reconstruction of this
                    culture—inside and outside the arena—would better convey the significance of
                    the challenge that Oakley and her gun-toting sisters represented.
            Similarly, some historians will take exception to Riley's statement that Oakley's
                    public persona "represented a West of honesty, courage, hard work, and sensitivity toward
                    others" (p. xvi). Acts entitled "The Attack on the Settlers'
                    Cabin," "The Buffalo Hunt," and "Custer's Last
                    Fight"—typical fare at a Wild West show—communicated other, less
                    innocuous, messages to their audiences (p. 49). Despite her celebrated friendship with Sitting Bull,
                    Oakley participated—consciously or not—in performances that celebrated, at
                    least implicitly, dispossession and Anglo-American superiority.
            All of this is not to dismiss Riley's achievement; she has constructed a sensitive, engaging
                    portrait of a fascinating woman. The Life and Legacy of Annie Oakley tells a
                    previously neglected story that speaks to important issues in women's and western history,
                    but it leaves much territory unexplored.
