            <byline>By DOROTHY RIKER</byline>
            <p>Jonathan Jennings is not widely known although he was the first Governor of the state of Indiana,
                    served as territorial delegate to Congress, and later as a member of the national House of
                    Representatives, Coming to Indiana in 1807, when he was but twenty-three years old, he held high
                    public office for more than twenty years.</p>
            <p>The birthplace of Jennings is not definitely known but it was probably in Hunterdon County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName>. The year was 1784.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> That same year his father, who was a
                    physician, became a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church. Jonathan's mother, the daughter
                    of Samuel Kennedy, a Presbyterian minister at Basking Ridge, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName>, was well educated. Kennedy also practiced medicine. There were seven other children in
                    the family besides Jonathan, five boys and two girls. While Jonathan was still a boy the family
                    moved to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette County</region>

                    </placeName> where the father accepted a position as minister of the Dunlap's Creek Church.
                    Mrs. Jennings died very shortly before the family moved to their new home.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The family ties were very close and even though the different members became widely separated they
                    did not lose touch with each other. The bond between Jonathan and his sister Ann, who was next to
                    him in age, was an especially close one judging from the letters he wrote to her and her husband,

                    hope that she may be happy, with some advice which he must have garnered from his observations of
                    other married people since he was then unmarried himself. Being as applicable today as then it is
                    worth quoting in part: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>You as well as myself know that human nature is prone to err…. That the marriage
                            state frees no one from the bonds of nature…. Thus have I known those who after
                            marriage have lived years together, as happy as happy could be, afterward lived miserably
                            all their lives. Let me offer this one thing to you as being the most able to affect
                            it…. be sure the first [time] any coolness takes place, as there always does
                            sooner or later between man and wife, remove the cause instantly and instead of having bad
                            effects, it will tend rather to cement your affections.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            <p>Jonathan's love for his elder brother Ebenezer is shown under quite different circumstances.
                    Upon learning of the serious illness of his brother he wrote: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            susceptible.</p>
                        <p>Tell him a long farewell; bid a long, a sad &amp; last adieu for a Brother who holds him

            <p>Following his brother's death, Jonathan's regard for him was shown in a more
                    material way. After a few years, he took his orphaned nephew, whose mother had also died, and
                    brought him up in his own home and educated him.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These close ties of kinship also extended to the stepmother. A short time after the death of his
                    father we find him writing to his brother-in-law that "if an opportunity offers, it would
                    oblige me if you would pay ten dollars to our step-mother. I had not money to leave her for the
                    purpose of harvesting and I expect she will want before I can return."<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The father was very anxious that his sons should enjoy all the educational advantages possible.
                    Jonathan attended elementary school at home and then the grammar school at Cannonsburg, <placeName>

                    classmates there were William Wick and William Hendricks,<hi rend="sup">8</hi> both of whom later
                    became prominent in Indiana. After attending grammar school, Jonathan probably studied law in

                    1806 we find him in Steubenville where his brother Obadiah had established a law office. At the
                    close of that year he writes of having been "down the <placeName>

                    </placeName> almost all summer." It was probably then that he made his first visit to
                    Indiana territory. The question of where to locate was then uppermost in his mind. He thought for a
                    time that he might to <placeName>

                    settled community, and by the spring of 1807, we find him located in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which was then the capital and most important town in Indiana territory.</p>

            <p>Regardless of having been so successful in working his way thus far he was not content. His
                    adventuresome mind was continually conceiving new plans for gaining wealth. Within two or three
                    months time we find him talking of launching a mercantile enterprise whereby he would furnish cotton
                    material, whiskey, etc. to the merchants of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Brownsville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
               </placeName>, and
                    surrounding towns,<hi rend="sup">14</hi> or again, in the event of war with <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> he was determined to risk all he could get together and run a contraband cargo to the
                    neutral isles <hi rend="sup">15</hi> Another scheme that he had was a more natural one, and one well
                    known in any new territory, that of speculating on the sale of public lands. He tried to interest
                    the other members of his family in its possibilities so that they would advance him funds for the
                    purpose, promising to pay them a certain per cent of all profits gained.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> His
                    activities along this line turned out disastrously, however. After purchasing land at the public
                    sales, he became ill and unable to work during several months, and in order to raise money was
                    forced to sell the land at a great discount.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

                    was appointed clerk <hi rend="i">pro tem</hi> of the board of trustees to succeed General <placeName>

                    Henry Harrison, who had been president of the board, was received. On August 29 Jennings was elected
                    permanent clerk, and on September 12 Harrison was reëlected a member of the board and
                    also president. At the next meeting, held April 4, 1808, with Harrison in the chair, a committee was
                    appointed to inquire into the conduct of Jennings as clerk of the board of trustees.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The reply to this communication, written by "Sand and Rosin," probably Johnston and
                    Decker, shows that differences had developed among the University trustees over a motion to curtail
                    the use of the Commons by the French inhabitants.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> It was opposed by Johnston
                    and other members and was defeated. Although Johnston had apparently won his fight, he resigned and
                    drew up a statement of the proceedings of the board upon the subject, which he got Jennings, as
                    clerk <hi rend="i">protem,</hi> to certify. "Sand and Rosin" stated that there was
                    a political persecution of Jennings in the April 4 meeting of the board of trustees and that a
                    resolution was introduced and seconded by the anonymous author of the "Dedication"
                    to expel Jennings for providing the certification for the pamphlet. There is no record of this
                    resolution in the available minutes of the board. The action of the trustees was: "On
                    Motion, Ordered, that a Committee be appointed to inquire into the conduct of J. Jennings as Clerk
                    of the Board of Trustees, and report at meeting to be held on the last Saturday of June."
                    There is no record in the preserved minutes of a meeting held on the designated date or of a report
                    by this committee.</p>
            <p>In the meeting of May 21, 1808, John D. Hay was appointed clerk <hi rend="i">pro tem</hi> of the
                    board of trustees. Jennings' resignation as clerk was received and read, and Hay elected
                    permanent clerk, at the meeting on November 21, 1808. By this time Jennings had removed to <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>These incidents are of significance in view of the later hostility of Jennings to Harrison. Perhaps
                    the later location of the state seminary at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> may have resulted from this animosity. But the records, in so far as they are
                    available, disclose nothing definite about the relations of Harrison and Jennings on the board of
                    trustees. The inquiry into the conduct of Jennings as clerk seems to be based on his action in
                    certifying the pamphlet dealing with the proceedings of the board, but the information is so meager
                    that no definite statement can be made.</p>

                    </placeName> for a year and a half and sizing up the political situation, he saw that there was a
                    better chance for himself in the eastern part of the territory. Also, he believed that the capital

                    between Jennings and Nathaniel Ewing, his former chief in the land office, which probably took place
                    on the occasion of a visit of Jennings to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1809, Ewing said, "Look us up a candidate for Congress", to which
                    Jennings responded–"Why wouldn't I do?" After considering the
                    matter, Ewing believed that Jennings might have a fair chance of success if he was acceptable to the
                    voters of the eastern part of the territory.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here it will be well to get a brief glimpse of the political situation in Indiana in the spring of
                    1809. Congress had just passed a law separating <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> territory from Indiana, and had also given the people the power to elect the delegate
                    to Congress and the councillors who were to form the upper branch of the territorial Legislature.
                    The division of the territory had a significant effect on the slavery question which was then most
                    important. The Ordinance of 1787 contained the famous anti-slavery provision, but when Indiana
                    territory was organized in 1800 the sentiment of the people was favorable toward the peculiar
                    institution. Slaves were held in many parts of the territory, having been brought in by masters who
                    emigrated here from slave-holding states. Between 1800 and 1805 several petitions were presented to
                    Congress by the settlers asking for a repeal of the antislavery clause of the Ordinance, but
                    Congress paid no heed to them. After 1805 the people turned to the territorial government for aid in
                    bringing in slaves. The so-called "servant act" was passed which virtually
                    legalized slavery in Indiana territory. With the removal of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>

                    This, together with the growth of settlements in the eastern part of Indiana which were largely
                    composed of antislavery elements, brought the latter forces into the ascendancy for the first time.
                    When Ewing asked Jennings to look up a candidate for Congress from the eastern part of the
                    Territory, he meant an antislavery candidate.</p>

                    </placeName> and John Johnson. <placeName>

                    </placeName>, the friend of Governor Harrison, comprehended the importance of the rising antislavery
                    feeling and tried to get away from his former proslavery position. If elected he promised not to
                    attempt to introduce slavery unless instructed to do so by a decided majority of his
                        constituents.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> During the contest, Johnson was quiet on the slavery

                        <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s conciliatory attitude toward the antislavery forces gave their support to
                    Johnson.</p>
            <p>After talking with Ewing, Jennings interviewed the political leaders in Clark and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dearborn</region>
                    </placeName> counties. There was quite a proslavery element in the southern portion of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dearborn county</region>
                    </placeName>, but in the northern part and in <placeName>

                    </placeName> settlements, Here the antislavery advocates were strong and they were getting ready to
                    put a candidate in the field. After some consultations Jennings was accepted as the antislavery
                    candidate for Congress.</p>
            <p>Several stories of his campaign methods as contrasted with those of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
                    </placeName> have been handed down to us. During a log rolling on the farm of David Reese in
                            <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Dearborn County</region>, <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
               </placeName> came riding up on horseback and was invited to stop. He
                    dismounted and accepted the invitation to go to the house and wait for an opportunity to address the
                    men at quitting time. The next day Jennings came by and upon receiving a similar invitation,
                    replied, "Send a boy up with my horse, and I'll help roll." After the
                    work was finished for the day, Jennings not only talked politics but entered into the sports of the
                    occasion, always being careful to let the men defeat him.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> And so he continued

                    that the election was illegal and that Jennings' seat ought to be vacated. Contrary to
                    common procedure the House refused to accept the report and Jennings was permitted to remain.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> He had fully expected that another election would be necessary so that the

            <p>Jennings was reelected as territorial delegate in 1811, 1812, and 1814. In 1811 <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
                    </placeName> was again his opponent, but, in 1812 and 1814, Jennings defeated Waller Taylor and
                    Judge Elijah Sparks, respectively. During the time that he served as a delegate, Jennings took no
                    prominent part in the discussion of problems before the country, but tried to look after the
                    interests of his constituents as best he could. A large part of his work pertained to relief for
                    those who had bought land and were in danger of losing it because of inability to make payments
                    under the well known credit system provided in the Land Act of 1800. On a resolution to prolong the
                    time of payment for those who had purchased land before April, 1809, Jennings pointed out that the
                    state of things had cut off from the people the means whereby they had calculated to make payments,
                    and although the extension of payment was, in principle, objectionable, circumstances imperiously
                    called for it. He also favored having each quarter-section of land divided and the price reduced,
                    pointing out that more money would accrue under that system and that it would be paid with greater
                        certainty.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

            <p>Jennings looked after the protection of the territory from Indian raids by securing the passage of a
                    bill providing for the organization of four additional companies of Rangers. Provision was made for
                    allowing the citizens of the territory to volunteer for this service, with the assurance that they
                    would not be called upon to leave the territory thus exposing their own homes to 'Indian
                    depredations. The Indiana delegate was active in looking after the many details connected with the
                    pay of these Rangers as well as securing compensation for those who took part in the Battle of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>

            </p>
            <p>Jennings also presented several resolutions intended to diminish Harrison's appointive
                    power, contending that the Governor had built up a party headed by his friends and devoted to his
                    personal interests. Especially in the judicial department, where the Governor appointed the sheriff
                    and that official in turn the jury, was there chance for corruption. To remedy this a bill was
                    reported providing for the election of the sheriffs by the qualified voters and for an appeal from
                    the territorial courts to those of the federal government.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> His constituents
                    instructed him to present a petition complaining of the arbitrary conduct of Governor Harrison in
                    vetoing a bill for the removal of the capital from Vincenne.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> Jennings believed
                    that Harrison's policy of making small purchases of territory from the Indians in the
                    eastern part of the territory and very large ones in the western part was followed in order to get a
                    large population in that district and prevent the removal of the seat of government.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The subject of roads was very important in any new territory. As a delegate to Congress, Jennings
                    introduced resolutions looking toward the building of roads between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>

            <p>Jennings was evidently subject to periods of discouragement during which time he would give vent to
                    such remarks as these: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>In December, 1815, Jennings presented a petition from the territorial Legislature asking that
                    statehood be granted. The census taken that year had shown a population of over sixty-three
                    thousand, which was more than the Ordinance of 1787 required. The bill as reported by Jennings early
                    in January, 1816, designated the northern boundary of the proposed state to be a line running east
                    and west through the extreme soiithern tip of <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName>, while the final
                    act passed by Congress designated a line running east and west through a point ten miles north of
                    and paralell to one tangent of the extreme southern end of <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName>. At
                    just what stage of the passage this change was made or who was responsible for it is not definitely
                    known, but Jennings no doubt aided in securing this additional territory for Indiana.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> The Enabling Act was finally passed on April 11, 1816, over three months after it had
                    been introduced. It provided that an election of delegates to a constitutional convention should be
                    held on May 13. Jsnnings was elected a delegate from <placeName>

                    Congress was no doubt largely responsible for his receiving this honor. The delegates completed

            <p>Jennings and Thomas Posey were the candidates for governor. The latter had served as territorial
                    Governor since 1813, but was not especially popular. <placeName>

                    have aided him in his candidacy for the governorship of the state. Jennings had the advantage over
                    Posey because he had been before the public longer and was more of a politician. He continued his
                    usual method of campaigning, joining in the work of the men he stopped to see. As the pioneers
                    opposed electioneering, his activities had to be disguised as much as possible. When he dropped in
                    at a meeting, militia muster, or log rolling, he was always "on his way" to some
                    other place.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> He was elected governor by a large majority.</p>
            <p>Space will not permit more than a cursory glance at his activities while governor. His messages to
                    the General Assembly were well written. His first one begins as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            just and generous policy toward the general government and a due regard to the rights of its
                            members respectively, should invariably have their proper influence <hi rend="sup">40</hi>

            <p>Some of the measures set forth as advisable for the new government were: the establishment of a court
                    procedure that would make the securing of justice swift and certain; the organization of an
                    educational system extending from the common schools to a state university; the organization of a

            <p>The letters to his sister and brother-in-law are less frequent during this period. In one he made the

                    </placeName> to exercise the duties of Governor, his enemies took advantage of the opportunity to
                    claim that he had vacated his office by accepting the appointment. Christopher Harrison, the
                    lieutenant governor, believing or hoping that the office had been vacated, began to exercise the
                    duties of Governor. Meanwhile, Jennings refused to accept this view of the situation, and upon his
                    return to Corydon claimed the office. In defense of his action he said: "I acted from an
                    entire conviction of its propriety, and an anxious desire on my part to promote the welfare and
                    accomplish the wishes of the whole people of the state in assisting to add a large and fertile tract
                    of country to that which we already possess."<hi rend="sup">43</hi> After considerable
                    discussion in the Legislature, that body refused to institute impeachment proceedings against
                    Governor Jennings. He must have felt fully vindicated the next year when the people
                    reëlected him as governor by a large majority over his opponent Christopher Harrison.</p>

                    issue of state treasury notes was resorted to but these also depreciated. Jennings was severely
                    criticized for his failure to supervise the Bank and his refusal to instigate an investigation
                    earlier. Other states were having similar experiences at the same time due to the panic of 1819. The
                    blame must be placed more on the general ignorance of economic laws and the dishonesty of some of
                    the men in charge of the Bank rather than on the conduct of the governor. He suffered from the
                    effects as well as others. His salary of $1,000 in sound currency amounted to only
                    $600 in the depreciated currency. His expenses incurred while in office were more than
                    double his salary and involved him in debts from which he was never able to recover.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The constitution provided that the governor should not serve more than two terms. Shortly before his
                    second term was to expire, Jennings resigned to become a candidate for representative in Congress in
                    place of William Hendricks, who, in turn, became a candidate for Governor. Jennings'
                    enemies had handbills printed bearing a list of charges in regard to his conduct but he was able to
                    refute these in a satisfactory manner and win the election.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> He continued to be
                    reelected to this office from the second congressional district until 1830. Twice he was a candidate

            <p>During this period in Congress the problem of internal improvements was much discussed. In 1819
                    Congress appropriated $250,000 to complete the Cumberland or National Road, now known as
                    U.S. Road 40, to Wheeling, and pledged the two per cent land sales fund of Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Treasury. During the session of 1824-25, a bill was introduced providing for another
                    large appropriation to continue the road to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Zanesville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>. During the
                    course of the debate on the subject Jennings spoke many times. He did not consider it fair to the
                    states of Indiana and <placeName>

                    came to a vote on January 17, 1825, and was rejected. The following day, however, it was
                    reconsidered and adopted by a large majority.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another internal improvement project furthered by Jennings was the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and Erie Canal. He was able to get a bill passed reserving from sale a portion of the
                    public lands through which the canal would be built and granting a part of such lands for the cost
                    of construction of the canal. In one of his speeches made during the progress of the bill, Jennings
                    adverted to the opinion of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>

                    be open to steam boats all the year round.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 1825, when the election of president was thrown into the House of Representatives, Jennings voted
                    for Jackson although personally, according to one author, he favored Adam<hi rend="sup">50</hi>
                    Previous to the ballotting he wrote home asking that the votes for President in each and every
                    county in Indiana be forwarded to him.<hi rend="sup">51</hi> Both the popular and elector vote of
                    the state was for Jackson, and it is probable that Jennings used this information to determine what
                    his vote should be. As a member of Congress, he voted with Jackson's followers for the most
                    part. At home, however, he was not considered a strong enough Jackson man to be elected to the <placeName>

            <p>On several occasions Jennings expressed his disapproval of the methods being used in the passage of
                    bills. One instance concerned the investigation of land surveyors' expenses. Jennings
                    asserted that since most of those favoring the bill were doing so because they wanted the conduct of

                    character of this institution, but in the past some had been appointed to this duty who could not
                    even demonstrate a proposition in Euclid. The appointment of men ignorant of military tactics made
                    the whole matter a farce.<hi rend="sup">54</hi>

            <p>During the time Jennings was in Congress, his friends at home conferred one more honor upon him. On
                    October 7, 1823, he was elected Grand Master of the Masonic Lodge. He was not installed until the
                    annual meeting in 1824 when he was reelected for another year. He declined reelection in 1825.<hi rend="sup">55</hi>

            <p>Jennings who had become addicted to the use of liquor while in public life, was defeated for Congress
                    in 1830 by John Carr. The drinking habit which, although then common and not considered derogatory
                    to a man's character, had affected the health of Jennings to a degree that could not be
                    overlooked. His friends felt that only retirement to private life would save him from an early death
                    and they gave their support to his opponents, there being four other candidates. His habits had
                    become too firmly fixed, however, for him to discontinue them and his last years were saddened by
                    over indulgence in strong drink.</p>

                    very agreeable host. He was called from this retirement to perform one more public service, that of
                    commissioner to treat with the Potawattomi and Miami Indians in 1832. The story is told by a witness
                    that the Indians objected to treating with the other commissioners, Mark Crume and John W. Davis,

                    see legislation carried on more efficiently in state as well as in national government is well
                    illustrated by his statement made at this time, that "a State that affords <hi rend="i">not,</hi> charts of its o[w]n geograph[y] must legislate <hi rend="i">'as through</hi>

            <p>Although Jennings was brought up under Christian influences and two of his brothers entered the
                    ministry, he seems to have made no church connections in Indiana. However, it seems probable that
                    this was due more to neglect than to any hostility to the church and its teachings. In his letters
                    we find several references to religion which support this supposition. In one he set forth his
                    thoughts relative to the matter: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Jennings has been judged quite differently by different historians. Jacob P. Dunn, writing in 1905,
                    upholds him as the apostle of freedom, without whom Indiana might have become a slaveholding state.
                    He describes him as "a young <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Perhaps the truth lies somewhere between these two extremes. Jennings was no doubt sincere in his
                    desire to make Indiana a free state, but the antislavery forces were already in the ascendancy by
                    the time he was in a position to exert much influence. The territorial Legislature of 1810 repealed
                    the slave law that was on the statute boks and from then on the proslavery group fought a losing
                    battle. Jennings saw the opportunity of championing the antislavery, capital-moving, and
                    anti-Harrison forces and by so doing he received his first political offices. His pleasing
                    personality which won him many friends, together with his assiduous care in looking after the
                    interests of those whom he represented were probably the leading factors in keeping him in political
                    office for twenty-one years.</p>

            <p>William Henry Harrison arrived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> in January, 1801, to assume his duties as Governor of the vast district then known as
                    Indiana territory. The capital, a town founded about three-quarters of a century earlier, was a
                    place of much interest. There Frances Vigo, Father Gibault, Colonel George Rogers Clark and other
                    men of intelligence and courage had made history. During the Harrison régime, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> continued to be a center of activity. From this old French village, orders were
                    despatched over a wide area. Here conferences with Indians were held and treaties made. Legislators
                    and judges met here to adopt or frame laws and render decisions. The annals of the period contain
                    such names as William Clark, Henry Vanderburgh, John Griffin, John Gibson, John Badolette, Benjamin
                    Parke, and John Rice Jones.</p>
            <p>The people who lived in the capital of Indiana territory were not without interest in the means of
                    education. The first regular school in what is now Indiana was probably that conducted by Father
                    Rivet in 1793.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> A school system was of very slow growth and little was
                    accomplished in the territorial period. It was far easier to start and maintain libraries which for
                    years provided a road to a degree of education for many persons. A meeting was held at the William

                    </placeName> on July 20, 1806, from which came into being a circulating library which survived for
                    seventy-seven years. The present public library of <placeName>

            <p>The meeting arranged for August 2 was held at the appointed hour. The minutes show the following

                    second meeting, with Governor Harrison in the chair and Benjamin Parke acting as secretary. The
                    committee appointed at the first meeting to draw up a constitution made a report. The draft
                    presented was considered, amended and adopted. The Library Company was to sell one hundred shares at
                    five dollars each "payable in specie, or in such books" as the President and
                    directors should judge proper for admission and at such values as the President and directors should
                    determine. Each shareholder was to pay annually two dollars on each share held. Yearly meetings of
                    shareholders were provided for, and the officers were to consist of a President, seven Directors and
                    a Librarian. These were all to be chosen annually by the members of the Company. The shareholders
                    were empowered to increase the number of shares from time to time in response to increasing demand.</p>
            <p>The duties of the Librarian were outlined in Article 4 of the Constitution: <pb n="242" id="VAA4025-028-4-022"/>

            <p>The Library was to be open on each Wednesday and Saturday from 10:00 A.M. to 4:00 P.M. "for
                    the delivery and return of books to and from subscribers." Each share was to entitle a
                    subscriber to one book at a time. It was possible for the same person to own more than one share.
                    The minutes of August 2, 1806, contain the names of eighty-seven shareholders, six of whom owned two
                    shares each, while the remaining eighty-one owned a single share each. Smaller volumes could be held
                    for one week, and larger ones for two weeks. No shareholder was permitted to lend any book drawn
                    from the library "to be read out of his own house". For any book "so lent
                    out" a fine of twenty-five cents was to be collected.</p>
            <p>John Badollete was chosen President of the Company, and Benjamin Park Librarian. The President and
                    Directors were requested to seek an "act of Incorporation" from the Legislature of
                    the territory. At a meeting of the President and Directors on August 9, 1806, it was arranged that
                    share-holders should be notified that books in payment for shares would be received on August 23.
                    Presumably many of the subscribers paid not in coin but in something even rarer and more
                    acceptable—printed volumes.</p>
            <p>By March 24, 1809, there were two hundred forty-five volumes in the Library. The minutes of this date
                    show but forty-six shares owned by forty shareholders. Evidently many who started in the venture had
                    grown faint-hearted and fallen by the wayside. At this meeting, the Librarian was asked <pb n="243" id="VAA4025-028-4-023"/> to destroy "Calipoedia" (one volume) and
                    "Peggy Black" and "Wilmot Bond" (in five volumes), which were in
                    the opinion of the committee of "immoral tendency" and "unfit to be found
                    in the possession of an institution the object of which is to diffuse useful knowledge and correct
                    moral principles …."</p>
            <p>The Librarian of 1809 met with some of the same problems and criticism as librarians of today
                    experience. The years have brought a different point of view—the realization that a
                    public library is not a moral institution. People must be met as they really are with no thought of
                    reforming them. Library workers endeavor to cultivate the attributes of a liberal humanity.</p>
            <p>The location of the books in the earliest period—the place from which they were delivered
                    and to which they were returned on Wednesdays and Saturdays—is unknown. It is held that
                    the Library was housed in the Harrison Mansion in the period following the departure of Governor
                    Harrison to take command of troops in the War of 1812.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> His eldest son, John
                    Cleves Symmes Harrison, occupied the home for a time. There is some evidence that the Library was
                    located in a rear room of the building which served as Courthouse and Jail at one time.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> This building stood where the J. P. L. Weems home now stands at the corner of
                    Fourth and Buntin Streets.</p>
            <p>In the minutes of May 26, 1812, there is a statement to the effect that a committee was named by the
                    directors to in-quire as to the possibility of housing the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> Library in the University building. Evidently, since this was before the books were
                    kept in the Harrison Mansion, the efforts of the committee did not bear fruit.</p>
            <p>After the books were removed from the Harrison House, whenever that may have been, they were kept in
                    rented quarters for many years. In the minutes of a meeting of February, 1830, an interesting
                    resolution occurs: "Resolved that the <list type="footnotes">

                    "Academy building." In October, 1839, the Catholic College was
                    "authorized to take the cases containing the Books in the <placeName>

                    from this motion that the Library had been placed in the University for a short time. New cases were
                    now purchased and the library was installed in a room belonging to a Mr. Crosby which was rented for
                    "twelve dollars per annum". The cost for the shelving plus the charge for the
                    moving of books and furniture was $28.07. Two years later, the stockholders'
                    annual meeting was held at the library room in the Town Hall, which means that another shift had
                    been made. In 1856, the Library was still in the Town Hall, since the minutes show that
                    "stockholders assembled in the City Council Room over the Library."</p>

                    </placeName> Library Company was quite modern in regard to the transaction of business. In 1832,
                    "duplicate copies" of books and "all such works as it may be expedient by
                    the decay of the binding to sell" were disposed of at an auction, with a credit of one
                    year. The sale resulted in clearing the shelves of twenty-five volumes. The aggregate selling price
                    of the several works auctioned off was $16.15. A set of Hume's English History
                    (5 vols.) brought $5.08. It is to be hoped that it was possible to collect the entire
                    amount of the sale at the end of the year. Transportation charges constituted no small part of the
                    cost of books purchased by any western library before the time of railway connections with the East.
                    Books, like other commodities that could stand the cost of shipment over the mountains, were carried
                    westward by overload freight companies. Most of the books that were bought for the <placeName>

                    books was $7.90, or ten cents per pound.</p>
            <p>On April 10, 1828, the Librarian was ordered to purchase of Moses Tabbs twenty-nine volumes of the
                        <hi rend="i">Edinburg Review</hi> at a cost of $58.00. This was the first move in the

            <p>A portrait of Colonel Francis Vigo, painted by Augustine von Smith, was purchased in 1839. For this,
                    the Directors of the Library Company paid the artist $25.00. In addition he was presented
                    with one share of stock and freed from the obligation to pay the annual dues of $2.00.
                    The said portrait was "handsomely framed" and hung on the wall of the library
                    room. This seems to have been the initial step in committing the Library to the useful purpose of
                    preserving pictures.</p>

                    many ways on the southern part of the State. One way is in the strong old mansion houses they left
                    behind them which seem to prove they builded better than they knew.</p>
            <p>One of these, at least one hundred eight years old, is the John David Dufour house, about three miles
                    above <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>

                    wonders how it is, or ever was or will be, possible to get down the incline in icy weather and yet
                    it is, and always has been, done. To a native of <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName>, no doubt, the descent or ascent was regarded as a matter of course.</p>
            <p>The old building is peculiar in being just one room wide and four rooms and a hall long. There are
                    great, wide verandas across both the front and back. The view from the front is magnificent,
                    commanding a wide stretch of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> hills, and, when the trees are leafless, the sweep of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio River</region>
                    </placeName>. One enters a hall about seven and one-half feet wide which runs the width of the house
                    and opens on the rear porch. The hills form a steep and lovely background, rising abruptly almost
                    from the rear veranda itself. Those old Switzers must have been reminded of their native Alps in
                    such an environment and have felt quite at home.</p>
            <p>On the left of the hall is a great, light, airy living room of twenty-two feet with a great
                    wide-mouthed fireplace that contains a "built in" stove of the olden time, called
                    a <placeName>

                    flanking the mantel piece.</p>
            <p>On the right of the hall is a dining room twenty feet in length, many-windowed and cheerful with the
                    dazzling outlook on River and hills that all the rooms have. A large and attractive bedroom of
                    eighteen feet, connects with this, presenting a frontage for the entire house of
                    eíghty-five and one-half feet. A kitchen, large according to modern ideas but dwarfed by
                    the other big rooms, has been added in recent years, just off the dining room.</p>

            <p>All the wood work is of solid walnut, even the floors, and there is a lovely walnut wainscoting
                    anciently called chair-boarding, to protect the walls from tilted chairs. The walnut doors are
                    paneled in three divisions with wooden pegs instead of nails, and have the
                    lift-up-the-latch-and-walk-in fastenings, like those of Red Riding Hood's grandmother. The
                    floors have great, wide planks.</p>
            <p>A walnut stairway, by easy treads, leads to a square landing and then by a square turn, to the upper
                    hall of the same dimensions as the lower. The ceilings are low so the stair seems very short. On the
                    right is an immense room with only two small windows, high in the wall. One would have to stand on
                    chair or step ladder to see out. On the other side of the hall are two attic rooms, dark as
                    dungeons, an ideal place for the family ghosts to assemble.</p>
            <p>Every one of the down-stairs rooms had the wide-mouthed fire places of early times with stone
                    hearths, but all save one have been boarded up and papered over. Still to the discerning eye, the
                    original dimensions are easily traceable. The great built in presses are another characteristic of
                    pioneer architecture.</p>
            <p>An immense cellar extends under the entire house and is entered from the outside by the old
                    fashioned, slanting, double plank-doors. As the house stands high and is reached by many steps, the
                    cellar steps are accordingly few. The basement is divided into several compartments. In the outer
                    one alone, the writer counted at least thirteen oak tree trunks, with the bark on, which form the
                    supports of the upper floor.</p>
            <p>This interesting old building has been continuously in the possession of the John David Dufour branch
                    of the family since that sturdy old pioneer erected it, until within the last few years when it has
                    become the property, along with the farm on which it is situated, of Mr. and Mrs. Clair Andrews,
                    descendants of one of the best Scotch pioneer families.</p>
            <p>Another of the many interesting old houses of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Switzerland County</region>
                    </placeName> is the one built by David Blunk, some eighty years ago, out on the Doe Run Road. It is
                    now known as the John Todd Place as it has been the property of the Todds for more than sixty-five
                    years.</p>
            <p>The building stands at a crossroads on slightly rising ground. <pb n="249" id="VAA4025-028-4-029"/>
                    It is a two story frame with two entrances, each having a small colonial veranda, like the Harrison
                    Home at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. There are some ten rooms, exclusive of the separate kitchen, a small two-room frame
                    building into which one steps from the great triangular back porch. In one of the kitchen rooms,
                    there is a great wide-mouthed fireplace with the crane which was used for cooking in the early
                    times. Probably the kitchen was once just one big room.</p>
            <p>The distinctive feature of the house is the immense hall, which runs the entire length of the
                    building, of which there is duplicate up-stairs. The paper on the walls looks as if put there but
                    yesterday. As a matter of fact, however, it was hung there at least sixty-five years ago. The same
                    oilcloth covering that was on the upper hall floor when the Todds first bought the house, is still
                    there, in a remarkable state of preservation.</p>
            <p>On the left of the hall as one enters is the parlor, rather smaller than one expects after examining
                    the hallway. The article of furniture which immediately catches the eye is a large ancient mirror in
                    a square gilt frame and an old fashioned couch-sofa that belonged to the Blunk family. Back of this
                    room, though having no connection with it, is an oblong bed-room. A feature of the house is that
                    these rooms all open off the hall and with one or two exceptions, have no other communication with
                    each other. One can never forget that the hall is the central artery of the building. On the right
                    is a cheerful, many-windowed living-room. Back of it is a square dining-room and trailing out the
                    length of the place, another room off of it which is now used as a kitchen. The dining-room has a
                    windowed door, giving an entrance on the side. This is the longer side of the house.</p>
            <p>A broad stairway on the left side of the hall, well back from the parlor door, leads to the upper
                    hallway. Over the parlor and adjoining the bedroom is one great room, designated as the ballroom,
                    now sunk to the level of a store room. Old clocks, a spinning wheel and other intriguing relics of a
                    past time are massed together here. Running across the entire back of the upper story is a wide
                    veranda, now enclosed. Imagination can picture the beaux and hoop-skirted belles of the early
                    sixties coming out from the ball room between dances to get a breath of moonlighted air, and
                    perchance a flirtation. Across the hall is the guest-room containing a wonderful old <pb n="250" id="VAA4025-028-4-030"/> four-poster bed and some horse-hair chairs with rose patterned backs.
                    This, as mentioned, being the longer side of the house, stretches out in some three bedrooms, the
                    last directly connected by an enclosed back stairway with the lower floor. The doors are wide,
                    paneled and grained in very substantial pattern. This home is an example of the well-preserved
                    dwelling-houses of the more pretentious type built in the pre-Civil War period.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <head>The Political Career of Benjamin F. Shively</head>

            <p>With but few exceptions the men who have represented Indiana in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senate have been men of high character, and the state is justly proud of most of those
                    who have been elevated to membership in the highest law-making body in the land. Among the
                    individuals who have been so honored are: William Hendricks, Oliver H. Smith, James Whitcomb Henry
                    S. Lane, Thomas A. Hendricks, Daniel D. Pratt, Joseph E. McDonald, Daniel W. Voorhees, Benjamin
                    Harrison, David Turpie and Albert J. Beveridge. Worthy of a place beside these honored names is that
                    of Benjamin F. Shively who was twice elected but whose death occured when he had served but little
                    more than a year of his second term. Among his colleagues were such Senators as Augustus O. Bacon,
                    Ollie James, John Sharp Williams, Robert L. Taylor, Knute Nelson, Elihu Root, William S. Kenyon,
                    Theodore E. Burton and John Warwick Daniel, but Shively was the peer of them all.</p>
            <p>Benjamin <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> Shively was born on March 20, 1857, about a mile west of the little village of Osceola
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph County</region>
                    </placeName> and near the bank of the lordly <geogName>St. Joseph River</geogName>. His father was
                    Joel Shively, a minister of what was then called the Dunkard or Dunker church, but whose official
                    name is now the Church of the Brethren. His mother, before her marriage, was Elizabeth Penrod. The
                    Rev. Shively traveled over <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
                    </placeName> counties preaching to the people of his faith wherever he was called. He was one of the
                    best known among the Dunkard preachers of his day and generation. Both he and Mrs. Shively were held
                    in high esteem in the community in which the greater part of their lives was spent. There were eight
                    children in the Shively family, three of whom died at an early age. Those who grew up were Benjamin
                    F., Aaron,' Christian, Rebecca and Catherine. Of these, Christian is the only one now
                    living. Aaron died in the latter part of 1931. Neither of these two brothers ever married. Rebecca
                    who became Mrs. David S. Kindig died in 1918. She and the writer attended the old <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Elkhart county</region>
                    </placeName> Normal school at the same time.</p>
            <p>Benjamin spent the early years of his life in the same way as did most country boys of that day,
                    working on the farm <pb n="252" id="VAA4025-028-4-032"/> through the summer and attending the
                    district school in the winter. This he continued to do until he was sixteen years old, when he began
                    teaching. He taught for two terms at the Willow Creek school, two terms at the Pleasant Valley
                    school and a year at Osceola. Southwest of Osceola was the Rogers School, which was known as the
                    roughest school in that section of the country. The older boys prided themselves on their prowess in
                    being able to run out the teacher winter after winter. When Mr. Shively was teaching at Osceola, the
                    boys at the Rogers School again drove their teacher out. Then the township trustee called on Mr.
                    Shively and asked him to come over after his school closed and finish the term. He did so and had no
                    trouble.</p>
            <p>After he became of age, Mr. Shively spent several summers in the harvest fields of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>. When harvesting was over he remained to go with a threshing machine. His brother said
                    that Benjamin enjoyed "feeding" the machine, which, as all who ever observed
                    "feeders" know, was hard work. In the meantime, he learned the
                    plasterer's trade and did some work at stone masonry. He worked at those trades in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mishawaka</settlement>
                    </placeName> and also in Osceola, where he helped to build the schoolhouse which preceded the
                    present one in that village. In addition to all this he managed to attend an eight weeks'
                    term of the Northern Indiana Normal School at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Valparaiso</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Outside of what he gained there and in the country schools, he was self taught until
                    he entered a school of law.</p>
            <p>In Benjamin's boyhood days, the Rev. Joel Shively belonged to the Republican party and the
                    son naturally followed in his footsteps. After the panic of 1873, both father and son began to study
                    the money question and both came to the conclusion that there was something wrong with the
                    country's financial system. By 1876 both were ready to join the newly formed Greenback
                    party. In 1880 Benjamin began the publication of a Greenback paper in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Era.</hi> This he continued for several years. In 1882 he was tendered the Greenback
                    party's nomination for Congress in the thirteenth Congressional district. He accepted the
                    nomination and stumped the district, a part of the time walking from one speaking place to another
                    because he could not afford to pay carfare. The late Appellate Judge, E.A. Dausman, who was then a
                    Democrat and a member of the county central committee, <pb n="253" id="VAA4025-028-4-033"/> heard
                    Shively speak in Nappanee. In a letter to the writer of this sketch, who was then attending school
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Valparaiso</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he told of Shively's gift of oratory and of the logical, forceful address
                    which he had delivered. In closing his letter, Mr. Dausman said: "I wish he were a
                    Democrat".</p>
            <p>In 1884 Mr. Shively again received the Greenback nomination for Congress. For several years, he had
                    been making a thorough study of the tariff question and found that on that question he was in
                    harmony with the Democratic party. In the latter part of the campaign, a somewhat peculiar situation
                    arose. Major William Calkins, the congressman from the thirteenth district, having received the
                    Republican nomination for governor, several months later resigned his seat in Congress. This left a
                    vacancy to be filled for a part of a term. Both political parties had held their congressional
                    conventions some time before. The Democrats had nominated George Ford, a prominent lawyer of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, while the Republicans had chosen Henry G. Thayer of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName>, also an able and worthy man. Both parties were anxious to effect a coalition with the
                    Greenbackers on congressional candidates and each party made overtures to Mr. Shively. At that time
                    the prospects for succeess were more favorable for the Republicans than for the Democrats. No
                    Democrat had been elected in that district for twenty years. Had Mr. Shively been willing to
                    Sibordinate his political convictions to expediency, he would have accepted the Republican
                    nomination, but he was not that kind of a man. His studies of governmental questions had carried him
                    away from the party with which he had been identified in his early years and he was now in accord
                    with the Democratic party on all of the major issues. So, as any honest man would have done, he
                    turned his back on the offer which held forth the greater promise of success and accepted the one
                    which offered the lesser. Both the Democrats and the Greenbackers supported Mr. Ford for the long
                    term and Mr. Shively for the short term and both were elected.</p>
            <p>Mr. Shively entered Congress at the opening of the short session in the following December and served
                    until the fourth of March, 1886. He was the youngest member of that Congress, but by his courteous
                    demeanor and his manly bearing he won the respect of all those members with whom he came in contact.

                    </placeName>, he was given an opportunity to make a speech, which was listened to with close
                    attention and made a favorable impression even upon those members who had been serving for years.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the close of his brief term of service in Congress, he entered the Law School of the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Ann Arbor</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He had been devoting as much time as he could spare to the study of law while he was
                    editing his paper in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, so that in a year from the time he entered the law school he was able to graduate. He
                    at once entered upon the practice of the profession in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which thereafter was his permanent home.</p>
            <p>While he was in the law school, an incident occurred which showed his native modesty, a trait which
                    characterized him throughout his life. A letter came addressed to Hon. B. F. Shively, M. C. The head
                    of the law department brought the letter to his class and asked Mr. Shively if he had ever served in
                    Congress. Mr. Shively replied that he had. The professor told him that he was the first
                    ex-congressman who had ever attended that law school.</p>
            <p>Mr. Shively's short service in the national House had made such a favorable impression that
                    when the time came for the off-year congressional campaign, that of 1886, the Democrats of the
                    thirteenth district began to consider him favorably as a candidate. Congressman Ford had already let
                    it be known that he intended to retire at the end of a single term. The matter of a candidacy having
                    been suggested to him by some of the Democratic leaders in the district, after giving it due
                    consideration, Mr. Shively decided to let his name go before the convention, which was held at
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Warsaw</settlement>. <region type="county">Elkhart

               </placeName> had two candidates in the convention, Lewellyn Wanner, a lawyer, and
                    Laporte Heefner, a banker. Mr. Shively was an easy winner and at once entered upon an active
                    campaign. His splendid oratorical ability and his skillful handling of the issues which divided the
                    parties made a favorable impression wherever he spoke. In fact he was soon conceded to be one of the
                    best campaigners who had ever made his appearance in <list type="footnotes">

                            problem of regulating inter-state commerce, the other with the currency Question. It is a
                            remarkable fact that the first of these speeches was made on Thursday, December 4, 1884, the
                            fourth day of the session. Certainly Mr. Shivelr's maiden speech was not held back

                    and they were now determined to make the most strenuous efforts to wrest it from the Democrats. They
                    nominated Gen. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jasper</region>
                    </placeName> Packard, the strongest man they had in the district, and withal a superb orator. A
                    series of joint debates between the two candidates was arranged. The discussions were to be held in
                    all of the county seats in the district—<placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">South

                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName>. The debates attracted immense audiences of enthusiastic partisans, usually about
                    equally divided between the two parties. The discussions were free from personalities and the
                    candidates treated each other with becoming courtesy on all occasions. Each one put forth his best
                    efforts in behalf of the cause which he had espoused and the great numbers who heard them enjoyed a
                    splendid intellectual treat. Before the debates were concluded it was quite generally conceded that
                    the young, intellectual giant from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> was getting the better of the seasoned campaigner who had been through many political
                    battles. They traveled together and after the speeches and while waiting for trains, surrounded by
                    their followers, they told stories and cracked jokes, thus passing the time in a way that was
                    enjoyable to all. Both candidates canvassed the district thoroughly having speaking' dates
                    up to the night before the election. When the votes were counted, Shively was found to be elected by
                    majority of about 1,000, although the Republicans had carried the district for their state ticket
                    and had elected their county officers in most of the counties in the district.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>When the time came for the campaign of 1888, no candidate offered himself for the Democratic
                    nomination in opposition to Shively. The Democratic convention was held in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
                    </placeName> and he was nominated by acclamation. That year the Republicans adopted a different line
                    of strategy from that of two years before and played for the Catholic vote by nominating Col.
                    William Hopes, a professor in the Law Department of Notre Dame University, a man of high character
                    and exceptional ability.</p>

                        20,971 votes and Thayer (Rep.), 18,782. At this time Shively, the candidate for the short term,
                        backed by Democrats and Greenbackers, received 20,964 to 18,786 for his opponent

            <p>From the time of his entrancer into politics, Mr. Shively favored a full, free and frank discussion
                    of all public questions and particularly of the issues which divided the parties in any canvass. He
                    also believed that the fair way to put the issues before the voters was to have the opposing
                    candidates appear together as often as convenient, so that each one could present his case to people
                    of all parties. He and Gen. Packard had done this in 1886, and believing in this method of
                    campaigning, he addressed a letter to Col. Hoynes soon after the latter was nominated in which he
                    said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Believing that you agree with me as to the propriety and desirability of a full, free and
                            thorough investigation of the issues involved in the present campaign, I very respectfully
                            invite you to engage with me in a series of joint discussions before the voters of the
                            thirteenth congressional district, the number, the dates and places of such meetings to be
                            arranged by our respective committees.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Shively waited two weeks for a reply and not receiving one he gave a copy of the letter to the
                    press. Col. Hoynes came back with a public letter over a half-column in length in which he chided
                    Mr. Shively for not waiting longer before publishing his letter, or, in the words of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Weekly News,</hi> gave Mr. Shively a "curtain lecture" for not so
                    doing. The Colonel indulged in numerous platitudes about alleged protection to American labor,
                    caring for the country's soldiers and various other matters which he claimed demanded the
                    attention of the people. He accepted Mr. Shively's challenge with apparent enthusiasm,
                    saying that he would be only too glad to appear on the same platform before the voters of the
                    district when each one could have ample opportunity to present his cause. When the time came for the
                    two committees to arrange speaking dates and places, the Republican Committee refused to enter into
                    any arrangement of that kind. Just what excuse they made is no longer remembered. The Democrats
                    taunted their opponents throughout the campaign, declaring that they were afraid to have their
                    candidate meet the popular, young Representative, who, in his brief term of service had made a
                    splendid record and whose oratorical ability had proved more than a match for Gen. Packard two years
                    before. Each candidate conducted his campaign alone, each of them making a vigorous canvass and
                    speaking day and night for nearly two months.</p>
            <p>The year 1888 was a disastrous one for the Democrats in Indiana.</p>
            <pb n="257" id="VAA4025-028-4-037"/>
            <p>From the beginning to the end of the campaign they were at a great disadvantage. Two years before
                    there had been an exceedingly bitter contest in the Legislature over the election of a <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senator. Benjamin Harrison was nearing the end of his term and was a candidate for
                    reelection. In the Legislature, the strength of the two parties on joint ballot was so nearly the
                    same that each claimed a majority on joint ballot. Each resorted to questionable means to gain the
                    ascendancy. After a protracted struggle, General Harrison was defeated, being succeeded by David
                        Turpie.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Then the Republicans raised the cry of fraud which they kept up for
                    two years, until the end of the 1888 presidential campaign. If there was fraud, both parties were
                    probably equally guilty, but the charge served its purpose in the campaign, which was the thing
                    desired. Besides this, Republicans had another advantage. General Harrison was nominated for
                    President, and they could appeal to state pride as a strong reason for his support. The result was
                    that Indiana was carried by Republicans for both their national and state tickets. They also elected
                    their local tickets in most of the counties. The thirteenth Congressional district went for Harrison
                    and the State Republican ticket by substantial majorities. The first reports had Congressman Shively
                    defeated, but when the official returns came in, it was found that he had run ahead of his ticket in
                    most of the counties in the district and that he actually had a majority of something over 300.
                    Although this was only a third of his majority of two years before, in view of the general
                    Republican success, it was a great and unusual triumph.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

                            first fifteen ballots, four members of the House voted for Jason H. Allen. Three of these
                            Prior Gates, Wesley Glover and Robert L. Mackey were Republicans. The fourth F. J. S.
                            Robinson was a Greenback-Labor man who had been endorsed by Democrats. The situation was
                            such that by voting for Turpie. Robinson could at any time make him <placeName>

                    pleasing speaker, but he was known to be far inferior to his competitor. He made many speeches but
                    the fact that he bore the name of a disappointed office seeker proved a handicap. His speeches
                    entertained but carried little weight. Mr. Shively again made a thorough canvas of the district
                    speaking in every city and every town. His meetings attracted large audiences from people of both
                    political parties. He discussed the issues of the campaign in a straightforward way, giving an
                    account of his stewardship in the popular branch of Congress. That his constituents were well
                    satisfied with his record was in evidence when the election returns came in, for this time he
                    received a majority of 2,701, which was much larger than had ever been given to any candidate of
                    either party in the district up to that time. He continued as before giving the best service
                    possible to the people of his district as well as to the state and nation. Upon the opening of
                    Congress, there was a spirited contest for the speakership. There were three Democratic candidates:
                    Charles F. Crisp, of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>; Roger Q. Mills, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>; and William M. Springer, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. All were worthy men and any one of them could have filled the office of Speaker very
                    acceptably. Mr. Shively believed that Judge Crisp was better qualified than either of the others and
                    identified himself with the supporters of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> statesman, who was finally elected.</p>
            <p>Having shown himself to be one of the best informed members of the house on economic questions, Mr.
                    Shively was given a place on the Ways and Means Committee, of which William L. Wilson of West <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> was chairman. He helped to frame the Wilson tariff bill. This measure was far different
                    from that which finally emerged from the Senate, and which, in the main, the House was compelled to
                    accept. The bill, known ever since as the Wilson-Gorman Act, was permitted to become a law without
                    the signature of President Cleveland. The original bill was a revenue measure and was far more
                    equitable than that which replaced it. Besides serving on the Ways and Means Committee, Shively was
                    a member of several other committees and was one of the busiest men in the fiftieth Congress.</p>
            <p>Although his influence was steadily rising, he decided that he ought at this time to return to the
                    practice of law to accumulate <pb n="259" id="VAA4025-028-4-039"/> a little property for himself
                    which he could not do should he continue indefinitely in public life. Early in 1892 he wrote a
                    letter to the district chairman saying that he would not be a candidate for re-election. He received
                    many letters from his constituents begging him to reconsider his declination, but he declared that
                    his decision had been made after careful consideration and that it must be accepted as final. There
                    was no question as to his re-election, had he become a candidate for that was a Democratic year and
                    his Democratic successor on the ticket, although a much less popular man than he, was elected by a
                    substantial majority,<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

            <p>While he was serving his second full term in congress, Mr. Shively was united in marriage with Miss

            <p>Although he held no office after 1893 for sixteen years, Mr. Shively's services were in
                    demand in every campaign and he never failed to respond at the call of his party. Each campaign year
                    he was on the stump for at least six weeks and his meetings were always attended by as large crowds
                    as when he was serving in Congress. In 1896 in response to demands from the bi-metallist wing of his
                    party, he became a candidate for the nomination for governor. There was a bitter contest over the
                    platform between the bi-metallists and the gold standard advocates in the convention but the
                    bi-metallists won by a large majority. After that was decided, Mr. Shively was easily nominated. He
                    made one of his characteristically vigorous campaigns, speaking in every part of the state. In this
                    campaign he was at a decided disadvantage. His opponent, James A. Mount, was a prominent <placeName>

                    at institutes in every county in the state and in many counties several times. He was a very

                    was associated with him occasionally in farmers' institute work, found him a very agreeable
                    co-worker and always had a high regard for him. Mr. Mount had been anxious for years to win the

                    close personal friendships which he made were not confined to members of his own political party.
                    When he came to make his campaign for governor these friendships were a great asset to him. The
                    writer would probably have voted for him had it not been for his close personal friendship for
                    Shively. That and the knowledge of Shively's eminent fitness for the office precluded any
                    such thing. The two candidates did not meet in joint debate and it was well for Mount that they did
                    not. While he was a pleasing speaker, he would have been no match for Shively, either intellectually
                    or as an orator. After one of the hardest fought campaigns since the civil war, Mr. Shively met the
                    first defeat of his life.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Although beaten, he was not in the least cast down
                    and those who met him on the day after the election would not have known from his demeanor that he
                    had not been elected. He again gave his attention to his law practice, as he had done since his
                    retirement from congress. His only diversion besides an occasional speaking date was his study of
                    great governmental problems of which he never ceased to be fond.</p>
            <p>He could have had the gubernatorial nomination again in 1900, had he consented to be a candidate, but
                    long before the convention he let it be known that he did not want to make another race. In the same
                    year, he could have had the nomination for vice-president at the <placeName>

                    wonted vigor, however, and made many speeches. In January, 1903, the Democratic caucus in the
                    Legislature gave him the nomination for <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senator and he received the complimentary vote of his party for that office. All

                    1906 when his party once more demanded that he make the race, he finally yielded. His opponent was
                    Abram L. Brick who had been serving in the National House since 1899. He had carried the thirteenth
                    district two years before by 7,000 majority. Mr. Shively made one of his old time aggressive
                    campaigns and, while he failed of election, he cut down the majority to about two hundred.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>

            <p>As the time for the opening of the legislative session drew near, the Democrats of Northern Indiana
                    became active in Mr. Shively's behalf. The people of his home city, regardless of party,
                    became enthusiastic in his support. The <placeName>

                    Stoll set forth the reasons why Mr. Shively was not only the most available of the candidates who
                    had been proposed for the office but the best qualified among them all to render the kind of service
                    that was needed in the Senate at that particular time. One of these editorials of 1908 so well

                                    proving the innate honesty of public men come out. A nephew of Mr. Shivley of

                                    leader: A wealthy manufacturer of northern Indiana desired to make the race for
                                    Governor on the Democratic ticket in 1908. Knowing the influence of Mr. Shivley,
                                    this affluent gentleman sent an emissary to him with $10,000. To receive
                                    this tidy sum, it was only necessary for Mr. Shivley to agree to go out and line-up
                                    delegates to the state Democratic convention who would support the aspiring
                                    manufacturer. The money was scorned and the emissary returned to the man who had
                                    sent him forth to report that Mr. Shivley had been thoroughly alienated by the

                            re-elected from <placeName>
                                <country reg="cou">Colorado</country>
                            </placeName> and Senator Newlands from Nevada. The only gain by Democrats will be the new
                            senator of whom, thanks to Governor Hanly, they are assured in Indiana. It is due to the
                            party in the nation; nay, more, it is due to the interests of the country, that the Indiana
                            Democracy furnish the best material it possesses. Senator Teller is an old man; his
                            re-election will be rather a compliment to round out his career than a commission to do
                            effective work for the country. Senator Newlands' connection with large corporate
                            combines is so close and intimate that he can not be relied upon to uphold the interests of
                            the people against the powerful forces arrayed in selfish opposition. Upon the new senator
                            from Indiana, then, will devolve the burden of the championship of Democratic principles on
                            the part of the great northern portion of the country.</p>
                        <p>This championship will be no easy task. The very first session of the next
                            congress—the one promised in the spring—will be the most important
                            held for years. The revision of the tariff in one way or another affects every home in the
                            land. That revision, while in equitable adjustments it may retain a few of the present rates
                            and even possibly increase some minor schedules, must be essentially downward, if it is to
                            relieve the great mass of the people from the heavy burdens imposed, whose benefits have
                            gone to the enriching of a favored few. Not only this, but the corruption, extravagance, and
                            monopolistic tendencies which are debauching both public and private life, if not bred by
                            these inequitable provisions, have at least been nourished by them.</p>
                        <p>Nor are the favored interests going to surrender their privilege without a struggle. It is
                            not in human nature that they should. The hearings already held at <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                            </placeName> are proof that, like the daughters of the horse leech, tariff-fed monopolists
                            are never satisfied. They are all protesting against reduction, and some have even the
                            effrontery to ask for higher rates. There will be a powerful lobby present at <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                            </placeName> to combat, by every argument known to the craft, any change that will diminish
                            the exorbitant profits that are now extorted from the consumer.</p>
                        <p>To meet these forces strong men are needed—men of physical and mental vigor,
                            equipped with a knowledge of affairs and familiar with parliamentary practice in addition to
                            being devoted to the public interests. In the protracted debates of the senate physical
                            endurance frequently counts as well as intellectual alertness and mental force and acumen.
                            Dignified bearing and breadth of mind that will command respect for opinions are also
                            essential qualifications. Some such champions are already in the senate, but they should be
                            reinforced strongly in the Democratic senator from Indiana.</p>
                        <p>In all these requisites Hon. Benjamin F. Shively easily qualifies. He is in the prime of
                            life, classing in age with Colonel Bryan, President Roosevelt and President-elect Taft, and
                            like them blessed with physical health and strength and intellectual vigor. He has had
                            congressional experience, and not only acquired familiarity with parliamentary practice, <pb n="263" id="VAA4025-028-4-043"/> but proved himself a deep student of public affairs
                            with broad and comprehensive views of statesmanship. During the speakership of Charles F.
                            Crisp he was a member of the ways and means committee, and therein associated with William
                            Jennings Bryan in a careful consideration of the economic questions involved in the
                            imposition of tariff duties. He is a logical thinker and a fluent, forceful speaker. His
                            integrity of purpose is firmly established, and his devotion to the public interests has
                            been conspicuously demonstrated during seven years of continuous congressional service. He
                            is a loyal party man, and while not descending to the tricks of the machine politician, he
                            has steadfastly advocated and advanced Democratic principles and aided in an educative
                            upbuilding of Democratic doctrines. In the tariff struggle that is imminent he would be
                            found a doughty champion—vigilant, aggressive, untiring, resolute and
                            resourceful. He would prove a power to the state and party and a benefit to the entire
                            country. That is why Benjamin F. Shively is needed as the one new Democratic senator from
                            the North.</p>

            <p>The contest in the Legislature was a spirited one, all of the candidates having ardent supporters. In
                    the Democratic caucus. Mr. Shively received the solid vote of the members from his own congressional
                    district, as well as nearly all from several of the other northern districts, besides many votes
                    from other sections of the state. He was also the second choice of enough members to give him the
                    nomination when they saw that their own candidates could not win. When the two branches of the
                    Legislature met in joint session, he received the solid vote of his party and was declared duly
                    elected, to the great gratification of his friends throughout the state. He was sworn into office on
                    March 4, 1909, and entered upon what was to be a brilliant but comparatively short senatorial
                    career. As Mr. Stoll had predicted, Senator Shively at once became a leader of the group whose
                    assumed object was to fight the forces of greed and monopoly. He led because his talents qualified
                    him for leadership, because he possessed those qualities which inspired confidence in him on the
                    part of his fellow senators and because he was true to those who are styled the common people. The
                    fact that he was the only Democratic Senator from the Middle West increased his opportunities for
                    leadership.</p>
            <p>During the sixteen years from the time when he left the lower House of Congress, he had been steadily
                    growing and by the time he entered the Senate he was easily recognized as one of the strong men of
                    that body. His first four years of service were during the Taft Administration, when there was <pb n="264" id="VAA4025-028-4-044"/> little opportunity for constructive work, as he was of the
                    opposition party. However he showed his breadth of mind by co-operating with the majority on all
                    measures which he considered meritorious. Whenever he opposed the acts of the Administration, he was
                    always able to give valid reasons there-for. When his party came into power under Woodrow Wilson,
                    Senator Shively was one of the men upon whom the new Administration leaned and from whom the
                    President often sought counsel concerning the grave questions which confronted the government. He
                    was the ranking member of the Committee on Foreign Relations, and, during the long illness of its
                    chairman, served as acting chairman. There were many perplexing international problems to be solved
                    at that time and his advice was often asked by both the President and the Secretary of State. He
                    also served on the Finance Committee, the most powerful committee in the Senate and here his long
                    study of important financial questions proved invaluable not only to the committee and the
                    Administration but to the nation as well. He was chairman of the Committee on Pensions, one of the
                    busiest and hardest-worked committees of either house.</p>
            <p>In 1914 he was re-elected to the senate, this time by popular vote. During his first term an
                    amendment to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> constitution was adopted, providing for the election of Senators by direct vote of the
                    people. His election to the Senate by the people, he considered the proudest event of his political
                        career.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> He lived to fill out only a part of his second term in the Senate,

            <p>Although he was one of the most accomplished orators in the entire Congress one whose speeches always
                    commanded the attention of his colleagues, he seldom spoke after he entered the Senate. He devoted
                    him time to his committee assignments, where all of the important work is done. Had certain other
                    Senators been in a position to do the important work that was done by Shively, it would have been
                    done at the sound of a trumpet, but the modest Senator from Indiana preferred to let the records
                    speak for him, and those records today are a monument to his great ability, his untiring industry
                    and his unswerving devotion to his country's service.</p>
            <p>Just before the end of his first full term in the House of Representatives, Mr. Shively told the

                    making changes in appointive offices. He had to be convinced that a change was necessary before he
                    would remove a man from office. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
                    </placeName> Postmaster was entirely capable, was an affable man and no fault could be found with
                    the conduct of the office. But he had one failing which was more common in those days than now: he
                    would occasionally become intoxicated. This was the only charge that could be preferred agoinst him.
                    At the urgent request of his party friends in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Congressman Shively took the matter up with the President. For several months, he was
                    unable to secure any results. Finally he determined to end the matter in one way or another. He
                    called on the President and said to him: "Mr. President, I am calling on you for the last
                    time about the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
                    </placeName> postoffice affair. I now wash my hands of any further connection with it. If you refuse
                    longer to make a change, I shall tell the people of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
                    </placeName> that you prefer a drunken Republican to a sober Democrat." It was only a short
                    time until <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
                    </placeName> had a Democratic postmaster, for the first time in twenty-seven years.</p>
            <p>All through his congressional career, Mr. Shively gave a great deal of attention to the interests of
                    the old soldiers in the matter of pensions. There were many old soldiers in his congressional
                    district and they all learned in time that he was their friend. In the vicinity of Osceola where he
                    grew up there were several Civil War veterans who were stalwart Republicans and who worked hard
                    against Shively in his first campaign for a seat in Congress. One of them in particular had been
                    exceedingly bitter against him and lost no opportunity to attack him, not only in campaigns but
                    after he was elected. He was very anxious to secure a pension and deserved one, but had been unable
                    to have any attention given to his claims. One day a friend told him to speak to his congressman
                    about it. He replied, "What speak to Shively about it? Why I have been fighting him ever
                    since he ran for Congress the first time and he wouldn't do any thing for me." His
                    friend assured him that this would not make any difference, but he was not convinced. <pb n="266" id="VAA4025-028-4-046"/> Finally after the lapse of considerable time and after repeated urging,
                    he mustered up courage to speak to Mr. Shively when the two chanced to meet in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Mr. Shively replied: "Certainly I will take up your case as soon as I get
                    back to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>." Upon investigation it was learned that the man deserved a pension and it was
                    not long until the matter was arranged. From that time on that man was one of Shively's
                    staunchest supporters instead of one of his bitterest enemies. This encouraged others in the
                    neighborhood to make applications and in the course of time all of those who deserved pensions were
                    receiving them. They learned that while Mr. Shively was a strong partisan and believed with his
                    whole heart in the principles of his party, he was big enough and broad enough not to let
                    partisanship interfere with his official duties. The greater number of those veterans became
                    supporters of Mr. Shively, not through any persuasion on his part, but because they learned to know
                    him for what he really was and realized that they had misjudged him before.</p>
            <p>No man ever was more loyal to his friends or more steadfast in his friendships than Senator Shively.
                    He never deserted a friend who was under fire when he felt the fire was unjust. Sometimes his
                    loyalty brought upon him undeserved criticism, but that did not swerve him in the least. He knew
                    that the penalty of public life was ingratitude and unfair criticism and no one bore it more
                    complacently than he. When political associates sought his assistance to secure preferment, he gave
                    to each one kindly and considerate attention. if one sought to improve his own chances by repeating
                    rumors that reflected on the other candidates, that man destroyed whatever chance he might have had
                    to secure the place. Dealing with others on a high plane of justice and fairness, he held in supreme
                    contempt those who sought to take unfair advantage. He was exceedingly careful about making a
                    promise; but when he had made it he never failed to fulfil it if it were possible to do so.</p>
            <p>As an orator, Senator Shively ranked with the best among Indiana's statesmen. He could
                    easily hold an audience for two hours and occasionally he spoke for three hours. In his eloquence
                    and his command of language he was almost equal to Dan Voorhees whom many conceded to be the
                    greatest of Indiana's orators. He was never known to indulge in the <pb n="267" id="VAA4025-028-4-047"/> least abuse toward his political foes, even though they heaped all
                    kinds of abuse upon him. Seldom did he make use of an anecdote or illustration. His political
                    speeches consisted of facts and solid reasoning from beginning to end. His services were in frequent
                    demand for addresses on all sorts of occasions, particularly at old settlers meetings and fraternal
                    gatherings. Even at those places his speeches were always of a serious character. He left it to
                    others to amuse and entertain. A Hoosier by birth, but of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> ancestry, he was always a prime favorite at the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> picnics which were held for so many years on the "Island" in the city
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
                    </placeName>. No less a favorite was he at the gatherings of the several orders to which he
                    belonged. One of the finest short addresses the writer ever heard him make was an impromptu speech
                    at a banquet of the Knights of Pythias order in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>After he entered the Senate, Shively became so engrossed with his committee work that he had little
                    time to make speeches. At the presentation and unveiling of the statue of General Lew Wallace in
                    Statuary Hall at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he delivered a brief address which is a fair sample of his style of oratory and also
                    shows his trend of thought in regard to one field of government—that of diplomacy. A part
                    of the address is here reproduced: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The history of the foreign relations of the <placeName>
                                <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                            </placeName> is interesting and instructive. The genesis of these relations roots back into
                            a period of revolution. The generation of men who established the new Republic had written
                            interrogation points over against many dogmas, old pretensions, old institutions, and
                            required them to show their right to survive. Diplomacy had been in the main, a system of
                            war in which cunning, craft, deceit, intrigue, chichane were the weapons. He was esteemed
                            the superior diplomat who was most proficient in the art of deceiving and overreaching his
                            adversary.</p>
                        <p>Like many other idols of misused power, this system passed under the rod of the general
                            inquisition. It was rejected, cast down, and melted away in the flame of the revolution. One
                            of the great founders of the Republic said, "True government is the art of being
                            honest." None knew better than he that the essential functions of good government
                            are few and simple, and that the greatest duty confronting the best government is resistance
                            to that selfish greed and ambition which forever lurk in the shadows of its power and seek
                            to pervert its functions to private and unworthy ends. Nor none knew better than he that the
                            same principles of conduct that make for good neighborhood among individuals make for peace,
                            order, mutual confidence, and good will among nations.</p>

                        <p>Under the Administration of President Washington, Thomas Jefferson, as Secretary of State,
                            promptly discarded the petty artifices and little expedients then current in diplomacy.
                            Openness, sincerity, frankness, candor, and good faith were made the characteristics of our
                            foreign policy. The initial lines of that policy were cast on a plane higher than ever had
                            been reached before in the history of nations. It was a policy becoming a country which had
                            withdrawn sovereignty from kings and reposed it in the bosom of a free people. Afterwards,
                            as President, Jefferson summarized the whole doctrine in the familiar words,
                            "Peace, commerce and honest friendship with all nations, entangling alliances with
                            none." Such was the new foreign policy and our diplomacy under it. In this, as in
                            many other things, the excellence of the work of the fathers like that of the sculptor,
                            appears quite as much in what was chiseled away as in what remains.</p>
                        <p>This policy admits no double standard of diplomacy. It allows no accents of trucelent menace
                            toward the weak and helpless, nor whispering sycophancy toward the great and powerful. Its
                            simplicity, impartiality, and justice make its dignity and its strength. The standard thus
                            erected at the beginning, as a rule has been well maintained. Departures, if such there have
                            been, have only served to mark how easy the unwholesome descent, and to admonish to a speedy
                            return into the whiter light of a noble and entirely practical ideal.</p>
                        <p>Time will not permit a call of the roll of the great Americans whose shining talents and
                            rugged worth have adorned the diplomatic service of their country. Suffice it to say that in
                            that company of rare spirits, and well in the front rank, appears the stately form of LEW

                    </placeName> people, like those in almost every other Hoosier community, each year for several
                    decades have seen the Grand Army of the Republic Adjutant scratch name after name from records of
                    members, and write memorials for stone monuments. But not until 1932 have they seen the ranks of men
                    who fought in the Civil War dwindle fifty per cent within a few months. Each day during the past

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

            <p>Because people want to pay tribute to these men of '61 and because they realize the value of
                    stories on the tips of tongues of gray-haired men, they are eager to hear tales of the Civil War
                    told by those who took part in it. The soldiers are as anxious to relate happenings of the struggle
                    as young people and older folk are glad to listen. <placeName>

            <p>The "old" soldiers, like soldiers of other wars, are less sentimental about the

                    patience with writers who have turned the war into an affair of moonlight and romance. Their
                    memories do include some experiences of the war which are interesting, humorous, and historically

                    Circle members when he made his raid into the North. "Morgan was an active
                    Knight," the 86-year old veteran relates, "and he had counted on considerably more

                            and visiting with them in their homes." (This and the succeeding footnotes were

                    disgusted with the way the war was dragging out. That, I believe, accounts for many Circle members
                    refusing to cooperate with Morgan."</p>
            <p>Born in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Mr. Weeden was enrolled in the Knights of the Golden Circle when only 14 years old.
                    Although the original purpose of the Circle, according to this member, when organized in the
                    50's was to build an empire of people of the southern part of the <placeName>
                  <country reg="-us">United States</country>, <country reg="cu">Cuba</country>
               </placeName>, a part of
                    Mexico and Central America, with a monopoly of the rice, tobacco, cotton and sugar markets, the aim
                    fizzled. During the early years of the Civil War, the organization in the north became pro-southern,
                    approving secession, discouraging northerners from joining the Union army, and assisting
                    "Rebels" in escaping from northern captors.</p>
            <p>Concerning the order, Mr. Weeden tells the following: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The members did more talking than acting. The oath was the most binding I have ever taken.
                            There were grips, signs, pass-words, and the vow that if a man ever divulged any secret of
                            the group, his body should be cut in four pieces, one to be cast to the North, one to the
                            South, one to the East, and one to the West. If you saluted a man with your right arm, and
                            he returned the salute with his left hand, you could be assured he was a Knight. If you
                            shook hands with him, saying, ''I owe you," and he denied the
                            statement, you were sure he knew nothing of the Knights' secrets. But if he
                            replied, "Mutual Aid," you knew he was a member of the Circle.</p>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, in a rambling, old deserted house about three miles out of town, that Mr.
                    Weeden took the vows of a Knight. Meetings were always held behind barred doors, he says, and after
                    the War started, there were discussions of every conceivable plan to aid the South. Firing a gun
                    three times in succession at night signified that a Circle member was in need of aid.
                    "Membership was large. In fact, as the saying goes, the woods were full of
                    Knights," the gray-haired man explains.</p>
            <p>In the spring of 1862 Mr. Weeden tired of life as a Knight. "I was so young when I became a

                            breastworks, and by the time we were finished, which would require several days, we would
                            again take a forward movement, halt, cut down trees, dig up earth, and form another line of
                            works. This continued about six weeks. When we reached the vicinity of Corinth Beauregard
                            was in command of from thirty-five to forty thousand men. When we were about ready to attack
                            his works, he withdrew his army further south, and we captured the place with a few broken
                            guns, but not a single Confederate soldier. We occupied six weeks in marching twenty miles,
                            when the distance should have been made in three days. The weather was hot, the water poor,

                                    desperate. We attacked with at least 40,000 force. Rebels loss is heavy in killed
                                    and wounded. We have quite a lot of prisoners.</p>

                            capturing the Fort we communicated with our fleet and received our mail and clothin. In a

                        could have spread the flames to many buildings. There is other testimony, however, to the effect

            <p>Judge Nelson was then offered the rank of second lieutenant in the regular army, but preferred to

                        <p>It was while we were on plantations that we had so little to eat. Once in a while we would

                            yam. There is hardly a Civil War soldier who will eat beans. We used to put a big potful on
                            to cook, and about the time the beans were getting tender, we'd have to begin
                            fighting. Then we ate burned beans or nothing.</p>

                        <p>The worst scare I had during the war was when I had moved up in the brushes pretty close to

                            nearer. I shouted, "Halt!" But on came the "clicks." I
                            pulled out my gun, and just then a bunch of little niggers pleaded, "It's

            <p>Alexander Young, a veteran who is eighty-eight, was present at the second inauguration of Abraham
                    Lincoln, and holds that to be one of the most interesting experiences of his life. He relates how

                        <p>One of the camp rules was that the guards were to eat first, Sherman's
                            "coffee coolers" second, and the rest of the fellows third. Well, the
                            "coffee coolers" decided they wanted to eat first. So they lined up for
                            mess and when the door was opened, they started in. The first man was ordered to the rear of
                            the line by the captain. Then a man from the back rushed up, faced the captain, and
                            snatching a sword, stuck it near his own heart and shouted to the line behind him,
                            "Now shove!" Well, the captain couldn't stand that—to
                            murder a man just for food and rules. So the "coffee coolers" got their
                            way.</p>

            <p>Questioned concerning the origin of the expression, "coffee cooler," Mr. Bechtel
                    explained: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>When the army was on the move, coffee was cooked in iron camp kettles and served boiling hot
                            in tin cups. All the men stood around blowing their coffee, and they often dubbed each other
                            "coffee coolers." The term, '(Sherman's coffee
                            coolers," originated when soldiers in Company H, 353rd Indiana Infantry, were
                            hurrying to catch an army train near <placeName>

                            some before getting on the train that they poured it back and forth in kettles to cool
                        it.</p>

                    While at the hospital, Mrs. Miller was asked by her husband's superior officer to join the
                    nursing staff which she did. She states that while a nurse she suffered no privations and was safe
                    at all times. The nurses of that day had no uniforms, but wore the hoop-skirts in vogue at the time.
                    This Hoosier girl, who went South to cheer her soldier-husband, was the youngest nurse on the

            <p>David McDonald of whom a biographical sketch appeared in our September issue, made trips from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, D.C., in the winter of 1858-1859 and in the summer of 1862. During 1864, he twice
                    journeyed to the national capital, first in September and again in December. In each instance, he
                    kept a diary covering the trips to and from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and his brief sojourns in the city. He was a lawyer with a strong interest in the
                    courts and the devotees of the law. He was a Republican who had been a Whig. Though never active in
                    politics, he had adopted as his own the views which prevailed among Whigs relative to Jacksonian
                    Democrats and Jacksonian policies. He was affiliated with the Methodist church, but his beliefs were
                    strongly Unitarian. He held vigorous and independent beliefs which he freely expressed in his
                    diaries.</p>
            <p>Judge McDonald was born in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. The family migrated to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in 1817 when David was fourteen years of age. He spent very little time in
                    school in Indiana, though he read much. He taught school for a time, and studied law in the office
                    of a local attorney. In 1838, eight years after he was admitted to the bar, he was elected judge of
                    one of the judicial circuits of Indiana. After his election, he lived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> where in addition to serving as judge of a large circuit, he taught in the Law School
                    of Indiana University for several years. In 1854 Judge McDonald moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> where he formed a law partnership with Albert G. Porter. It was while engaged in the
                    practice of his profession in the Hoosier capital that he made the four visits to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> of which he kept a record in his journals.</p>

                        <p>Dec. 23, 1858. At 8:40 P.M. left home for <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington City</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. Took the Belfontaine road. Passed the night pleasantly in a
                                    "Sleeping Car".</p>
                        <p>At 7 A.M. of Friday, Dec. 24, 1858, I found myself at Crestline, <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName> where I breakfasted.</p>
                        <p>Thence took the Fort <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                                    </placeName> &amp; Pittsburg road. At about 10 o'clock the tender broke
                                    an axle; and we were detained about three hours. When this accident occurred, we
                                    were running about forty miles an hour. Yet, <pb n="283" id="VAA4025-028-4-063"/> as
                                    it was a hind axle, the tender was dragged forward and nobody was hurt. I did not
                                    even feel the jar.</p>
                        <p>We arrived at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                                    </placeName> at 9 o'clock P.M. and stopped at the Alleghaney House.</p>
                        <p>It was dark and I could see little of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                                    </placeName>.</p>
                        <p>My journey through <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName> this day showed a poor, marshy country. I saw no improvements and no
                                    farms equal to the best in Indiana.</p>
                        <p>Dec. 25, 1858. At 1:30 A.M. I left <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                                    </placeName> for Harrisburgh, a distance of about 250 miles. We ascended the
                                    Alleghaney Mountains in the night. But, when on the very top of them, the day
                                    dawned. It was clear and frosty, and it was a glorious daybreak. Far below, toward
                                    the Atlantic, the golden light glowed along the horizon—a magnificent
                                    [scene].</p>
                        <p>On the top of the mountain is a village where there are extensive manufactories. Here
                                    we breakfasted—a very good breakfast it was. Then we dashed along at the
                                    rate of 30 miles an hour through the mountains, following the way of the Juniata, at
                                    first a mere rivulet, but at Harrisburgh uniting with the Susquehanna, as wide as
                                    the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName> at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                                    </placeName>—a far more beautiful stream than the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName>.</p>
                        <p>I thought we would soon be out of the mountains; they continued to Harrisburgh. To me
                                    these' mountains were most interesting objects. Clothed everywhere with
                                    pines and cedars, I loved them. Lifting their heads in grandeur to the clouds, I
                                    venerated them. In places, their sides were composed of vast quantities of stone
                                    broken up as if for McAdamizing. In other places they presented solid walls of stone
                                    rising high above us in huge layers. I noticed that these layers were in no place
                                    horizontal. In many places, they had a dip of 30 degrees, and in some places, they
                                    were nearly perpendicular. I noticed, too, that the dip was in some places toward
                                    the east, and in some towards the west. An observant person cannot but conclude that
                                    these mighty mountains have been heaved up by some vast commotion below.</p>
                        <p>It is a wreched country all the way from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                                    </placeName> to Harrisburgh—not a good farm to be
                                    seen—miserable patches enclosed with wretched crooked rail fences.</p>
                        <p>We arrived at Harrisburgh at 12 M., just as the <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                                    </placeName> train was leaving, and we were left behind. So we must spend the
                                    evening in the Capital of <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                                    </placeName>.</p>
                        <p>Harrisburgh is a poor place. Not half equal to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. The public buildings do not compare with ours. A brick state-house,
                                    some offices, and a poor looking Insane Asylum are all I saw.</p>
                        <p>It was Christmas and all the people were out buying toys etc. Many were
                                    drunk—many cursing, swearing, quarrelling, using most obscene language.
                                    White men and negroes seemed on an equality. It looked like a general riot. I never
                                    saw anything like it in a <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Western City</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. The landlord said they had only three policemen.</p>
                        <p>Sunday, Dec. 26, 1868.</p>
                        <p>At 2:30 A.M. we took the cars for <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                                    </placeName> and arrived there at 8 A.M.</p>
                        <pb n="284" id="VAA4025-028-4-064"/>
                        <p>As the passage was mostly in the night I could see little. What glimpses I had showed
                                    a wretched country—poor land, poor fences—poor houses.</p>
                        <p>
                           <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                                    </placeName> is a great city—here are magnificent
                                    churches—splendid residences—-ships and small craft
                                    innumerable. The city surrounds the head of the bay (Chesapeake) which seems to run
                                    into the city's very heart.</p>
                        <p>I looked at the <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName> monument, which seemed to me to be fine; and at the monument
                                    commemorative of the battle of Northpoint, which seemed to me very
                                    poor—as good however as the battle.</p>
                        <p>At 11 A.M., I went to the Unitarian Church. It was all very
                                    fashionable—here was the organ—and here two
                                    singers—a man and a woman.</p>
                        <p>The Rev. a Dr. Somebody read a poor sermon, and read it badly. The congregation was
                                    small. It was, upon the whole, a poor affair.</p>
                        <p>Monday, Dec. 27, 1858. At 4% A.M., took the train for <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. Got there at 7 A.M.</p>
                        <p>Here I am in the <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Federal City</settlement>
                                    </placeName> at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                                    </placeName>'s Hotel, midway on <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                                    </placeName> Avenue, the widest street I ever saw. The Capitol is at the east end of
                                    the avenue, the President's house at the west, the P.O. department and the
                                    Patent office on the N.W. and the Treasury Department immediately east of the
                                    Presidential mansion.</p>
                        <p>This day I went to the Capitol and looked around it a little. I examined little of
                                    the interior except the rotunda.</p>
                        <p>Tuesday, Dec. 28, 1858. After breakfast I went to the navy yard about 1 mile S.E. of
                                    the Capitol. I had not time to examine it. I saw, however, that it was on a grand
                                    scale, and was enclosed like a penitentiary with a high wall. Near the entrance were
                                    four large cannon taken in 1804 from the Algerines near Tripoli by Com. [1/2]<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>At 11 o'clock A.M., I went with R. W. Thompson<hi rend="sup">2</hi> to the
                                    Supreme Court room. After sitting there a while, the Judges marched in headed by the
                                    Chf. Justice. They wore long black gowns. The impression the first sight of them
                                    gave me was that of weary, worn out, feeble old men, whose places would be rather in
                                    their chimney corners, than here. Nor could I see in them any great marks of great
                                    intellect. They seemed just the men who might get up the shabby decisions in
                                    Howard's Reports.</p>
                        <p>The Court room is small, and much in the shape of our Representatives Chamber. On the
                                    columns are fixed the faces of all the former Chief Justices sculptured in marble,
                                    Marshall, Rutledge, Jay, Ellsworth. Facing the Judges on the opposite wall are the
                                    blind goddess with her sword and scales, some angel on her left with the
                                    constitution, and an eagle on her right.</p>
                        <p>Now let us look at the Judges a little more closely:</p>
                        <p>1. In the middle sets Taney, the Chief Justice. He looks 80 years old. He is feeble,
                                    decrepit, bowed together. Complexion dark, face <list type="footnotes">

                                    not' judicial.</p>
                        <p>2. On the right of the Chief Justice is the chair of Judge McLean.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> He is not in it, but I will describe him:</p>
                        <p>A man more than 70 years old, tall, fine formed, majestic,—his hair very
                                    thin but not gray—pretty good shaped head and large—an
                                    imperious look, as much as to say "I am sir Oracle". He has been a
                                    long time in office, and in high life. He loves good eating, and goes to sleep on
                                    the Bench in the midst of an argument. He has a miscellaneous, not a logical mind.
                                    His powers of intellection are not strong. His style is wishy washy. He has no
                                    taste. He never was a thorough lawyer though he thinks he is. He affects to be a
                                    magnificent man. But he lacks a simple heart, and an earnest mind. "I do
                                    not like you, Dr. Fell".</p>
                        <p>3. Catron<hi rend="sup">5</hi> is on the right of McLean's chair.</p>
                        <p>He is a large, heavy old man somewhere about 65 years of age. He has a good wholesome
                                    face and a large head. And yet I don't see any marks of great intellect. He
                                    reads without spectacles and reads very badly. In fact, I heard none of them read an
                                    opinion well. Our Perkins is equal to the best of them in that respect.</p>
                        <p>On the whole, however, I think Catron has as much talent as any of them.</p>
                        <p>4 Nelson<hi rend="sup">6</hi> sits on Catron's right. He looks to be some 70
                                    years old. He is very gray—heavy set—a little
                                    corpulent—large head. He looks more like a southern than a northern man.
                                    There is much similarity between him and Catron; and I do not know which is
                                    superior.</p>

                                    appearnce. No talent patent in his face. He is one of those indifferent kind of men,
                                    of whom little can be said in any way, except that his face is strongly marked with
                                    benevolence. Certainly he is a man of an amiable, sweet, kind heart, unless

                                        was placed at the head of the Treasury Department because he was in thorough

                                        born in 1777, and wan, therefore, 81 years of age in 1868.</item>

                                    was scolding, it was bad rhetoric, bad English, bad taste, and bad sense. The thing
                                    seemed to me to combine want of learning and want of manner.</p>

                                    should think he had talents; but he don't look like a thoroughly cultivated

                                    vigor of mind. But I doubt his mental vigor. And yet he has a large, fine head
                                    &amp; face. But he looks too good natured, too easy—his face shows
                                    nothing of the severity which commonly marks a closely thinking judge.</p>
                        <p>These judges all sit crouched on their chairs. They do not hold up their heads like
                                    men even when reading opinions. And while counsel address them they often read, and
                                    converse with each other.</p>
                        <p>Upon the whole I pronounce them an umpromising set—a disgrace to the
                                    nation—a burning disgrace to the partisan presidents who placed them

                        <p>Here is an argument before the Sup. Court. Two questions are made. 1. Is a Railroad
                                    which is incorporated in several states a citizen of any of them so as to be sued in
                                    the U. S. Courts? 2. Can a corporation be sued for libel?</p>
                        <p>In the affirmative were Davis<hi rend="sup">14</hi> &amp; Reverdy Johnson<hi rend="sup">15</hi> of Md. On the negative, Donaldson<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
                                    &amp; Sly.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I have heard Johnson's argument. He is a rather small, well made
                                    man—a good formed head, but not very large. His voice is not good. He is
                                    very earnest, very impassioned, very clear and logical. He acts rather too
                                    much—walks about—feels at home here—never
                                    pronounces ing right.</p>
                        <p>He began without parade, his hands in his breeches pockets. But he soon fired up, and
                                    moved off like a steamboat.</p>
                        <p>The argument was opened by Donaldson in a neat statement of the facts and a fair
                                    speech. He was followed by H. Winter Davis who made a very good speech. Then came
                                    Johnson; and Sly closed it. It lasted two days. Upon the whole, it was pretty well
                                    done. But I have certainly heard things as well done in Indiana. Johnson looks very
                                    much like old Ed. Browning.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Thompson<hi rend="sup">18</hi> moved my admission to the bar. The Chief Justice
                                    assented. I walked forward—looked as big as I could. The clerk swore
                                    me—charged me only $6.50—I paid it—took
                                    my seal and my license—and went to dinner.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Wednesday Dec. 29, 1868. With Mr. Thompson, I looked into the patent office this
                                    morning. Saw so many strange things that it is not worth while to attempt their
                                    description. The whole affair, so complicated, so various, so vast, confounds one.</p>
                        <p>I forgot to say that yesterday I took a stroll around all the public offices and the
                                    president's house. Everything is white, grand, vast.</p>

                        <p>On the north of the president's house and in full view of it is the
                                    equestrian statue of Jackson, in a park. It is a bronze statue—gigantic
                                    in size. There is a marble platform some 6 feet high. On this is a mighty bronze
                                    studhorse reared on his hind feet—his forefeet high in air as if ready to
                                    jump off the platform. Saddle, bridge, girths and all look very natural. On the back
                                    of this stallion, old Hickory sits like a god—his sword on thigh and his
                                    cap in hand. And he seems to swear his wonted oath that something shall be done.</p>
                        <p>I suppose this affair is well got up. But I do not venerate either the memory of
                                    Jackson or the statue. With him, the moral tone of our country began to go
                                    down—the impetus he gave it has ever since been downward. He is
                                    responsible for it all. And I worship no such hero.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

                        <p>The grounds about the President's house did not strike me as very
                                    remarkable. The trees are fine; but they [there] are not many of the kind of our
                                    noble forest trees—no poplars—no oaks—no
                                    sugartrees. I walked all round it, without much desire to see the old man within, by

                        <p>Off to the southeast from the President's house some 600 yards is the
                                    Smithsonian Institute. I did not go to it. It is built of red stone—the
                                    appearance is just as if painted with Spanish brown as the dutch paint their houses,
                                    I believe the material is red granite. Its sight [site] is too low to show the

                                    churches or bawdy houses—to Courts or billiard salons, or anywhere
                                    else—a dollar an hour is the charge.</p>
                        <p>Thursday, Dec. 30, 1858. This is a dark sleety morning.</p>
                        <p>I went early to the Capitol. It were endless to describe its interior. On its front,
                                    is a raised platform of stone surrounded by various figures—Goddesses,
                                    eagles &amp;c, &amp;c. These stood Cockburn's fire in 1814 not
                                    however without a scorching but here they stand yet. Whether it was in good taste to
                                    let them remain all scorched and mutilated as they are by the fire which burned down
                                    the Capitol, is I think doubtful. The sight of them may well make every Briton who
                                    enters the Capitol blush for the Vandal act of his nation. But it may also make an
                                    American blush to think that a handful of British soldiers marched to the Capitol
                                    and burnt it without any serious opposition.</p>

                                    </placeName>'s statue—what she represents I know not. But the
                                    figure is obscene.</p>
                        <p>In a park 300 or 400 yards east of the Capitol is a collossal figure of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName> erected on black granite 6 feet from the ground. He looks with benign
                                    face toward the Capitol. The figure is gigantic and I suppose very fine, It is
                                    marble. On the granite under the figure is inscribed thus:</p>
                        <p>On the north—"First in war."</p>
                        <p>On the south—"First in peace."</p>
                        <p>On the west—"First in the hearts of his countrymen."</p>
                        <p>On the east—"Simulacrum istud ad magnum libertatis exempleum nec

                        <p>At 11 o'clock I went into the Supreme Court room. An admiralty case is on
                                    hand. Cushing<hi rend="sup">24</hi> commenced the argument of it; and after hearing
                                    him awhile, I went to the law library.</p>
                        <p>Cushing speaks well. He has a great command of language and seems to possess a clear,
                                    though not a gigantic mind.</p>
                        <p>The law library is a grand affair. Here are all sorts of law books, and an attentive
                                    librarian with a polite negro to hand down any book called for.</p>
                        <p>Friday Dec. 31, 1858. A rainy morning. After breakfast I bought an umbrella for 76
                                    cts and went to the U. S. Law Library.</p>
                        <p>Thence, at 11 o'clock A. M. I went to the Sup. Court room. The hour of
                                    meeting is 11, but the judges never come in promptly at that hour.</p>

                                        the work in 1832. He spent eight years on the task, carving the statue from

                                        was found to be too heavy for the floor. It was removed to the plaza in front of
                                        the Capitol. Here it stood until 1908, when it was removed to the National
                                        Museum. The statue is 12 ft. high and cost $44,000. <placeName>

                                    </placeName> is a squat, heavy-set man of good sense. But his style, taste, and
                                    manner are bad. He is about 50 years old.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Brown is a bluff, hairy, swearing fellow—has warts on his
                                    face—looks a little like Bob Walpole—has no talents, learning,
                                    or taste. He raves—he rants—claps his hands—flies
                                    around—and all about nothing. His back is often turned to the Judges.
                                    Such conduct in a jury trial in our Courts would be laughed at.</p>
                        <p>I visited the Congress library. All I can say is that the multitude of books is
                                    bewildering.</p>
                        <p>Next I went to the Representative Chamber. It is very large. All carved work,
                                    tinselled and red. I do not like the taste. I call it gingerbread, though the polite
                                    call it Italian. Here I found Wilson<hi rend="sup">28</hi> of <placeName>

                                    growth—the bread tree—the palm—the banana, and
                                    everything else. Here are flowers, and shrubs and grass—and every rare
                                    vegetable thing-the tea plant among the rest. To describe and particularize is
                                    impossible. The sight bewilders and overwhelms me.</p>
                        <p>At night, Thompson and I called on Reverdy Johnson. We spent an hour or two with him.
                                    He is a plain, unpretending man. At home, he evidently is in all law questions. He
                                    told us that Wirt<hi rend="sup">29</hi> always wrote and committed his law arguments
                                    when he had a great case. He said Pinckney<hi rend="sup">30</hi> was in the habit of
                                    doing so too. He thinks Pinckney the greatest lawyer this country has produced.</p>
                        <p>He says when Taney practised law, he was the most troublesome opponent he ever met.
                                    And he thinks Taney's mind is not at all impaired by age, wherein I differ
                                    with Mr. Johnson.</p>
                        <p>On leaving him, he set out a bottle of brandy, and one of whiskey but tasted none

                                    is a great man; but he don't look much like it.</p>
                        <p>Next we called on Mr. Floyd,<hi rend="sup">33</hi> cretary of War. A noble looking

                        <p>Sunday, Jan. 2, 1859. This morning, I set out to find Dr. Nadell's church. I
                                    got there at 9 A.M. and went in to class meeting. The room was poorly
                                    furnished—one old chair and some benches. About six old men were there,
                                    from middle aged to old. The Leader, a bachellor [sic] of 45 or 50, a retired

                                    things were done in a low tone. There was little passion, little animation. The

                        <p>At night, I went to the Unitarian Church close to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                                    </placeName>'s Hotel. I was much surprised to find them going over the
                                    episcopal liturgy with very slight variations. The congregation was small, but
                                    select. After the prayers etc., a drawling sermon was read. If the Unitarians all
                                    preach as they do here and in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, I do not wonder they make so few proselytes. Neither the matter nor
                                    the manner of this sermon was worth hearing or seeing. Here too, was the organ and
                                    two singers! The rest read the hymn book. What a pity that what is perhaps the true
                                    faith should have so lifeless, so formal a worship. A man with talents and learning,
                                    arid a soul in him could change these things for good. I would infinitely prefer
                                    Theo. Parker with all his heresies. He has a soul, and he may be right, too. I will
                                    not now decide; but there is to me something soul stirring in his notion of the
                                    "Aboslute Religion," rising into the Universal and Eternal, and
                                    regarding Judaism and Catholicism, and Protestantism as mere ephemeral forms,
                                    temporary, fading, vanishing away.</p>
                        <p>Monday, Jan. 3, 1859. This morning I went to the Smithsonian Institute. The entire
                                    buildings are of red stone—just the color of Spanish brown painting. It
                                    is situated in an enclosure of about 50 acres. Here is the lecture
                                    room—very fine. Here are some 150 Indians painted, and a marble figure of
                                    the dying gladiator. There are there, rooms full of all birds, quadrupeds, reptiles,
                                    corals, and the Lord knows what. Of all these I can give not any description. I
                                    bought a pamphlet of my cicerone which describes some of them.</p>
                        <p>I went at night to the Smithsonian Institute to hear Prof. Danas<hi rend="sup">39</hi> lecture on Corals. He is a wretched speaker: but his lecture was ex-tremely
                                    interesting. He told many things as to corals which were new to me.</p>
                        <p>Upon my return about 10 o'clock P.M., Hughes asked me to go with him to look
                                    at some of the magnificent gaming houses. We were ushered into one with ceremony.
                                    Invited to a sumptuous table of all good things to eat—oysters, terrapin
                                    etc., etc., all gratis—then we looked at their far bank. I did not
                                    understand it; and of course I did no more than look. We staid a few minutes, then
                                    went to another of the same sort; looked on a little and then went out. Curiosity
                                    led me to see these hells. I am sorry I went. I think I did wrong even looking at
                                    them. At least my conscience smote me; and I pray God to forgive me; 0 the

                                    I live or die may I be his, prepared for all events.</p>
                        <p>And now we are on the cars. Yonder is a large frame building with the sign,
                                        "<geogName>Mt. Vernon</geogName> Cane factory. All canes manufactured
                                    here warranted of <geogName>Mt. Vernon</geogName> wood!" Humbug.</p>
                        <p>We took the Balt. road about 30 miles, through a poor country of low hills and flat
                                    ground—oak and pine the principal trees. Shrubs and briars abound. At
                                    what they call the relay house about 9 miles from <placeName>

                                    </placeName>, we took supper and the <placeName>

                                    </placeName> just at dark. What a road, winding, dashing, jolting-we went all night
                                    through the mountains—at daylight we came to Grafton. There we took the
                                    Parkersburg road to Clarksburgh in search of Bill Alexander. What a night I have
                                    spent on this dangerous road! But all is safe, thank God!</p>
                        <p>Wednesday, Jan. 5, 1859.</p>
                        <p>Here we are in Clarksburg about sunrise. Alexander is not here. We (i.e. I &amp;
                                    Goss) stop at a <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                                    </placeName> tavern in a <placeName>

                                    </placeName> Hlls. What an awful place! I do not find a decent man, woman, nigger or
                                    house. This is slavery &amp; slave territory. O <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                                    </placeName>, mother of states! How art thou fallen! Happy if thou didst but know
                                    thy degradation—but it is hid from thy eyes.</p>
                        <p>We started back for Grafton at 3:50 P.M. where we arrived about 5 and took lodging
                                    for the night awaiting the Wheeling cars tomorrow morning 6 o'clock.</p>
                        <p>As our journey back to Grafton was by daylight, I had a good opportunity to notice
                                    the country. It is 22 miles through hills and narrow glens. Wretched hovels and
                                    little fields on hillsides appear everywhere. Whiteoak is the chief
                                    growth—a few stunted sugartrees along the branches—no large
                                    trees of any size. The soil can't produce them.</p>
                        <p>We got to Grafton about sundown. This is a village in the mountains. Here is a good
                                    brick tavern. And here we tarried for the night and slept well.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>

                                    along creeks &amp; rivulets. Still we have the same eternal prospect of high

                        <p>I was on the floor of the House today and was introduced to several members. It is,
                                    as ever, a mob. How anybody can be eloquent here I know not.</p>
                        <p>I called on J. Wright today. Also on Senator Lane<hi rend="sup">47</hi> et ux. He
                                    falls into my views as to the circuit. So far, so good.</p>
                        <p>June 12. 1862. I slept till nearly nine o'clock this morning. After
                                    breakfast, hunted up Porter and Colfax.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> The latter now thinks
                                    he can't get a circuit made for C. B. Smith.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> And he
                                    consents, therefore, on failure of that, to go for my project.</p>
                        <p>I went to the Senate Chamber in the afternoon. Davis<hi rend="sup">50</hi> of Ky.
                                    moved that a resolution pass ordering the Military to deliver up Gen'l S.
                                    B. Buckner<hi rend="sup">51</hi> to the civil authority to be tried for treason.
                                    Davis spoke for and Trumbull<hi rend="sup">52</hi> &amp; Brownings<hi rend="sup">53</hi> of Ill. against the resolution. It lies over.</p>
                        <p>Here, as in every city, the extremes of society are found. Here are the proud whom I
                                    regard not; but here is a poor girl sweeping the sidewalk, and begging a copper from
                                    the passers by. Poor child of want! Where is thy security for bread or virtue? Poor
                                    child, may heaven defend thee! Sad is thy fate, poor girl! Sadder far than thou
                                    imaginest. Pure now, though poor and unfriended, thy purity repays thee for all thy
                                    poverty. But at some future day thy purity will be lost. That will be thy direst
                                    calamity. Poverty thou thinkest is thy greatest affliction—Silly child!
                                    want of chastity will be greater. When that is gone—and gone it will
                                    be—then thy real calamity will come. O God! pity the beggar girl, and
                                    save her from that worst of woes! Dost thou take notice of the sparrow, and wilt
                                    thou not protect this friendless girl?</p>

                        <p>About 9 A.M. I strolled to the Capitol, and spent three hours inspecting its
                                    magnificences. How unfortunate that this spot was fixed as the seat of government.
                                    These immense buildings—the Capitol, the post office, the patent office,
                                    the Treasury house, the Smithsonian Institute, the White House, would worth
                                    something, and would remain, situate at <placeName>

                                    </placeName>. But what are they worth here on the Algerine [Confederate] border? How
                                    long will they last here?</p>
                        <p>It is strange how little is known of the war news here. All the means of information
                                    here are not half equal to what I daily read in the <placeName>

                                    </placeName> Gazette at home. It is known indeed the McClelland's army is

                                    has—what is the number of the enemy—when, if ever, the fight
                                    will be—what are the grounds of hope for success—these nobody
                                    knows.</p>
                        <p>I spent some time in the Senate lobby today. The point in debate was whether a bill
                                    should pass requiring all U.S. officers to swear themselves clear of treason, past,

                                    </placeName> and her decisions, he cited a case from N.Y. in his favor. Trumbull
                                    does not strike me as either a great orator or a great statesman. His colleague,
                                    Browning, talked of for Supreme Judge of the U.S. may be good and
                                    great:—he don't look so.</p>
                        <p>I got a peep at Sumner<hi rend="sup">56</hi> this afternoon. He seems unfashionable,
                                    dressed in loose gray clothes—seems at ease, at home—looks
                                    solid—complexion rather dark—features
                                    prominent—irregular. He is the great man of the Senate. He is not old
                                    yet, not over 50, few gray hairs. His voice seems deep and guttural. But I am too
                                    far off to scan him well.</p>
                        <p>Saturday, June 14, 1862.</p>
                        <p>This morning I fell in with Henry S. Lane and Bob Cravens.<hi rend="sup">57</hi> We
                                    went to the Whitehouse. Old Abe was abroad. We sauntered a while in the flower
                                    garden, and, on returning to the house, found that "(Abe" had just
                                    returned from a ride on horseback. He was standing at the door holding his horse. We
                                    spoke to him. He received us with no ostentation, and, so far as I could see, with
                                    no cordiality. He had seen me on the bench in Indiana. True—but what of
                                    that? He asked us into the house where we sat with him about two minutes, and
                                    withdrew.</p>
                        <p>I think no one can doubt that the President has an honest and benevolent face and
                                    heart. There is too, a fair degree of manliness in his personal [bearing]. His
                                    exterior, however, is rough and ungainly. And one can not but feel that he lacks
                                    polish, and is destitute of a refined taste and all sorts of book learning. Has he
                                    sound judgment? Does he combine honesty of purpose with wisdom of discrimination?

                                    hair and beard very long and very white—a couple of little bright eyes
                                    peeping out through a whole forest of hair. I could form no idea of his features,
                                    for I saw them not; they lay concealed in darkness behind a capillary screen. He did
                                    not rise up. He reached out his hand to us and said, "how d'ye
                                    do" and it was all over, and we evacuated the fort. What sort of man he is,
                                    I know not. He did not say enough to enable me to form an idea of his intellect, and
                                    through his hairy covering, he was so "dimly seen" that I could
                                    not scan him either phrenologically or physiog-nomically. But it was plain enough

                                    I had first to send up my card. Then I got for answer that he would see me in the

                                    all I found him no great thing—A dull, heavy fellow I think him to be.

                        <p>The House does not sit today. I spent a little while in the Senate. Then the heat

                        <p>Sunday, June 15,1862.</p>
                        <p>Tis very warm this morning. I staid in my room till 10:30 A.M. when Mr. Porter called
                                    on me to go with him to the House of representatives to hear Doctor Stockton of the
                                    Radical Methodists preach. I would much rather go to the Unitarian Church. But I
                                    consent to go with Porter.</p>
                        <p>And here we are. The hall of the House is pretty well filled. At the clerk's
                                    desk sits the preacher—A frail, slender, old man with a white beard and
                                    hair. He don't look very intellectual. His text is "Charity
                                    suffereth long and is kind". He sat in his chair and preached—It
                                    was good and great. The man himself was the very picture of the charity his text
                                    extolled, He was graceful, logical, classical, eloquent. Considering his elegant and
                                    impressive manner of treating his subject, and the excellent spirit so conspicuous
                                    in the man, I think I never heard a finer sermon. No feeling person can hear him and
                                    not love and revere him. He re-minded me of the ideal I had formed of John Wesley,
                                    and of the pictures of him which I have seen. What a treat is this! Such a sermon
                                    has life in it. It makes me better. How different from the blather I hear at home,
                                    which really makes me worse.</p>

                                    myself took a hack this evening and went to see some of them. Some of them we

                                    The country through which we passed, seemed to have been one great camp. I suppose
                                    part of McClelland's army camped here last winter. Indeed many soldiers
                                    were here yet. Many sick-some union, some traitors, were here also. We found that
                                    the wounded were mostly <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName> men—a few were Pennsylvanians and a few from Indiana. One
                                    man had an arm off—one was shot through the face, or rather the head,
                                    under or behind the top of the nose. Some had be shot through the breast, some in
                                    the arms and hands, but the greater portion were wounded in the thighs, legs and
                                    feet. No one appeared to be dangerously wounded. Some were suffering a great deal;
                                    but most of them seemed very cheerful. The sight was not near so bad as I expected.
                                    I found no one whom I knew. I spoke to most of them.</p>
                        <p>On our return we saw a large number of soldiers collected under some oaks; and found
                                    that a lady, who sang well, was singing the "Star Spangled
                                    Banner." The crowd joined in the chorus. It was very fine, and even grand.</p>
                        <p>I should state that we found the "Sisters of Charity" attending the

                        <p>At night I went to the Unitarian Church. Mr. Channing, nephew of Dr. Channing
                                        preached.<hi rend="sup">67</hi> The mode of worship I did not like. He read a
                                    prayer partly from the Episcopal prayer book. Most of the time was taken up with
                                    alternate readings from the Bible and singing by the choir and playing on the organ.
                                    They call it vespers. One song if song it was, was sung by one man alone, All I
                                    could hear of the words was "Must I leave my native soil" repeated
                                    ten times or more. The whole matter of the music was to me execrable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Channing gave a sensible sermon from "Fervent in spirit, serving the
                                    Lord." His delivery however, is poor "and his speech
                                    contemptible." He lives at 505, 12th St. next to E in <placeName>

                        <p>Monday, June 15, 1862. This is a cool day I spent it mostly looking around the city.</p>
                        <p>I have done now all I can do for our Judicial Circuit. I think the scheme will
                                    succeed, but time and the Senate must tell.</p>
                        <p>From all that I can hear, I fear for the result at <placeName>

                                    </placeName>. McClelland's great army is now within four miles of that
                                    city; but it is said the enemy is much stronger in numbers than he. I hope
                                    McClelland will beat him; but, considering how much depends on the result of the
                                    battle now imminent, the least doubt about the matter is very painful. May God
                                    prosper the better cause!</p>
                        <p>Tuesday June 17, 1862. This forenoon I was at the Capitol looking on at the doings of
                                    Congress. Tonight at 5 o'clock I start for home.</p>
                        <p>I arrived at Balt. about 7 and waited there till 9 P.M. for the Harris-burgh train. I
                                    got my supper near the depot at a poor Dutch tavern. So much disorder I never saw at
                                    a depot in Indiana as I witnessed at this depot in Balt. I was glad at 9
                                    o'clock to get into a sleeping car far Harrisburgh.</p>
                        <p>At Harrisburgh, I arrived about day break on Wednesday, June 18th. I passed the

                        <p>Thursday, Sept. 8, 1864. The first thing this morning was to hunt up C. M. Walker. I
                                    found him at the Treasury at 9 o'clock. We planned that he should collect
                                    certain old recommendations of me for U.S. Dist. Judge already on file in the office
                                    of the Atty. General—make an abstract of them and all the others I had on
                                    hand—and then at 12 M. find the President, and lay siege to his sacred
                                    person. After all the red tape round, of first sending an order in writing to Att.
                                    Gen'l Bates,<hi rend="sup">69</hi> and then going in propria persona, and
                                    receipting for all these documents by name and number, I got them into my
                                    possession. But—the President—the President—was too
                                    busy to be seen today. We must wait for that until tomorrow at 9 o'c. A.M.</p>
                        <p>The rest of the day I spent wandering about the city and making
                                    observations—[for] which there is much material.</p>
                        <p>The first thing that strikes one is the multitude of men in military
                                    uniform—Officers of all grades—Soldiers of all
                                    sorts—men maimed in all sorts of ways—Here is a man with only
                                    one leg; there a man with an arm off. Yonder is a man limping on crutches; and
                                    yonder another with a nose off or slit lip, or a countenance otherwise marred.</p>
                        <p>Another remarkable thing is that <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName> situate on the very seat of war, should at the end of three years
                                    fighting seem so pecuniarily prosperous, yet so it is—money
                                    abundant—trade prosperous—everybody getting rich.</p>
                        <p>Friday, 9 Sept. 1864.</p>
                        <p>At 9 o'clock this morning I and C. M. Walker went to see the President. We
                                    waited in the ante room till about eleven; and were at last invited by the private
                                    Sec'y Mr. Nicholi [John G. Nicolay], into the "presence
                                    chamber." Lincoln was not in; but entered shortly, and seemed to receive me
                                    very cordially. We had met before. He recognized me and began to talk of old times
                                    in Indiana when he was a boy living in Perry county &amp;c, &amp;c. He said
                                    he came to that county in 1816, seven years old.</p>
                        <p>Finally I mentioned my business, made him a poor stump speech, and told him all I
                                    could. He heard me patiently, and I think encouraged me to expect success. But he
                                    told me that, as several had telegraphed him not to make a sudden appointment, he
                                    would have to delay until he heard <list type="footnotes">

                                    raised. Certainly he is very far from being a fool. On political topics, he talked

                                    instinctively to hold the right course, not varying an inch, now rushing through
                                    gorges of the mountains—now dashing through tunnels—now
                                    hanging on and winding around the edges of precipices—now dashing down
                                    the mountain side like an avalanche. But all goes safe; and at last at 4 A.M. we
                                    find ourselves safe at Harrisburgh—too late for the <placeName>

                                    </placeName>. And here at the "National" I find Henry S. Lane. He
                                    says he has recommended several of us to the President for this judgeship and now
                                    having done his whole duty, he says he leaves it with the President to do his!!!</p>
                        <p>I called on G. S. Orth<hi rend="sup">74</hi> today. He says he has to go for his
                                    Judge Huff; but I am his second choice.</p>
                        <p>I went to the Unitarian Church today. Mr. Channing preached a very good sermon. He
                                    was severe on slavery, strong for the Union, spiritual, holy. O that I could often
                                    hear such preaching. I love the man and his doctrine.</p>

                        <p>I find that Jas. Speed<hi rend="sup">75</hi> of <placeName>

                                    </placeName> is the new atty. general. Glad of it. I called on him. He is decidedly
                                    for me for the judgeship. He is a host.</p>
                        <p>No quorum in the Sup. Court today. The Court of Claims sits; but Judge Hughes<hi rend="sup">76</hi> is not here. I am sorry for it.</p>
                        <p>Congress meets today. I was in the Senate Chamber a little while. Nothing of interest
                                    there.</p>
                        <p>The vastness of the Capitol and other public buildings gives me an idea of the
                                    vastness of our country and its prosperity, till of late, now when war is raging, I
                                    had no idea this was so great a nation. No nation in Europe could have sustained
                                    what we have sustained in the last four years with equal success. It is incredible
                                    that in such a war, all the free states should have had such
                                    prosperity—yet we have it—greater than was every known before.
                                    But what will the end of all this be?</p>

                                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                                    </placeName> was called to the chair. A committee on resolutions on the death of
                                    Taney was appointed. And then I left the room. I looked in at the Court of Claims,
                                    and then went to the Senate Chamber, where the President's Message was
                                    read.</p>
                        <p>At 2:30 Hendricks and I went to see the President, waited there till sun down but did
                                    not see him.</p>
                        <p>Things look better today. I think I shall get the Judgeship. How-land is the only
                                    opponent I fear, and he seems much discouraged. Alfred Harrison has gone home, I
                                    suspect, in despair. Howland, himself can do nothing. And I hope success. Still I
                                    must not be over-confident.</p>
                        <p>Today Mr. Chase<hi rend="sup">78</hi> was nominated and confirmed as Chief Justice of
                                    the <placeName>
                                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                                    </placeName>.</p>
                        <p>At about 8 o'clock P.M. Senator Hendricks and I went to the
                                    President's House. After waiting a long time, Hendricks was called in. He
                                    had a long talk with the President about me. Then I was called in. The President
                                    said he had thought of making me judge in McLean's place. This he said was
                                    at the request of Bishop Simpson.<hi rend="sup">79</hi> Afterwards he said he
                                    thought seriously of me when he appointed Smith, and so also when he appointed
                                    White. He said he cared nothing about recommendations. He said, in fine, everything
                                    from which I might infer that he would appoint me without promising it directly. I
                                    feel sure he will do it. Yet the doubt and the uncertainty are painful.</p>
                        <p>Wedn. Dec. 7, 1864. Slept till nearly 9 this morning.</p>
                        <p>At 12M. I went to the Sup. Court room. It was full of lawyers. Presently somebody
                                    announced "The Supreme Judges." Then all rose and stood till the
                                    Judges took their seats: Whereupon old Tom Ewing<hi rend="sup">80</hi> rose and
                                    addressed the Court. I could not hear a word he said. Some paper was then read about
                                    the death of Chief Justice Taney. To this, Mr. Justice Wayne, the senior Judge, read
                                    a long response-not one word of which I could hear. Then the Court arose.</p>
                        <p>This veneration of the name of Taney I do not approve. That he was a man of talents
                                    and a learned lawyer is true. But he got his office by being the tool of
                                    Gen'l Jackson and removing the deposits from the U.S. Bank. And by
                                    pronouncing the Dred Scott Decision he caused the present rebellion. Praise him who
                                    will. I say the Dred Scott decision ought to stain him indelibly, and cause infamy
                                    to roll its burning fires over his memory forever and ever.<hi rend="sup">81</hi>

                        <p>At night, in company with Dan Mace,<hi rend="sup">82</hi> I went to see Colchester, a
                                    spiritualist. There was a company of about 20. We sat in a circle with hands joined.
                                    A table in the centre piled with drum, fiddle, bell &amp;c. Colchester sat with
                                    us. All hands were joined—one of his to Mace, the other to a lady. Then
                                    the light out. The drum beat—the fiddle played—the bells rang.
                                    All these flew around the room—phosphorus had been put on them so that we
                                    could see them flying. Colchester's coat Was pulled off, thrown across the
                                    room, then put on him—all the while he was held by the hand so as to seem
                                    to render such a feat impossible. These things were oft repeated, Then each of us
                                    paid him a dollar and went home.</p>
                        <p>Thurs. Dec. 8, 1864.</p>
                        <p>I spent this day loitering about the Capitol and in the Supreme Court. Only 6 of the
                                    10 Judges are present. Swayne<hi rend="sup">83</hi> looks more like a live man than
                                    any of the rest. And I think he is the best lawyer of the crowd.</p>
                        <p>I am glad to find that Judge Jas. Hughes has arrived. I saw him this evening. He goes
                                    for me. He is to see the President as soon as possible. He says that both Usher and
                                        Defrees<hi rend="sup">84</hi> admit that my appointment is inevitable.</p>
                        <p>How strange that Hughes, who in former years was a long time my bitterest enemy,
                                    should be my warmest friend! "The world changes and we change with
                                    it."</p>
                        <p>Friday, Dec. 9, 1864.</p>
                        <p>I have stayed in my room nearly all day. I have nothing more that I can do here that
                                    I see. And yet I incline not to <hi rend="i">go</hi> home till I see the end.</p>
                        <p>Hughes failed to get to see the President yesterday. He says that he will see him
                                    this day. Yet at this hour, 8 P.M., I hear nothing from him. "Uncle
                                    Abe" is hard to see.</p>
                        <p>Sat. Dec. 10.</p>
                        <p>I have spent about the whole day in my room. It is a gloomy day.</p>
                        <p>A snow fell last night. It is bad going out.</p>
                        <p>I have not heard whether Hughes has seen the President.</p>
                        <p>Sun. Dec. 11, 1864.</p>
                        <p>This morning I hunted for a Methodist class meeting, but found none.</p>
                        <p>At 11 o'clock, I went to the Unitarian Church, and heard Mr. Channing preach
                                    a great discourse. I have been deceived as to him. When I heard him a few years ago,
                                    I did not admire him. Now I see he is one of the great men of this country. His
                                    sermons make me better.</p>

                        <p>I went to the Capitol this morning. There I met Judge Wright<hi rend="sup">85</hi>
                                    and Dan Mace. They hinted to me that I would be appointed Judge that day. Then Henry
                                    S. Lane came to me looking wise. He spoke thus. "The President sent for me
                                    this morning. I went. He asked me if there any good reason why McDonald should not
                                    be appointed Judge? I ahwered, none in the world. Then, said the President, I will
                                    appoint him."</p>
                        <p>After the Senate met, I found the President had, sure enough, sent in my name. Then
                                    with my heart full of joy and thankfulness to God I hasted to my room at the Hotel
                                    and, on my knees, adored the Good God, who had thus consumated my highest worldly

                        <p>When about forty miles east of Crestline, at about 10 o'clock P.M. and while

                                    moment the car tumbled down an embankment, rolling on its side so as nearly to turn
                                    bottom uppermost. The people came tumbling to the lower part, and seats and carpet
                                    sacks came tumbling on us. Wat I most dreaded was that the sleeping car would come
                                    next and crush us. Then arose the shrieks of women and children and the cries of
                                    men. It was the awfullest moment I ever experienced. But a moment only. For when I
                                    found that the sleeping car was not on us, and that I was not hurt, I could not but
                                    cry out, "Thank God, we are safe!" But the uproar was immense. Men
                                    broke the windows on the upper side and many of them escaped through them. I got out
                                    at one of the doors, and at the first step I was knee deep in water. I found that we
                                    were on the edge of a creek which was said to be ten feet deep. I clambered up the
                                    bank on the Railroad track, and was safe;—not the slighest injury could I
                                    see or feel, except that my new $13 hat was "mashed into a
                                    cocked hat". But there we were standing on the road track in the snow, the
                                    night cold, I wet up to my knees—some 60 people of us old and
                                    young—our train gone out of sigh—even the speed we had been
                                    running had carried the sleeping car out of sight. But I was joyful, nearly as
                                    thankful as yesterday when I learned that "Uncle Abraham" had made
                                    me a U.S. Judge.</p>

            <p>A challenge comes out of the "Depression" to those interested in history. Now that
                    the political campaign of 1932 is past, it can be seen that a fundamental factor in our depressed
                    condition is the disparity between our progress in mechanical and scientific achievements and our
                    progress in social control. Science has prolonged human life and exploited new elements and forces;
                    machinery has multiplied production, and man's power and possessions have correspondingly
                    increased. So little progress, however, has been made in the organization of <pb n="308" id="VAA4025-028-4-088"/> human relationship, in what is technically called social sciences and
                    is popularly known as wisdom, that we have at last tangled ourselves up in a snarl from which there
                    is no ready release. The ultimate responsibility rests upon the failure of our civilization to
                    develop through history, economics, and other social sciences an enlightened control of conduct and
                    of natural forces. It is opportune, therefore, in the circle of historians to inquire into the
                    status of history in the general debacle.</p>
            <p>In the last two generations history has become one of the major subjects in education. It has also
                    enlisted the services of a great many writers outside of academic circles. National, state, and
                    local organizations have been formed by those supposedly devoting more or less of their time to its
                    cultivation. It must be confessed, however, that the results have not as yet been commensurate with
                    those attained in the realm of machinery and natural science. Certain errors of statement have been
                    corrected; certain gaps have been filled; and certain individuals and movements have been
                    illuminated by detailed research. That our understanding of the past has been either greatly
                    increased or greatly deepened, however, cannot be asserted. The contribution which has been made to
                    enlightened leadership is not very apparent. The impression one gets from a survey of the field is
                    that most of the historical work being done consists in communicating to the young in imperfect form
                    the accumulation of ideas and facts handed down from the last generation. The comparatively few
                    historians who make significant additions to our knowledge of the past work in detachment and pit
                    the surface here and there but make no organized constructive attack upon the task of explaining the
                    present or guiding the future by an understanding of the past.</p>
            <p>Historical societies ought to do better than this. They should serve as clearing houses in which
                    duplication of work is avoided and stimulation of effort upon intelligently coordinated and
                    constructive studies is afforded. High school, college, and university faculties ought to take
                    advantage of such societies, not only as a means of broadening their field of instruction, but also
                    as a means of specializing historical work, each in its own institution, so far as it can wisely be
                    done, to the end that each may lead out into undeveloped and distinctive fields of study in which
                    significant results may be hoped for.</p>
            <p>Hereditary patriotic organizations might easily contribute <pb n="309" id="VAA4025-028-4-089"/> to
                    the same result. In the present crisis and in the present state of historical science, there is no
                    excuse for those who are organized as descendants or participants in great movements of the past,
                    using such organizations as a means of social pleasure or preferment or as a mere gratification of
                    pride of ances-tory. They ought to line up with others in doing historical work connected with the
                    movements in the light of which they bask. The study of immigration into America, of the
                    significance of the American Revolution, and of similar movements, would be the means of important
                    contributions to an understanding of American institutions and the development of effective agencies
                    for improvement. The many societies organized on an hereditary basis which have come into existence
                    might easily coordinate their efforts along these lines through historical societies. A comparison
                    of numbers and prestige might make such a statement seem incongruous but in the long run it will be
                    found that the real justification for hereditary patriotic societies is historical. Unless they tend
                    to make the American people more historically minded, they will do more harm than good.</p>
            <p>The conclusion of the whole matter is that historians and would-be historians should acknowledge
                    their share of responsibility for our backwardness in intelligent political, economic, and social
                    organization and buckle down to the task of making history shed more light than it has upon the
                    problem of human welfare.</p>

                    </placeName>, 1932. Pp. 147.</head>
            <p>This <hi rend="i">Bulletin</hi> represents a revision and a compilation of a series of articles first
                    published in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">News</hi> during the early months of 1931.</p>
            <p>Two introductory articles deal with the origin and legal status of the county as an institution of
                    local government and with the organization and functions of counties in Indiana. The chief functions
                    of the Indiana county are: the preservation of the peace; the administration of justice; the
                    administration of welfare activities, including indoor poor relief; the construction and maintenance
                    of highways and other public works; the imposition and collection of taxes; the holding of
                    elections; the enforcement of state laws; and, to a limited degree, the administration of education.</p>
            <p>The administration of justice throughout the circuit, superior, and special courts is considered at
                    some length. These courts, it is pointed out, while legally component parts of the state judicial
                    system, may for practical purposes be considered as instrumentalities of county government. The
                    grand and petit juries are described, and criminal and civil procedure outlined. Considered in their
                    relation to the court system are the prosecuting attorney, sheriff, coroner, and clerk of the
                    circuit court.</p>
            <p>One of the longer articles is devoted to a discussion of the board of county commissioners, the
                    administrative body which is, in reality, "the heart of county government in
                    Indiana." Another article pertains to the county council, the agency which, through
                    authorizing appropriations and fixing tax rates, controls the purse strings of the county. Other
                    county officials whose offices and duties are described are the recorder, surveyor, treasurer,
                    auditor, assessor, superintendent of schools, agricultural agent, and inspector of weights and
                    measures. There are also articles on county finance, welfare and health work, and elections. A
                    comprehensive index enhances the value of the <hi rend="i">Bulletin</hi> for reference purposes.</p>
            <p>The approach to the problem of county government in the study is both historical and analytical. When
                    a particular office <pb n="311" id="VAA4025-028-4-091"/> is selected for discussion a brief
                    historical sketch, going back in some instances to English precedents, is followed by an analysis of
                    the powers and duties of the office as prescribed by constitution and statute.</p>
            <p>It is to be regretted that the readability of the various articles is somewhat impaired by the
                    excessive use of direct quotations, frequently of considerable length, from the state constitution
                    and statutes. The text is also encumbered, at points, with details of very minor significance, while
                    discussions of certain fundamental problems of county government are entirely lacking. Thus the
                    author points out that dueling, under our constitution, makes a person ineligible for public office,
                    and that ferrymen are by statute exempt from jury service. Again, an entire paragraph is devoted to
                    listing the salaries of the sheriffs in the ninety-two counties of the state. Yet one looks in vain
                    for a discussion of the current problems of our jury system or for a consideration of the
                    possibilities of county reorganization. Throughout the articles, indeed, more concern is evidenced
                    for constitutional and statutory provisions as to qualifications, powers and compensation of the
                    various county officials than for a description of their everyday activities as agents of
                    government.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding these shortcomings, however, the study represents a substantial contribution toward
                    the satisfaction of a real need. Here is collected and compiled, for the first time, certain
                    information concerning county government which hitherto has existed only in scattered and more or
                    less fugitive sources. This fact, undoubtedly, justifies the publication of the material as a <hi rend="i">Bulletin</hi>. The <hi rend="i">Bulletin</hi> should serve as a helpful handbook for
                    those interested in a study of county institutions in Indiana.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> when the line between that metropolis and <placeName>

                    </placeName> was surrendered to the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Central Company.</p>
            <p>The first work of the Air Line was a narrow gauge road from Delphi to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rensselaer</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Preparations had been made for constructing other parts of the line from Renssalaer to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hammond</settlement>
                    </placeName> and from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Delphi. Very soon after the absorption of the Air Line Company in May, 1881,
                    construction was under way, though it was not until 1884 that the road from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> was completed, including the substitution of standard gauge for narrow gauge track
                    between Delphi and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rensselaer</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The new division crossed the old line at Bradford, the name of this town being changed
                    to <hi rend="i">Monon</hi>. After a few years, it was found possible to operate much faster and
                    better trains over the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan City</region>
                    </placeName>. Indeed the more important traffic of the old road came to be that between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. After passing through the economic troubles following the panic of 1893, which
                    resulted in a receivedship, the road was reorganized under a new charter in 1897 as the
                            <placeName>

                    </placeName> Railway Company. To the public, employees, and even to officials of the Company,
                    however, it is the "Monon".</p>
            <p>The study of Professor Hargrave is confined largely to the early years of the old line, to which he
                    devotes one hundred eighty-one pages, giving eight pages to the Civil War years, and but fourteen to
                    the whole period since 1865. The volume furnishes, in reality a history of the construction and
                    operation of the railway from the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> to <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName> in the period from 1847 to 1858, with a rapid
                    survey of the developments of later years. The chapters dealing with the problems relating to the
                    construction of the line and its management in the early years are filled with interesting
                    information. The illustrations add value to the book, and some good documentary matter is included
                    in the appendix.</p>
            <p>The format of the book leaves several things to be desired, <pb n="313" id="VAA4025-028-4-093"/> and
                    the author has not given sufficient attention to the development of a smooth narrative. There are
                    many dry quotations, which contain valuable information, where the facts could have been presented
                    with more force in the language of the author. On the other hand, there are many quoted passages
                    which add flavor to the story and help the reader to recreate for himself the atmosphere of the
                    period. It is hoped that the author may be able to bring out a somewhat larger edition, improving
                    the style, giving more attention to the importance of the old line during the Civil War and
                    amplifying the history of the Monon since 1881. The expression of this hope for a larger and better
                    edition, does not mean that the reviewer underestimates the great value of the work already
                    accomplished by Professor Hargrave.</p>

                    editing and printing of the letters, was a highly commendable undertaking on the part of the
                    Historical Society. The documents now made available to students of Indiana history will be welcomed
                    by all. Miss Riker has written a sketch of the career of Jennings, partly based on the new

            <p>Not only the owners and managers of the vast productive wealth of today regard the existing economic
                    and social system as the most perfect yet known to man, but so do most of our political leaders,
                    lawyers, clergymen, educators, literary lights and philosophers. There is nothing new about this and
                    it is entirely natural. The same thing was true in regard to all of these classes in the age of
                    feudalism, in the days of kings who ruled by divine right, and in the times of African slavery.
                    Those who are the very pillars of any existing edifice will of course believe in the structure,
                    defend it and resist change. History shows that the other classes mentioned will likewise believe,
                    defend, resist change and build up theories and philosophies to explain and sustain the system in
                    the midst of which they live and carry on.</p>
            <p>Systems that have existed in the past have either disappeared through revolution or through gradual
                    decay and replacement by some new system that has developed from necessity or through the operation
                    of natural forces. Often people have found leaders who have helped them to wreck suddenly or modify
                    through a period of years a wornout régime. It would seem that one of the finest
                    attributes of man is his power to project something superior to what he has attained, recognize it
                    as such and work towards it. If ever the countries of the world had need of leaders ready to
                    exercise this capacity, now would seem to be the time.</p>
            <p>With the power to produce commodities for the well-being of mankind up to or beyond the needs of the
                    earth's vast population, the problem to be solved is one of proper distribution. To the
                    solution of this problem, the energies of the world's greatest minds should be at once
                    directed. The challenge of this problem must be boldly and successfully met, or it must be admitted
                    that man's power to play a real part in controlling his own destiny, when all the materials
                    are ready for his hands to shape them, is a mythical power. The acceptance of defeat now, and
                    especially in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> where nature does her part so fully, means that men prefer to exist and develop under
                    the operation and control of blind forces.</p>
            <p>In our last issue, we were bold enough to propose a way by <pb n="316" id="VAA4025-028-4-096"/> which
                    the executive and legislative branches of the federal government might be kept in harmony. There is,
                    as every intelligent citizen knows, the British Cabinet system which has spread widely among
                    self-governing peoples. The system of government in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> has evolved along a different line, largely because of certain provisions in our
                    written constitution. Our scheme of party government is unique, and, being our own, it should not be
                    thrown overboard for another but it can be modified.</p>
            <p>Deadlocks between the President and Congress, which come too readily and often under our system are
                    fatal to efficiency. They prevent the American people from giving credit to leaders who deserve
                    credit and from placing blame where it belongs. They rob political leaders of the incentive to
                    measure up to their responsibilities. Without seriously changing the nature of the
                    President's power, or the nature of the House or Senate, party government in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> can be vastly improved by some simple changes in the Constitution.</p>
            <p>Let the President be chosen by a <hi rend="i">joint convention</hi> of the members of both branches
                    of Congress, and whenever differences between House and Senate cannot be ironed out through the
                    means regularly employed, let them be settled in <hi rend="i">joint convention</hi>. To make this
                    system work well the terms of Senators, Representatives and President should alike be two years.
                    Otherwise the Senate and House should be left as they are. The establishment of such a system would
                    automatically do away with the Electoral College and presidential campaigns as we now know them. The
                    new system would not prevent the elevation of a state executive, or any other citizen worthy of
                    consideration, to the presidency.</p>
            <p>There is a good deal that is tiresome and indefensible about College Commencements. There are a good
                    many things that members of faculties are expected to do in connection there with that they cannot
                    do with sincerity or pleasure. The conscientious college teacher is at the very time of commencement
                    festivities confronted with stacks of examination papers and reports, and he is really concerned to
                    deal justly with his students. He cannot find much to admire in drummed up reunions and artifically
                    created enthusiasm. Former students who really want to come back to the institution from which <pb n="317" id="VAA4025-028-4-097"/> they were graduated, who really want to look at the campus
                    again and go through the old buildings, and who really want to find and meet once more certain
                    professors—let them come by all means. When they return expecting to get pleasure out of
                    anything else that has been cooked up for them, they are usually disappointed. Would it not be
                    better to greatly modify College Commencements, and confine the exercises to one short program,
                    attended by graduating seniors, those receiving advanced degrees, relatives of any of these, members
                    of the faculty, and any undergraduates or others who may wish to be present. Let the program be of
                    reasonable length and the exercises dignified and artistic. The whole affair will then be helpful
                    and enjoyable, a fitting close to the academic year for all really concerned.</p>
            <p>Much progress has been made in sanitation and in the prevention of disease, especially during the
                    present century. Most people avoid the common drinking cup, the roller-towel has disappeared, and
                    sneezing or coughing in the midst of a crowd is not so common as in earlier days. There is still
                    room for improvement. Anyone can yet observe too many people, even some who are well educated, that
                    take few precautions, violate the simplest rules, and endanger the health of others as well as
                    themselves. As in economic or moral matters, prevention of disasters is better than attempting cures
                    after they come, so in the realm of health, physical or mental, all endeavors to avoid preventable
                    diseases are highly commendable.</p>
            <p>The Indiana Society for Mental Hygiene is to be praised for its objects—"the
                    conservation of mental health and the prevtion of mental disease and defect." It is hoped
                    that much good will come from such meetings of the Society as that held in <placeName>

                    overestimated.</p>
            <p>In several instances questions have been asked in connection with articles published in this <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>, in the hope that answers might be drawn from readers. The results have
                    not been encouraging. Perhaps the queries have escaped the notice of those who could have supplied
                    the desired information. Possibly another effort may bear fruit. At least we shall <pb n="318" id="VAA4025-028-4-098"/> try some questions on the small group who read these pages of
                    "Comment".</p>
            <p>Here are some of the questions: Who wrote the volume portraying the daily experiences of some Civil
                    War soldiers under the title <hi rend="i">Corporal Si Klegg?</hi> Who can furnish some information
                    relative to Taylor N. Snow who lived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and who went to <placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1859? Can anyone furnish the actual measurements of Indiana trees that were from
                    five to ten feet, or more, in diameter? Can any one supply the names of the father and mother of
