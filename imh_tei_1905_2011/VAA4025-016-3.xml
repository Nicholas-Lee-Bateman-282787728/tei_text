            <head>The Progressive Party In Indiana</head>
            <byline>By CARL PAINTER, A. M.</byline>
            <p>The progressive movement in Indiana was simply a component part of the larger movement throughout the
                    nation. It was broader than any political party, and embodied many fundamental measures and
                    principles of political, social and economic reforms common to the platforms of parties for the
                    preceding half century. The Republican party at its inception was prophetic of progressiveism. It
                    undertook to introduce positive economic and social functions into the American government.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> However, after a long lease of power, during which its supremacy was never
                    seriously disputed, corrupt practices had crept in.</p>
            <p>For some time there had been Republicans who stood for a change in their party's
                    leadership. These men wanted it to be more responsive to the will of the people at all times. There
                    was a feeling that the government with its privileges belonged to those who best knew how to manage
                    votes and voters. Corruption in state and local politics grew. There was little public protest. A
                    long period of indifferentism followed. The old story of the man who was enraged because a
                    corruptionist was sure to be elected mayor, yet stayed away from the polls because he had an
                    engagement to go quail hunting, illustrates the attitude of many. Under such circumstances it became
                    possible for political bosses to control elections in their own interests. Some of the earlier
                    progressive Republicans were Robert M. La Follette of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> who was defeated as a candidate for governor of that state in 1894. Later, in 1900 he
                    was elected to that <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName> initiated certain movements in their respective cities looking toward the amelioration
                    of the poorer classes as well as the comfort and welfare of all.</p>
            <p>The Democratic party was not unlike the Republican party in its corruption and failure to measure up
                    to the demand of the times. As in the Republican party, there were certain pioneer Progressive
                    Democrats who because of their revolt against the old processes in state and local government helped
                    to make the way easier for the later Progressive movement as an independent party. Among these the
                    most prominent were William S. U'Ren and George E. Chamberlain of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName>. Joseph W. Folk started "the fight for <placeName>

                    </placeName>" in 1900 which he continued as governor in 1904.</p>
            <p>The smaller third parties had from time to time announced their principles, practically all of which
                    were taken up by the Progressive party.</p>
            <p>Some of their platform planks were woman suffrage, direct election of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senators, abolition of child labor, initiative, referendum and recall, non-partisan
                    tariff commission, income tax, inheritance tax, regulation of railway rates, control of monopolies,
                    mothers' pensions, minimum wage laws, preferential primaries, factory regulation and
                    inspection, employer's liability, workmen's compensation, state insurance
                    acts, home rule for cities, postal savings banks and government ownership of certain public
                    utilities.</p>
            <p>With the succession of Theodore Roosevelt to the presidency a union of the man and the occasion was
                    consummated. It made possible the launching of the Progressive movement on a national scale. The
                    policy of legislative control of the great corporations was begun, and at the same time illegal
                    combinations were prosecuted under the Sherman Anti-trust act of 1890. The national movement
                    extended its authority to the settlement of labor disputes, railroad regulation, pure food, meat
                    inspection, and the great undertaking for the conservation <pb n="175" id="VAA4025-016-3-005"/> of
                    our natural resources. Roosevelt's bold and fearless administration coupled with his
                    striking personality made him the idol of a majority in his party.</p>
            <p>As president, William H. Taft, in order to realize a successful administration, needed only to gather
                    up the spoils of victory which his predecessor had already won for him.</p>
            <p>The Republican reactionaries in congress had longed for the end of Roosevelt's term to
                    come, counting the days until his successor would be inaugurated. It was doubtless Mr.
                    Taft's intentions to keep in between the two factions of his party, and in his failure to
                    give his aid to the Progressives he alienated them. To them it seemed clear that he had fallen
                    entirely into the hands of the conservatives.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> For the ordinary administrative
                    duties of the presidential office Taft was a good man, but along the new lines of governmental
                    activity he failed to make good. It seemed that he always did the wrong thing at the wrong time
                    although perhaps unintentionally.</p>
            <p>While there were Progressives in all parties the Republican party was the only one to experience an
                    open rupture. The first evidence of division was in the house of representatives during the special
                    session of congress, March, 1909. At this time the "insurgents" as they were
                    called, arrayed themselves against Speaker Joseph G. Cannon. "Uncle Joe" was
                    accused of exercising arbitrary power and of holding back desirable legislation.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Republican party had been returned to power in 1908 with the promise in its platform that the
                    tariff would be revised. It was generally understood that revision meant a reduction on most
                    schedules. The House tariff bill was amended by the finance committee of the Senate in a way that
                    made it unsatisfactory to senators from the west. On the final vote ten of these senators voted
                    against the bill.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> All of these senators save <placeName>

                    Progressive Republicans felt that he should have helped them more. They therefore speedily severed
                    relationship with him when he declared that the tariff measure was "the best that had ever
                    been passed."<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An outstanding feature of the off year elections in 1910 was the schism in the Republican party. Six
                    normally Republican states elected Democratic governors. The Democrats gained control of the house
                    of representatives by a majority of 64. In the Senate they were only outnumbered by eight. It was
                    obvious that most of the Republican strength had been due to progressive assistance. The elections
                    clearly rebuked the Republican "standpatter" and indicated that the voters
                    supported the progressive position.</p>
            <p>As the break grew wider the Progressives formed a definite organization. On January 23, 1911, the
                    Progressive Republican League was started in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> "to promote popular government and progressive legislation."<hi rend="sup">6</hi> At this time five reforms were advocated: (1) Direct election of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senators, (2) direct primaries for nomination of all elective officials, (3) direct
                    election of delegates to national convention, (4) amending state constitutions to provide for
                    initiative, referendum, and recall, (5) a thoroughgoing corrupt practices act. Senator Jonathan
                    Bourne was made president of the league. Other leading members were Senators La Follette, Cummins,
                    Bristow, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Clapp, Gronna, Beveridge; governors of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>, <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>, <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>, <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
               </placeName>
                    and Wyoming; Gifford Pinchot, James R. Garfield, and Louis D. Brandeis. The league showed its
                    political importance when in the reorganization of the Senate it demanded a representation in the
                    Republican committees at a ratio of one to four. Such assignments were to be made by La Follette,
                    Cummins, Bourne and Bristow, Progressive members of the Republican steering committee in the upper
                    house. In spite of Republican protest the Progressives virtually acted as a third party during the
                    special session from April to August, 1911. They opposed Canadian reciprocity, but voted for the
                    Democratic measures including the farmers' free list, <list type="footnotes">

                    measures about two-thirds of the Progressives formed a coalition with the House Democrats in an
                    unsuccessful attempt to pass the free list and woolen bills over the veto.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the summer the leading Progressive Republicans continued to attack the President in various
                    public utterances. He was accused of being too friendly to the large corporations. Moreover, the
                    attitude he took toward the Payne-Aldrich bill, Canadian reciprocity and his conservation policy was
                    generally condemned.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> On the sixteenth of October about two hundred Progressive

                    principles, as several speakers expressed, would be countenanced by the aggressive men gathered
                    together under the banner of progressiveism.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> The selection of a presidential

                    accomplish this.</p>
            <p>Republican sentiment in Indiana was still progressive, but it was not strong for La Follette. When
                    some of the senator's boosters chose to abandon the impersonal fight for tariff and
                    industrial reform and resolve the movement into a vehicle for his ambition they parted company with
                    the rank and file in Indiana. Nevertheless, the devotees of "anything to beat
                    Taft" were beginning to realize that, after all, the Payne-Aldrich bill was not the only
                    thing that had happened in the last two years, nor the only thing that the people would be thinking
                    of when they came to select a president. Further tariff reform might be undertaken during the winter
                    session of congress. If no relief was granted on the woolen and cotton schedule the country would
                    then understand who was to blame. Gradually public opinion was beginning to identify the president
                    with other things. He could hardly be held responsible for the Payne act except as playing the part
                    of "first aid to the injured" at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Winona</settlement>
                    </placeName>. La Follette, even, considered that the tariff was being overmuch discussed. To refrain
                    from raising that issue would enable him to hold the farmer protectionist vote and not alienate
                    those held by direct primaries, just as a trust plank of the <placeName>

                    November. It was argued that such a visit would be unprecedented and would embarrass the new county
                    committee after the holidays by seeming to indorse a candidate in opposition to the President. La
                    Follette's friends therefore declared that a Progressive party would be formed to
                    entertain him and to help further his candidacy in that section. These men felt that Taft had
                    already intimated his fear in an address at the <placeName>

            <p>In order to determine just who was the man most likely to defeat Mr. Taft's nomination the
                    La Follette following urged the use of preferential primaries wherever possible. The Progressives
                    planned to bring the matter up before the Republican national committee when it met in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, December 12, but since they could only command about six votes of the committee, the
                    attempt was doomed to failure. The friends of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> man however were expecting the coup to fail but contended that its failure would be a
                    help rather than a hindrance. "Every knock a boost" was their slogan. By rejecting
                    the scheme, Republican standpatters would be shown up. The only defense they offered was that any
                    such change would cause confusion. Under the usual convention system they could control this
                    election of delegates in favor of President Taft. At the <placeName>

                    </placeName> meeting of the national committee, December 12, the scheme was rejected, as predicted
                    by the progressives. The spirit of the national body was decidedly pro-Taft. Harry S. New, as
                    Indiana's member, was strongly opposed to the primary idea. After overcoming some slight
                    opposition he was made chairman of the sub-committee to arrange for the national convention to be
                    held in <placeName>

            <p>Indiana politics was not greatly influenced earlier in the year by the Progressive agitation in the
                    neighboring states. According to Walter L. Hauser, La Follette's field secretary, the
                    state was on the map for the "opening gun" in the presidential campaign of his
                    leader. The gun was to be loaded, primed and fired for Indiana and by Indiana. Out of
                    "senatorial courtesy" Indiana had been left alone by insurgents pending
                    Beveridge's return from Europe. The future course of Progressiveism in the state was
                    still admittedly up to him.</p>
            <p>At this time an unexpected statement by State Chairman Edwin M. Lee, that Taft could not carry
                    Indiana, caused unusual political activity in the Hoosier state. Mr. Lee had been in <placeName>

                    </placeName> after his arrival there, December 12. This left no doubt of the possibility of a fight
                    being made in Indiana to prevent Taft instructions in the district conventions and in the state
                    convention <list type="footnotes">

                    large to the national convention. Copies of the statement were eagerly sought for in the lobby of
                    the Willard hotel where Mr. Lee was staying. Newspaper men heard that a sensation was on tap and
                    flocked to the Indiana man. Republican State Chairman Walter <placeName>

                    </placeName> had preceded Mr. Lee in declaring against the availability of Mr. Taft. With the
                    impetus given the movement to prevent instructed delegates to the national convention it would now
                    go on with considerable co-operation throughout the country. It was expected that an anti-Taft
                    organization would be effected in Indiana within the following few weeks. Lee's statement
                    was as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Mr. Taft cannot carry Indiana. If he is the Republican nominee our fight is lost before a gun
                            is fired. As one of his original friends I have been driven to this knowledge with extreme
                            reluctance. I have hoped he would be the man to lead us next year and have personally
                            declared for him three separate times. I have spent the last eight months traveling over
                            Indiana, have visited each county in the state and some counties many times. For a time it
                            looked as if we might pull Mr. Taft through and I fostered favorable sentiment to him
                            wherever I could because I am his personal friend and it seemed logical and good party
                            policy that he should succeed himself. From the first, however, I found no enthusiastic
                            sentiment for him. The feeling of the precinct workers and the rank and file seemed to be
                            one of sufferance that he had the solid south and would be nominated and we might as well
                            make the best of it. In the last two months sentiment has changed to pronounced
                            dissatisfaction with Mr. Taft as our leader. A few days ago I sent letters to our precinct
                            committeemen-there are more than three thousand of them-asking for a statement of political
                            conditions in their precincts. I have received already hundreds of replies. Four out of five
                            of these letters from precinct committeemen state that there is dissatisfaction with Mr.
                            Taft among the voters, and this too although in my letter I did not ask for opinions on that
                            point, but only on general conditions. This proves to me what my personal contact with our
                            voters-and I have personally interviewed literally thousands of them in the last eight
                            months-had led me to fear, there is not the slightest chance to carry Indiana for Mr.
                        Taft.</p>

            <p>The formation of a new Republican state committee in Indiana brought out the real cleavage of the
                    members of that party. The issue was Taft instructions or an open field. Mr. Lee declared that on
                    November 21 he had told President Taft <pb n="181" id="VAA4025-016-3-011"/> that it would be
                    impossible to carry Indiana with him as the nominee. To national chairman Charles D. Hilles he
                    stated that the use of federal patronage and the attempt to force activity of federal appointees in
                    building up a Taft machine in Indiana would "result only in the promotion of additional
                    factional feeling." Medill McCormick, returning to La Follette's headquarters in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> from a tour of investigation in Indiana, declared that all the information he had been
                    able to obtain tended to bear out the statement of Mr. Lee. When the state committee met to fix
                    dates for the meetings in the districts to choose district members of the state committee, all
                    conceded this would take place. Chairman Lee favored the second week in January for these meetings
                    so that the anti-Taft sentiment would have time to grow. Some prominent Republicans of the state
                    issued statements concerning Mr. Lee's actions.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> It was generally

                                will be the same strong candidate in 1912 that he was in 1908. President Taft proved to
                                be remarkably vigorous as a vote getter in the county and district three years ago. So

                    Hemenway and James E. Watson of the old state organization lined up against Chairman Lee. They
                    refused to admit the correctness of Mr. Lee's views as to Taft's strength in
                    Indiana. While the state chairmanship at that time, December 17, was one of the chief things at
                    issue in Republican party politics, the matter of instructions for the Indiana delegation to the
                    Republican national convention was not entirely forgotten. Men on both sides of the organization
                    contest asserted that it was altogether probable that when the time came the Indiana delegation
                    would go forth uninstructed. Men who had in mind the uncertainties and possibilities of politics as
                    well as the high standing of Charles W. Fairbanks as a presidential possibility were expected to
                    insist upon non-instruction for an outside man. The Lee forces had not yet said much concerning this
                    matter but it was understood that their efforts included the selection of national delegates as well
                    as the naming of a new state committeeman for the party.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in defense of the administration. He accepted the invitation and made his speech in the
                    evening of March 11. His conclusion was that the future historian would find difficulty in
                    accounting for the war waged against Taft by some Republicans. The platform of 1908, he said,
                    contained many specific pledges and few presidents had shown such an earnest determination to carry
                    out their party's pledges. According to the cabinet member Taft was not criticized so
                    much for recreancy to the platform, the last authoritative declaration of party faith, as for
                    refusal to embrace new doctrines which had never been accepted by the party at all and which were
                    not at that time articles in the Republican creed. The principles of the initiative, referendum and
                    recall, according to Secretary Nagel's views were advocated by men ambitious for national
                    office and generally avoided by those having to do with local affairs. Each was therefore making
                    promises to which he could not be successfully held.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

            <p>This was a time of great stirring and ferment throughout the land. The people were groping, seeking
                    for a new and better condition of things. After having secured new grants of control over their
                    government they were now asking for still more. The era of democracy and the "average
                    man" seemed to be at hand.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Economic conditions only intensified the
                    unrest. The high cost of living was a problem being grappled with perhaps as much in Indiana as in
                    any other state. Reform legislation, "Progressiveness" generally, was quite the
                    thing in the campaign. It was the popular method of the hour to capture public fancy. This was more
                    noticeable in the west where the insurgent members of congress had found themselves lined up against
                    the members from the east over the Payne-Aldrich tariff; where Progressive legislation had already
                    been enacted and where the spirit of the movement was demonstrated in <placeName>

                    observations as a Republican are interesting as showing the general frame of mind in this section.

                        <p>The Republican party as an organization is in peril. Those in charge have been giving
                            attention only to the insurgents. They have overlooked the conservatives, the old liner who
                            stood for gold and a protective tariff. Business is not good beyond the

                            There is lack of confidence in the future, too much agitation, threat and uncertainty as to
                            the interpretation of the law. One feature not reckoned with is that the fight for the <placeName>

                            from fear that that party may not win in the election. The situation is similar to that of
                            1884 and that of 1892. If we can shift the situation from a question of trusting men to
                            party policies, and get our forces together we can win. Our internecine trouble will hurt us
                            at the polls. If the Democrats indorse the recall and tariff for revenue only the
                            Republicans can pull together on these issues. I found only one prace favoring the recall
                            and none for revenue only tariff. The insurgents are now more hopeful than the old line

            <p>In Indiana the situation was almost without parallel as far as the Republicans were concerned. One
                    could hardly have placed a finger on the average worker and declared positively where he stood.
                    Lines were crossed as never before. Men who stood with the old organization were coming out for
                    Roosevelt or La Follette. On the other hand men who had been followers of former Senator Beveridge
                    were lining up behind Taft. A third term issue, the initiative, referendum and recall, no doubt,
                    alienated a number of Roosevelt admirers. As for the Democrats the hope of victory would hold them
                    together and they would endeavor to foster the breach in the Republican ranks.</p>
            <p>The Socialists felt that by refusing to support the Progressives they could add to their own
                    strength. Their objection to the ideas of the Roosevelt following was that they tended toward a sort
                    of state socialism not in harmony with the principles of the Socialist party. The Prohibitionists
                    were too much interested in accomplishing their purpose through their own party to endeavor to
                    attain it through another. On the whole it appeared that the Progressive Republicans in Indiana
                    would labor to gain control of the party organization within the state. Having done this they would
                    appeal for support to independent voters from all other parties, some former Socialists, some
                    Democrats, some Prohibitionists. Just how successful they would be no one could predict.</p>
            <p>President Taft, Senator La Follette and former President Roosevelt each endeavored, either directly
                    or indirectly, to obtain support for his candidate. The <placeName>

                    place. Roosevelt clubs were formed throughout the state to promote his candidacy. Some men hesitated
                    to favor him because of the third term argument, still others because he came out so plainly in
                    favor of the referendum and recall before the <placeName>

            <p>Immediately after this event his candidacy received another impetus when Senator La Follette was
                    reported to be in ill health so that he would probably withdraw from the race. Men in politics for
                    pass time, diversion and political preferment favored Taft. Traveling men, literary men, physicians,
                    students and social workers as a rule favored the Colonel. The standpat element maintained that the
                    Republican party would be wrecked if Roosevelt continued as a candidate. To these men his advocacy
                    of preferential primaries at a comparatively late date would be a good excuse for his retirement in
                    case his will in this matter suffered defeat.</p>
            <p>President Taft stated the position of most of his sympathizers in Indiana when he made a brief
                    address at <placeName>

                    the campaign." The issue of "killing the bosses" had no place in the
                    contest for he was "as much against the bosses as their distinguished fellow townsman,
                    William D. Foulke." In 1908 Roosevelt had commended him to the people in terms of glowing
                    eulogy, but after four years the ex-president would return to office as "the only fit man
                    for the job."<hi rend="sup">24</hi>

                    The claim of the Indiana chairman was doubtless made with good intentions and for the good of the
                    party. Progressive sentiment began to manifest itself first of all in the border counties of the
                    state. Among these <placeName>

                    to the control of the party organization, the selection of various delegates and the naming of
                    candidates. The plan of the national Progressive workers was to have a complete party organization.

                    </placeName> it appears that there must have been serious misrepresentation of the Progressive
                    strength in the primary and convention. The resolutions of the standpat majority confirmed the party

            <p>The Progressives determined that a final effort should be made to carry the remaining district mass

                    the fact that four Roosevelt delegates to both the state and Third district conventions were chosen.

                    by Taft by a vote of 70 4/10 to 54 6/10, William H. Dye and William Endicott being selected as

                    followers. "Rump" meetings were held by the latter in the Third, Sixth and
                    Eleventh districts. The Taft men were able to control the selection of approximately eight members
                    on each of the various comimttees.</p>
            <p>The credentials committee acted on some 134 contests. Of this number the Taft supporters gained 130,
                    while the Roosevelt ranks were strengthened by one additional delegate from Posey county and from a <placeName>

                    </placeName> ward. It was necessary for the police to assist Chairman John B. Cockrum in maintaining
                    order. Taft members of the committee had been selected from the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth,
                    Sixth, Seventh and Tenth districts, leaving the Eighth, Ninth, Eleventh, Twelfth and Thirteenth for
                    the Reesevelt sympathizers. Edward Warfel of the Sixth district and A. P. Hauss of the Third were
                    unsuccessful Roosevelt contestants for places on the committee.</p>
            <p>The first test of the comparative strength of the two forces came on a vote to table the minority
                    report of the Roosevelt members of the credentials committee. The vote stood 772 to table, against
                    667 opposed. This indicated that the Taft men had a majority of about 105 in the convention.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

            <p>At a conference of the Roosevelt men in the headquarters just before the convention it was decided to
                    propose a compromise. The substance of the plan was that two Roosevelt and two Taft delegates at
                    large be named by the convention. Wallace B. Campbell of Anderson, Eighth district member of the
                    resolutions committee, made the proposal. Frederick Landis of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName> was selected to present the conference plan. During the session of the convention
                    Horace Stilwell discussed the plan with Mr. Harry S. New, but he refused to give it any
                    encouragement. Charles H. Campbell then tried James P. Goodrich, but he also disapproved of such
                    action. Practically all the Roosevelt men were active in behalf of such a course, but their
                    opponents allowed them no headway. With the regular organization men it was simply a case of taking
                    everything since it was possible to do so.</p>

            <p>The platform was adopted by the resolutions committee by a vote of 7 to 6. Jesse L. Dunning, an
                    ex-soldier and Roosevelt man, offered a resolution to indorse the Sherwood pension bill, already
                    passed by the house of representatives, with a petition to the Senate and President that they
                    respectively pass and sign it. He also proposed to strike out the endorsement of President Taft.
                    Both of these proposals were lost by a 7 to 6 vote. Wallace B. Campbell suggested that the
                    declaration against the initiative, referendum and recall be omitted, but this was not done. The
                    delegates at large were instructed to vote for Taft. On the tariff question the resolutions were
                    orthodox, but it was so subordinated that even a free trader could not object to the wording. This
                    was accomplished by the assertion that "the Republican party has established and maintained
                    protection." Taft's administrative achievements were summarized and commended,
                    while the third term idea of the former president was opposed as something which "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Jefferson or Jackson would not have and which Grant could not get."<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

            <p>Attention was now directed to the national convention of the party. All contests would be finally
                    decided there and the true strength and character of the Progressive movement manifest itself. On

                    before the national committee by Horace Stilwell of Anderson.</p>
            <p>Long before the convention date State Chairman Simms announced that he was swamped with requests for
                    tickets. This showed a great interest in Indiana, for as a rule the state has been rather tardy in
                    stirring up enthusiasm of this kind, but once started it eclipsed almost any of our commonwealths.
                    As one Republican put it, the "Hoosiers love a good scrap." Many Roosevelt men,
                    enthusiastic over their leader and angered because of machine domination, were eager to journey to
                    the Windy City for a final encounter with the foe. They would oppose Senator Root for the temporary
                    chairmanship offering Governor Hadley of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> instead. When their leader arrived it was planned to make a great demonstration.</p>

                    roll prepared by the national committee it almost caused a fight between some of the Indiana
                    delegates. He stated that the Seventh Indiana district returns were made up by election officials
                    without even opening the ballot box. William E. English, one of the Seventh district delegates,

                    committee. This brought out the second test vote of the convention showing a gain for the Taft men,
                    the figuring being 564 to 510.</p>
            <p>The vote for President stood Taft 561, La Follette 41, Roosevelt 197, Cummins 17, Hughes 2, not
                    voting 344, absent 6. On this contest seven of the Roosevelt delegates from Indiana obeyed the
                    orders of their chief and remained silent while Porter, Bryson, and Toner voted for the Oyster Bay
                    man. The vote for vice-president was Sherman 597; Hadley 14; Borah 21; Merriam 20; Beveridge 1;
                    Howard F. Gillette of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> 2; not voting 352; absent 71. Porter cast his vote for Sherman while Bryson and Toner
                    supported Hadley.</p>
            <p>The platform adopted by the convention was marked by several innovations. It dealt with issues in a
                    general way yet more concisely than usual. No direct reference was to be found in it to any pending
                    legislation at least by name. The party still believed in a protective tariff but admitted that some
                    schedules were too high recommending a tariff board to make adjustments. In censuring the Democratic
                    tariff bills of the last congressional session and denying that the protective tariff was
                    responsible for high prices two <pb n="200" id="VAA4025-016-3-030"/> blunders were made according to
                    the opinion of many. It was admitted that a simplification of existing methods of removing derelict
                    judges would be helpful when such a course became necessary. The recall was considered unwise, for
                    the integrity of the courts might be impaired by its operation. Other recommendations included the
                    continuance of Taft's peace treaties; supplementary legislation for the Sherman
                    anti-trust law; steps toward farm loans and financial readjustment; the merit system; campaign
                    publicity; parcel post; adequate navy and marine; flood prevention; reclamation; river and harbor
                    work; the leasing system for Alaska; safety at sea; immigration legislation; continuation of the
                    previous policy toward Porto Rico and the Philippines.</p>
            <p>When it became evident that his contesting delegates would not be seated Colonel Roosevelt refused to
                    recognize the further procedure of the convention as binding. Much talk emanated from the Coliseum
                    as to the likelihood of a third party being formed. A conference of Progressive leaders on the night
                    of June 20 resulted in the final decision as to their future course with a statement from the third
                    termer himself: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>If the honestly elected majority of the convention chooses to proceed with business and to
                            nominate me as the candidate of the real Republican party I shall accept. If some of them
                            fear to take such a stand and the remainder chooses to inaugurate a movement to nominate me
                            for the presidency as a Progressive on a Progressive platform, and if in such event the
                            general feeling among Progressives favors my being nominated, I shall accept.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>The meaning of this announcement was clear. It meant a bolt that would not seem like a bolt. While
                    the Republican party platform might appear to be very progressive-as it did-yet the party could not
                    be trusted to carry out the pledges made therein so that a new party resulted. A sharp difference of
                    opinion developed among Roosevelt supporters. On one side a group of radicals headed by Governor

            <p>A majority of the Roosevelt delegates were willing and indeed eager to follow him in a new venture.
                    By forming a temporary organization, at a mass meeting, the delegates were held together until more
                    definite steps could be taken. Work toward the formation of a Progressive party, as it was to be
                    known, started immediately throughout the country.</p>
            <p rend="center">ORGANIZING THE NEW PARTY</p>
            <p>Following pre-arranged plans, a majority of the Roosevelt delegates to the national convention
                    following an informal and unofficial nomination of Mr. Roosevelt for the presidency, gathered at
                    Orchestra hall on the night of June 22, where they formulated agreements for their future course.
                    The new party determined to hold state conventions for nominating electoral, state and legislative
                    tickets where there seemed any chance of success. At a conference between Roosevelt and Governor
                    Johnson of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>, Sunday June 23, it was agreed that the latter should appoint a committee of seven
                    which, with the former's advice, should do the preliminary work of organizing a new party
                    and issue the call for a national convention to be held early in August at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Denver</settlement>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>No prominent Indiana political leader appeared on the stage, or went on record as taking an active
                    part in the "rump" meeting at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Seven out of the ten Roosevelt delegates to the G. O. P. convention were reported as
                    attending. The list included William Holton Dye of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Noblesville</settlement>
                    </placeName> (9th District); Dave Harris of <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> (8th District); William Endicott of <placeName>

                    </placeName> of Waterloo (13th District). These men received the instructions to return home and
                    ascertain the popular sentiment. If the people back home balked it was understood there should be no
                    third party.</p>
            <p>Edwin M. Lee called a conference of Progressives to meet in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> on July 3. In a telegram to Theodore Roosevelt he had asked advice as to the
                    advisability of launching <pb n="202" id="VAA4025-016-3-032"/> a third party in Indiana.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> To the telegram Roosevelt replied: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I heartily approve the project. Go on with the commission of the Progressive party. Such a
                            party must of necessity break away from both of the old organizations.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Considerable difference of opinion prevailed among the men before the conference opened. All were not
                    willing to go as far as Mr. Lee who believed that a third party should be organized immediately.
                    However, it appeared as if Mr. Lee would make a strong effort to effect a temporary
                    stateorganization.</p>
            <p>Just before the conference met in the Claypool Hotel a number of the men frankly admitted that they
                    were "up in the air" and were undecided just what to do. Those who came from other
                    counties showed a disposition to investigate the Indiana situation from all angles. R. R. Rerick and
                    Louis Litman of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lagrange</region>
                    </placeName> called at Republican State Headquarters to talk things over with State Chairman Fred A.
                    Sims. Some of the more enthusiastic members, who especially desired to punish the Republican machine
                    for its sins, were Rudolph G. Leeds and Ed Harris of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>

            <p>More conservative views were held by William D. Headrick and Charles O. Roemler of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. They were inclined to stay with the Republican party making an effort to obtain a good
                    Republican state ticket and adopt a good Progressive platform. In other words those who were
                    inclined to be regular politically sought to cleanse the old party from within, failing in which it
                    would then be time to get out.</p>
            <p>The "Big Chief" was out already. His telegram urging the
                    "necessity" of a break from both the old parties practically assured a formal
                    schism in Republican ranks. Some <list type="footnotes">

                    speakers asserted their belief in the principles of the Republican party but usually advanced the
                    theory that Roosevelt was the "real" nominee and President Taft the

            <p>Mr. Lee read a long letter from Horace C. Stilwell of Anderson explaining why a new political
                    movement was necessary. Comment on the letter led some to say that Stilwell was being groomed for
                    governor. Others mentioned were Albert J. Beveridge and Frederick Landis. Beveridge was in <placeName>

                    time, a state committee could not be selected by primaries but according to the old party methods.</p>

                    Republicans" used in the resolutions. He said a Democrat who wished to join in the movement
                    had expressed the wish at the beginning of the meeting that the designation of "Progressive
                    Republican" had not been used but that the men in the new movement should style themselves

                    date set was for August 5, and the place selected <placeName>

                    forty states signed the call. For Indiana, Edwin M. Lee and Horace G. Stilwell affixed their
                    signatures. Each state was to select delegates by its own method. The representation was cut down to
                    one-half of the regular numbers. This was considered advisable because the convention would be
                    largely a deliberative body and composed of a class of men altogether different from those who
                    usually attended conventions.</p>

                    authorized by the third party conference of July 3. At this meeting, July 12, further details of the
                    state organization were planned. Two problems of more than ordinary importance came up for
                    discussion. One of these, that of putting independent tickets in the field where some Roosevelt men
                    were already nominees of the Republican party brought out some earnest discussion. The argument
                    against such a course was that the chances of both parties would be ruined.</p>
            <p>The second question was whether the state convention, if one was called, should be held before or
                    after the Republican state convention dated for August 6. The prevailing sentiment favored an
                    earlier date, holding that if the third party waited until after the Republican convention, the
                    latter would adopt as radical a platform and nominate as radical a Progressive ticket as it could
                    find timber for, in order to anticipate if possible the third party platform and ticket.</p>
            <p>The committee decided that Roosevelt men nominated for presidential electors by the Republicans in
                    five of the thirteen districts should resign.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> John I. Nixon of Attica, a
                    Roosevelt man so nominated in the Ninth distict, had already resigned by sending a letter to State
                    Chairman Sims of the Republican state committee. Cornelius McGrevey from the Eleventh district also
                    expected to resign unless the Republican state convention put him off before he had a chance to do
                    so. Austin W. Stults of Ft. Wayne said he would remain regular, although he had worked for Roosevelt
                    and had been nominated as a Roosevelt elector. Fred S. Buggie of <placeName>

                    and have charge of all arrangements for it. The call also included an address to the people setting
                    forth the third party's appeal for support. Headquarters were to be opened at the English
                    Hotel on July 15, but the location was subsequently changed to the Majestic Building before that
                    date. August 1 was named as the date for the state convention. The committee decided to enter the
                    field in every county, nominating congressional, judicial, legislative and county tickets all over
                    the state. One delegate was allowed for every 500 votes cast by all parties at the last general
                    election. According to this ratio the total number would be about 1400. A state committee should be
                    elected by district delegates on the night before the convention. The new committee thus chosen
                    would then elect a state chairman. Recommendations were given for the holding of congressional,
                    county and other local conventions as well as for the nomination of tickets. At the state convention
                    a state ticket would be nominated, a platform drawn up and two delegates-at-large selected to attend
                    the national convention at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, August 5. Considerable opposition to local tickets was manifested, so that a
                    compromise resulted, the committee merely recommending that third party tickets be nominated along
                    with a full set of presidential electors.</p>
            <p>July of this year was marked by new party organization all over the state. Most of this activity was
                    to be found in the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Eleventh, Twelfth and Thirteenth districts where
                    the Progressives were strongest. The work consisted chiefly in perfecting county party machinery by
                    electing chairmen, secretaries and treasurers. Speakers at these meetings regularly denounced the
                    tactics used by the Republican party at its state and national conventions. An address made by Fred

                    political affiliations were present. The list included seven original Taft men, thirteen Roosevelt
                    men, five Democrats, three Prohibitionists, two Socialists and one who styled himself a Wilson
                    Republican. Another feature was the taking of a collection to meet expenses. Each ward was expected
                    to raise twenty-five dollars for committee expenses. According to Willitts A. Bastian, the speaker,
                    there should be no "slush" fund. The Progressive party organization in Indiana was
                    comparatively poor financially most of the time.</p>
            <p>The district organizers appointed by Chairman Lee deserved more than ordinary credit for the
                    substantial machinery which they built up within so short a time. Regular Republicans naturally
                    accused the Democrats of "egging" the new movement along. This was true, but the
                    Republicans received honest encouragement as well. From a Democratic viewpoint the Indiana situation
                    presented a united Democracy, a disorganized, disgraced, warring opposition party that had utterly
                    failed to carry out its pledges. For them it was well for the Progressive and Republicans to fight
                    it out, and they quoted approvingly the old proverb "when rogues fall out, just men get
                    their dues." Good Democratic politics therefore dictated the policy of giving aid and
                    comfort to both factions in the enemy's ranks.</p>
            <p>Printed programs sent out from the state headquarters gave instructions for the holding of county
                    mass conventions (July 27 and 29) for the purpose of selecting delegates to the state convention,
                    August 1. These gave the apportionment of delegates to the various counties, the locations of
                    district meetings on the night before the convention, the order in which nominations would be made.
                    On the front page of the program was printed "Thou shalt not steal" while on the
                    inside appeared the slogan by the Bull Moosers, "We would rather be right than
                    regular."</p>

                    tickets and where the candidates had already been working on their fences. It seemed unjust to vote
                    against a Progressive candidate nominated by the Republicans simply because he happened to be
                    selected before the time of the new party.</p>
            <p>Those advocating the local tickets advanced the theory that the local third partyites could hold over
                    the heads of candidates already nominated the threat of a third ticket in order to force them to
                    agree to support the Bull Moose electoral vote. The fact that some Republican nominees resented this
                    intimidation and that the third party muddle would open the way for effective work by the Democrats
                    added to the unpleasantness of the situation.</p>
            <p>In Vanderburg county the Bull Moosers divided into three factions over the local ticket question. One
                    headed by Charles T. Smith who, it was said, didn't want anything injurious done to the
                    Democrats, was not strong for either a state, congressional or county ticket; another headed by
                    Samuel Crumbaker, former state senator, anxious to have a state ticket nominated, did not care about
                    a congressional ticket but opposed a county ticket; while the third group, led by Robert Gore,
                    demanded all kinds of tickets. According to Republican interpretation these three leaders picked
                    their share of the thirty-seven delegates chosen by the county convention for the state gathering,
                    August 8.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> However true or false the report, it showed a difference of opinion
                    among Progressives as to the effect third tickets would have upon the success of their cause. The
                    election returns seemed to indicate that Indiana voters, like those from the other states,
                    considered the Progressive issues more national than state or local.</p>
            <p>Delegates met by districts on the night of July 31 to elect district members of the various
                    committees, officers of the state convention, district chairmen and candidates for electors. The
                    meetings were but fairly well attended because there were no contests to speak of. The credentials
                    committee which met after the district meetings adjourned having no business before it.</p>

                    </placeName>, was chairman; Monte M. Katterjohn, of Boonville, secretary. Samuel Crumbaker, of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, obtained a coveted place on the Resolutions committee.</p>
            <p>Second district: Sentiment was strong for "Beveridge for governor," being brought
                    out in a speech by Judge James B. Wilson, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, secretary. Speeches were also made by Dr. Amos S. Hershey, of Indiana University, H.
                    R. Louder, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomfield</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and Judge T. J. Terhune, of Linton.</p>
            <p>Third district: <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington county</region>
                    </placeName> was not represented but the room finally became filled. H. C. Poindexter, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was chairman. A feeling prevailing that the Third district ought to be represented on
                    the state ticket, Lawson M. Mace was therefore indorsed for attorney general, and Beveridge for
                    governor. According to reports, one speaker in likening Roosevelt to Moses, who would lead the
                    people to victory, became so excited that he dropped his false teeth. He caught them however before
                    they hit the floor. All the counties desired representation of some sort which accounted for the
                    selection of three delegates to the national convention, each with a one-third vote, and three
                    alternates.</p>
            <p>Fourth district: Fred Morgan, from Batesville, was made chairman and O. I. Demaree, secretary. There
                    were no contests, all places being filled by acclamation except one instance, that of presidential
                    electors. John Overmyer, of Jennings county, was nominated as well as Captain W. Haiken, of Hope.
                    Overmeyer then withdrew, being placed on the resolutions committee instead. Two delegates to the
                    national convention, with a one-half vote each, were chosen and instructed for Roosevelt. Beveridge
                    and Mace were also indorsed.</p>
            <p>Fifth district: There was but little excitement developed in the Fifth district meeting. W. J.
                    Snyder, of <placeName>
                        <country reg="bl">Brazil</country>
                    </placeName>, an alternate delegate to the national convention, made a speech in which he urged the
                    workers to "go back home and buttonhole the Democrats." Richard H. Crouch, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greencastle</settlement>
                    </placeName>, later district chairman, presided with John T. Hume, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Danville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, as secretary.</p>
            <p>Sixth district: Men from the Sixth district discussed the <pb n="211" id="VAA4025-016-3-041"/> wet
                    and dry issue for some time. Rudolph Leeds, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, declared he would not accept a nomination for the resolutions committee if he had to
                    stand for a local option plank. He preferred instead the initiative and referendum issue. F. W.
                    Hemenway, of Union county; G. R. Carter, of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette county</region>
                    </placeName>, and W. R. Steele, of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Henry county</region>
                    </placeName>, well-known temperance men, said they favored the initiative and referendum. Leeds was
                    elected to the resolution committee. William Dudley Foulke in a speech eulogized Roosevelt, but said
                    the new party would have to look out for Wilson whom he characterized as an "honest
                    man." Will Bond, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was indorsed for judge of the Fourth Indiana judicial circuit.</p>
            <p>Seventh district: Men representing the Seventh Indiana district engaged in a rather long and noisy
                    session. Dr. R. C. Light, of Broad Ripple, acted as chairman. Harry O. Chamberlin, who had been
                    provisional district chairman, was elected to that position permanently. The difficulty arose in
                    electing delegates to the national convention. Lucius B. Swift, a Democrat before 1896, then a
                    Republican until 1912, but finally a Progressive, was chosen as a delegate to the convention as
                    planned prior to the meeting. The same thing was expected in the case of Charles S. Lewis, but since
                    eight names were proposed the delegates voted for four allowing the others to be alternates. The
                    delegates chosen were Swift, Henry Reminger, J. F. Wild and Dr. R. C. Light. The alternates named
                    were Charles S. Lewis, Z. V. Zartman, G. B. Griffey and Dr. G. W Ward (colored).</p>
            <p>Eighth district: Clayte Sells, of Anderson, presided at the Eighth district meeting. He was afterward
                    elected district chairman. Rev. Geo. W. Schraeder, of Winchester, received appointment as the Eighth
                    district's representative on the resolutions committee. Resolutions, including an
                    indorsement of Beveridge, carried.</p>
            <p>Ninth district: One contest marked the Ninth district meeting. W. R. Hines, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Frankfort</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and Fay Cullens, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kokomo</settlement>
                    </placeName>, were both candidates for the resolutions committee. Cullens was elected. By a vote of
                    66-43 it was decided to drop county option if the platform committee did not look on it with favor.
                    William H. Dye was elected district chairman with Noel C. Neal, also of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Noblesville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, secretary, and Charles <pb n="212" id="VAA4025-016-3-042"/> Adams, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kokomo</settlement>
                    </placeName>, treasurer of the district committee. August 10 was selected as the date for the
                    district convention.</p>
            <p>Tenth district: Delegates from the Tenth district selected Dr. G. R. Coffin, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Monticello</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for district chairman. After indorsing Beveridge for governor the name of B. B. Baker,
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Monticello</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was proposed as a candidate for state treasurer. August 14 was decided upon for the
                    Tenth district convention at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rensselaer</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Eleventh district: John Lawrence, of Peru, acted as temporary chairman. C. E. Spalding, of Winamac,
                    was selected as secretary. After the withdrawal of A. S. Boyer, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and J. W. Caswell, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Huntington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, William M. Hasty, f <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName>, was elected to the resolutions committee.</p>
            <p>Twelfth district: Two questions troubled the Twelfth district men. One was county local option while
                    the other was whether Bull Moosers should attend the Republican district convention at Kendallville
                    August 3. Some favored a Progressive candidate for congress on the Republican ticket. Others wanted
                    a candidate of their own. Delegates from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lagrange</region>
                    </placeName> and Noble counties were opposed to third party county tickets, saying that men already
                    on the Republican ticket were Progressives, and that it would cause strife to ask them to resign.
                    One delegate expressed the real stumbling block when he remarked: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>We don't want a third ticket in <placeName>
                                <region type="county">Lagrange county</region>
                            </placeName>, because a third ticket would mean that the Democrats would win out, and we
                            don't want any Democrats in the courthouse. There has never been a Democrat in a
                            county office in <placeName>
                                <region type="county">Lagrange county</region>
                            </placeName> and we don't want to put any of them there now.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>No final decision was arrived at on this issue, but local option followed as soon as possible by
                    state prohibition became the verdict on that question. Louis N. Litman was chosen for district
                    chairman.</p>
            <p>Thirteenth district: After Captain Runyan, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Warsaw</settlement>
                    </placeName>, had declined it, F. E. Lambert, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, accepted the district chairmanship at a meeting of delegates from that section. Judge
                    John C. Richter after announcing that he would not seek the congressional nomination for that year
                    was made a candidate for contingent elector.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

                    must keep their hands clean. The constitution says all men shall have justice in the courts speedily
                    and without delay, but they don't get it."</p>
            <p>R. C. White, of Munice, chairman of the committee on rules and order of business, read the report of

            <p>Beveridge was placed in nomination for governor by William D. Headrick. During the five minutes time
                    alloted for such speeches Headrick eulogized his candidate as a man always battling for justice,
                    asking no quarter and giving none; accepting no compromise with any enemy with which he was in a
                    fight. He came as one single man to voice the sentiment of the people toward the famous senator who
                    was "the greatest man in the greatest state in America." Motion for a unanimous
                    vote carried by rising and cheers. Similarly the nomination of Fred Landis for lieutenant governor
                    by J. F. Lawrence, of Peru, was made unanimous. Lawson N. Mace, of Scottsburg, was nominated for

            <p>Beveridge in accepting his nomination declared that since he had been chosen to lead the fight he
                    would lead it. He designated the effort as "a crusade for a cause and that cause the cause
                    of the people." If elected he pledged that he would be a "free
                    governor,' that "no boss or anti-public influence" would stand between
                    him and the people. "The people do not want things to go on as they have. Everybody knows
                    that neither of the old parties can free American government of its boss system that is sucking out
                    its life. Nothing can do it but a new party fresh from the people, and that is what the Progressive
                    party is. I bid you now go forth and fight in the same spirit our fathers fought, and know that you

            <p>The platform as adopted by the convention contained many favorite measures of Colonel Roosevelt and
                    former Senator Beveridge. In state affairs it recommended a conservation commission, trade and

            <p>The Republican defeat in Indiana two years before was attributed to the failure to put a local option
                    clause in the party platform for that campaign. A sub-committee, consisting of Willitts A. Bastian,
                    Rev. George W. Schraeder and Rudolph G. Leeds, appointed to investigate that issue, made its report
                    at ten P. M. Early the Indiana Anti-Saloon League left an impression that the league would not
                    support the new party, even if it should insert a strong county option plank in its platform, unless
                    it refrained from nominating all officers of the state ticket except presidential electors. James E.

            <p>With the selection of Edwin M. Lee as state chairman, the remarkable convention closed. A new party
                    had been ushered into the field of Indiana politics, equipped with its own state ticket and
                    electors. It was made up mostly of young professional and business men, educators and literary men.
                    Others there were, who might have been classified as disgruntled office seekers, radical reformers
                    and agitators. As one would naturally expect, such a composition must surely dissolve when a number
                    of the measures advocated by it had been put upon the statute books. At this time however there
                    seemed to be no relief in sight so that adherents to the new faith eagerly awaited further
                    developments in the nation and state, the most immediate of which was the national convention at <placeName>

                    </placeName> on August 5-7.</p>
            <p>Interest in the national convention was shown by the fact that Indiana Progressives had requested
                    tickets for almost one thousand persons from the state prior to july 26.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> Of

            <p>Shortly after noon on August 5 (Monday), Ralph C. Otis as temporary chairman of the Progressive

                    "battling for the actual rights of man".</p>
            <p>As for the Progressive program the speaker claimed it was one of construction. The party had grown
                    from the soil of the people's hard necessities to do their work and abuse, ridicule and
                    falsehood would only add to its growth. For years the people had been voting only to find their
                    hopes turned to ashes on their lips. What we needed was a new alignment of our electorate along
                    English lines, so that there would be the two divisions of liberals and conservatives or progressive
                    and reactionary. Republican and Democratic legislators would no longer find it difficult to vote
                    together merely because of a nominal difference in party membership. Under the then existing system
                    bosses did not even work for their own parties but for "anti-public interests"
                    whose servants they were. These "anti-public interests" constituted what Beveridge
                    was pleased to call "the invisible government behind our visible government".</p>
            <p>Furthermore our old parties had kept alive the spirit of sectionalism. The
                    "tragedy" of our history had been continued. Men from the southland voted as
                    "dead tradition and a local fear" instead of "conviction and national
                    faith". It was the object of Progressives to break down this partition so that southerners
                    could vote with northerners on our national problems.</p>
            <p>In business the Progressives intended to tell the business men what they might do and what they might
                    not do. Laws were to be made clear and not "foggy", stating plainly what things
                    were criminal and what lawful. Another reform was proposed in the advocacy of a permanent tariff
                    commission. Progressive theory held that the tariff should be high enough to give American producers
                    the American market and low enough to enable foreign manufacturers a chance to compete in case
                    American manufacturers made dishonest goods and dishonest prices.</p>
            <p>The American government should control moral problems and conserve our resources both human and
                    material. This done there was not the slightest doubt but what a "braver, fairer, cleaner,
                    and purer America" would come; that "a <pb n="221" id="VAA4025-016-3-051"/> better
                    and brighter life for all beneath the flag" would be achieved. "Those who now
                    scoff soon will pray. Those who now doubt soon will believe, and soon the night will pass, and when
                    to the sentinel on the ramparts of liberty the anxious ask "Watchman what of the
                    night?" his answer will be "Lo the morn
                        appeareth'".<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

            <p>The national convention was more of a ratification meeting than a convention. Those present knew what
                    they wanted to do so they were not long in doing it. Another Indiana man who broke into the flame of
                    oratory was Frederick Landis of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, candidate for lieutenant governor of the state. His opportunity came in seconding the
                    nomination of Gov. Hiram Johnson of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> as the vice-presidential candidate. In the course of his remarks he gave the opinion
                    that Indiana would go for Roosevelt by some 30,000 at the November election.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
                    The platform was thorough-going in its declaration of principles. It purported to be a real covenant
                    with the people. Recommending an easier mode of amending the constitution, it proceeded to urge such
                    amendments as popular election of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senators, and presidential preference primaries giving voters the opportunity to
                    nominate as well as to vote for candidates. Equal suffrage was indorsed and also legislation against
                    corrupt practices, for the publicity of campaign expenditures and the improvement of public service.
                    Other important planks were for the improvement of court procedure, the administration of justice
                    both social and industrial, creation of a department of labor, improvement of country life, lowering
                    the high cost of living, the improvement of health, regulation of business, patents and currency, an
                    interstate commerce commission, further commercial development, good roads and waterways,
                    inheritance and income taxes, parcels post, the extension of civil service regulations, movements
                    toward peace as well as for national defense, and government supervision of investments.</p>

                    progressive forces of the nation into an organization which would unequivocally represent the

                    snap judgment on the regular Republicans (August 3) and went through the formality of selecting
                    delegates to the Republican state convention. In <placeName>

                    Beveridge men were in control, came out again for the fray. The regulars claimed that both factions
                    would work in harmony again because many followers of the former Indiana senator had refused to
                    follow him into the Bull Moose camp.<hi rend="sup">18a</hi>
            </p>
            <p>James E. Watson made the keynote speech as temporary chairman. Referring to the new party he declared
                    that it demanded "new methods, not new policies". Only two issues existed
                    according to his interpretation. First the question of one man power and second the maintenance of
                    constitutional government.</p>
            <p>After a compromise on the primary election plank the resolutions committee found it possible to adopt
                    the majority report in favor of county option. A woman's suffrage plank carried eight to
                    five. Many of the planks were similar to those adopted by the Progressives. The recall of judges was
                    not favored but rather a law looking toward the removal of incompetent officials. While the
                    committee favored enforcement of the Sherman Anti-Trust act it also urged an amendment to clarify

                    success as a business man, his ability as an organizer and his financial record while in that office
                    were counted upon to help him considerably in the campaign. The Anti-Saloon league ultimately give
                    its support to his nomination.</p>
            <p>As time passed by it became necessary for the Progressives to make up their minds definitely on the
                    question of third party local tickets. Chairman Lee urged that candidates be nominated in every
                    county but his constituents were about evenly divided as to the advisability of such a move. The
                    general dread was due to a fear that the local Republican organization would be weakened. This was
                    especially true in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lagrange</region>
                    </placeName>, Noble, and <placeName>

                    </placeName> counties. Many of the regulars in these counties desiring above all else to keep the
                    Democrats out, endeavored to show that it was a question of keeping local and national issues
                    separated. In Democratic counties third tickets were opposed because there was little hope of
                    victory with the Republican forces united. In Republican counties any weakening of Republican

                    The argument for good roads was frequently used in the northern part of the state. Congressman
                    William E. Cox of the Third district claimed to be the pioneer in the good roads movement and
                    accused Mr. Beveridge as being a late convert, but at any rate the evil still existed.</p>

            <p>The leading features of the Democratic campaign were the active canvass made by Samuel M. Ralston,
                    candidate for governor, and the tactful use made of Woodrow Wilson's brief visits. Mr.
                    Ralston began his speechmaking on August 30, at Anderson where he read a carefully prepared paper
                    giving the Democratic tariff and finance doctrine. Platforms and administrations of his opponents
                    received their share of criticism but personalities were avoided. Romus F. Stuart, of the Democratic

                    tariff in his speeches. In state politics he maintained that his party had enacted a school book and
                    tax law in spite of strenuous Republican opposition. On September 30, he was so impressed with the
                    hope of triumph as to declare: "They can't beat me, I am having fine meetings. I
                    have been practically all over the state, and I find Democratic prospects excellent."<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

                    breastworks of the regular Republican party; and (3) those who believed the new party offered an

            <p>The Progressive cause in the Sixth district was handicapped because of the third ticket difficulty.
                    Moreover the party there had trouble in securing a nominee for congress whose past record would not

                    had been accepted and set September 23 as the date for another district convention to be held there,
                    at which time a successor would be named. Gierluf Jansen, of <placeName>

                    35,000. Different reasons have been assigned for the slump. Illegal voting in 1908 may have
                    exaggerated the poll of that year, yet in spite of the heated campaign and the vigorous efforts by
                    the parties an unexpected apathy developed among the voters. Under the new registration law of that
                    year some 743,000 had registered, of these a number were illegally enrolled. To offset the number of
                    illegal registrants party leaders estimated that perhaps as many as 50,000 men failed to register at
                    all. Again, the combined Republican and Progressive votes amounted to 313,274 or 31,384 in excess of
                    the Democratic total. This was 25,719 less than the Republicans mustered in 1908, while the

            <p>Anti-liquor forces were very active during the campaign. Many opposed T. R. Marshall as Democratic

                    gave their votes to the cause but it would not be safe to assume that a very large number did so.
                    The chance for the success of their own party, under a leader whom they considered progressive, was
                    too great for them to disregard. Had Democracy been led by a recognized reactionary there is no
                    doubt but that the verdict of November 5 would have been different. As it was the Progressive
                    movement reached the summit of its strength within thirteen weeks of its inauguration as a separate
                    political organization.</p>
            <p>The public generally was content with the results. The Democratic party had been reinstated with
                    complete control of practically all departments of government. It was now expected to use that
                    control wisely. The Republicans felt that they were merely repulsed but not whipped. They were not
                    dispersed, but hoped in time to be reinforced and even in the next fight to win.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> Progressives felt about the same about it. Governor Johnson expressed their belief by
                    referring to the result as "of little more consequence to the ultimate success of earnest
                    men than was the missing of a train."<hi rend="sup">49</hi> Sincere and earnest
                    Progressives were already beginning to plan for the future. If a longer time and a more complete
                    organization of party machinery were necessary for success they were resolved to take advantage of

            <p>The Progressives felt that their defeat in 1912 was largely due to the fact that they entered the
                    campaign too late. Their organization was considered inadequate. But since they polled more votes
                    than the Republicans for their state and presidential ticket there seemed to be sufficient cause for
                    further effort. This led to the party's participation in the municipal elections of 1913.
                    The leaders felt that it was imperative for their party to be represented in all political
                    activities so that the rank and file of the voters would not become indifferent or deserters.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Within a week of the election of 1912, therefore, there was some talk of city
                    tickets where the new move made the strongest showing. At Anderson, Clayte Sells, Progressive
                    chairman of the Eighth district, was prominently mentioned for mayor. At <placeName>

                    </placeName> mayorality race was one of more than ordinary interest. Dr. William H. Johnson was the
                    Progressive nominee. He had been a city councilman and was familiar with the problems of the
                    capital. During his campaign he advocated "majority rule," and giving the
                    "ordinary citizen representation at the city hall," In order to bring about such
                    reforms civic centers would be established at the school houses in each ward where the people could
                    meet to consider matters pertaining to their own wards and the general welfare."
                    "I want to make the city government a family affair instead of a government by ring
                    politicians," Johnson is quoted as saying.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Certain other reforms urged
                    by the Progressives included the nonassessment of city employees for campaign expenses, no more

                    opened with much "red fire" in a mass meeting at Tomlinson hall on the night of

                    building, better care of streets, better street lighting, efficient municipal boards, civil service
                    for fire and police departments, an effort to increase the number of industries, the development of

            <p>The Democrats placed Joseph E. Bell in the race. His election was urged as an indorsement of the
                    state and national Democratic administrations. The Prohibitionists, Socialists and Socialist Labor
                    parties also nominated tickets; in addition to this Dr. Charles S. Woods was nominated to oppose the

                    Prohibitionists had five. Robert W. Harrison, a former mayor and a Democrat, was nominated to head
                    the ticket. For clerk Lee Morgan, a Republican, was named. I. O. Mann and Martin Lemmon, both
                    Progressives, received places for councilmen at large, while among the ward councilmen selected were
                    two Republicans, two Progressives and one Democrat. The new party had already nominated a ticket
                    including the names of Mann and Lemmon but this was withdrawn after the mass meeting had given them

                    to the presence of the Progressive ticket in the contest but the latter might have explained his
                    failure in the same way. It was simply another illustration of the fact that here in Indiana a
                    divided opposition stood little chance of defeating a united Democracy.</p>
            <p>Progressive leaders declared that no comfort was to be found in the assumption that the new party was
                    losing ground. They maintained that even though the conditions of 1912 were missing, wherever a test
                    of strength was made the Progressive party had shown a body of men fighting for principles and
                    demanding that there should be one party representative of those principles. The municipal elections
                    shorn of extraordinary feeling and rapidly shifting of balances, which marked the 1912 contest,
                    showed the Progressives as still a potent group with at least some aligned in their ranks who stood
                    for no compromise short of a complete acceptance of their faith.</p>
            <p>Joseph B. Kealing endeavored to show that the Progressives had weakened while the Republicans gained.
                    Taking the vote of thirty-three cities he pointed out that the Democrats lost 8,500 votes, the
                    Progressives lost 11,000 while the Republicans gained 15,000. It required another election to
                    definitely determine the future success of the new party.</p>

            <p>Firm loyalty was the keynote of the gathering. Those present pledged themselves to stand by the
                    ideals of 1912 and declared any compromise with the Republican party to be impossible. Though the
                    immediate cause of the formation of <pb n="244" id="VAA4025-016-3-074"/> the new party was the
                    dishonesty and fraud practiced by the Republican national convention, it was in reality the
                    culmination of movements that had long been in progress. Various groups working independently along
                    different lines for the general betterment saw in the new party the opportunity that had not been
                    offered by either of the old political organizations. A large number of people, interested in one
                    phase or another of social industrial or political reform, that received no encouragement from the
                    old parties, or else had been espoused only to be betrayed, saw in the Progressive party a chance to
                    promote their respective causes and came together under its banner. The movement crystallized under
                    the "insurgents" in congress like Beveridge, Poindexter and Murdock. The new party
                    offered all dissatisfied persons an opportunity and they welcomed it.</p>
            <p>The new organization was now undergoing a test to see whether it could long endure. Those of the more
                    earnest adherents contended that their platform stood for something. That unlike that of the
                    Democratic party, it was a program. The principles they adopted were vital, they looked to a
                    changing of the social, industrial and political order, they represented the needs of the people and
                    because they did there was no disposition to abandon them and return to the Republican or Democratic
                    fold. Some Progressives contended that there was even less prospect than ever before of
                    accomplishing anything through those parties.</p>
            <p>As with every new political movement deserters were expected. Certain men attached themselves to it
                    for selfish reasons and with little or no interest in its principles. They either wished revenge on
                    opponents or hoped for the rewards of success, the spoils of office, or personal prominence not
                    before obtainable. Such men would soon drop out and in fact some had already done so.</p>
            <p>Those who remained faithful claimed that they were not working for power because it would give them
                    control of a few offices. They were rather working for principles because they believed that the
                    interests of the people demanded the inauguration of those principles. If in the meantime Democrats
                    or Republicans should take up and put in operation any of the Progressive reforms, members of the
                    Progressive party <pb n="245" id="VAA4025-016-3-075"/> would rejoice over the spread of their
                    beliefs. But they would not join the Republicans because they had ceased to be in touch with the
                    people and had shown no signs of abandoning their allegiance to the interests. Neither would the
                    true Progressives join the Democrats because they were mere office seekers, were apt to Bryanize the
                    currency and had so far rendered mere lip service to genuine reform. Thus did the loyal Progressives
                    feel about their position even in the face of almost certain defeat. They had "a cause to
                    fight for" and their "heart was in the fight."<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Tenth district Progressives were first to lead off with an organization rally following the state
                    gathering. The national committee planned to encourage and promote a campaign in all the states for
                    the election of Progressive congressmen and for county tickets in each county. At <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, therefore, arrangements were made for the selection at an early date of precinct
                    committeemen, county chairmen and for the beginning of activities in the general interests of the
                    party. The delegates indorsed the new primary election law and called for elections under it.</p>
            <p>Enthusiasm ran high when a few of the Progressive leaders gathered at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> for a conference, December 23. Mr. Beveridge, Mr. Toner and others received ovations as
                    they renewed pledges of undying loyalty to the fight for the people. The former senator reiterated
                    his advice made by letter to the <placeName>

                    no combination, no relations of any kind with any other party whatsoever." E. C. Toner also
                    maintained that it was the duty of the Progressive party to proceed alone without the aid of or
                    fusion with any other party.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

                            extinct within 150 years. I can say, however, that a marriage of the Republican and
                            Progressive parties would in no wise conform to even eugenic principles, but if this might
                            be in error and if such a marriage might occur, the result would be in no wise related to

            <p>It was announced that about all the counties would put out tickets in 1914 which would be much better
                    than in 1912. Reports at the meeting carried the idea that many Republicans were not taking much
                    consolation in their new state committee. The trouble being that new district chairmen elected on
                    February 10 were aligned with the standpat element and that little could be hoped in the way of
                    progressiveism from them. This dissatisfaction manifested itself in the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth,

            <p>E. C. Toner of Anderson, who had been chosen chairman of the state executive committee, proceeded at
                    once to build up an efficient working of various units throughout the state.</p>
            <p>The Democratic party again showed its partiality for an early nominating convention by setting the
                    date for its state meeting on March 19. The party was filled with such enthusiasm and hope as come
                    from supremacy. There was an abundance of candidates for all offices. Competition and disappointment
                    were expected to cause animosities in some cases. The long campaign however would give opportunity
                    to adjust these difficulties.</p>
            <p>Governor Ralston was chosen as temporary chairman to deliver the keynote. He, himself, did not care
                    for the honor, and favored a senator who would discuss national issues. The prevailing majority
                    however declared that state issues would be paramount to everything else.</p>
            <p>A feature of the convention was the adoption of a platform containing a recommendation for a primary
                    election law in Indiana. Senator Kern forced the issue by announcing the desire of President Wilson
                    and Mr. Bryan for such a plank. Many of the party followers declared that the President was bent
                    upon progressivizing the Democratic party in Indiana. At any rate he was able to obtain a favorable

            <p>The Progressives at first planned to hold their state nominating convention on May 1. Objection was
                    made to this date on account of busy season in the rural districts. The date was therefore changed
                    to April 16 one week before the Republican meeting, but because Tomlinson hall was not available for
                    that date another and final change was made to April 18 and 19. There were 1669 delegates elected on
                    April 10, on the basis of one for each hundred votes for Beveridge in 1912. These met at the
                    statehouse by districts to select members for the credentials, resolutions, rules and order
                    committees.</p>
            <p>The convention was looked forward to with more than ordinary interest because it represented the more
                    settled and determined thought and intentions of the new party, to a degree not possible in the
                    excitement and enthusiasm of its formation. Its members had had almost two years in which to reflect
                    on the movement, to compare its principles with the promises and acts of the old organizations, and
                    to measure the importance of their undertaking. Their zeal was unbroken. Their convention was firm.
                    There was much work to be done. They had rejected all overtures to return to their former
                    allegiance. The "grand old party" had shown no signs meet for repentence. The
                    Democrats had paid them a tribute by adopting, though reluctantly, some of their reform ideas, e.
                    g., the direct primary plank.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

            <p>In their platform the Progressives reaffirmed the basic principles of the 1912 document. It declared
                    for woman suffrage, minimum wage, workmen's compensation, public utilities, regulation by
                    commission, and free school books. The foreign policy of Wilson's administration was
                    condemned especially so far as it related to Mexico, Panama Canal tolls, and the Columbian claim.
                    Prohibition was a knotty question as in 1912. From the northen part of the state there came a more
                    insistent demand for it than from the southern part. Delegates from the Eighth, Ninth, Tenth and
                    Eleventh districts were particularly active in favor of the Prohibition plank. The 1912 plank was
                    favored by delegates from the southern part and a large number of those from the Sixth district. It
                    seemed inconsistent to most of the delegates to favor woman suffrage and not prohibition.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>

                    would not deceive the people. Again the Democratic refusal to stand for the constitutional
                    convention and woman suffrage set forth the position of that party clearly.</p>
            <p>The Progressives therefore felt that they had the best platform and ticket. All parties were planning
                    to get an early start. The new party was not going to be asleep, but hastened to lay its campaign
                    lines in all counties. By means of a series of district conferences they planned a more complete
                    organization. Mr. Beveridge and Mr. Toner were both active in promoting these conferences and
                    attended as many as they could. With a thorough organization the Progressives had hopes of
                    successfully competing against the Democrats and Republicans, especially in those districts where
                    either of their opponents were divided or in poor standing with the people.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

            <p>Owing to the fact that this was not a presidential election year the chief interest centered around
                    the congressional and senatorial contests. The Progressives claimed exceptional strength in the
                    Second, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Tenth, Eleventh, and Thirteenth districts.</p>
            <p>The First district developed a hot race between S. Wallace Cook, the Republican nominee, Ulrich H.
                    Seiler the Progressive candidate and Representative Charles W. Lieb who had been renominated by the
                    Democrats. This district was not considered a Progressive stronghold. The basis of hope was due to a
                    Lieb and anti-Lieb faction among the Democrats. The trouble arose from some post-office appointments
                    which displeased a few party followers.</p>
            <p>Representative William A. Cullop, a Democrat, was opposed in the second district by Oscar E. Bland,
                    Republican, and James B. Wilson, Progressive. Here the Democrats were again divided into a Cullop
                    and an anti-Cullop faction. Some leading party workers who were ambitious for official honors
                    thought Cullop had represented the district long enough and that it would be best for him to step
                    down in favor of some other candidate.</p>
            <p>The Third and Fourth districts were both conceded to the Democrats almost without a struggle.

                    party's district convention caused several of its members to become disgusted with it.
                    Progressives felt that the miners approved the new party's stand on the tariff in

                        <settlement type="city">Huntington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. With these publications to supplement the well directed stump campaign, the
                    Progressive cause was presented to the people in no uncertain terms. Although the new party could
                    entertain no assurance of victory it was determined to make a good showing at the polls. Just how
                    well it succeeded in this is at once evident from its future history.</p>
            <p>The press and politicians talked fusion throughout the year. The Progressives, however, declared that
                    any party good enough to fuse with was good enough to vote with. This seemed to be the real
                    situation, for, having returned in 1914, many former Progressives remained loyal at the polls to
                    their old party which they had forsaken two years before.</p>
            <p>In Bango township, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Elkhart county</region>
                    </placeName>, the Republicans and Progressives merged in the election of a township ticket. They
                    adopted the name of "citizens" and chose clasped hands as an emblem.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> Progressives accused the Republicans in <placeName>

                    Republican ticket in order to make it appear that they were coming back. Only the vote could
                    determine the real extent of repentance among the new party men.</p>
            <p>Senator Shively was re-elected by a plurality of 45,483 over Mr. Miller. The vote for Mr. Beveridge
                    was 108,581, or less than half of that for the Republican nominee. Evidently many who supported him
                    in 1912, were now voting another ticket. Two of the congressional seats were reclaimed by the
                    Republicans. These were the Seventh and Tenth. In neither of the districts did the Progressive
                    nominees win second place. Their vote was considerably less than the party received in 1912. In only
                    two districts, the Sixth and Eighth, did the Progressive vote amount to as much as half of the
                    Republican figures. The poorest showing made <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The Democrats still controlled both branches of the General Assembly, but with a greatly reduced
                    majority in thehouse of representatives. The proposal to have a constitutional convention was voted
                    down by 103,807 and that for a centennial memorial building met a similar fate by 368,982.
                    Successful nominees asserted that the result showed an approach to more independent voting and the
                    fading of party lines. While this was no doubt a cause yet there is an indication of a conservative
                    reaction. This is perhaps more evident in other states where questions like woman suffrage and
                    prohibition were up for more or less definite solution. The people were trying to play safe and be
                    conservative. In <placeName>

            <p>Immediately after the returns were in, November 5, the Progressive state committee in a meeting at
                    the Hotel English adopted a resolution stating the party's plans for the immediate

                        <p>The Progressive party was organized by sincere men and women who wanted to make this country
                            better and our people happier. That movement must and will go forward. We are right on every
                            fundamental question. Temporary defeat nerves us to greater efforts. We pledge the thousands
                            of voters who have stood with us that we will continue the fight until victory is won.
                            Tuesday's election returned to power the most extreme reactionaries in the
                            country. Men whose names only yesterday were synonymous for all that is bad in American
                            politics are more strongly enthroned than ever before. Two years ago there was a swing to
                            impracticable and incompetent Democracy; today there is a swing to the most backward looking
                            Republicanism; tomorrow the swing will be to us. We begin right now for the battle of

            <p>The same Republican ticket was expected to be in the field again. James P. Goodrich was mentioned as
                    the candidate for governor. As national committeeman he was looked upon as a man trying to bring
                    about party harmony. At a meeting of the state committee on November 14 it was decided to have a
                    "get together" love feast during the Christmas holiday season. The committee
                    resolved to give each Republican an equal voice in the management of the party.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About two hundred Progressives gathered at the party club rooms in the Hume-Mansur building on
                    November 15 when they determined to continue the fight for progressive principles. Those present
                    were asked to sign cards pledging aid in keeping up the movement through the campaign of 1916. Some
                    leading members of the party in 1912 had already deserted it. Their attitude seemed to be that they
                    regarded continuance in the new party as an ineffectual effort to accomplish anything in practical
                    politics.</p>
            <p>Chief among the early deserters were Taylor Groninger of <placeName>

                    </placeName> and Horace Stilwell of Anderson. According to the latter a new progressive lineup had
                    occurred within the Republican party and it had become the real progressive party in America. Former
                    differences within the Republican party were differences of means rather than of ends. The
                    Progressive party could no longer be used as an instrument to accomplish progressive results. He
                    felt that it would be wiser to abandon the Progressive party as a party and to preserve the movement
                    as a movement.<hi rend="sup">41</hi>

                    future would be reached. A Johnson boom for President was started by R. G. Leeds, the Indiana

            <p>"Progressive principles are permanent and it is now more than ever evident that the
                    Progressive party today is the necessary organ for their realization."</p>
            <p>A new kind of aggressiveness would prevail, different from that of 1912. There would be no hopeful,
                    catchy phrases, no grandiloquence about "enlisting for the war," no bitterness,
                    but quiet mature deliberation. The party was to sit tight, hold its national strength, organization,
                    say nothing and saw wood, until the next arrangement of forces gave it its new opportunity to serve
                    the principles to which it was dedicated. The Republicans could not think that "the cruel
                        <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>positive political party, contributing only negative results, not positive progressive
                            victories, protecting Democracy from punishment that is its due, professing faith in
                            majority government but at the same time making minority government secure. I favor a
                            two-party system where majority rules. Blocking the channel does not appeal to me. I am not
                            leaving the Progressives but joining them. More than 300,000 affiliated with the Republicans
                            on November 3 and hordes have joined since then. This is more than three times as many as
                            remained with the Progressives. The new battle line-a tribute to American citizenship, which
                            forced to solve pressing present economical problems by disciplining an Incompetent
                            Democracy-moved the entire Progressive army, with the exception of a few panting stragglers
                            to the new position within the Republican party, where they can continue their progressive
                            fight without interruption and at the same time administer to Democracy the punishment that
                            it deserves. The first skirmish will be upon methods of party procedure and management. The
                            party organization be a mere referee of contests within the party. We have had the
                            progressive movement a long time before the Progressive party and we shall have it a long
                            time afterward. While they obsequiously the while lament the untimely death of the virtuous
                            party, the courage and energy continues undaunted upon its way. Pouters fail to grasp the
                            meaning of the sweeping vote of November 3. The Progressives themselves have decided that
                            their future activities shall continue within the Republican party; that the Progressive
                            party is not necessary for Progressive success, and should be abandoned as a real
                            interference and stumbling block in the way of the movement. That the movement will sweep
                            along without the party and without the individuals that cling to the shell of the party
                            name: that their misdirected sincerity will not save these excellent gentlemen from being
                            politically pigeonholed and effectually anchored in the dead eddy of a dormant party while
                            the movement sweeps past them upon the irresistible tide of victory. They cannot keep up the
                            fight pouting behind the abandoned breastworks of last year's battle fields. The
                            fight will not be abandoned because the party movement failed. Ultimately it is my sincere
                            hope that all real Progressives will feel the touch of each other's shoulders at
                            the front upon the new line of battle within the Republican party."</item>

                    be reckoned with.</p>
            <p>The party was to be a growing concern, with a determination to hold its place in the sun which it won
                    by its own hard work. The national committee planned to meet again in December, 1915, when it would
                    make plans for the 1916 convention and campaign. Convinced that the Republican party did not offer a
                    fertile ground for their principles, some talked of indorsing Wilson, if a reactionary was nominated
                    by it for President.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No one could be sure as to the outcome of the whole matter. In Indiana, as elsewhere, very much would
                    depend upon the result of a conflict already staged between the old leadership of the Republican and
                    the new. The new leaders seemed to be trying to keep its promises of a new deal in not only methods
                    but men. If such a program were really undertaken it would be entitled to sympathy and aid, at any
                    rate Progressives had already returned and were returning to their former alignment. Many no doubt
                    reasoned like Stilwell and pictured themselves as members of a party which could never hope to do
                    any positive piece of work. The outbreak of a world-wide war in Europe also tended to smother
                    political divisions in this country so that with the handicap of the 1914 slump the Progressives
                    could scarcely hope to survive.</p>

            <p>Elections throughout the country in 1915 showed a further weakening of the Progressive party. This
                    fact had its effect upon Indiana devotees of that faith who up until that time had refused to
                    amalgamate with the Republicans. In November of that year elections occurred in eight states east of

                    throughout the state the Republicans made a fine showing. They made a concerted effort with a great
                    result. Although in many cases the contests were non-partisan or citizen affairs, yet it is doubtful
                    if ever so much party spirit had been displayed in the state within recent years. Conspicuous

                    understanding that the party declared for prohibition and did not demand the application of the
                    initiative, referendum or recall. His name had been filed as a candidate for governor by the
                    Progressive state committee, because names of candidates for state offices had to be filed with the
                    secretary of state on or before January 7 and all others had declined to allow their names to be

                    latter to join them in the nomination of their candidates. The supreme court had ruled, January 5,
                    that the law would not prevent such participation, and that a party could decide for itself as to

                    E. D. Salsbury, vice-chairman of the Progressives, said the criminal section of the law made such
                    fusion impossible, since section 28 provided a fine for voting another ticket than that for which a
                    man voted for a majority of its candidates at the last general election. The court's
                    ruling, however, removed this difficulty, and the Republicans made a spirited effort to get out a
                    heavy vote so that the Progressives would be shown up.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

                    the polls. Mr. Goodrich won out over McCray for governor, while New received the senatorial
                    nomination over Watson. The latter at first intended for a time to appeal to the state convention
                    for a reconsideration of the vote. He contended that by eliminating <placeName>

                    Mr. New, thus carrying the substantial and reliable Republican counties of the state. The actual
                    returns from all counties, however, showed that Mr. New had a plurality of some 8,000, having
                    received a majority in the populous counties.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Judge Wilson received the
                    Progressive nomination for senator, while Mr. Hanly received the vote of that party for governor.
                    Although their vote was light, about 10,000 in all, Chairman Lee argued that it showed a party
                    strength of some 100,000 in the state. His explanation of a heavier Republican and Democratic vote
                    was because of contests and expenditure of money by the former, while the latter had control of the
                    offices. That this explanation was not sufficient is evident from the fact that several leaders of
                    the new party soon deserted it as offering no hope of victory at the polls in November.</p>
            <p>Oswald Ryan of Anderson left the Progressives early in January, having as his excuse the assumption
                    of power by members of the state committee to determine candidacies and platforms. "The
                    Progressive party," said he, "was born of an unlawful assumption of power by a
                    party committee. The successful execution of Mr. Lee's plan in this state can only insure
                    that the party shall meet its death in the same issue in which it got its birth." The
                    incident calls attention again to the real issue in democratic government as it is at present

                    which constitute the actual government of America, the political parties. Unless the party is so
                    organized as to make easy its control by its own citizenship there is little hope of popular control
                    of a government which of necessity is governed by political parties. This is exactly the point which

                    Mr. Stilwell has taken the position that the real significance of the 1912 split in the Republican
                    party lay in the determination of the citizenship of the party to nominate the party's
                    candidates and write its platforms, and that any constructive policy for party permanency must rest
                    upon an equitable plan of party government. The protest of 1912 would do no good unless it developed
                    a new type of democratic party government.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

                            in becoming a near-Progressive in 1916. The Progressive party is on the down grade and I
                            attribute this mostly to mismanagement on the part of its leaders. I am leaving the party

                    progressive. No objection was made to the omission of woman suffrage and prohibition planks. On the
                    other hand the platform declared for: the restoration of a protective tariff and for a tariff
                    commission; for preparedness legislation at once; for a more spirited foreign policy; opposed
                    Wilson's policies toward nations at war in Europe and toward Mexico, also the existing
                    Democratic state administration; favored tax reforms; short ballot, home rule for cities, and giving
                    the governor power to veto any items in a general appropriations bill.</p>

                    been passed under Democratic administrations. Some things mentioned were: An improved banking law,

                    banks, income tax, strengthening of Sherman anti-trust-act. In state legislation they pointed with
                    pride to workmen's compensation, vocational education, public service commission, primary
                    election law, the payment of state debts, anti-loan shark laws, provision for a state fire marshall,

                    second choice" expressed the feeling of those Progressives who would not support any
                    candidate but Roosevelt.</p>
            <p>On the third ballot, June 10, Hughes and Fairbanks were named to head the Republican ticket. Mr.
                    Roosevelt, after suggesting Mr. Lodge as a compromise candidate, declined tentatively to accept the
                    nomination for President with John M. Parker as Vice-President, when it was tendered to him by the
                    Progressive convention. The former President desired to learn the attitude of Mr. Hughes on the
                    vital questions of the day. His conditional refusal was placed in the hands of the Progressive
                    national committee. Immediately after the final adjournment, the Indiana Progressive delegates
                    appointed a committee, consisting of W. D. Foulke, W. C. Bobbs, and Willitts A. Bastian to send a
                    message to Mr. Roosevelt reaffirming their faith in him and insisting on his acceptance of the
                    Progressive nomination.</p>
            <p>Thus had the efforts to name a compromise candidate failed. The refusal of Mr. Roosevelt to accept
                    the Progressive nomination left the members of that party in the dark. His final statement to this
                    effect was made to the Progressive national committee when if reconvened at <placeName>

                    vote of 36 to 6. William Holton Dye, Indiana's member, voted with the majority. He was
                    severely criticised by many for his action, while others just as freely upheld him. A stormy session
                    resulted when the Indiana Progressives met at <placeName>

            <p>The breach over Hughes grew wider and wider. The Progressive party was being unscrambled in Indiana
                    as well as elsewhere. It was made up in general of two elements. On one side were the devotees of
                    Mr. Roosevelt, while on the other were the apostles of social agitation. That the party was not made
                    up entirely of Roosevelt's personal following was clearly demonstrated by the widespread
                    revolt against his support of Hughes. Some of these men began even at <placeName>

                    </placeName> to charge him with perfidy to them and of betrayal of Progressive principles. Scholars,
                    authors, settlement workers and such like are not dependables of any party, and who were now on fire
                    with zeal for reform measures that filled up so large a part of the Progressive platform, had merely
                    accepted the Colonel as the generalissimo of the new organization. He offered them spirited and
                    sagacious leadership. He had probably accepted such a curious division of his army with something of
                    the same utilitarian frame of mind. His personality dominated in 1912, now they were not so anxious
                    to follow him into the Hughes camp. Some who followed him into the new party without regard for its
                    reform propaganda had already preceded him into the reunion camps. Others wore sullen countenances
                    and deplored his betrayal of social justice. Those of the latter class might be expected to scatter
                    to all parties, some even to the Socialists and Prohibitionists, where they were not wholly
                    strangers. Former Governor Hanly, whom the Progressives had expected to have at the head of their
                    ticket, was one of the first to decline to make the race for an office. He cast his lot with the
                    Prohibitionists, giving as his excuse the failure of the Progressive national convention to put a
                    national prohibition plank in its platform.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

            <p>Realizing that their ranks were being steadily thinned by desertions, very few Progressives were
                    optimistic enough to believe that victory was possible for them in November. This fact had its
                    influence in including others to give up the fight and enlist with stronger forces, where there was
                    some hope of doing some actual service. All they could hope to do as Progressives would be to go on
                    record for principles as the Prohibition party did. There were only a few to whom such a course
                    proved interesting. In 1912 there was a distinct chance of success at the polls, but the 1914
                    election had shown a decline in Progressive strength, which it was reasonable to infer had
                    continued. In 1916 it would be either Hughes or Wilson. The Progressive national committee had
                    recommended Hughes though it disavowed any right to deliver the votes of the party at large. The
                    truth was that Progressives, who were not very strong party slaves, would exercise their own
                    individual judgement in November. To the returned Progressives, Mr. Roosevelt's action in

                    would appeal to their hesitating brethren with constantly increasing force as time wore on. In
                    inviting their support for the Republican ticket, nothing but kindness and calm reason were to be
                    used. Roosevelt's example of personal sacrifice was one, which, in the long run, sagacity
                    and patriotism would have to follow. The welfare of the country came first. The management of the
                    Indiana Republican organization was unsatisfactory to many Progressives, and not without
                    justification in the past. But the disposition to deal fairly with former Progressives was in
                    evidence and could not fail to exert its effect except with those who were determined not to be
                    reconciled.</p>

                    instantly operative in subsequent political developments requiring a well organized protest
                    movement. There was a feeling that the Progressive cause would not be advanced by committing the
                    party as a party to the Democrats or Republicans, but that on national issues Progressives should be
                    left free to act as the national committee suggested, according to their own consciences.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> The Progressive state central committee, at a meeting, July 10, adopted a
                    resolution refusing financial assistance from either Democratic or Republican organizations during

                    The "committee of nine" was quite active just before the state convention, in its
                    efforts to solicit proxies from delegates who would not attend. This precipitated the question of
                    whether or not the proxies had been issued according to the rules of the party.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>

            <p>The regular Progressives held the "whip hand" in the convention and clinched the

                    "the committee of nine." They even nominated presidential electors.
                    "Bogus" and "counterfeit" tickets were said to be in
                    circulation, proxies were also in evidence, those obtained by the "committee of
                    nine" of which Clarence R. Martin was secretary, were uniformly ruled out by the chairman.
                    The "committee of nine" then tried to change the proxy rule, eliminate
                    presidential electors and declare in favor of a Progressive league, instead of a straight party
                    organization. Clarence Martin offered a truce, saying that the "committee of nine"
                    would withdraw from the fight against nominating a state ticket if Lee resigned as state chairman.
                    He, no doubt, believed that with Lee not exercising control a majority in the convention would
                    "listen to reason" and decide not to put up a state ticket.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>

            <p>Former Senator Albert J. Beveridge, in July, announced his intention of taking the stump in behalf of
                    Hughes. The regular Republicans welcomed his return because he was considered one of the leading
                    Progressives and no doubt existed as to his oratorical abilities. The course taken by Mr. Beveridge,
                    could not fail to influence others of the Bull Moose party, who hesitated to take a like step before
                    that time. Judge James B. Wilson withdrew from the party in August. He had been nominated for
                    senator at the March primary so that his retirement necessitated the appointment of a successor.
                    While he still believed in the Progressive principles there was no hope for his election so that it
                    seemed the course of wisdom to allow voters freedom of choice between candidates of the old parties.

                    the state. Mr. Hughes covered the state very well in two tours through it. The first, September
                    21-23, was over the northern part. On October 31 and November 1, just before the election, he made a
                    hasty canvass of the southern section, giving especial attention to the German element there. Mr.
                    Roosevelt, Raymond Robins and George Ade all spoke in behalf of the Republican nominee, urging the

                    stronger than his party.</p>
            <p>The Progressives practically disappeared as a party after the election. The vote cast for their
                    nominee was almost negligible. None of their candidates on the state ticket received as many as
                    5,000 votes or one-third of the support given to Prohibitionist or Socialist candidates. Progressive
                    nominees for congress received very little consideration, only the Fifth, Ninth, Eleventh and
                    Thirteenth districts giving them more than 1,000 votes.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

            <p>Evidently practically all the 1912 Progressive vote was this year given to the Republicans. The
                    latter party was thus enabled to elect its state ticket and Hughes electors. As intimated elsewhere
                    the Progressives were reconciled to their former allegiance because it was evident that they could
                    not accomplish anything except through their influence and not through actual control of the
                    government. George Ade expressed the true vision of the situation in explaining his own case when he
                    said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I marched with the Progressive party until it became a dwindling minority of bleeding martyrs
                            and I would have continued to march if there had been a probability of our arriving
                            anywhere. I liked my travelling companions and the scenery, but a man can not continue a
                            journey which offers no terminus. When a man has just one round of ammunition to shoot he
                            can't afford to stand off on a hillside and shoot into the air. Progressives must
                            recognize the fact that this year there are only two contending parties and every voter must
                            either make a quick choice or retire to the deep woods. This is no time for grieving over
                            what might have been. The thing for every Progressive to do is to look pleased and vote for

                    ordinary political issues. The Republicans had made a blunder in attacking President Wilson rather
                    than his party. Some of the western electorate thereupon seemed to fear that the country would
                    suffer because Republican orators spoke in disrespectful terms of the chief executive. No doubt
                    Hughes' plurality in Indiana was reduced to some extent by this argument, and the love of
                    peace at any price. Indiana's Republican organization was likely the best of any state.
                    The old leaders there had not ignored the Progressives but made an effort to give them places on the
                    various party organization committees. The Progressive leaders asked for a continuance of this
                    recognition in the future. Gifford Pinchot, Raymond Robibns, James R. Garfield, William Allen White
                    and others made such a plea in a meeting at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> on December 7. This action was followed on the next day by a similar demand from the
                    regular Progressive party through the acting chairman, Matthew Hale.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With the 1916 election the Progressives ceased to exist as a political party in Indiana. A desire for
                    united effort along lines, incident to the great war, led voters to walk in accustomed paths instead
                    of insisting upon radical changes. The old guard machinery was rapidly restored so that by the 1918
                    campaign there was scarcely any evidence of Progressiveism in its make up. Former Progressive
                    leaders were not found in positions of influence in the old party. Most all third party movement
                    created a large independent vote. Of this, the largest of all such parties, a proportionately large
                    and patent group of political mavericks was the result. These men are not the property of any party.
                    They resent the idea of being accomplices of any bosses or unscrupulous party leaders. Whether or
                    not the Progressive movement will again be organized into an independent political party is of
                    course uncertain, and any statement to that effect would be mere conjecture. A large majority of the
