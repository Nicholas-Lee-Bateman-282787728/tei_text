            By the middle of the nineteenth century 
                        New Albany
                    's increase in land area and its advance towards a complex and diversified
                    economic establishment clearly placed it in the category of city. Its steady,
                    youthful growth during the thirty-year period preceding the Civil War is confirmed by the federal
                    census reports. The 1830 population of 2,079 had doubled by 1840, and with its 4,220 inhabitants the
                    Scribner settlement at the lower end of the Ohio Falls had become
                    Indiana's largest city. By 1850 the population had almost doubled again (8,181). 
                        New Albany
                     was still the largest city in the state, the ninth largest in the Old Northwest, and
                    among the first hundred in the nation. This relative prominence of 
                        New Albany
                     was destined to pass as other points in the region accelerated their own pace toward
                    urbanization. The 1860 census, rather disheartening to 
                        New Albany
                     boosters, revealed that the city's population of 12,647 was only a few hundred
                    more than that recorded for 
                        Evansville
                     and 
                        Fort Wayne
                    , and that it was almost six thousand short of that listed for the now booming capital, 
                        Indianapolis
                    . 
                  Louisville, Kentucky
               , which had consistently kept a five or six to one
                    population superiority over its crossriver rival, could by 1860 boast a population of 68,033.1

            However kindly or unkindly the population reports might deal with 
                        New Albany
                    , there was evidence on every hand that the mid-century community had outgrown the
                    status of town. The cultural and racial homogeneity of the earlier years was less conspicuous and
                    class lines, based chiefly on success in local economic ventures, were making their appearance. East
                    Main (Upper High) Street was rapidly becoming a select neighborhood, while less favored areas in the
                    lower section, particularly those subject to flooding by the river, were already developing slum
                    aspects. With the construction of business blocks and other brick edifices the downtown landscape
                    was undergoing a noticeable transformation, while the peripheral areas were being quickly filled in
                    with frame dwelling houses. By the early 1850's 
                        New Albany
                     possessed extensive centers for amusement and recreation, and it offered an impressive
                    array of churches and fraternal organizations. It had two daily newspapers, a lyceum, the beginnings
                    of a public library, and most of the other facilities for intellectual stimulation and leisure that
                    would be found in a contemporary 
                  Louisville,
                            Cincinnati
               , or

                        New Albany
                     formally became a city in 1839 when it received from the General Assembly a charter to
                    replace the town charter issued to the Scribner brothers in 1815.2 The principal
                    difference between the 1839 arrangement and the earlier one was that the position of mayor was added
                    and functions normally ascribed to the executive branch of government were somewhat systematized. 
                        New Albany
                    's municipal government operated under the provisions of this document until
                    1852 when a third charter, conforming to the new state laws, was granted.3 Again
                    the basic structure of local government was retained; functions which had been worked out over the
                    previous decades were defined and extended in the codification of ordinances that occurred
                    throughout the 1850's.4 In recognition of the expansion of the city,

                     were added to the existing four, and the pair of councilmen from
                    each of the six were elected annually to serve as the legislative branch of the city government. The
                    mayor, elected every two years, served as city judge as well as chief executive. Among the other
                    officials prominent in the affairs of mid-century 
                        New Albany
                     were the city clerk, the treasurer, assessor, marshal, engineer, street commissioner,
                    and attorney. All were elected annually in compliance with state law. Positions allotted by
                    appointment included weigher, measurer, gauger, and the coveted ones of marketmaster and
                    wharf-master. The job of "chief fire engineer" was created in 1853, and the first
                    real city school board, a refinement of a complex earlier trustee system, was appointed this same
                        year.5 By the middle of the 1850's most of those services normally
                    rendered or regulated by a municipal government were manifest in 
                        New Albany
                    —street maintenance, water, lighting, and sanitary facilities, fire and
                    police protection, and public education.
            The village designed by the Scribners in 1813 remained the core of the expanding community, with the
                    city's physical expansion following a pattern dictated by the presence of the
                        Ohio River and the neighboring knobs. State Street, which ran southeast to
                    the river, continued to be the chief thoroughfare. That portion of the city southwest of State,
                    appropriately referred to as the "lower," i.e. downriver, end of the city, was
                    built up for ten blocks—about as far as it could be on level terrain. Major expansion was
                    in the direction of the "upper," or eastern, end of the city, and before 1850 this
                    portion had been occupied for a distance of several blocks to Ninth Street.6
                    Silver Street, about ten theoretical blocks farther east, is shown on maps of the period as the
                    eastern city limits, but at mid-century the section between East Ninth and Silver was still mostly
                    woods and farm land.7 The city

                     6 In 1850 part of the "old Conner farm" above Ninth
                            Street was divided into lots and put up for sale. By 1857 it was reported that more than a
                            thousand houses had been constructed in the former Conner property and the adjacent area

                            Daily Ledger, April 15, 1857. The City council formally annexed five major
                            sections to the city in the period 1853-1854.

                     7 That the east end of the city was marked for expansion in the
                            1850's is clearly indicated by plans of the 
                                Floyd County
                             officials to build a new courthouse at the northwest corner of East Ninth and
                            Spring—near the geographic center of the present city. The lot was purchased, but
                            the plans were later abandoned in favor of a site at the corner of State and Spring. 
                                New Albany
                            
                            Daily Ledger, May 6, 1851.
               
                     stretched out along the river and therefore had little depth,
                    ranging to the north only six or seven blocks. The actual built-up section covered an area of
                    approximately a square mile, but the pattern of a city at least twice this size was already in the
                    making by the early 1850's.
            The streets laid out by the founders were lengthened and new ones added as boundaries of the city
                    stretched out in the three principal directions. Surfacing operations and maintenance of the
                    expanding network proceeded only so fast as the public demanded and the available technical
                    knowledge permitted. Although 
                        New Albany
                    's streets were a topic of much local boasting in the pre-Civil War years,
                    claims as to their adequacy ignored a few pertinent facts. "Unlike some metropolitan cities
                    of larger pretensions," wrote a booster in 1866, "we are not wallowing in the mud
                    and mire six months of the year and buried in dust the balance."8 Such
                    statements were designed for outside consumption, for local residents could hardly have avoided
                    knowing that the opposite was closer to the truth. As in the case of the neighboring country roads
                    and turnpikes, the city's streets were laid out, macadamized, opened to traffic, and then,
                    in a remarkably short time, declared to be inadequate and in serious need of further improvement.9 A typical street of mid-century 
                        New Albany
                     was really little more than a wide pathway, dusty and smelly in the summer and almost
                    impassably muddy in the wet seasons.10 On the main streets there was a semblance
                    of sidewalks, but in adverse weather high-top boots for pedestrians were, as the Ledger put it,
                    "all the go."11 Concealed mudholes were a major inconvenience
                    and even a hazard, especially at night in the dimly lighted areas.12 Gutters
                    were often collecting

                     places for all kinds of debris and refuse, their only real
                    cleansing coming from the flushing effect of a heavy rain.13
            
            These conditions did not prevail because of any lack of regulations applying to the streets. A
                    comprehensive list of laws was drawn up under the earlier town government and most of them were
                    retained in a modified form as city ordinances. In the 1830's local laws had been passed
                    prohibiting digging or taking away "any earth, sand, or gravel to the injury of any
                    street," or "placing any obstructions on any street, alley, side walk or public
                    ground." Gutters along the paved streets were supposed to be cleaned periodically, at least
                    once a month, and loose stones swept back into their proper place.14 In 1844 the
                    city was divided into "road districts" to facilitate street maintenance, with work
                    in each district directed by a supervisor who had authority to call upon any resident to join in the
                    maintenance labor.15 Later (1853) when the position of street commissioner was
                    created this work was centralized under his supervision. The commissioner was authorized to
                    "employ the necessary workmen" and use the inmates of the city jail to help him
                    carry out his responsibilities.16
            
            In these days before the common use of concrete and asphalt, keeping streets in a serviceable
                    condition called for constant effort and experimentation. A watering cart was sometimes used to
                    settle dust, and attempts were made to

                            under such laws are rare. In 1830 a Luke Enlon was criticized for obstructing the sidewalk
                            with a pile of cord wood, but the town fathers decided just to remind Enlon that there was a
                            regulation to the effect that sidewalks were not supposed to be cluttered. Minutes of the

                            Gazette, April 24, 1844. This city ordinance is reminiscent of old
                            European laws providing for street and road maintenance. Section 3 states that "It
                            shall be the duty of each supervisor: elected … to notify each person resident in
                            his respective district liable by law to work on the roads, of the time and place [in] the
                            district at which such person is required to work for two days specified in said notice, and
                            the tool or instrument he is required to bring with him." Section 4 provides that
                            the supervisor has the authority to collect the "penalty" from
                            "… every person notified to work as aforesaid and not exempt by law or
                            excused by the Mayor and Council, who shall fail to comply with the provisions of this
                            ordinance." It is unlikely that residents, rich and poor, turned out in any great
                            number to perform work on the streets; thus, the practical result of this ordinance was the
                            levying of a "corvee" tax.

                     counteract the summer stench by liming the worst streets.17 Local editors often attacked what they considered the laxity of the street
                    commissioner—for failing to keep the chuck holes filled, or allowing dead hogs to lie for
                    days in the gutter.18 On the other hand, they occasionally praised
                    him—as when he demonstrated his ingenuity by removing an old tree that had long
                    "encumbered" the sidewalk at 
                        Pearl
                     and Oak and rolling the logs out into the street to "check up fast
                        drivers."19 Pressure to get the city's streets in a usable
                    condition apparently began to bear fruit in the middle and late 1850's. "Such is
                    the extent of street improvement now going on in this city," commented the editor of the
                        Ledger in August, 1853, "that the street commissioner has procured a
                    horse to ride around on, that he may the better and more promptly superintend the work."20 In 1857 the total length of macadamized streets in the city was reported to
                    be 22 miles—"a greater extent of paved streets than any city in the
                        state."21
            
            Facilities for lighting 
                        New Albany
                    's streets by gas first appeared in the early 1850's following the
                    authorization by the city council for John Lockwood and Associates to lay down seven thousand feet
                    of pipeline and construct a local gas works.22 Obviously this artificial
                    illumination brought about significant changes in the social pattern of the community, for
                    heretofore sundown marked the informal closing of most outdoor activities. The first gas lights were
                    installed in the business area in November, 1852, and within a few months most of the major streets
                    were equipped with them.23 Individual citizens paid for the lamps in front of
                    their property, while lighting and servicing the lamps were the responsibility

                            Daily Ledger, November 17, 1852. Water Street, which during this period
                            was the center of much commerce and industry, did not receive gas lights until 1860, Ibid., September 22, 1860.
               
                     of the gas company.24 The efficiency of the
                    lamplighters was sometimes criticized, for occasionally they did not get around to igniting the
                    lamps at all, and at times the globes were so heavily coated with carbon that they served little
                    purpose. "The glass of the city lamps again needs washing,'' chided the
                        Ledger in 1854. "The public would not object to seeing the lights
                    within them."25 Gas illumination was restricted to the streets and
                    public buildings; 
                        New Albany
                     homes continued to be lighted by kerosene and other traditional methods until the
                    introduction of electricity in the city near the close of the century.26
            
            The "natural springs" that the town's pioneers had been so enthusiastic
                    about in the founding years served as the major source of the community's water supply
                    until the last quarter of the century. This source was supplemented by surface water collected in
                    especially prepared underground cisterns and, in the dry season, by water carted from the river.27 Though some citizens had their own private wells, most of them relied on
                    public wells and cisterns dispersed throughout the city.28 As late as the
                    1840's water was drawn from the underground reservoirs by rope and bucket, but by the
                    1850's most of the public wells and cisterns had been capped with hand pumps.29 The Ledger reported in 1860 that there were eighty public and about sixty private pumps
                    in the city.30

                        "as cheap as stone, brick, or wood can be made." He constructed a cistern for
                        kale's Hotel with a capacity of 150 barrels and a number of others around town with a
                        capacity of about 60 barrels.

            As with other public facilities, maintenance of the public pumps was desultory. When a pump broke,
                    the people who depended on it were obliged to go for days without sufficient water or were forced to
                    carry their needed supply for several blocks from another neighborhood.31 Public
                    wells and pumps were natural focal points for exchange of gossip, and this neighborly congregation
                    was sanctioned so long as it did not seriously interfere with the primary function of the watering
                    places. But an early town law prohibited bathing, washing of clothes, or the fastening of
                    "any horse, ox, or team to or at any such well or pump," and this regulation was
                    retained in substance in city ordinances of the early 1850's.32
            
            In 
                        New Albany
                     at mid-century there was a vague awareness of what might result if sanitary measures
                    were not pursued, but this did not mean that cleanliness always prevailed in the growing city. Town
                    and city ordinances prohibiting the throwing of "rubbish, offal, or filth, into or upon any
                    street, alley, sidewalk, or public place" were ignored with a remarkable
                        frequency."33 For example, in 1854 when a pedestrian on Market
                    Street became the victim of a deluge of dishwater from a second-story window, he relied on a
                    personal form of law enforcement and heaved a brick "through the aperture from whence the
                    unwelcome bath had proceeded."34 If news items in the local dailies
                    have any validity, odors floating through some sections of the city in the summer time were
                    "extremely insalubrious" and "perfectly sickening."35 Editors persistently prodded civic officials to see that local merchants were
                    prevented from selling tainted food, that residents cleaned up their backyards, and that

                        endangering the public health" were duly covered in city ordinances.

            It was a common attitude among people of mid-century 
                        New Albany
                     that their city was normally free of contagious diseases and that any cases which
                    developed there were brought in by some irresponsible person from the outside—an attitude
                    which had its roots in the frontier circumstances of the early town. An example of how the young
                    community sometimes dealt with individual cases of communicable disease can be glimpsed from the
                    record of an episode occurring in 1830. Doctor Asahel Clapp was then the leading physician in the
                    town, and his distinction brought him some of the less pleasant medical tasks: 
                        Dr. Clapp, who was invited to this [town council] meeting stated: That he discovered Symptoms
                            of the small pox on a certain black woman, who came lately from the other side of the river
                            and lived now in town, that there would be danger, if she should be suffered to remain so,
                            of spreading out this malady among our citizens: Therefore on motion resolved
                        That Doctor Clapp be politely called upon and hereby authorized to go to 
                                Louisville
                             in order to make inquiry whether this poor black woman could be received there
                            in a hospital purposely kept for this kind of people and in case of a favorable answer to
                            hire a hack and bring her conveniently to that asylum and all this on the expense of the 
                                New Albany
                             corporation.37

                        New Albany
                     uncomfortably close to the affected areas in the South where many of the epidemics
                    seemed to have their origin. When passengers heard that a contagious disease had broken out on board
                    they naturally were anxious to get off at the first opportunity—and 
                        New Albany
                     could be as eligible a debarking point as anywhere else along the river.38
                    
                        New Albany
                     did not welcome such emergency visitors. An ordinance passed in 1839 and reissued in
                    the 1850's was designed to insure against such outside contamination. Its original wording
                    may appear a bit naive and provincial, but it shows how concerned the inhabitants of 
                        New Albany
                     were to keep themselves isolated from the dreaded southern plagues:

                            Daily Ledger, April 3,1850: "We learn that ten deaths occurred on

            The tendency among 
                        New Albany
                     people to isolate themselves from "infected" persons was further
                    reflected in the hospital controversy of 1852. The Presbyterian Theological Seminary in 
                        New Albany
                     was prepared to sell its buildings and site on East Elm to the city for a hospital.
                    There was no local hospital, and the editor of the Ledger was representative of
                    the faction who wanted the situation to remain just that way. To him a hospital was synonymous with
                    pest-house—"a receptacle for the victims of small pox, ship fever, and other
                    infectious diseases, who are landed from Southern steamboats." Such a place would be a
                    "manifest outrage on the rights of citizens owning property in the vicinity." He
                    pointed out further that the city was rapidly building up toward this section, and a populous
                    neighborhood was certainly no place for a hospital. If one were necessary at all it should be placed
                    a safe distance outside the city limits "on a high, open space, where fresh air, would be
                    constantly blowing, and away from the heart of the city, surrounded by the dwellings of citizens,
                    who, with their families, are momentarily in danger of being stricken down by the poisonous effluvia
                    constantly sent forth from the disease filled building."40 The proposal
                    to establish the hospital was ultimately defeated, and though during the Civil War residents of the
                    city became accustomed to having emergency hospitals for wounded soldiers in their midst, it was
                    many decades before they allowed a civilian "pesthouse" to be built within the
                    city limits.41

                  41 At times during the Civil War there were ten or more makeshift
                        hospitals for wounded soldiers located in 
                            New Albany
                         with the total number of patients as high as 1600. Ibid.,

            Apparently 
                        New Albany
                     did remain relatively free of epidemics throughout the pre-Civil War period.
                    Undoubtedly there were some serious plague scares in the 1830's, one of these being hinted
                    at by the European traveler, Maximilian, Prince of Neuwied, in 1834.42 But the
                    nearest thing to a real epidemic in 
                        New Albany
                     for which there is a fairly detailed record was the cholera siege of 1850. Fatalities
                    in the city resulting from the epidemic were few, but the threat lingered for almost a year. The
                    crisis prompted 
                        New Albany
                     residents to resort to the most advanced sanitary precautions that the times afforded.
            Initial warning of this serious epidemic was sounded by the Ledger in February of
                    1850: 
                        Indications are all around us that this dread disease has not left our shores, and that on
                            the approach of Spring we may reasonably expect that it will revisit us. … In
                            almost all of the towns of the Lower 
                                Mississippi
                             fatal cases have occurred within the last two or three weeks. In view of these
                            facts, it becomes the duty of our city authorities to be prepared for the coming
                                destroyer.43
                  
                    
            
            A month later, as the disease moved up the Mississippi valley, the alarm spread:
                    "We hope that our city and neighborhood may escape, but this is by no means certain. Let
                    every precaution be used against its progress, if, unfortunately, it should visit us."44 By the middle of the summer the disease had penetrated the lower
                        Ohio valley, and residents of 
                        New Albany
                     launched a cleanup campaign in an effort to keep their city immune from its ravages.
                    Lime was spread over backyards and alleys in order to prevent the "contamination"
                    from spreading, while a quarantine was placed on areas in the community where cases were known 
                  "United Charities Hospital" was established in the city in November,
                            1888. D. P. Robbins,

                             on his return trip from the American West in 1834 because "there had

                     to exist.45 Whether it was the result of
                    the sanitary measures, or mere chance, 
                        New Albany
                     was scarcely touched by the disease.46 Dozens of cases were
                    reported in neighboring 
                        Louisville
                    , and citizens were reported to have fled in all directions from that city.47 Other southern Indiana towns were severely hit, and many deaths were reported
                    in 
                  Shelbyville, Madison
               , and 
                        Jeffersonville
                    . At 
                        Jeffersonville
                     the disease swept through the state penitentiary and killed twenty-five of the one
                    hundred inmates.48
            
            Besides the dreaded cholera and smallpox, other diseases commonly mentioned in the 
                        New Albany
                     papers in the pre-Civil War years were "consumption," "the
                    flux," ague, and scarlet fever ("the red demon of the nursery").49 Numerous remedies were proposed for the various ailments, but few of them
                    would be acceptable to medical practitioners of a century later. Cure-all remedies were in
                    abundance, and the space which their advertisements occupied in the local papers is ample proof that
                    there was a market for them in the area.50 Moffat's "Life
                    Pills and Phoenix Bitters'' were advertised as a "permanently
                    efficacious" treatment for fever, ague, and bilious fevers.51 Cumfries

                            helped to popularize the various miracle cures: "Remarkable phenomenon—A

                            days ago by medicine which expelled a tapeworm fifty-two and a half feet long. Dr. s. Heine
                            was the physician, and administered but four table spoons of the medicine, whatever it was,

                    Every One His Own Physician!" ("Showing private diseases in every shape and
                        form").55 Women wishing to avoid conception "without
                    incurring danger to health or constitution" could purchase from Doctor Gates of 
                        Louisville
                     some of Monsieur La Craux's "French Preventive Powders" or
                    "Female Monthly Pills."56
            
            In spite of the availability of these home remedies there was still a place in 
                        New Albany
                     for physicians, and around mid-century there were at least fifteen practicing most of
                    the time. Some were transients who hung their shingles out for a brief period and then moved on.57 Most of the doctors

                            directories give a basis for estimating the number of physicians in the community. For
                            example see ibid., September 21, 1849; Gabriel

                     were general practitioners, but occasionally one advertised
                    himself as a specialist in surgery, obstetrics, homeopathy, or dentistry.58 The
                    majority of them probably received their training as apprentices to other doctors, while a few
                    claimed to be college-trained. In 1837 a Doctor Pollard represented himself as a graduate of the
                    "Medical College of 
                        Ohio
                    ";59 another claimed to have received his formal training
                    in Europe—just where he did not say.60 The Medical Department of
                    Transylvania University, 
                  Lexington, Kentucky
               , customarily advertised for prospective
                    students in the 
                        New Albany
                    
                    Gazette during the 1830's, and possibly some of the local physicians
                    received their schooling there.61
            
            The only medical school that 
                        New Albany
                     was ever reported to have was clearly a fraudulent one, sometimes known as the
                    "University of Indiana," and sometimes as "Christian College."
                    Headed by a John Cook Bennett, it was granted a charter in 1833 by the Indiana General Assembly. It
                    was to have "full power and authority to confer or cause to be conferred degrees."
                    There is only one known extant diploma from the "College," but many more were
                    probably issued. The issue date of the one extant diploma was only forty days after the charter
                    date! Evidence that such a corporation had been chartered led to the belief that it was the pioneer
                    medical school in Indiana, but later scholars have concluded that it was strictly a degree-selling
                    enterprise that added little distinction to Indiana's—or

            A feature of 
                        New Albany
                     that clearly symbolized its urban development up through the 1850's was its
                    facilities for fire protection. In 1830 there was little organization and practically no equipment
                    to deal with the frequent conflagrations; by 1860 there were five well-trained fire companies with
                    some of the best fire-fighting apparatus obtainable. 
                        New Albany
                    's firemen were the community's heroes, embodying the courage of the
                    early Indian fighter with the physical prowess of today's athlete.
            The inadequacy of the old "bucket brigade" method of fire fighting prompted town
                    officials in 1830 to purchase 
                        New Albany
                    's first fire engine. This was the "Comet," a hand-towed,
                    hand-operated pump for which the American Hydraulic Company was paid three hundred dollars. To
                    insure its efficient operation the council this same year authorized the formation of a
                    "volunteer" fire department known as the 
                        Washington
                     Company.63 Ten years later a hook and ladder company was added, a
                    total of $155.00 being allotted for the "carriages" and
                    $120.00 for an engine house.64 This company was composed of thirty
                    men: twelve "hook men," ten "ladder men," and eight
                    "axe men." Like the 
                        Washington
                     Company, this group appointed its own officers and made its own regulation.65
            
            All of the burden of fire fighting was not placed on these two early companies, for during the
                    1830's and 1840's fighting the flames was still regarded as a community project.
                    There was an ordinance making it mandatory for every able-bodied man to appear at a fire to lend his
                    assistance. Two fire wardens were appointed in each of the three wards (1836), and, according to the
                    ordinance, they "shall number themselves, by ballot, from one to six; and shall have
                    command in the order of the respective numbers, that one who shall have the lowest number, present
                    at any fire, being the first in command.'' The second-in-command, designated the

                     64 Town ordinances passed in 1836 provided for the creation of the
                            hook and ladder company, but apparently equipment for such a company was not supplied until
                            1840.

                     warden," superintended the "requisite supply
                    of water for the fire engine or engines" and gave "all necessary commands and
                    direction for that purpose to the citizens." The other four wardens, all with white bands
                    on their hats to designate their authority, served as deputies and aids to the commanding fire
                        warden.66 This rather involved chain of command was dispensed with in 1853
                    upon the appointment of a regular chief fire engineer who had the power to delegate his deputies at
                    each individual fire.67
            
            Water to subdue the flames came from special cisterns located at strategic spots throughout the
                    community. Most of these were supplied by natural wells, but, as in the case of other cisterns, it
                    was sometimes necessary to replenish them with water hauled from the river.68
                    "Good leather fire-buckets" were supplied by the individual property owners: every
                    owner of a "dwelling house, store, or ware-house" had to supply one; for every
                    additional eight hundred dollar value of his property he had to make available an extra one. When
                    the alarm was given every citizen was supposed to run to the scene with his bucket, or, if for some
                    excusable reason he could not make it to the fire, he was to have the bucket accessible by placing
                    it in front of his house.69
            
            The fire ordinances, like most of the other formal regulations of the growing community, probably
                    were not carried out to the letter. But the excitement accompanying a serious blaze did make for an
                    unusual degree of citizen cooperation. Such notices as the following indicate that the early system
                    worked at least some of the time: 
                        Croel Richards tenders his sincere thanks to the citizens of 
                                New Albany
                             for their timely assistance on the evening of the 8th instant, in removing his
                            furniture and rescuing his house from the flames. He feels that it was owing to their
                            kindness and prompt action that his house and furniture were saved from destruction.70

                     fighting fire by mass community participation, the task coming
                    to be more the responsibility of "professional" firemen. In the late
                    1840's a third company, the Hoosier, was organized; in 1850 the Osceola; in 1853 the 
                        Franklin
                    ; and shortly thereafter the Relief Company.71 These companies were
                    more than just fire-fighting outfits: they were in reality fraternal organizations, or lodges, whose
                    members were attracted by the opportunities to demonstrate occasionally their agility in fire
                        fighting.72 These later companies not only chose their own officers and made
                    their own bylaws, but they paid for most of their own equipment as well.73
            
            Rivalry among the fire companies was usually friendly but intense. This sometimes brought confusion
                    in the fire fighting operations, but on the whole it made for speedy and efficient service.74 The object of each company was to get to the scene first, throw the largest
                    stream of water, and win acclaim from applauding citizens for putting out the fire. The competitive
                    spirit of the companies carried over into their "extra-curricular" activities too;
                    they vied with each other in the gaiety of their uniforms, the furnishings of their club houses, the
                    care and attention given to their 
                  
                     71 The Hoosier Company may have been organized somewhat earlier, but
                            it was certainly in operation by the summer of 1850.

                            Daily Ledger, August 9, 1850. The Osceola Company was organized as the
                            Mohawk Company but came to be known by its more common name following the purchase of its
                            first engine (called "Osceola") and hose carriage (called
                            "Pocahontas") in 1851. Ibid., May 1, 1851, March 5,

                     73 The fire companies had to depend on their own resources for most of
                            their operating revenue. Public balls sponsored by the companies to raise funds were among
                            the most gala affairs of the 1850's. Ibid., January 29, 1851,
                            June 11, 1856. On one occasion the Osceola Company solicited from the city government
                            $150.00 to help in the purchase of a city fire bell, the city officials agreeing
                            to only half of this amount. Ibid., March 5, 1852. In 1858 the Hoosier
                            Company was forced to sell some of its meeting hall furniture to pay its expenses. The Tribune hints that their ostentatious policies prompted members of the
                            Hoosier Company to over-extend themselves financially.

                     equipment, and the adeptness with which they handled their
                    pumping apparatus. Off-duty stream-throwing contests were tremendously popular in 
                        New Albany
                     in the 1850's. At an appointed time the challenging companies pulled their
                    engines beside one of the tallest landmarks in the city and measured the distance they could direct
                    the water from their hand-pumped machines. The 
                        Washington
                     Company machine, built in 1854 by B. F. Lemon of 
                        New Albany
                    , shot a stream of water ten feet over the 160-foot steeple of the Second Presbyterian
                        Church.75 Local companies took their machines as far away as 
                        Indianapolis
                     to challenge fire teams of other towns in this sport and attempt to bring the honors
                    back to 
                        New Albany
                    .76
            
            On parade days the fire companies were particularly conspicuous. Members polished and decorated their
                    engines and then turned out in full regalia to march in the colorful procession. Their dress
                    uniforms would have been of little help in fire and smoke.77 Below is a
                    description of three of the local companies when they prepared to take part in the 1853 
                        Louisville
                     Fourth of July parade: 
                        Osceola—White coats, faced and tipped with red, black pants and drab hats, a la
                            Kossuth. Their Engine will be drawn by six beautiful gray horses, and their Hose carriage by
                            four superb black ones.
                        
                     
                                Washington
                            —Red coats, faced and tipped with black velvet, white pants and white
                            felt hats. They will carry with them a magnificent banner, costing the company nearly one
                            hundred dollars.
                        Hook and Ladder—Yellow coats, tipped and faced with black velvet, white pants and
                            green hats. Their carriage is to be drawn by six beautiful and spirited horses.78
                  
                    
            
            The companies succeeded frequently in combating house fires, but at more serious fires, such as those
                    at the Reisinger lard factory in 1856, the 
                        New Albany
                     and 
                        Salem
                     Railroad shops in 1858, and the 
                        Hamilton
                     and Lewis pork house in 1860, they could generally do little more than stand idly by
                    and wait for total destruction.79 During the 1850's fire damage
                    sometimes was as low as a few thousand dollars

                     annually, but because of some costly fires, $25,000
                    was considered a low annual average.80 Though arson was almost invariably given
                    as a cause for the fires, few, if any, of the suspected parties were ever convicted.81
            
            By the late 1850's the enlarged buildings and industrial plants of the city had made the old
                    hand-pumped machines outmoded. In 1863 the first steam-operated equipment was purchased by the city,
                    and shortly thereafter the companies were consolidated into a city fire department.82 The new system
                    proved to be more efficient than the one it replaced, although perhaps less dramatic.
            Published crime reports at mid-century indicate that law violation in 
                        New Albany
                     was certainly approaching urban dimensions. Though it is neither just nor scholarly to
                    sort from contemporary newspapers the most sensational accounts of law violation and consider them
                    typical of everyday life in the city, the prevalence of certain items-back before the days of
                    "yellow journalism"—justifies the conclusion that mid-century 
                        New Albany
                     experienced about every kind of misdeed that mankind ever devised. Most of the
                    violations involved petty thievery and general rowdyism, but one need not read far to find examples
                    of murder, rape, infanticide, armed robbery, counterfeiting, organized prostitution, and mob
                    violence.

                        New Albany
                    's over-all crime record for these years is unique or merely normal for a
                    community of its size in this era cannot be determined without a more intensive comparative study of
                    other localities. But part of its record of law violation can be accredited to its proximity to the
                    river, which served as a convenient medium of entrance and exit for
                        "floaters.''83 Part of it can be adjudged

                            magnificent buildings, yet it is difficult to account for any other hypothesis."

                     phase of that universal contest between
                    "haves" and "have-nots" which becomes particularly acute in a
                    young society where the two groups are jockeying for position. And part of it must be explained as
                    the normal friction which is a concomitant of urban living.
            In the 1850's civic officials never found a way to cope with the outbreaks of robbery and
                    burglary. After dark thieves swept in from their rendezvous along the river or in the nearby hills,
                    broke into shops and houses, maliciously accosted pedestrians, and then were gone without a trace by
                        morning.84 The presence of a police force, consisting of a full-time marshal
                    and six or seven "watchmen," apparently added zest to the game played by the night
                        marauders.85 In 1853, when the store of a leading merchant was burglarized
                    under their very noses, the whole force of watchmen was temporarily dismissed as a waste of the
                    taxpayers' money.86
            
            Assaults on night pedestrians were common. On one occasion James Brooks, retired president of the 
                        New Albany
                     and 
                        Salem
                     Railroad, was attacked and beaten as he stepped out of his house on Main Street, and a
                    few nights later another prominent citizen received the same treatment.87 The
                    editor of the Ledger advised the carrying of revolvers by persons venturing out at night with money
                    in their pockets that they might "be able to answer rationally the demands of
                        highwaymen."88
                    
                        New Albany
                    's criminal population received valuable additions from the nearby 
                        Jeffersonville
                     state prison, many of the dismissed prisoners lingering in the vicinity to pursue their
                    original careers as opportunities presented themselves. In 1859 the Ledger
                    reported that "no less than fifty-one penitentiary birds" assembled at a house
                    west of Falling Run bridge to plan their pilfering campaigns.89

                        19, 1859. The following report gives an idea of the modus operandi of one thief: "Mr.
                        Perdue … who lives on Spring, between Lower 4th and 5th, was robbed of about
                        $100 in money last night. It appears that the money was in his pocket loose, and upon
                        going to bed he put his pants between the feather bed and mattress on which he slept, and when
                        he got up this morning he found the money gone, with the window open. This is certainly a faring
                        robbery." Ibid., July 25, 1857.

                        little to curb activities of night marauders.

            With the fighting and brawling that customarily took place in the course of the night hours it is
                    little wonder that law enforcement officers were distracted from more serious offenses. Drunken
                    rowdyism, wife-beating, and an occasional outbreak of serious rioting kept the watchmen busy most of
                    the time.90 The profane shouting of drunken river hands demanding hospitality in
                    a respectable hotel, a pugilistic contest between "two sons of the Emerald Isle,"
                    an hilarious descent by pranksters on the home of an unsuspecting Negro, a skirmish on a steamboat,
                    at the railroad depot, or at some gambling den—these made up the dramatic side of 
                        New Albany
                    's night life in the 1850's91
            
            Juveniles contributed their share of excitement too. Young boys ganged up for the purpose of stealing
                    "anything they can lay their hands on," or simply to make themselves a general
                    nuisance to "respectable" adults.92 Some of the bolder ones
                    sneaked into the woods to "pass the Sabbath by card playing''; others
                    entertained themselves by behaving "in a most disgraceful manner" at some public
                    function or by throwing stones at intoxicated pedestrians.93 Obviously their
                    favorite pastime, and one for which they received frequent rebukes, was congregating on street
                    corners to insult lady passers-by. Sunday was the best day to pursue this particular avocation:
                        
                        Considerable complaint is made of those young men who are in the habit of crowding around the
                            doors of the churches in the city every time there is service in them, and making scurrilous
                            remarks upon the ladies who may pass in and out of the church. If the city watchmen would
                            devote a few hours of their time each Sabbath towards putting a stop to such scandalous
                            conduct, they would no doubt receive the hearty thanks of many of the ladies of the city.94
                  
                    Young boys could be depended on to add their bit to a colorful political demonstration. When
                    a delegation of Buchanan supporters from 
                        Jeffersonville
                     visited 
                        New Albany
                     in 1856, they were pummeled with stones from the practiced

                     arms of "half-grown boys."95 When things around town were particularly dull they turned in fire alarms so they could
                    watch the "masheens" race through the streets. The Ledger
                    recommended that more of the "little spalpeens" be spanked, but the little
                    spalpeens kept a jump or two ahead of the marshal and his men.96
            
            Local editors were not at all hesitant to inform their readers and the apathetic police that
                    prostitution was rampant in the city.97 Sometimes they brought enough pressure
                    to bear to cause a general roundup of street-walkers, or a raid on some reported "house of
                    ill fame." Prostitution, counterfeiting, and other misdeeds were often joint enterprises,
                    and a raid on a notorious "den of iniquity" sometimes filled the jail with a
                    variety of offenders.98 Occasionally a "procurer" would be
                    snared and brought before the bar of justice. Such was Randolph Carter: 
                        [Carter] a tall, cadaverous looking animal, was cited before the Mayor this morning to answer
                            the charge of keeping a house of ill fame. Upon the testimony of several creditable
                            witnesses it was conclusively proven that Carter made advantageous and judicious
                            arrangements with all who wished accomodation [sic], at his own house. In
                            consideration of the premises and the direct tendency of the evidences toward immorality,
                            and not deeming the kind of business carried on by Carter profitable to the community, if so
                            to himself, his Honor fined the old pimp $25 and costs. It is to be hoped he will
                            inhabit Castle Frederick [popular name for the 
                                Floyd County
                             jail] for some time and serve the city on the streets until the full penalty is
                                paid.99
                  
                    
            
            As a rule, justice was speedy once culprits in mid-century 
                        New Albany
                     were apprehended. Disturbers of the peace were usually arraigned before a
                    magistrate's court within a few hours and fined a few dollars plus costs.100 If they could not produce the fine they were put to work, as was 
                        Randolph

                     97 The editors were adept at applying euphemisms when referring to
                            prostitution. For example: "His Honor, Mayor Burnett, had two cases before him this
                            morning. One, Miss Ferguson, whose chastity is said to be somewhat elastic was arraigned on
                            the charge of being drunk and disorderly." "Liz Atkins up again for
                            prowling about the streets at night. Discharged on condition that she leave the
                            city." Ibid., January 25, 1860, July 7, 1857.

                     Carter, repairing the streets.101 Extended
                    prison sentences were frequently handed down by the 
                        Floyd County
                     circuit court, sometimes with a puzzling interpretation of justice. Edward Collins
                    received a two-year sentence for assault and battery with intent to commit murder, while a man named
                    Seibert received a similar sentence for stealing two hams, and William Murrick, a Negro, three years
                    for taking a pair of pantaloons.102 There was an occasional expression of lynch
                    law, particularly when the moral conscience of the community had been affronted. In 1850 a Negro was
                    tarred and feathered for consorting with a white woman, and this same year another Negro accused of
                    rape would have been hanged on the spot "but for the interference of some peaceably
                    disposed citizens."103
            
            The only public execution around mid-century, one of three ever occurring in 
                        New Albany
                    , took place in the winter of 1850.104 The victim was William Gross
                    who had murdered a man in 
                        Jeffersonville
                     and who was brought over to 
                        New Albany
                     for hanging.105 Gallows were constructed on a vacant lot down by
                    Falling Run Creek several days before the hanging, and by the time the eventful day had arrived,
                    several thousand people were on hand as witnesses. Just as at the public execution in 1821, there
                    was much excitement and a temporary suspension of normal activities.106 For some
                    time after, the spot where the gallows stood held a superstitious fascination for some of the New
                    Albanyians, serving on at least one occasion as a dramatic setting for a duel.107
            
            Inmates of the local county jail had so increased by the 1850's that the accommodations were
                    thoroughly inadequate.108 Customarily it was populated by fifteen or twenty

                            The county jail in use until 1859 was probably the one constructed around 1830. The
                            "new" jail, located at State and Spring, was opened for use in July, 1859.
                            It cost $18,940.14.

                     offenders, of both sexes, some awaiting trial at the next
                    circuit court, some serving time for failure to meet a small fine, and some just sleeping off a
                        "drunk."109 There is no detailed record of what the
                    interior of the jail looked like, but from reports of fights occurring there several prisoners were
                    obviously confined in one cell.110 Jail breaks were not uncommon, and sometimes
                    all but one or two of the inmates fled together.111 The sheriff was responsible
                    for feeding and guarding the prisoners, the latter duty requiring constant vigilance on his part. On
                    one occasion he broke up a jail riot by chaining the prisoners to the walls.112
                    On another he demonstrated his rather wide discretionary powers by resorting to a popular form of
                    corporal punishment: 
                        Ryland Shuck, the young rascal recently sentenced to the penitentiary from this city, was
                            severely cowhided by Sheriff Frederick this morning, who had learned that Shuck had been
                            circulating false reports as to his relations with his (Frederick's) daughter, a
                            very young girl. … This young scamp is utterly unprincipled, and is capable of
                            any villainy.113
                  
                    
            
            The "Anglo-Saxon" population strain which had been predominant in 
                        New Albany
                     since the early days of settlement had by mid-century become leavened by large numbers
                    of Irish and Germans. By 1900 these elements would be assimilated into the community and noted for
                    their leadership roles; but in the 1850's their presence, if not openly resented, created
                    conditions that taxed the patience and ingenuity of civic officials. Irish immigrants were welcome
                    enough as laborers on the railroad and turnpike projects, but their exuberance and unfamiliar habits
                    caused much eyebrow raising on the part of "older" and more staid New
                        Albanyians.114 Local papers almost daily reported in the 1850's to

                     114 This commonplace episode is indicative of the role the Irish
                            played in 
                                New Albany
                             society in the 1850's: "An Irish woman walked into a house on
                            Market street yesterday, and stepping up to a bed took therefrom a quilt with which she
                            deliberately vamoased [sic]. Several persons were in the room at the time,
                            but were so lost in astonishment at her cool impudence that they made no effort to arrest
                            her and recover the stolen quilt." Ibid., October 24,1853.
               
                     the effect that the Irish had been "kicking up another
                    row," and the marshal and his deputies became accustomed to herding together large groups
                    of them and locking them in jail until they sobered up.115 When such vivacious
                    offenders as Dave Collins went on a drunken rampage there was excitement enough for everybody.
                    Collins and his Irish friends spent one thrill-packed evening in the summer of 1859 beating up two
                    German families in the west end, attacking random pedestrians on the downtown streets, and then
                    upsetting two men in a skiff along the river bank. "Thinking forbearance no longer a
                    virtue," west end residents formed a vigilance party and rounded up Collins. Next morning
                    the mayor fined him five dollars and costs.116 The Irish were just above the
                    Negroes on the social ladder, and for dozens of misdeeds whose responsibility could not be readily
                    established, the Irish served as convenient scapegoats. Some of the more reckless, such as Dave
                    Collins, accepted their role as troublemakers and played it to the hilt.
            Representatives of the German population were also conspicuous in many of the local brawls of the
                    1850's, their natural proclivity for good fellowship occasionally leading to commotions not
                    sanctioned by their neighbors.117 On the whole the Germans of the community were
                    "accepted" and did not bear the same social stigma as the Irish. But occasionally
                    they were victims of violent outbursts of anti-foreignism, and they were not reluctant to defend
                        themselves.118
            
            The city had its "Negro problem" too. As the slavery issue became more acute at
                    mid-century, 
                        New Albany
                    's location on the Ohio River, just above the North-South
                    dividing line, placed it in a crucial position. Local opinion regarding the Negro ranged from
                    extreme benevolence to open hostility, the most prevalent attitude probably lying somewhere 
                  
                     115 Such reports were particularly noticeable in the summer of 1853,
                            about the period when nativism was at full tide. Although the Ledger editor opposed the Know
                            Nothing Party which stressed nativism, his paper consistently expressed anti-Irish sentiment
                            in its reporting. For examples see ibid., July 6, 9, 11, 25, August 4, 25,

                     in between.119 The general policy was to
                    keep the Negro population small enough to be manageable and restrict it to a suburban section known
                    as "West Union."120 There are records of serious rioting
                    against local Negroes in the 1850's, but the most disturbing outbreaks were reserved for
                    the next decade when the charged atmosphere of Civil War prompted extremists to handle the race
                    problem in their own arbitrary way.121
            
            
               
                  119 The editor of the Ledger reflects, for the times, a
                        more balanced and probably majority attitude of New Albanyians toward the Negro in the immediate
                        pre-Civil War years. He saw the presence of the Negro population as a potential source of
                        trouble, and therefore supported movements to restrict their number within the city (and within
                        the nation, i.e., emigration to Liberia). But he maintained in his editorialized news accounts
                        that the Negro must be treated in accordance with the established laws. On occasion he used
                        abusive language in referring to Negroes, but he stood firmly against any form of mob action.
                        For examples of these expressions see ibid., August 14, 1850, August 8, 9,
                        1860.

            Zigzagging across southern Indiana and 
                        Ohio
                     in the summer of 1863, John Hunt Morgan wove a trail as raddled as turkey tracks.
                    Although his pursuers were never more than a few hours behind him, they were never sure of the
                    whereabouts of the man known variously as The Thunderbolt of the Confederacy and The King of Horse
                        Thieves,1 until they stumbled upon him.
            Today, plaques and monuments mark 
                        Morgan
                    's route from Mauckport, Indiana, where he crossed the Ohio
                    River on a July day almost a century ago, to Salineville, 
                        Ohio
                    , near the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     line, where he surrendered eighteen days later. But the modern tourist who attempts to
                    follow that trail of some six hundred miles will find himself almost as confused as the Federal
                    cavalrymen 
                        Morgan
                     was dodging in 1863. The legend of 
                        Morgan
                    's Raid along the north shore of the 
                        Ohio

                        Morgan
                     himself once seemed to be.2
            
            At times, the vitality of the legend gives the visitor the impression that the country has not
                    changed since 
                        Morgan
                     swept across it. There have been changes of course, but off the main highways there is
                    much that remains the same. If those slumbering, isolated hill-villages dream at all, they can dream
                    now only of the past. On their quiet streets the houses where 
                        Morgan
                     dined and slept have a certain lustre upon them, and nearby, at crossroads and along
                    creekbanks, the old battle sites remain as they were when home guards stood and fought or, more
                    often, dropped their inadequate arms and fled. In the back-country lanes where 
                        Morgan
                     rode, it is possible still to imagine that distant thunder on a sultry summer day is
                    the echo of his horsemen's passing. And all along the way there are, still living in that
                    country, men and

                     women whose forebears sat on rail fences in their childhood and
                    watched the raiders gallop by.3
            
            Surviving also in southern Indiana and 
                        Ohio
                    , almost as vital as the legend of 
                        Morgan
                    , are the bitterness of 1863 and the contempt that was added to it when at last the
                    Confederate raider was captured and imprisoned in the 
                        Ohio
                     State Penitentiary, head shaved and beard shorn like a common criminal's. In
                    that country, The Thunderbolt is only The Horse Thief, and the descendants of the people he robbed
                    console themselves, like their forebears, with the conviction that his unauthorized invasion was a
                    failure.
            Actually, it was not.
            It is true that 
                        Morgan
                     lost to the Confederacy an organization of 2,400 seasoned cavalrymen. He did fail to
                    rally to his support the Copperheads believed numerous in the area through which he passed. He
                    turned eastward only sixty miles south of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , which indeed he might have captured and where he might have released and armed from
                    the city's arsenal some three thousand Confederate prisoners.4 And he
                    failed to unite with Lee in 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , as some say he intended to do.5
            
            But the arguments in 
                        Morgan
                    's favor are stronger.
            The damage to railroads, steamboats, bridges, and public stores inflicted by the raid amounted to at
                    least ten million dollars. The cavalry unit of 2,400 was disintegrated, but most of the men escaped
                    and lived to fight for the Confederacy again. In contrast with their own small losses, the raiders
                    captured and paroled six thousand Federal home guards and regulars and killed or wounded some six
                    hundred more, they kept thousands of Yankee citizens in a paralyzing state of panic for a fortnight,
                    and by their penetration behind the lines they immobilized 28,000 troops under General Ambrose
                    Burnside, who otherwise would have joined General William S. Rosecrans three weeks before the battle
                    of Chickamauga.6

                            Morgan
                         on his raid. Anyone who remembers 
                            Morgan
                         today, however, must be nearly a centenarian.

            On only one score can 
                        Morgan
                    's raid be truly said to have failed, and here the argument, like most of the
                    arguments against him, must rest on hypothesis. Since 
                        Morgan
                     was destined to disobey the orders of his commanding officer and cross the 
                        Ohio
                     eventually, it is too bad that he did not disobey nine months earlier, when he first
                    conceived and proposed the Indiana and 
                        Ohio
                     raid. Then, even with the same tactical mistakes and the same' losses, he
                    might have accomplished much more than he was able to accomplish in 1863.
            Nine months earlier, 
                        Morgan
                    's men were less war-weary, less starved for luxuries, and better
                        disciplined.7 Although the number of Copperheads in Indiana and 
                        Ohio
                     was probably exaggerated by the Republican canard that all Democrats were traitors of
                    one degree or another, what Southern sympathizers there were in the states north of the 
                        Ohio
                     might have welcomed the raiders more warmly if 
                        Morgan
                     had been able to keep them under control.
            Of more significance was the opportunity which lay within the grasp of General Braxton Bragg in 1862
                    and which was never to come again. That summer Bragg invaded 
                        Kentucky
                    . If he had joined forces with General Kirby Smith while 
                        Morgan
                     harassed the Federals' rear on Northern soil, he could easily have taken the
                    entire state out of the Union. All that was needed was to prevent General Don Carlos
                    Buell's being reinforced at 
                        Louisville
                    , and 
                        Morgan
                     could have accomplished that, just as he prevented Burnside from reaching Rosecrans in 
                        Tennessee
                     a year later. But Bragg said no, and 
                        Morgan
                     obeyed him. Buell got back to 
                        Louisville
                    , consolidated his forces, and returned to the offensive; and the Confederates'
                    opportunity was lost.
            All this is based on the assumption that Braxton Bragg would have acted swiftly and vigorously in
                    conjunction with a raid by 
                        Morgan
                     in 1862, and that of course is a large assumption. Still it can be soundly argued that
                    the tragedy of 
                        Morgan
                    's disobedience lies in its postponement. 
                        Morgan
                    's original proposal was a good one, but when finally his patience with his
                    over-cautious and short-sighted chief was exhausted and he took matters into his own hands, the most
                    propitious time for insubordination had passed.

            By the best accounts, 
                        Morgan
                     was an even better strategist than tactician. Nature had endowed him with
                    "gifts which she very rarely bestows, and which give the soldier who has them vast
                    advantages; a quickness of perception and of thought, amounting almost to intuition, an almost
                    unerring sagacity in foreseeing the operations of an adversary and in calculating the effect of his
                    own movements upon him, wonderful control over men, as individuals and in masses, and moral courage
                    and energy almost preternatural."8
            
            These are the words of Basil W. Duke, who commanded the first of the two brigades 
                        Morgan
                     led across the 
                        Ohio
                    . In his Reminiscences
               9 and his History of 
                            Morgan
                        's Cavalry, General Duke regards his commanding officer always with
                    admiration and respect. So, in The Partisan Rangers, does Adam R. Johnson, who
                    commanded the second brigade. Both these men were able and intelligent soldiers and both lived after
                    the war to become distinguished and respected citizens, Duke as a prominent lawyer in
                            
                  Louisville, Johnson
                as the founder and patriarch of a prosperous town in 
                        Texas
                    .10
            
            Their estimates of 
                        Morgan
                     should prove that he was neither the lawless brigand that his enemies in Indiana and 
                        Ohio
                     called him nor the unruly hothead that some historians have concluded he was because of
                    his insubordination on the banks of the 
                        Ohio
                    . By all standards of military conduct there is no justification for his action of
                    course, but if he had disobeyed Bragg earlier and achieved a greater success, the insubordination
                    would have been more generously regarded afterwards.
            Writing about the raid at the close of the war, Duke said that when 
                        Morgan
                     revealed his plan to ignore Bragg's instructions to confine his movements to 
                        Kentucky
                    , "all who heard him felt that he was right in the main, and although some of
                    us were filled with a grave apprehension, from the first, we felt an inconsistent confidence when
                    listening to him."11
            
            Shortly after the raid, when there was the threat of a Confederate court of inquiry, General Johnson
                    wrote to

                    I approved it then and will do so again if the opportunity offers."12
            
            The only officer in 
                        Morgan
                    's command who ever disagreed with him to the point of leaving him was the
                    fantastic English soldier of fortune, George St. Leger Grenfell.13 Sixty years
                    old, Grenfell had already fought with the French against the Moors, with the Moors against the
                    French, and with Garibaldi in South America. He was 
                        Morgan
                    's adjutant, responsible for the discipline of the troops, famous among them
                    for his red cap, his wild bushy beard, and his profane exasperation with their failures to submit to
                    European cavalry rules. Grenfell left 
                        Morgan
                     because he disapproved of one of the General's appointments.
            Afterwards, John Minor Botts, a 
                        Virginia
                     Unionist, reported that Grenfell described 
                        Morgan
                    's men as "a band of horse thieves and plunderers."14 At that time, however, Grenfell had grown weary of service on Jeb
                    Stuart's staff and was teetering on the verge of conversion to Botts's Unionist
                    principles. Later in the war, still a Confederate, Grenfell forgot his grudge and rejoined 
                        Morgan
                    's command.
            Although John Hunt Morgan was born in 
                        Alabama
                    , he regarded himself as a Kentuckian.15 He grew up in
                            
                  Lexington, Kentucky
               , a member of a slave-owning family. After a year of service
                    in the Mexican War, he returned to 
                        Lexington
                     and married a young woman of delicate health who was soon to die. In business, he was a
                    successful manufacturer of hemp and woolen goods, and he was active in many civic affairs.
            "His benevolence was so well known in 
                        Lexington
                    ," writes Basil Duke, "that to ‘go to Captain
                    Morgan’ was the first thought of every one who wished to inaugurate a charitable
                    enterprise, and his business house was the rendezvous for all the distressed."16
            
            An ardent believer in states' rights and a Secessionist, 
                        Morgan
                     had a lively interest in politics, but he never ran for public office. He was active in
                    local military affairs, however, and organized and captained the 
                        Lexington

                        Kentucky
                    , and offered their services to General Albert Sidney Johnston.
            When 
                        Morgan
                     embarked upon the Indiana and 
                        Ohio
                     raid, he was thirty-eight years old, married for the second time, a brigadier general,
                    a cavalryman of two years of arduous service raiding in 
                        Kentucky
                     and 
                        Tennessee
                    , and a veteran of the battle of 
                        Shiloh
                    . By the time he reached 
                  Brandenburg,
                            Kentucky
               , on the banks of the 
                        Ohio
                     on the morning of July 8, 1863, he had completed his raiding mission under
                    Bragg's orders. Capturing 
                        Columbia
                    , Lebanon, and 
                        Bardstown
                    , he had destroyed large quantities of Federal stores in 
                        Kentucky
                    , had thoroughly confused the Union command as to the intention of the Confederates, and
                    had already delayed Burnside's march into East 
                        Tennessee
                     to join Rosecrans. By that time, too, he had long since made up his mind to cross
                    independently into the rich country north of the 
                        Ohio
                    .
            
               
                        Morgan
                    's reasons that July morning were not so cogent as they had been nine months
                    earlier when he first contemplated the raid, but they were still valid. Bragg and Rosecrans were
                    facing each other now in 
                        Tennessee
                    , neither ready to strike. They had already engaged in one major battle, at
                        Stones River, and each could claim a sort of victory, Bragg's
                    statistical, Rosecrans's strategic, but neither's decisive. Bragg's force
                    was smaller than Rosecrans's, but it was in top condition, had the advantage of shorter
                    supply lines, and was maneuvering on familiar terrain. If Burnside could be kept in the North, the
                    chances of the Confederates holding their own at least were still good.
            Elsewhere, conditions seemed to favor a bold Confederate action of the sort 
                        Morgan
                     was about to undertake. Down the 
                  Mississippi, Grant
                was still hammering at 
                        Vicksburg
                     and had not yet overpowered it when 
                        Morgan
                     left 
                        Tennessee
                    . In the East, the Confederate Army had won two major victories, at 
                        Fredericksburg
                     and Chancellorsville, and, so far as 
                        Morgan
                     knew when he stood on the banks of the 
                        Ohio
                    , Lee was still marching into 
                        Pennsylvania
                    . Finally, in the North, there were draft riots and a growing weariness of the war.
            How much these last two considerations weighed in 
                        Morgan
                    's decision is a matter for conjecture. He spoke on  several occasions of joining Lee in 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , but at the same time he was making definite plans to recross the 
                        Ohio
                     at Buffington Island above 
                        Cincinnati
                    .17 The project of union with Lee was probably only an alternative
                    to be resorted to if the crossing at Buffington Island failed. As for the dissidence in the North,
                    he would naturally have welcomed a large-scale revolt, but there is no good evidence that he counted
                    on support from Copperheads, in spite of attempts to prove that he was deeply involved in
                    "the Northwest Conspiracy." For one thing, 
                        Morgan
                    's first raid into 
                        Kentucky
                     the year before must have taught him not to expect recruits from Southern sympathizers.
                    If his fellow Kentuckians would not rally round him, certainly few disaffected Hoosiers and Ohioans
                    would do so. Morever, his treatment of the few Copperheads who approached him in Indiana and 
                        Ohio
                     demonstrates his lack of confidence in the Knights of the Golden Circle.
            "Good," he is reported to have said to one of them, as he took the
                    Copperhead's horse. "Then you ought to be glad to contribute to the
                        South."18
            
            The crossing of the 
                        Ohio
                     got off to a bad start. Although two steamboats were easily captured for the ferriage,
                    a party of home guards were established on the Indiana side behind houses and haystacks. The
                    raiders' Parrotts had to be put into action to silence the single Hoosier field-piece
                    before the crossing could commence. Then, after the Second 
                        Kentucky
                     and the Ninth 
                        Tennessee
                     were over the river and the home guards were retiring, a Federal gunboat steamed round
                    the bend and began tossing shells alternately at the raiders on the Indiana shore and those who had
                    not yet left 
                        Brandenburg
                     on the 
                        Kentucky
                     side.
            The appearance of the gunboat brought the ferrying to an abrupt halt. Worse still, it put the entire
                    Confederate force in a hazardous position. Delay was dangerous, because pursuing Federal cavalry
                    would soon be coming up from the south. Yet if the crossing was abandoned, half the troops would be
                    left stranded on the Indiana shore. 
                        Morgan
                     opened up on the gunboat with every piece of artillery at his disposal,

                     but for two hours he could not drive her off. When the
                    situation had come to seem most desperate, however, she suddenly turned tail and fled, her
                    ammunition exhausted.
            That night, after firing the two steamboats and setting them adrift, 
                        Morgan
                    's men camped at Frakes Mill six miles north of the river. Behind them, one of
                    the boats, the "Alice Dean," did not burn completely, and until only a few years
                    ago a part of its carcass was still visible in the water where it sank.19
            
            The next day, the raid was on in full swing,—and swing is a good word
                    for describing its progress. 
                        Morgan
                     had what the English call "a good eye for a country,"20 but he amplified his vision and prehension by using his troops as an insect uses its
                    tentacles. They rode usually in fours, and at every crossroad those at the head of the column fanned
                    out, foraged and scouted for several miles on both sides of the main force, and then rejoined it in
                    the rear. Thus was 
                        Morgan
                     not only kept informed of any threat on his flanks, he kept the countryside in a wide
                    area through which he passed in constant alarm and confusion as to his whereabouts and the direction
                    he was taking.
            A Canadian telegrapher named George Ellsworth, but called Lightning by the raiders, further extended 
                        Morgan
                    's vision and his knowledge of the purposes of his adversaries. Ellsworth had
                    the priceless skill of mimicry at the telegraph key.21 By watching a captured
                    operator work or by listening to one on a tapped wire, he could soon imitate the man's
                    style so well that he was able to deceive other operators and get information from them. Better
                    still, he could send out false information and even false orders. His expert faking made it possible
                    for 
                        Morgan
                     virtually to assume command of the enemy forces surrounding him and to put them almost
                    anywhere he wanted them.
            At Corydon, once the capital of Indiana, the raiders met their first serious resistance. Outside the
                    town, four hundred home guards barred their way. Before the defense could be broken, sixteen
                    Confederates were killed, but 
                        Morgan
                     was

                            boats is still visible on the Indiana side of the river below the landing."

                     able to enter the town in time for noonday dinner at the dinner
                    Hotel. It was while he was dining there, on July 9, that he learned from the innkeeper's
                    daughter that Lee had been defeated at 
                        Gettysburg
                     almost a week before.22 There is no evidence that he even
                    considered turning back when he received this disheartening information.
            After Corydon, the men were in the saddle twenty-one hours out of every twenty-four for the next two
                    weeks. They advanced to 
                        Salem
                    , Vienna, and 
                        Lexington
                    , but nine miles below Seymour they began to swing eastward toward the 
                        Ohio
                     line.
            When the news of the invasion came to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , its people were panic-stricken, and if 
                        Morgan
                     had pushed straight on from 
                        Salem
                     on July 10, he might indeed have captured the city.23 In another
                    twenty-four hours, however, it was too late. By that time, Governor Oliver P. Morton had the
                    situation in hand, General Lew Wallace, home on leave and on a fishing trip on the 
                        Wabash
                    , was back in uniform and on his way downstate to help General Edward H. Hobson, who was
                    hot on 
                        Morgan
                    's trail, and General Henry M. Judah, whom Burnside had dispatched in 
                        Cincinnati
                     to head the raiders off if he could. More damaging to 
                        Morgan
                    , however, than the combined maneuvers of all three of these generals was the thing that
                    was happening to his own men. They had begun to loot and to straggle.
            Horses had been taken as needed from the beginning. This was the custom of cavalrymen, both Union and
                    Confederate. It not only gave the raiders fresh mounts along the way, it denied them to their
                    pursuers. 
                        Morgan
                     tried to see that the exchanges were as fair and as legal as possible under the
                    circumstances, but in his swift, zigzag movements he lost contact with many of his men, and by the
                    time they reached 
                        Salem
                    , the plenitude of the shops and stores after impoverished Dixie was too much for them.
                    To use Basil Duke's euphemistic words, they developed "the propensity to
                    appropriate beyond limit or restraint."24
            
            General Duke could be—and was—more specific. Describing the raid for Century Magazine in January, 1891, he wrote:

                        The weather was intensely warm,—the hot July sun burned the earth to powder, and
                            we were breathing superheated dust,—yet one man rode for three days with seven
                            pairs of skates slung about his neck; another loaded himself with sleighbells. A large
                            chafing dish, a medium-sized Dutch clock, a green glass decanter with goblets to match, a
                            bag of horn buttons, a chandelier, and a birdcage containing three canaries, were some of
                            the articles I saw borne off and jealously fondled.25
                  
                    
            
            At 
                        Harrison
                    , Indiana, twenty-five miles from 
                        Cincinnati
                    , all detachments that could be reached were drawn in and thereafter a strong provost
                    guard kept the stragglers under some control. They would not throw away their loot, but from there
                    on their holiday was ended. 
                        Morgan
                     was no longer a wolf on the prowl; he was now a fox in flight, and the hounds were
                    baying all around him.
            Still, he was able for another two weeks to dodge, turn, stand at bay, turn and dodge again, and even
                    vanish for several hours at a time. He circled round 
                        Cincinnati
                     in the night, the men in the rear lighting torches every few yards to pick up the trail
                    of the vanguard in the foam dropped from the mouths of the horses and the dust kicked up by their
                        feet.26 Then on to Buffington Island, in as straight a line as he dared to
                    follow.
            Halfway to the proposed point of crossing the river, he learned that 
                        Vicksburg
                     had fallen and that Lee was retreating across the Potomac.27 At
                    1:00 P.M. on the eighteenth, he reached 
                  Chester,
                            Ohio
               , eighteen miles from his destination. He
                    knew that the river was rising and delay was dangerous, but his men were exhausted and he was
                    encumbered with two hundred wounded; so he postponed the crossing till the next morning and stopped
                    for a two-hour rest that would allow the stragglers to come up.
            This decision proved disastrous. The next morning, at the riverside, General Judah's whole
                    force was upon him. Then came Hobson's advance under General James M. Shackelford. And
                    after that, Federal gunboats appeared and began shelling the raiders from the river.

            Duke's brigade was lost in the ensuing battle, but 
                        Morgan
                     and Johnson succeeded in leading a thousand men out of the trap; and twenty miles
                    farther up the river they began to cross. Johnson got over with three hundred men, but when 
                        Morgan
                     himself had swum his powerful mount half way over, he turned back. Too many of his men
                    were behind him, and gunboats were approaching that would cut them off. He preferred to remain with
                    them to the end.
            Yet the end did not come for another six days, during which 
                        Morgan
                     traversed the eastern half of the state; and when finally he surrendered, he
                    surrendered voluntarily.
            He was riding along with Captain James Burbick of the Union militia near Salineville. He had
                    persuaded Captain Burbick to guide him to the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     line in return for his promise to leave the district unharmed.28
                    Suddenly he asked Burbick whether he would give him and his men paroles if he surrendered, and the
                    startled militiaman agreed. When the word was passed around to the 364 men remaining with 
                        Morgan
                    , they must have dropped from their saddles in unison, like the crew of the Ancient
                    Mariner's ship falling to the deck, for when Colonel Shackelford came along a few minutes
                    later, they were ail sound asleep.
            Shackelford refused to honor the terms Captain Burbick had granted 
                        Morgan
                    , and 
                        Morgan
                     and his men were taken back to 
                        Cincinnati
                     as prisoners of war. When they were incarcerated in the 
                        Ohio
                     State Penitentiary at 
                        Columbus
                     two days later, they were treated as common criminals.29
            
            Four months after their imprisonment, 
                        Morgan
                     and six of his captains tunneled their way out of the penitentiary and escaped. 
                        Morgan
                     fought again, in 
                        Virginia
                    , but never again so boldly or successfully. As one contemporary put it, "The
                    plain truth is that 
                        Morgan
                     never had a fair chance after he escaped from prison."30
                    He was given only the meanest troops to command, and his requests and proposals fell upon deaf ears
                    in 
                        Richmond
                    . There were many in authority there, too, as in the North, who thought him a failure;
                    and among them, quite understandably, was Braxton Bragg.

            John Hunt Morgan was finally shot dead at point blank by a Union soldier in Greeneville, 
                        Tennessee
                    , on the fourth of September, 1864, and the soldier is said to have cried out after he
                    fired the fatal shot, "I've killed the damned horse thief!"31 By that date, 
                        Morgan
                     was indeed no longer The Thunderbolt, but it mattered little to the Confederacy then
                    what he was. The war was already lost, and the time for such feats as he could once accomplish had
                    passed.

            Although Confederates and their sympathizers made various raids across the Ohio
                    River into southern Indiana during the Civil War, the one led by General John Hunt Morgan
                    exceeded them all in size. Morever, it caused more excitement, resulted in more property damage, and
                    created more legends than did any of the other raids. The objectives and results of 
                        Morgan
                    's raid continue to be interpreted with much diversity of opinion; for
                    instance, see the article by Professor William E. Wilson in this issue of the Indiana
                        Magazine of History.
            
            General Morgan's cavalry division included approximately 2,400 troops when it arrived at the
                    little Ohio River town of 
                  Brandenburg, Kentucky
               , on the
                    morning of July 7, 1863. During the previous day advance scouts had captured two steamers, the
                    "J. T. McCombs" and the "Alice Dean," for use in crossing the
                    river. Meanwhile, the Indiana Legion (Home Guards) and local volunteers called for reinforcements
                    and girded for conflict.
            On July 8 
                        Morgan
                     easily crossed the 
                        Ohio
                     despite the opposition of the Indiana Legion and local volunteers. Proceeding northward
                    against sporadic opposition from the Hoosiers, 
                        Morgan
                    's cavalry spent the night several miles south of Corydon and about ten miles
                    from the 
                        Ohio
                    .
            Next morning, July 9, the Indiana Legion and the local volunteers fought the invaders at the Battle
                    of Corydon, a mile or so south of the former state capital. 
                        Morgan
                    's cavalry were soon victorious and immediately marched into Corydon and looted
                    the town, then headed toward Palmyra and 
                        Salem
                     yet that afternoon. Their route thereafter until 
                        Morgan
                    's capture in 
                        Ohio
                     is indicated in the article by Professor Wilson.
            The account of the Battle of Corydon which follows was written by Simeon K. Wolfe, editor of the
                    Corydon Weekly Democrat, and a participant in the battle. Though his estimate of
                    4,500 men with 
                        Morgan
                     is about twice the actual number, Editor Wolfe frankly admitted quick defeat for the
                    defenders.

            Our town and community have been the scene of intense excitement during the whole of the past week in
                    consequence of the invasion of the State at this point by the notorious guerrillas under the equally
                    notorious John Morgan. A vast amount of damage by horse-stealing and other plundering has been done
                    which it is impossible for us to detail at the present time with any great degree of accuracy, but
                    we think it a safe estimate to put the loss to our citizens at the least at $100,000.

                    accounts.
            THE FIGHT AT BRANDENBURG CROSSING.
            On Tuesday evening (July the 7th) the steamboat T. J. McCombs landed at 
                        Brandenburg
                    , and was immediately captured by 
                        Morgan
                    's advance guard then in possession of the town. The McCombs was taken by the
                    rebels to the middle of the river and there she hoisted the sign of distress. Soon after the Alice
                    Dean coming up was hailed to give relief. For that purpose she approached the McCombs and was thus
                    also captured by the rebels. The news of the capture of these boats was communicated by some Union
                    men of 
                        Brandenburg
                     to Lieut Col: Wm. J. Irvin, of the Indiana Legion, then at Mauckport. A short time
                    after receiving this intelligence the Lady Pike coming up was hailed by Col. Irvin at Mauckport, and
                    turned back to Leavenworth for a six-pound gun und [sic] assistance; a dispatch
                    was also sent to Col. Jordan at Corydon for reinforcements to intercept the rebels crossing. At
                    midnight the Lady Pike returned with the Leavenworth gun and a small company to man it under command
                    of Capt Lyons and Col. Woodbury. Before daylight, on Wednesday morning the gun was in position on
                    the bank opposite 
                        Brandenburg
                    , and as soon as daylight and the disappearance of the fog would render it practicable
                    the gun was directed by Col. Irvin to be fired upon the boilers of the vessels with a view of
                    sinking or disabling them and thus prevent the crossing of the raiders. This command, we are
                    informed by Colonel Irvin, was countermanded by Provost 
                        Marshall
                     [sic] John Timber-lake who claimed precedence in command on the occasion, and an order
                    was given by the latter officer, to shell the rebel cavalry on the bank. Another and different
                    version, however, of this matter, we understand is given by Provost Timber-lake; but we have not
                    been able to see him and obtain it. This shelling was done for a short time with some success,
                    causing the rascals to skedaddle to the rear of the town in fine style but before getting out of the
                    way some thirty of them were killed and wounded. Soon, however, after our gun opened fire, two rebel
                    batteries, one at the Court House at 
                        Brandenburg
                     and the other towards the lower part of  town,
                    began to play with terrific force upon our gun with shells, making it too hot for our boys to hold
                    their position. They abandoned the gun, but afterwards retook it and carried it farther to the rear.
                    The rebel infantry from the 
                        Kentucky
                     shore also kept up a brisk fire across at our forces; and our infantry, consisting of
                    Capts. Farquar's Huffman's and 
                        Hays
                    ' companies of the Legion, in all not exceeding 100 men, returned the fire
                    briskly.
            But the superior artillery force of the enemy soon compelled our small force to abandon the gun
                    again, and then under the cover of his batteries, the enemy began to cross their thieving forces to
                    the Indiana side. Our boys held the ground as long as it was prudent or safe in the face of the
                    forces coming against them, and then retired.
            In this gallant little fight we lost two men killed and three or four wounded.—The killed
                    were, Georia Nance of Laconia and James Currant of Heth township. Capt Farquar was pretty badly
                    injured by his horse running him against a tree. The names of our wounded in this fight we have been
                    unable to obtain.
            SKIRMISHING
                    ON THE ROAD.
            Failing in the effort to prevent the rebels crossing Col. Irvin and provost Timberlake ordered the
                    men to fall back on the road to Corydon and by skirmishing and falling trees to obstruct the passage
                    of the enemy as much as possible until reinforcements with artillery could be had from 
                        New Albany
                    , to which place dispatches were repeatedly sent for help; but for some reason, which we
                    hope the authorities of that post will be able to explain, we never got a man or a
                    gun!
            
            Not deterred however by this neglect, or the overpowering forces in our front, the people went to
                    work and by great exertions a force of Home Guards and citizens, number about 300 effective men,
                    were got together on Wednesday evening and marched out on the Mauckport road to skirmish with the
                    enemy and impede his progress as much as possible. The main body of these under command of Col.
                    Jordan, went as far as Glenn's house four miles south of Corydon. Here the infantry
                    remained until about 10 o'clock at night and returned to the neighborhood of Corydon, while
                    the cavalry and mounted citizens to the number of over one hundred men were sent on the roads
                    running south of Corydon as scouts to watch the operations of the enemy. Several small engagements
                    between the skirmishers occurred on Wednesday evening and Thursday morning; in one of these one
                    rebel was  killed near Glenn's house, and two prisoners
                    were captured. The rebels, shortly afterwards at the same place shot John Glenn, a son of Peter,
                    through both thighs, and about the same time—shot and killed Peter Glenn, an old and well
                    known citizen, and burnt his dwelling and barn. In their progress to Corydon they also burn Peter
                    Lopp's Mills on Buck creek, which is all the burning of property we have heard of them
                    doing in the county. Their principal depredations being in horse stealing and robbing houses and
                    citizens of everything valuable.
            Many "hair-breadth escapes" and gallant charges are reported by these skirmishers,
                    but we have not the space for detailing them at this time.
            THE BATTLE AT CORYDON.
            About 11½ o'clock on Thursday morning our scouts brought the report that the
                    enemy was approaching in strong force up the Mauckport road toward Corydon. Our forces, consisting
                    of about 450 Home Guards and citizens under command of Col. Lewis Jordan of the Legion, assisted by
                    Provost Timberlake (late Col. of the 81st Indiana regiment) and Maj. Jacob Pfrimmer (who up to this
                    time had been engaged with the cavalry in scouting) formed a line of battle on the hill one mile
                    south of town, the extreme right wing resting at the Amsterdam road and the left near the Laconia
                    road, making the Mauckport road, along which the main body of the enemy would approach, about one
                    third of the distance of the entire length of the line from the right wing. The ground on the left
                    of the Mauckport road is a heavy woods and though not hilly is somewhat uneven, which with the logs
                    and underbrush made it difficult for a cavalry charge. This portion of the line was well selected
                    for the purpose of saving our men from the rebel fire, but bad for the purpose of enabling our men
                    to operate effectively against them, the line being at least fifty yards too far north, being that
                    distance from an elevation in the ground which prevented either party from seeing the other before
                    the enemy arrived to that distance from our line. Temporary breastworks composed of logs and fence
                    rails were hastily thrown up by our forces which did good service in impeding the charge of the
                    enemy.
            About an hour later, the enemy made his appearance in small force, probably one company, about three
                    quarters of a mile a little to the left and in front of our line where they were handsomely whipped
                    by the infantry under the command of Captain G. W. Lahue which had been placed there for  picket duty. In that fight we lost one man killed, named Steepleton,
                    and had none wounded. The rebels had several killed and six or seven wounded. Before this skirmish
                    was fairly over, the enemy made their appearance in front of our main line along the Mauckport road
                    in strong force. We (the editor) were with a squad of the Henry Rifles under command of Maj.
                    McGrain, at the extreme right of the line on the Amsterdam road and had a full view of the
                    approaching enemy. They completely filled the road for nearly one mile. As soon as they approached
                    in range the Henry Rifles opened fire and did good work, the enemy being in full view. Soon the fire
                    became general along the entire right wing, which checked the advancing column of the enemy, and
                    compelled them to undertake to flank both our wings at the same time, a performance which the great
                    disparity of forces enabled them easily to do.
            Shortly after the flank movement was began [sic] and before it was executed, the
                    enemy opened upon our forces with three pieces of artillery, making the shells sing the ugly kind of
                    music over our heads. This shelling operation, together with the known fact that our line would be
                    strongly flanked on both wings at the same time made it necessary for the safety of our men, for
                    them to fall back. This was done, not with the best of order it is true, for our forces were mostly
                    undrilled, but with excellent speed. From this time the fight was converted into a series of
                    skirmishes in which each man seemed to fight upon his own hook mostly after the manner of
                    bushwhackers.
            In the meantime the enemy had completely flanked the town, having, before a gun was fired, taken
                    possession of the plank road one mile east of town, where our men in their retreat were intercepted.
                    Upon the right wing a large flanking force was sent against our lines and the fighting was very
                    sharp for the space of 20 minutes in that quarter; twelve Henry Rifles and a squad of 30 or 40, some
                    100 yards to their left, armed with the ordinary rifle musket holding a heavy body of flankers in
                    check for ten or fifteen minutes and compelling them to dismount.
            Being completely overpowered by numbers our forces gradually fell back to Corydon and the cavalry and
                    mounted infantry generally made their escape. After the field was taken by the enemy they moved
                    forward, and planted a battery on the hill south of the tom, and threw two shells into the town,
                    both of them striking near the center of main  street, one
                    exploded but did no damage. Seeing the contest was hopeless and that a continuance of the fight
                    would only result in unnecessary loss of life and the destruction of the town, Col. Jordan wisely
                    hoisted the white flag and surrendered.
            The enemy immediately marched in and took military possession of the town; and then the work of
                    pillage soon began. Everything the rebels wanted in the eating and wearing line and horses and
                    buggies they took. The two stores of Douglass, Denbo & Co., and S. J. Wright and the two
                    Steam Mills were the heaviest losers. The two stores were robbed of about $300 each and a
                    contribution of $700 each in cash was levied upon the two mills in town and a like sum
                    upon Mauck'smill near town. This large sum Messrs. Leffler & Applegate, Wright
                    & 
                        Brown
                     and John J. Mauck were compelled to pay to save their Mills from the flames. Many other
                    citizens lost in horses and other property from 100 to $600, Mr. Hisey was robbed of
                    $690 in cash. But we have not space enough to enumerate the pecuniary losses few or none
                    escaped entirely.
            LOSSES.
            The Union losses, beside property, are as follows:
            KILLED:
            Wm. Heth; Nathan McKinzie and Harry Steepleton —3.
            WOUNDED:
            Jacob Ferree and Caleb Thomas —2.
            Our loss in prisoners was about 300 all of whom were paroled.
            The rebels admitted their loss to be 8 killed and 33 wounded.
            FORCES ENGAGED.
            The number of forces engaged was 4500 commanded by Gen. 
                        Morgan
                     with 7 pieces of artillery. The Union forces, consisting of raw malitia [sic] and citizens, did not exceed 450. With these raw troops - one yank
                    to ten rebs — 
                        Morgan
                    's progress was impeded about five hours, which we hope will result in his
                    capture.
            Under all the circumstances we think our boys did exceedingly well. It was not expected at the start
                    that so small a force could whip 
                        Morgan
                    , but it was expected we could punish him some and impede his progress so that somebody
                         else more nearly equal his strength could catch him and do
                    him justice. That this will soon be done we have every reason to hope.
            HIS LEAVING THE COUNTY.
            About 5 o'clock, P. M., after robbing the town to his heart's contents, the King of
                    American Freebooters left, moving north on the 
                        Salem
                     road, stealing, as a matter of course, as he went. In Blue River
                    township the rebels shot two young men named McKinstry and at Bradford they shot a German whose name
                    we did not learn.
            
               
                        Morgan
                    's Whereabouts.
            It isn't safe to say one hour where 
                        Morgan
                     will be the next. Our latest intelligence placed him in the neighborhood of Vernon in 
                        Jennings
                     Co., on Saturday where he had a fight with Lew. Wallace. A small squad of the raiders
                    were whipped and scattered at Perkin in 
                        Clark County
                    , a portion of their scattered men were seen in the north part of this county on Sunday.
            After leaving this county 
                        Morgan
                     went to 
                        Salem
                     and captured the town without any resistance. After burning the depot and committing
                    all the depredation he wanted, he left, going east.
            Shot and Mortally Wounded.
            At 
                        Salem
                    , Wm. Vance, a son of the late Arthur Vance of this place, was shot by the rebles and
                    mortally wounded, but under what circumstances we have not been able to learn.
            6 Rebs and 19 Horses Captured.
            Six of 
                        Morgan
                    's men and nineteen horses were captured by the citizens near Fairdale, on
                    Monday morning, and brought to this place. They are a portion of those that crossed at Twelve Mile
                    Island. They were cut off from their main force in a skirmish at 
                        Pekin
                     on Saturday evening last. The 13 who had the other horses have not at this time (Monday
                    evening) been captured, but will be, unless they dodge equal to 
                        Morgan
                     himself. The horses are mostly very fine ones. The Rebs came to a house unarmed, gave
                    themselves up and told where the horses were hitched in the woods.
            Hurrah for Old 
                        Harrison
                    !
            
               
                        Morgan
                    , at last accounts, was at 
                  Aurora,
                            Dearborn county
               , having left Vernon. The Home
                    Guards and citizens,  in no other county but Old 
                        Harrison
                    . stood and gave him a fight. We faught [sic] him twice.
            Hurrah, for Old 
                        Harrison
                    ; her sons are as true as steel doubly refined.
            In the hurry and confusion with which we have been surrounded for the past few days we have not, in
                    our account of the rebel invasion and the battle, been able to give a statement of the different
                    companies of the Legion engaged. Nor are we able to state fully the assistance we received from
                    other counties. We saw some gallant boys from 
                        Georgetown
                     and Edwardsville. The "two hundred from 
                        New Albany
                    ," mentioned by the 
                        Louisville
                     Democrat, we have not heard of.
            We have every reason to believe and hope that 
                        Morgan
                     cannot escape from the State. Ample preparations are on foot to capture him.
            Another contemporary document which describes the Battle of Corydon is the following letter written
                    by Attia 
                        Porter
                    , a young Corydon girl, to her cousin Private John C. Andrews, Forty-third Indiana
                    Infantry Regiment, Company C, who at the time was with the Union army in 
                  Helena, Arkansas
               . This letter is the property of the family of James P. Andrews of 
                        Terre Haute
                    , and is here reproduced with the permission of the Andrews family.
            
                    
                  
                     
                        
                                    
                              Corydon Ind.,
                           
                                    July 30/63
                                
                        Dear Cousin
                        I was just studying the other day whose time it was to write mine or yours and could
                                    not come to any satisfactory conclusion, when your letter arrived and as a matter of
                                    course I was the debtor and I have since found out I owe you two letters instead of
                                    one. I received yours with the miniature three weeks ago, but never could manage to
                                    sit down and write. We have had rather exciting times in Indiana for the last few
                                    weeks, and have had a few of the miseries of the south pictured to us though in a
                                    small degree. On the doubly memorable ninth of July a visit was paid to the citizens
                                    of Corydon and vicinity by 
                                        Morgan
                                     and his herd of horse thieves. We heard Tuesday night that they had
                                    crossed the river and had disgraced the soil of Indiana with their most unhallowed
                                         feet. Our home guards skirmished with the
                                    rebs from the river to [Corydon] and on one of the hills overlooking the town had a
                                    grand battle. The battle raged violently for thirty minutes, just
                                    think of it! and on account of the large number of the rebs we were forced to retire
                                    which our men did in good earnest every one seemed determined to get out of town
                                    first but which succeeded remains undecided to this day. After the general
                                    skedaddle, Col Jordan wisely put up the white flag—and we were prisoners
                                    to a horde of thieves and murderers. I don't want you to think I am making
                                    fun of our brave home guards for I am not in the least. But now, that all the danger
                                    is over, it is real funny to think how our men did run. Gen. Carrington awarded
                                    great praise to us and we all think that is something. What could 350 undrilled home
                                    guards and citizens do against 4,000 well drilled and disciplined soldiers (?) We
                                    did not even know Hobson was following him. We sent to 
                                        New Albany
                                     time and again for help and not one man or gun did they send us. Though
                                    we have found out since that it was the fault of Gen. Boyle and not the people of 
                                        New Albany
                                    . It made 
                                        Morgan
                                     so mad to think a few home guards dared to fight his men. I am glad
                                    they done it just to spite him. However they captured most of the guards and
                                    parolled them and killed three of our men. Father was out fighting with his Henry
                                    rifle but they did not get him or his gun. One of Morgans spies was in town three or
                                    four weeks visiting his relatives and some of his men helped our men to build the
                                    entrenchments. I guess none of the rebels down south are that accommodating are
                                    they? One of our brave boys run three miles from the rebels, and really run himself
                                    to death. He stopped at a house and fainted and never came to. Dident he deserve a
                                    promotion? I think that was the awfullest day I ever passed in my life. The rebels
                                    reported around that they shot father because he would not surrender, but it was all
                                    a story. The rebs were pretty hard on the copperheads but they did not take a thing
                                    from us. The[y] kidnapped our little negro and kept him three weeks but he got away
                                    from them and is now at home safe. We killed six or eight of theirs and wounded
                                    twenty five or thirty. I expect you are tired of hearing about 
                                        Morgan
                                     so I will stop. I forgot my letter till so late this morning, and I
                                    have not got time to write much more or I will be too late for the stage so Goodby.

            The Civil War Journal of Stephen Keyes Fletcher
            
                    Contributed by Maxwell Keyes Fletcher, III Edited by Perry McCandless
                    *
                
            Stephen Keyes Fletcher (May 30, 1840-July 6, 1897) was one of Calvin and Sarah (Hill)
                    Fletcher's eleven children. Calvin Fletcher was one of the earliest settlers of 
                        Indianapolis
                     and his family was one of the most prominent and influential in the capital city.
            Stephen Keyes Fletcher enlisted in the Thirty-third Regiment, Indiana Volunteer Infantry on October
                    14, 1861, and he was immediately detailed as Ordnance Sergeant. In July of 1863 he was discharged to
                    accept a commission as First Lieutenant and Adjutant in the One Hundred Fifteenth Indiana Infantry
                    Regiment, and he joined that organization on August 14, 1863. He was mustered out on February 24,
                    1864. Although the journal was not begun until March of 1862, it narrates events from the
                    author's enlistment in October, 1861, until October, 1862.1
            
            The Thirty-third Regiment, under the command of Colonel John Coburn, was sent to
                            
                  Louisville, Kentucky
               , then to Camp Dick Robinson, and on to 
                        Lexington
                    , where they reported to General George H. Thomas, Army of the 
                        Ohio
                    , as part of the First Brigade, Brigadier General Albin Schoepf commanding. From 
                        Lexington
                     they were sent to Crab Orchard and to Camp Wildcat to reinforce Colonel Theophilus T.
                    Garrard's Seventh 
                        Kentucky
                     Regiment. On October 21 they engaged the enemy at Wildcat, defeating General Felix K.
                    Zollicoffer's forces. After a march to 
                        London
                    , then back to Crab Orchard, they spent the period January, 1862, to April, 1862, in 
                        Lexington
                    . After receiving orders to join General George H. Morgan's forces at
                    Cumberland Ford, they set out on the march and engaged in several skirmishes on the way. On June 18 
                        Cumberland Gap
                     was taken. While here the Thirty-third participated in marches and skirmishes into East 
                        Tennessee
                    . On September 18 the Gap was evacuated and the Thirty-third marched as escort to an
                    ammunition convoy to

                        Ohio
                    . At this point Sergeant Fletcher's Journal ends. The Thirty-third moved later
                    with General William S. Rosecrans' army into 
                        Tennessee
                     and also participated in the 
                        Atlanta
                     Campaign.2
            
            The Civil War journal of Sergeant Stephen Keyes Fletcher reveals in vivid prose the hopes and
                    disappointments, the pleasures and hardships, the difficult monotonous work, and the long delays and
                    dry-runs of a soldier's life. A keen observer of both the physical characteristics of the
                    area in which he served and of the life and attitudes of his fellow soldiers, Fletcher records his
                    impressions in clear and at times dramatic style. During the period of the journal, the major
                    military operations of Fletcher's regiment were directed toward the capture of 
                        Cumberland Gap
                    . The Union forces occupied the Gap after its evacuation by the Confederate forces only
                    to find themselves, in turn, blockaded, and as Fletcher wrote: "For 9 months we marched
                    & countermarched through rain & snow mud & water just to take the Gap,
                    & just 3 months ago … we took it. … We have lived on short rations
                    every [sic] since. … But for four weeks now we have been blockaded
                    … & now just three months after we leave it as we took it, with a hungry gut
                    & a lean belly" (see pp. 182-183).
            Following the Civil War, Stephen Keyes Fletcher became a well-known and highly respected business man
                    in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . In addition to his business activities he operated a model dairy farm about fifteen
                    miles from 
                        Indianapolis
                    . His first wife was Miss Mary Malott, who died in 1876, and his second wife was Miss
                    Laura Maxwell. John H. B. Nowland, who knew him well, described him as "rather below medium
                    height," with "light hair and complexion," and as "genial and
                    pleasant in manner."3

                    original spelling and punctuation have been followed as closely as possible, although it has been

                        To commence this Journal & note down the incidents of 5 months in the service
                                    of the 
                                        United States
                                    , I hardly know how.
                        That a civil war broke out between the North & the south, 6 when that was
                                    commenced & why it commenced is & ever will be known. All know that
                                    after the Confederates fired on Ft Sumpter, that there was a general uprising
                                    throughout the North & all cryed, to arms the Union must & shall be
                                    preserved.
                        It was my desire to join the armie immediately on the first call. But circumstances
                                    did not permit of my doing so until the middle of October (1861) Ingram4 & myself worked together on the farm through the
                                    summer, both desirous of going to war as soon as the summer work was done. But when
                                    in the middle of August we learned of Drs. being taken prisoner,5 the war fever raged high in my breast. But about this time I had my right
                                    shoulder fractured by jumping a horse over a pair of bars. It was nearly two months
                                    before I could use it at all. When my shoulder got about well I told Ingram I had
                                    determined to go to war. He said that he was going, & that I must stay
                                    & take charge of the farm, as one of us had to stay. So we threw up a cent
                                    to determine which should go. I got it 5 times out of 7. I began to get up a company
                                    with Adams & 
                                        Brown
                                    . I was to furnish 25 men. I had 10 of my men in 2 or 3 days. But the
                                    other fellows

                                 5 Dr. William B. Fletcher, another brother, served
                                            with the Sixth Indiana Infantry Regiment and did secret service work. He was
                                            captured at Big Spring, 
                                                Virginia
                                            , in the summer of 1861. In October of the same year he was
                                            tried by court martial and ordered to execution. After General Robert E. Lee
                                            issued a reprieve pending further investigation, Dr. Fletcher was sent to a 
                                                Richmond
                                             prison. Through an error he was paroled in March, 1862, and
                                            returned home to Indianaolis. Berry R. Sulgrove, History of

                                     were working rather too slow for me, I informed
                                    them that it was my intention to go to war & not to be fooling around 
                                        Indianapolis
                                     fishing for an office for nothing. As Maj Manker6
                                    of the 33 Ind. was then in the city, and just going to start for his Regt. then at
                                    Camp Dick Robinson, K. Y. I concluded to enlist & go with him as high private. So on the evening of the 10th of October 1861, we
                                    left Indps for the seat of war in K. Y. We arrived after a very pleasant trip at
                                    Camp Dick on Sunday afternoon. We found the Regt had left that morning for Crab
                                    Orchard 18 miles farther south. We changed horses & put ahead & over
                                    took the Regt. camped near Crab Orchard, at 10 that night. On Monday the Regt went
                                    into camp 1½ miles S. E. of Crab Orchard, called Camp Coburn.
                        I went into camp Monday afternoon, 14th of Oct and this was my [first?] night in camp
                                    life. The weather was most delightful. Indian summer was just commencing, &
                                    the excitement of being brought into this new life so suddenly, filled me with the
                                    most ardent love for the camp & the life of a soldier. On Wednesday it began
                                    raining very hard. About noon I saw a buggy drive up the road, & stop at the
                                    camp, in mud up to the axles, & who should I see but Will Holliday'
                                    step out & come into camp. I had bid him goodbye but the Friday before in 
                                        Indianapolis
                                    , little thinking I would ever see him in the armie. My impressions were
                                    that he would not, or could not stand the life. As he had long been a clerk in a dry
                                    goods store. But am happy to say after nearly 6 months camp life, he has stood it as
                                    well & better than most in the Regt.
                        On Wednesday 16th Col Coburn8 appointed me Ordnance Sergeant,
                                    & on Thursday started me to 
                                        Louisville
                                     for ammunition. I went to Camp Dick horse back. There met Gen
                                        Sherman.9 After a five hours waiting, I got to see his
                                    honor. He was very crabid & nervice But I had just brass enough

                                     in my face to talk to him, like I would to any
                                    other man. He was a tall, slim, ugly, plain man, a perfect bundle of nerves. I got
                                    what I wanted here, & started back the next morning with a wagon &
                                    40 boxes of pills When I arrived at camp late in the evening I
                                    heard that marching orders had come for us to push on to Wild Cat 22 miles farther
                                    down. That Gerred10 at that place was expecting an attack from
                                        Zollicoffers11 whole force. All was excitement about moving.
                                    The details although they might be interesting, would take up time & room
                                    that would hardly pay, as so many things have happened of the same kind since we
                                    have been out. The Regt started about 11 o clock A. M Saturday, 19th & after
                                    a hard drive over some of the worst roads, hills & rocks that I ever saw, we
                                    arrived at Mt Vernon just at dark, 10 miles from Camp. My wagon of ammunition
                                    stalled, stuck several times during the day, so that we had to doubleteam teams,
                                    & a good deal of swareing & hollooing was done to pull out. At Mt
                                    Vernon I divided the load into two wagons, so that we went through without more
                                    trouble. Wilkins,12 Test,13 Maj Manker
                                    & myself with several others slept on the parlor floor in the hotel. About 3
                                    oclock in the morning, Col. Coburn came in, & told us he had just received a
                                    dispatch from Gerred to "Push on for Gods sake, that the enemy were close
                                    on them." All was astir now, & & the Regt was ready to
                                    start at sun up, & most splendidly did he show forth that beautiful sabbath
                                    morning as our boys wound around the foot of the large hill near this town. Their
                                    bayonets all sparkling in the sun. It was a stirring sight to me at least. We
                                    trudged on over the hills & through the mud at a forced march. About noon I
                                    came up to Rock Castle river. Here was quite an exciting scene.
                                    The Regt. had most all crossed, a boat load had just started across as I arrived on
                                    the bank. The large elm trees with their wide spreading branches made almost a
                                    perfect arch over the river. Col Coburn stood at the landing on his horse, cheering
                                    the boys on. The crossing of the boys & the anticipation of a fight 3 miles
                                    ahead, filled me with an

                                     exciting feeling, & I took off my cap
                                    & gave one loud yell. After we all got over, the Regt was drawn up in line
                                    in a field, & ammunition distributed guns inspected & C. We then
                                    pushed on anxious for the fray. From the river to Wild Cat, 3 miles, we met wagon
                                    load after wagon load of sick soldiers from Gerrards Regt. They all reported the
                                    pickets fighting ahead. The home guard Cavelry passed us going full tilt. Every one
                                    yelled out as they passed, give em hell boys, give em
                                        hell. They responded, yes we'll give em hell.
                                    But before we got to Wild Cat we met them all coming back on a slow trot saying that
                                    the pickets had quit fighting, & they were not needed. They were realy the bigest set of cowards I ever saw.
                        We got to Gerrards camp about 3 P.M. Sunday 20th, passed on & camped about a
                                    mile in advance on a ridge about the only place level enough to set our tents, just
                                    behind the rifle pits. The 14th

                                     had got in from the 
                                        Richmond
                                     road just before we. The 17th 
                                        Ohio
                                     just after we got in. All was quiet during the afternoon &
                                    night. About 7 A.M. Monday 21 while I was eating breakfast with Col.14 Lt. Col15 & Maj Manker, Gen Sheoppf16 rode up & Staff, told Col Coburn to get
                                        his men in line immediately, that the enemy were right on us. All was now
                                    astir & excitement. The long roll beat & in less than 10 minutes the
                                    Regt was formed & all ready for the word. 4 of our companies were sent over
                                    west to build breast works & guard a pass where we expected the enemy to try
                                    to flank us. The other 4 companies (there being two left at Crab Orchard) went East
                                    on the hill where the fight took place. I went with this party. Went up double
                                    quick, 3/4, of a mile. Col Coburn was in command of this wing
                                    & Lt Col. & Major were in command of the other. The men were
                                    immediately deployed around the hill & down through the gullies. But before
                                    this was completed we were fired upon. A scattering fire now took place which lasted
                                    about an hour & a half. About 10 minutes after the firing commenced one of
                                    our men in Co. D, by the name of McFerrin,17 was shot

                                                General of the State of Indiana, V, 92, does not list him as either
                                            killed or wounded.
                           
                                     in the left chest. I was standing about 20 feet
                                    from him, talking to Capt McRea,18 his Capt. He walked up the
                                    hill to where we were & said, "Capt I'm shot.
                                        I'm a dead man" He carried his gun up with him. H[e] died
                                    in about 5 minutes. After the firing ceased, I went to camp for ammunition. While
                                    there the firing commenced again very brisk, & the rebels began firing their
                                    canon. They had fired but 2 or 3 shots when Standards 
                                        Ohio
                                     battery19 came up through our camp pitched some of
                                    the tents out of the way, got in position & fired 3 shots before we could
                                    say Jack Robinson. The shells whistled through the air, over the
                                    hills, & fell bursting away in the gullie below where their canon was. They
                                    threw nothing but round shot, 3 missing our camp about 3/4 of a mile. 2 whistled
                                    through the pine trees just at the edge of the camp. The last one struck about 6
                                    feet below our canon in the bank. As soon as they found out that we had canon, they
                                    ceased firing. But renewed the attack upon the hill about 3 in the afternoon. They
                                    charged up the hill to within 30 steps of our men with their hats on their bayonets,
                                    crying out, we are Union, we are Union. But our boys poured volies of minie balls
                                    into them for ½ an hour without ceasing. One of our men were killed in
                                    the afternoon, & about 20 were wounded in the two last fights. But only two
                                    were killed dead. 2 died in about 12 days from their wounds. We took 3 Secesh that
                                    were wounded, two of them died, the other we kept in our Hospital until we got back
                                    to 
                                        Lexington
                                    , when I went with Capt Burton20 & took him
                                    to

                        In the evening two canons were taken on the hill. The last attack of the enemy was
                                    about 12 at night, when the canon on the hill fired twice before day light their
                                    canons & wagons were heard rolling off in the distance. They were making a
                                    rapid retreat. We might have captured the whole of them, but our Gen21 would not allow an advance. The Rebles were under the command of Gen
                                    Zollicoffer, & numbered about 7000, including Cavelry & Artilery.
                                    Tuesday noon I went down to their camp & came up the hill the same

                                     way that they did. On one side of the hill I
                                    counted eleven dead Secesh. They were all large mountaineers, dressed in butternut
                                    jeans. We found & buried all together about 50. We had authenticated
                                    information of 18 wagon loads of dead & wounded being taken off. On
                                    Wednesday the 14th & 17 
                                        Ohio
                                     marched down the road & camped 3 miles North of 
                                        London
                                     called Camp Conel. Thursday the 24 our Regt with the 38

                                     followed. As our ammunition could not be hauled in the first train I
                                    was left back with 12 guards. The 1st & 2nd Tenn. Regts, were also back for
                                    a day or two. Then we were left alone. We were here 5 days, & a most
                                    lonesome time we had too. The next Tuesday while on our way down through the rockey
                                    gullies, one of the wagon tongues broke short off. Old Sailors
                           22 the teamster got the wagon out of the way so that the others
                                    could pass & went to work to make a new one. I borrowed an old dull meat axe at a little log cabin & while he cut a saplin I rode one of the horses 3/4 of a mile & got a 3/4 auger.
                                    He was pretty tight & couldnt do much, so I had to put my gamion to work. With these two simple tools in an hour & a half we
                                    had a tonge in & started, and I will state here, that the
                                    tongue is in servise yet, has lasted through every thing. (This is April 26th/62)
                        Went to 
                                        London
                                     from Camp Conel. Wednesday the 30th. Here our Regt took the advance,
                                    were camped on a ridge just below a high hill, which we built strong breast works
                                    all round. Johny Wilkins & myself went & got the Courthouse for a
                                    magazine & commissary & soon had things piled in. We laid here until
                                    the 13 Nov. Raining most of the time. We had just sent our wagons and men to
                                    commence winter quarters & I had gone out 6 miles to a mill to engage lumber
                                    for bunks, roofs &C. I engaged 12,000 feet of pine lumber, but before I got
                                    back to camp, orders had come for us to march back to Crab Orchard immediately. All
                                    was now excitement. Not a Regt had enough wagons to move everything immediately, so
                                    they had to press teams in of the farmers. Col started me out as
                                    soon as I got in after teams. There were men on every road. But the 33 got more than
                                    any other. Our Regt got started about 10 P.M. The moon was shining bright The boys
                                    were all in fine spirits. But were mad to think they could not go to the gap.23

                        I was left back with the ammunition, & Will Holliday with the commissary
                                    stores that could not be taken then. 50 guards were left back with Adjt Durham24 in command. We got everything off except the Ordnance by
                                    Saturday morning this we placed under the charge of the 1st Tenn Regt. I transferred
                                    to them 44 boxes of round shot. One of their Capts, receited for it, he could not
                                    write his own name. Had to make his cross.
                        
                        4 of our sickest boys were left back, one died while I was there, two afterwards,
                                    only one got well.
                        Durham & I started Saturday evening on horseback. I had an old clay bank that
                                    would not work to the wagons, an old saddle tree with no stirrups or girth. With my
                                    blanket over it. I had been riding this for 3 days & nights & was
                                    getting pretty tired. Holliday and Lt. Johnson25 started on foot
                                    Nov. 16th We staid all night at the river at Grissems,26 where
                                    our sick & wounded boys were. Here I took sick by sleeping in a feather bed.
                                    This night the ground froze for the first time. The trees were white with frost next
                                    morning. We took an early start & found our Regt about dark, camped in the
                                    woods about 1½ miles east of Crab Orchard. Found they had been without
                                    tents for 3 nights & it had been raining all the time. The march from 
                                        London
                                     was very severe. About 100 started in wagons that had the measels, the
                                    raid threw them into a relapse, & they took the typhoid fever, a great many
                                    were left on the road & some died before they ever got up with the Regt.
                        Our Regt was reported unfit for duty & took up quarters in camp at the
                                    springs in Crab Orchard. The men took sick fast. Between the 1st & 10th of
                                    Dec. we had about 600 men in the Hospital, or in every house in the town. For two
                                    weeks they died from two to 5 a day. About 55 died while we were here, nearly two
                                    months. Betty Bates came down from Indps & nurced in the Hospital for about
                                    6 weeks. Miss Kate Merrill also came down & staid two weeks, & done
                                    much good. Mrs Lieut Col Henderson also worked hard day after day
                                    with Betty, & they saved many a poor
                                        soldier.27

                                     & an expedition of 100 men under Maj Manker started down. I
                                    went along in command of the train of 100 wagons. When we got with in 12 miles of

                                     we were turned back by the Gen. This made the boys sware, as they had
                                    been anticipating a finger in the pie.
                        Christmas I received a box of good things from home. Johney Wilkins
                                    had been home & brought a mess chest back with white dishes, also a lot of
                                    thing for Will Holliday. We prepared for a big dinner on Christmas. We had fruit
                                    & preserves & jellies & turkey stuffed with oysters, hot
                                    biscuit & butter & every thing that we could have had had we been at
                                    home. Also Mince pies.
                        
                        We went into it heavy, every thing was from Ind except the Turkey & biscuit.
                        On the 10th of Jan 1862, tents were struck & the Regt took up march for 
                                        Lexington
                                    , although they did not know where they were going at the time. I was
                                    left back as usual with the ordnance, Fullenwider with the commissary stores. We
                                    were back just a week when the wagons returned & we loaded every thing
                                    & started. Fullenwider & myself walked it. We found our Regt camped
                                    3 miles North of 
                                        Lexington

                                     pike in a bluegrass pasture of 160 acres, about 15 acres of woods. The
                                    most beautiful camp & drill ground I ever saw. The grass was perfectly
                                    matted on the ground, making it splendid for camping until the rains set in. With
                                    continual rains & continual tramping it became very muddy. I used a Hospital
                                    tent for a magazine.
                        Ingram wrote me that Dr would be released about the 1st of Feb. I thought this would
                                    be my only chance to get home & I thought I could make it. So I told the Col
                                    that I must get off if it was to be at home but 3 days. We had two
                                    Secesh prisoners, one taken at Wild Cat, that had to go to 
                                        Louisville
                                    , so I got off with these as an excuse. From here I went home. Found all
                                    well. It was Thursday the 30th when I started, & Friday 31st early in the
                                    morning when I got home. Dr arrived Sunday morning. I remained until Thursday
                                    morning. Had a splendid time while I staid, but it was so short. Rural Roost was

                                    night with my friend, Will Fletcher. I arrived in 
                                        Lexington
                                     Friday the 7th Feb. Went to camp Saturday morning, found the camp moved
                                    to a dry spot. I went immediately to issuing out the Enfield
                                    rifles to Cos A & B. This was a considerable job.
                        While we remained in Camp Henderson I got acquainted with a good
                                    many of the farmers around through the country. Among the principal ones, were Mr
                                    Montague & family, The Hontan's, Mr Thompson, & Mr
                                    & Mrs Ross. Also a great many others, in & out of 
                                        Lexington
                                    , including a great many very interesting young ladies.
                        April 28th 1862. Camp near Cumberland ford.
                        April 30th Cumberland ford.
                        About the 1st of April we received marching orders. All were anxious to leave. We had
                                    lain still so long that camp life had become perfectly monotonous,
                                    & the Regt was getting perfectly demoralized. Before we
                                    left the Ladies around the country gave us a big dinner. They had
                                    3 long tables made & they were covered with every thing
                                    that was good. All kinds of meats, bread & butter, cakes, pies, jellies,
                                    mince, & C & C & C. Every thing was in
                                    abundance. Enough for another Regt. We had 3 very large cakes
                                    presented to us. One by Mrs. Scott, of 
                                        Lexington
                                    . It had a tent on it with two flags crossed in front. Stamped in the
                                    frosting in pink letters was "Honored be the brave." The edging
                                    & sides of the cake was beautiful. Another had the American Egle &
                                    shield stars & stripes, in the appriate colors, two canons crossed in front
                                    in yellow. Stamped on writing Presented to the 33rd Regt Ind. Vol. by Mr

                                    , Ky. It had been raining all day but cleared up about noon. This was
                                    taken advantage of, & the dinner dispatched in a hurry. But before they were
                                    entirely through the rain came down in torrents & continued all the
                                    afternoon. There were about 30 carriages & the Ladies made
                                    them selves as comfortable as possiable in them. Also some of the Soldiers found
                                    very comfortable quarters, & pleasant company in them. As it had been
                                    raining nearly constantly, for two months, the boys had got used
                                    to it, & ate away as unconcerned as though it was bright sunshine.

                                     I was presented with a splendid dish of salid by Mrs Ross, which lasted our mess (at the commissary)
                                    3 meals.
                        We were presented by the ladies of 
                                        Lexington
                                     a most beautiful, Regt flag. It is most exquisitly
                                    wrought. The American Eagle, shield stars & stripes all in appropriate
                                    colors. The eagle in heavy nedle work with gold silk
                                        thread. It cost 106$. Mrs Fishback daughter of old Governor
                                        Shelby,30 1st Governor of Ky. was the principal getter up of
                                    the flag. She was the most patriotic woman I found in or about 
                                        Lexington
                                    . She was a particular friend of mine. She realy
                                    seemed more like a mother than a friend or acquaintance. At the
                                    presentation Col Coburn made a short but most able speech. It pleased all.

                                     on the 10th. I did not get off until the next day, when I went down to
                                    Nicholasville, where I found them camped for their 2nd night. I remained at Lex.
                                    with Col. C. marking, & transfering guns, accoutrements &C. to ship

                                    , also shipping out our own ammunition. This was friday. In the evening
                                    when I got through work, I got a buggy & took Miss Mollie
                                        Vanpelt, a youn[g] lady friend & went out on the Versales

                                        Lexington
                                     a most pleasant one. Before we left in the morning we had plenty of
                                    native wine & cake, & Miss Kate sent a bottle of wine to Lieut
                                        Whitson,32 which, He, Lieut Hill33
                                    & myself had a jolly time over in Nicholasville. Mr. Foley told me he had a
                                    son in Mondays Cavelry34 which was near the ford. He had been
                                    sick for some time, & was staying about 3 miles at a house south of
                                        Bar-boursville.35 He wanted me to call & see him if
                                    I had an opportunity.
                        I went into camp at Nicholasville Saturday the 12th & to my position as

                                            , Company E, Thirty-third Regiment.
                           
                                     While on the pike we marched by sections. I had
                                    charge of the 1st section. Tuesday we passed through Crab Orchard, & camped
                                    at Old Camp Coburn. I went back to town & spent the
                                    evening with some of my old friends. Every thing looked as natural as though we had
                                    been away but a week. Here one of Capt Days37 boys took sick
                                    & had a sinking chill during the night. No one knew it until he was noticed
                                    in the morning after all were up, he still laid in bed. Capt Day started with him in
                                    an ambulance to town. But he died before they got half way. Wednesday afternoon
                                    about 3 oclock we camped about a mile from 
                                        Mt. Vernon
                                    . Found the roads thus far very good. The 
                                        Wisconsin
                                     battery that was with us (6-10 lbrs.) camped on a hill just above us.
                                    In the evening they practised shooting at a big apple tree that was full of blossoms
                                    on a hill about a mile & a quarter [s]traight over the town, which is in a
                                    valey. The shells whistled over & nearly scared the people out of their boots.
                        
                        Thursday morning we took an early start & passed down throug[h] Mt Vernon,
                                    & wound around up the hill, opposite, just as we did on just such a morning,
                                    6 months before lacking 3 days.
                        Here we took the ridge road, right on the tops of the hills (or
                                    young mountains) Most of the time we had to go in single file, & I could
                                    look a head, for ½ a mile & see the Regt winding a long up, up the hills over the peaks & along the rocky cliffs.
                                    The boys supposed that some one had directed the Col this way for a nearer cut. They ripped & swore, & said they would give
                                    anything to know the man that directed the Col this road, they would shoot him with
                                    out mercy.
                        When we got to the river & found the wagons had not yet got up, &
                                    that we had saved a great deal by coming the way we did, that the
                                    main road was a foot or two in mud, they all cooled down. We crossed the river
                                    & camped just where we had formed to give out ammunition just before the
                                    battle at Wild Cat. Here we learned that our wagon that we had hired to haul our
                                    knapsacks had broken down & would not be up. Lieut Whitson started back to
                                    get another wagon & bring them through, if he could. Our boys with several
                                    other companies in the same fix had to sleep without blankets. This

                                     was my first night on guard. It was a beautiful
                                    moonlight night, & the whip poor will sang all night a
                                    cross the river in the hills. They were answering each other all through the woods.
                                    The 14th Ky. & artilery camped opposite on the other side of the river.
                        Friday morning we moved on up towards Wild Cat. The train & artilery had got
                                    in before us. Found the roads very bad, & every wagon making them worse. We
                                    were stopped continualy, on account of some wagon that was stuck or some canon that
                                    had got too heavy for its 6 horses. A great many little things happened while we
                                    were on the march, & especialy while we were at a rest, on the road, that I
                                    thought I would remember, that would be realy interesting. Here at this place while
                                    the boys were setting along on each side of the road waiting for a wagon to get out
                                    of a mud hole some of the boys got after a lizzard, there were about a dozen after
                                    it, & persued it until they had killed it with as much interest &
                                    excitement as though they were after a rebble. Then they got to snapping stones across at each other, calling them shells. They would put
                                    a little stone on the hammer of their gun, point & snap it. It would through
                                    the stone pretty straight. As we came up to our old camp at Wild Cat, instead of
                                    hearing the roar of canon, the thunder was pouring forth roaring voleys, &
                                    the rain commenced pouring down in torrents. We ran into the old house used last
                                    fall as our magazine. But we had been here but a few moments when the Cap.38 came up & yelled out "roll out
                                        Co E." So we pitched out, & were soaking wet in a very
                                    short time. But what is a soldier fit for, if he cant stand rain.
                                        Hoosier hill looked perfectly natural, the breast works
                                    were still standing. Nearly 6 months ago I had bid farewell to this place hoping
                                    never to see it again. But it seems to be the doom of the 33rd to
                                    soldier it in this God forsaken country.
                        
                        We camped on Zollie's39 last camp ground, on the bank of
                                    little rock castle. We had come but 5 miles, but were very tired from marching
                                    through the mud & raine. We cut hemlock branches for beds. Our wagon had not
                                    got up yet, & we slept under the fly of our tent, rather thin as the night
                                    was very chilly. The Lieut40 came up said he had got another
                                    wagon & 
                              
                                 38 Captain Hendricks.
                              
                                 39 General Zollicoffer.
                              
                                 40 Probably Lieutenant Whitson of Company E.
                           
                                     brought all the knapsacks up as far as the
                                    river, except 16, which were 5 miles back from the river, making 10 miles from camp.
                                    I said, as the fellow did on the cars when the old man asked him if he knew he was
                                    on the road to hell. He said just my darned
                                    luck, always on the wrong train. I said it was just my luck to have my knapsack
                                    left back 10 miles, & so I found it. 36 of us started back. We found the
                                    road for 3 miles lined with the train of wagons, stuck in the mud, mules into their
                                    bellies, teamsters yelling & hallooing. All except 18 staid with our wagon
                                    to help it on to camp. I cut off one of my blankets & sold it for 50 cts,
                                    rather cheap but the best I could do. We made the trip of 20 miles in just 8 hours.
                                    Found the Regt gone ahead, but our Co. We pushed through next morning, &
                                    found the Regt at Camp Conel laid over to rest until we got up. It
                                    rained all day.
                        We pitched our tents in the mud, & corporels 
                                        Montgomery
                                    
                           41 & Modrell42 &
                                    myself went to the woods to cut brush to sleep on. We could hear guns firing all
                                    round, & fresh meat was coming in plenty, but on the sly.
                                    While we were out we saw two fellows skinning a hog. We went up to them and they skedaddled. They just took the hams & left all the rest.
                                    The hog would gross about 150#. 
                                        Montgomery
                                     staid & skined the animal, while Modrell & I carried in
                                    the brush. I told the Col. the circumstances & that I wanted to go &
                                    get the meat. He said go of course, it will spoil if you leave it. We put out early next morning, full tilt,
                                    the streets through london were 2 feet in mud. We got our mail at this place. I
                                    received a letter from Lucy & one from Laura.43 It
                                    really made my load lighter to get two letters. 2 miles from 
                                        London
                                     we crossed Little Laurel river which was very
                                    high, covering the road for ½ a mile. Some of the boys stripped off to go
                                    through, But I rooled down my pants & bolted right ahead.
                                    After I got across I went to cross a little neck of water about 5 feet wide. Two
                                    rails lay across it with the ends under the water, & I thought rested on the
                                    ground. But as soon as I threw my wait on the rails, I went nearly to my waist. The
                                    boys yelled & had a good laugh over it. It was real amusing to see them
                                    crossing. Some tumbling in head & ears, some that had 
                              
                                 41 Corporal John Montgomery, Company E, Thirty-third
                                            Regiment.
                              
                                 42 Corporal John H. Moderel, Company E, Thirty-third
                                            Regiment.
                              
                                 43 Perhaps his first cousin, Laura K. Fletcher,
                                            daughter of Stoughton A. Fletcher, or his aunt, Mrs. Calvin (Laura Fletcher)
                                            Button.
                           
                                     stripped, & were coming so carefully,
                                    would slip into the mud & their legs would be streaked
                                    with yellow clay.
                        
                           Big Laurel River 4 miles ahead was so high that we could not
                                    cross at all. So we laid by one day. Co E got on a big bust. They
                                    got some rot gut whiskey some wheres, & about 1/3 of the
                                    Co were tight. They quarrelled & fought & cut up jack in general.
                        The roads were so muddy that the mules would [go] clear under some
                                    times. Some of the boys said the teamsters had to fish them out with a rope on a
                                    pole with an ear of corn for bate. I dont know how this was, but it was deep
                                        enough.44
                        
                        The country from Rock Castle river to Barboursville is the
                                    poorest I ever saw. Nothing but rocks & hills. No level land at all. The
                                    steep side hills were all that was cultivated & very few of these. There is
                                    very little preparation for crops, & it looks as though they will starve in
                                    another winter. They plough altogether with one horse or mule with a plough
                                    something like what we call a bull tongue. As we
                                    struck the Cumberland river we came into a beautiful, little
                                    valey. It was about a mile wide. Here were some nice fields. The grass looked nice
                                    & green. The mountains on each side were all green, & the dog woods in full blossom were scattered thickly over their sides,
                                    making a beautiful contrast. Barboursville is quite a pretty little place situated
                                    in this valey. I suppose about 1000 inhabitance. After we passed through
                                    Barboursville about 3 or 4 miles, Lieut Whitson & myself stopped at a house
                                    & got our dinner We thought it was our only chance & last chance to
                                    eat in a house, so we went in strong. Had butter milk cornbread, pork &
                                    greens. The woman that waited on the table would ask us if we would have some pork & salid. We had a good laugh about her calling turnip greens, salid. About 2½ miles from town we found
                                    young Foley. In the evening I went back from camp to see him. A pretty sharp young
                                    man, Sergt. in Mondays Cavelry. When I returned it was pitch dark
                                    & raining. On coming down a steep place I slipped & fell, striking
                                    my right jaw on the end of a rail, sticking out from the fence. I
                                    saw Stars by the thousand. I thought it was broke, & the
                                    first thing I done was to work it to see that none of the machinery was out of
                                    order. This was Thursday the 24th.

                        From here we moved right along the river through this valey, which lay along on both
                                    sides. Some very good farms but very little preparation for cultivation. Monday the
                                    28 we arrived here at the ford. Here we are camped in a valey on the bank of the
                                    river, containing 30 or 40 acres, as level as a floor. Here are 8 Regts. 1st
                                    & 2nd Tenn 3rd 14th & 22nd KY. 33rd & 49th Ind. &

                                    . 3 Tenn Regts are forming farther down the river. The 
                                        Tenns.
                                     are coming over the Mts every day. Andy Johnsons son is Col of one,45 & Parson Brownlows son is Capt.46
                                    On the 30th I went out on picket for the first time I had charge of 17 men, was 3
                                    miles from camp, & next to the outmost pickets. The house where we were
                                    stationed, had once been a very respectable one The farm looked as though it had had an owner a little above the generality of
                                    people around here. During the day a man of about 30 & lady of 25 I should
                                    think came up, the lady picking some stray flowers that had sprung up through the
                                    hard trodden ground. I asked them where they were going, & as the man took
                                    out his pass he said, here is where I used to live. But its all gone now. I said
                                    something about his property being destroyed, he sighed & said I once had a
                                        home in the hills, & it was a pleasant one. &
                                    a tear came in his eye, & he turned a way. I realy pitied them. The Rebbles
                                    had torn every thing to pieces.
                        Saturday May 10th 1862.
                        Here we still lay in this valey surrounded by mountains, the sun coming down hot
                                    enough by day to scorch the hide off of us, & at night so cold that 3
                                    blankets will not keep us comfortable. Nothing of interest going on, except a little
                                    picket work now & then. The most interesting happened last Sunday night (the
                                    4th). Sunday it rained nearly all day. I was setting in the tent writing to Ingram
                                    & Lucy. I had just closed the letter when I heard the Maj yell
                                        out, strike tents. As usual, a rainey day or on Sunday we have to move. We
                                    didnt know where we were going, but supposed towards the Gap of course, so it was
                                    soon every tent was down & we marched across the pontoon bridge. But only
                                    went about a mile from our old camp. Stopped on a long grassy strip by

                                     the side of an old corn field with the tall
                                    clean stalks still standing The wagons had gone by way of the ford & had not
                                    yet come up. There are some men in every Regt that can always see the first straw,
                                    dry leaves, broomsey, & any thing good to make them a bed of, &
                                    always lookout for their own comfort. As soon as we stopped, some struck out into
                                    this field, cutting the stalks to sleep on as the ground was low & full of
                                    water. It seemed like a hungry drove of cattle turned into a bluegrass pasture. 2 or
                                    3 starts in, then all see & go with a rush. So here, in a few minutes the
                                    whole field of 8 or 10 acres was covered with busy workers gathering corn stalks. I
                                    was among them of course. in 15 minutes not a stalk 2 feet high was left. Tired
                                    & wet, I went to bed at dusk also the other boys. We had been in bed about
                                    ½ an hour & I had began to snooze, when I heard someone ask Capt.
                                    in next tent, how many men he had. I smelt a
                                    mice, & was wide awake in an instant. Somethings up boys, say I. Wev
                                    got to go out on picket says Corprl Montgomery. Just our luck, in another minute
                                    Capt pulled open our tent & says Whitson, Hill Fletcher roll out. 
                                        Montgomery
                                     Corprl Modrell rolled over together & sayd they guess they
                                    didnt have to go. But before we were out they were called. It wasnt long before Co E
                                    was formed. Loaded our guns to order & all we wanted was the word. Just then
                                    the Maj came riding down the street yelled out, drummers beat the long
                                        roll. Then came that long, stirring monotonous sound. The
                                    Regt. hussled out in a hurry. There was pulling & hauling for guns, some had
                                    lost their cartridge boxes. Some a bayonet, some couldnt find their hats, but all
                                    got out finaly. We were formed across the cornfield, several other Regts were formed
                                    across. Fosters47 battery was moved up in front so as to rake
                                    the road right along river. Here we stood for about 2 hours every moment expecting
                                    the Rebbles would come on to us. But it was a water haul, nary
                                    Secesh came. While we were in line I couldnt help but laugh at the number that all
                                    of a sudden got the back door trot.
                        
                        It proved to be a false alarm & we were ordered back to our quarters to sleep
                                    on our arms but no such good luck for Co E. We had no sooner got to our quarters
                                    than the word came for us to go out on picket. All went willingly, for they were
                                    anxious to get in to a muss of some sort after being called out with that
                                        expectation.48

                              48 Here occurs in the journal an illustration of the camp
                                        of the Forty-ninth Indiana Infantry Regiment at 
                                            Cumberland Gap
                                        .
                        
                        
                        We tumbled & stumbled along out the road (for it was a
                                    perfect bed of rocks, & dark as pitch) to what is called the stone house about a mile from camp. It is an old one storied house
                                    ½ frame ½ stone right on the bank of the river, or just room
                                    between it & the river for the road. The Mount, running up abruptly from
                                    behind. Here 12 men were called for to go 3/4 of a mile to another house. I couldnt
                                    stand it, to see any one go father out the road than I went, & of course I
                                    volunteered. When we got to the house which stands 3 or 4 hundred yards from the
                                    road, I was tired & wet & lay'd on a big stone about 20
                                    feet in front. I had been there but a second when I heard
                                    something up the hill back of the house, sounded like a man walking. I jumped up
                                    instantly & started that way. Just then I heard Corporel Montgomery yell
                                    out, halt, halt, there, walk right up here or I blow the daylights out of you. & I saw through the thick darkness the
                                    shadow of a man, or form of a man & I thought the bigest
                                    man I ever saw. He was a soldier with gun & accoutrements. Who
                                        are you & what are you doing here, was immediately asked. He was
                                    undoubtedly very much scared, said well Im here, youve got me. As he approached you
                                    could hear the click of more. than a dozzen guns. Where are the
                                    rest, was asked him, scattered all round here. I had imagined there was some others
                                    there & had been peeping round & just then I saw the form of a man
                                        skedadling up into the bushes about 50 yards up the hill, I
                                    put after him yelling halt, halt. But he disapeared, I did not
                                    shoot, I dont know why. I was cool & had my gun ready. I
                                    suppose because I wasnt shure of my game But as I found out afterwards, it was a
                                    good thing I did not. For they turned out to be our own pickets, of the 22nd KY.
                                    that had been stationed at the Moss house & when our pickets were fired on
                                    in the evening, & our Cavelry run in, they got scared & put to the
                                    woods & Mts, Lieut & all. Nothing else disturbed the silence of the
                                    night. All was as still as death. But there was no sleep. We expected the enemy in
                                    every moment, so we kept out eyes & ears open. It was a cloudy, foggy night
                                    & all was still, except one old cow that had been spared from the Secesh
                                    hands. She was browsing away in a little valey meadow about
                                    ½ a mile off & the tink, tink, tink, of her
                                    bell made me think of Grays Elogy, "And drowsy tinkling lulls the distant
                                        fold."49 Far in the night, she tired 
                              
                                 49 A more exact quotation from Gray's
                                            "Elegy Written in a Country Church-yard" would Rave been:
                                            "And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds." Edmund
                                            Gosse (ed.), The Works of Thomas Gray (4 vols.,

                                     of eating laid down to rest. Oh! that I had as
                                    little thought or care on my mind, as that old cow. That I might lay down even on
                                    the ground & sleep without fearing the cry to arm they
                                    come, I thought. But there was no other sound. Not even the bay of the long, lean lank, yellow eared mountain hound. Nor the shrill crow of a neighboring dung hill to tell us the
                                    hour of the night. All seemed, uninhabited, uncivilized. No! all was not silent,
                                    either, as gray dawn appeared, the doleful sound of, whip poor
                                    will, whip poor will, was heard from hillside & mountain top. As day
                                    broke I spread my oil cloth on the ground stretched my self, with my head on a stone
                                    for a pillow, I was soon asleep. It was broad daylight when I was wakened by one of
                                    the boys who yelled out, Fletcher, come wer going, you 11 drown
                                    laying here. The rain was pouring down right into my face. Instead of going back to
                                    camp where we could get our breakfast, the rest of the Co came out & we
                                    marched on out the road they said to meet the Rebbles &
                                    give them a round. Went about a mile & half, placed ourselves behind two
                                    little noles, where we could rake them as they came down the road. Here we were
                                    until 12 M. the raine pouring down in torrents. We were wet to the hide, tired from
                                    having no sleep, & nothing to eat since the night before. The boys would go
                                    to sleep just setting round. I saw 7 all sitting on the rocks, with their heads hung
                                    down, fast asleep. This was soldiering. Where is all that romance
                                    in camp life that you read about in so many novels. Where every man wares a feather
                                    in his hat & a sword & pistol by his side. All is success &
                                    pleasure. Venison was their meat, & wine was their drink, & a good steed carried them. But where, where is the
                                    romance, the pleasure, of war. You can put it all in your eye. An eleven & a
                                    half pound musket, on our shoulder, & 30 to 40 round of oz balls, in our
                                    cartridge box. And all our earthly property on our backs. Fat bacon &
                                    crackers to suffice our appetite and strong coffee without sugar or milk to wash it
                                    down. Once in a while we are furnished with flour & the boys make what we
                                    call flap jacks, Beat up into a thick batter & fry in grease. They are heavy
                                    & not fit for a dog to eat, & men begin to get sick after living on
                                    them a few days. Sometimes, beans & rice & sugar. This is soldiering
                                    at Cumberland Ford, in the Great Rebellion of 1861. & 2.
                        May the 12th/62. Is there any beauty & highfalutin about
                                    this? If there is I cant find it. But I came to war because I felt it my duty. I was
                                    one more drop in the bucket. I imagined the life
                                    before I came into it, but did not know it. 
                                    Although I have written the above, I am happy to say that I have not for one moment
                                    regretted entering the service. I wrote it to give an some idea of the life, as it is.
                        
                        I forget myself. I have left my pickets at their post, fast asleep
                                    in the drenching rain, & have strayed off. We watched impatiently till noon
                                    both for the Rebles & for our relief.
                                    Our relief came but nary secesh. We turned our
                                    wearied steps, but with a more quickened step toward camp. Sick with hunger
                                    & chilled from an incessant cold rains, & mad that
                                    after all, hadnt had a crack at a Secesh. After
                                    we got to camp we were immediately ordered to strike tents, & moved across
                                    the river again to our old camp we had left but the day before. And here we are yet,
                                    this May 12th 1862 and there seems to be a fine prospect for staying here two weeks
                                    longer. Gen Morgan50 has issued an order to drill 6 hours a day.
                                    Pretty hard on fat bacon & flap jacks. We are called by
                                    the revalle at ½ past 4 AM, roll call at 5 & drill until 6, one hour. A cook is left in each mess to have the meals prepared. Drill from ½ past 8 till ½ past 10
                                    making 3 hours in the fore noon, from ½ past 3 until 5 P.M. this is
                                    battalion drill, dress parade at $42 past 5, then Battalion drill till 7.
                                    The aim is to get the drill in the cool parts of the day. The days are very warm
                                    here, & the nights very cold. We sleep with 3 blankets & a quilt
                                    over us & then are hardly cumfortable. The clouds settle right down in the
                                    valey nearly every night, dont have any frost here. The few peach trees &
                                    apple trees that are left standing about here are full of fruit. I
                                    just had a letter from Stetson, writen on the 5th. He says the trees are just
                                    budding. I had a letter last night from father with 3$ & some
                                    postage stamps. I hear from home often. I have been up on a mountain just across the
                                    river & with the aid of Gen Coburns51 glass saw part of
                                    the Reble works at the gap. The distance was so great (10 miles) that I could not
                                    see or distinguish men or canon. They have 14 or 16 anon, 2 of which are heavy guns.
                                    Some report them 32, & some 64 lbrs.
                        These are the works I saw52 The dots are tents, & this is
                                    as I understand the Mts to lay. One standing seemingly right in the gap. The road
                                    runing through a little valey or open space, & right up to this middle Mt
                                    then turning to the right around it up through the gullie.

                        Tuesday May 20th 1862
                        The weather is pleasant but cloudy. Sunday it rained, a regular spring rain. It made
                                    every thing perfectly refreshing, & cool. From the mountain sides you could
                                    hear a perfect chatter & clatter made by the many birds
                                    that live there of every sort, shape & color. Friday morning Col Coburn
                                    brought me a 
                                        Cincinnati
                                     Gazette of the 12th containing the account of Miles death.53 It was the first I had heard of it. I could hardly realize it, & can hardly yet. I have received 2 letters
                                    from Ingram, giving me the facts. It was a sudden blow & was tended to make
                                    me, away here in this lonesome country feel low spirited & blue. But I have
                                    tried to keep my self as cheerful as possible. "Why should we weep when God
                                    has called his own" But let us be prepared for the day when we shall be
                                    called. That we may meet those that have gone before in a better world. We know not
                                    the day nor the hour when death will come.
                        Sunday afternoon the big guns that have [been?] talked about so
                                    much came up. Also a battery of 8 lbrs. But that, that pleased the boys most was, the Paymaster. The boys cheered &
                                    yelled. We will be paid off today or tomorrow 4 month pay. Sometimes when laying in
                                    my tent I can hear the 16th 
                                        Ohio
                                     commence yelling, 3/4 of a mile down the road, then our Regt. III
                                    lookout to see what is up & hear goes a poor dog up the road with his tail
                                    between his legs just a skedadling. Then the yell will pass clear
                                    along up the line of camps for a mile The guns we got were 2-32 lbrs & 2-24
                                    lbrs. Parrott We have now 22 pieces. 6-10 lb Parrott. 6-8 lb Parrott. 2 mountain
                                    howitzers, 4 brass pieces. We expect we will soon move up to the gap &
                                    commence opperations.
                        Friday May 16th/62. Cumberland Ford.
                        This morning Col Coburn brought me a paper of the 12th stating that Bro. Miles was
                                    killed by a Rail Road accident at 
                                        Sullivan
                                    , Ind. He was on his way to Pitsburg landing with Gov Morton54 Laz Noble55 & Dr. Bobbs56 & a great many 
                              
                                 53 Miles J. Fletcher, another brother, was killed in a
                                            railroad accident at 
                                                Sullivan
                                            , Indiana, May 12, 1862. At the time of his death he held the
                                            office of Superintendent of Public Instruction in Indiana. John H. B.

                                     nurses. It was a shock to me, & I can
                                    hardly realize it. So soon, so suddenly taken away. But so goes the world. We all
                                    have to die sooner or later. We know not the hour nor the day when death will visit
                                    us. May we be prepared that whenever it does come, we may meet those that have gone
                                    before.
                        Sunday afternoon June 1st 1862.
                        On the night of the 22nd May we were ordered to be ready to march next morning at 9.
                                    In the morning all were busy, throughout the camp, prepareing rations, scouring guns
                                    & C & C. We did not get started until about 11. We had marched but a
                                    hundred yards from camp, getting into a sunny open place when Gen Morgan met Col
                                    Henderson, & asked him where he was going. Says he you have no orders to
                                    move at this time 11 oclock you were ordered to march at 9. So you can halt your
                                    Battalion here until you get orders to move. So here we lay in the sun for nearly 2
                                    hours, when we recd orders to march.
                        The boys cheared & yelled when we started. I got my nose thougheraly sunburnt
                                    for about the 6th or 8th time this spring. We took the right hand road at the Moss
                                    house. But proceeded but a short distance57 when we overtook the
                                    19th Ky. wagons. Here we lay for an hour waiting for them to get out of the way. But
                                    when they did we went but about 200 or 300 yards until we overtook them again. Here
                                    we rested most of the afternoon The boys talked & laughed & cut up
                                    as usual on a march. I noticed that the beach trees all around were newly pealed. I
                                    couldnt tell what it ment. But soon saw the boys taking of the bark with their
                                    bayonets, & eating the iner portion. Of course I tried it, it had a sort of
                                        sweet bitter taste. But I realy had no particular relish for
                                    it. Just before dark we went up a steep winding hill. On one side was quite a jump off, not exactly a precipice. We went but about 200 yards
                                    beyond this when we again overtook the wagons in front of us. Our teamsters soon
                                    came up, & said that Co E's wagon had capsized on
                                    the hill back. One fellow said it had turned over 2 or 3 times & was 20 feet
                                    below the road & could not be got up without taking to pieces. Some one must
                                    go back & help it up. But all were tired & hated to move, so I 
                              
                                 57 Here occurs in the journal a page illustrating
                                            "Zollicoffer's old breastworks & stockade, one
                                            mile above Cumberland Ford."
                           
                                     struck out calling to some of the boys to come
                                    along. 2 or 3 followed. We found the wagon had just jumped over the bank &
                                    run down in the gullie, & that nothing was hurt, but with a little hard work
                                    could be got out. The guards that were left with the wagon were sitting lazily
                                    looking at the wagon. The boys cursed them for all that was out
                                    for not chocking the wagon as they should. Soon the whole Co came back. We could not
                                    do much that night, so we built fires around, got out our rations & took a
                                    quiet supper I was glad we got to sleep here, we were away from the noise &
                                    bustle of the Regt. We tumbled on the ground & slept finely, although there
                                    was a very accomodating rock that stuck up just high enough to dig me in the ribs,
                                    & not allow me to sleep to soundly. For all that one thing happened that
                                    night that makes me remember it more forcibly. I had a long pleasant dream. A dream that had a commencement & and
                                    end. It had realy a pleasant tendency away here in these wild woods. I hope I will
                                    remember it.
                        At day break we were up had our wagon out & ready to start. Found the Regt
                                    just where we left it mostly ready to start. Took our places & waited for
                                    the order to march. Here the boys lay along the side of the road & up under
                                    the trees on the side of the Mt waiting for the word. But no word came, getting
                                    tired they would take off their knapsacks & take it easy.
                        I saw Col C. during the fore noon & asked him what caused the delay. He said
                                    he had orders from Gen Morgan not to move until further orders. The telegraph line
                                    was put up as fast as we went. About noon 
                                        Morgan
                                     & staff came out & we were moved ahead about
                                    ½ a mile & pitched tents in a little valey of about 10 acres,
                                    right down in the Mts. We had been here about an hour, were
                                    getting dinner ready, & the boys building booths all round to lay under as
                                    the sun was very hot, when Col. C. came round & ordered us
                                    to strike tents. Told us we were going back & expected to
                                    go up the Gap road. In two hours we were back at the Moss house,
                                    & when the head of the column filed right towards the Gap there went up a
                                        prolonged yell that made the hills ring
                                    again. But loo this exciting pleasure that we had so long
                                    waited for, & seemed now so near was soon knocked in the head. The Regt was
                                    halted & marched back towards the ford & camped
                                    where we now are, on the side of the Mt about half mile from  the Moss house, just where the Rebles camped last
                                    winter. Our tent sets just where one of theirs did. They had it all leveled off nicely for us & some of our roofs are fastened to their
                                    old pegs. This is called Camp Whip Poor Will. Very appropriate
                                    name too, for every evening at dusk the whip poor wills commence their to sing out
                                    their dolefull penalty on poor Will &
                                    long before morning it is again commenced. At night I can stand in my tent &
                                    look up at the valey & across up the Gap road, & it looks like a
                                    vast city, hundreds of tents, & nearly all lighted, &
                                    there's a hum of voices, singing & blowing of bugles &
                                    beating of drums & rumble of wagons like the noise of a great metropolis. What means all this noise. What is all this queer business
                                    that has called so many thousands on thousands forth to live in this way. As I lay
                                    down on my blanket at night these thoughts are pondered over & over in my
                                    mind. All have come out with one intention, for one great purpose. How long it will
                                    last, we cant tell. We are all anxious for it to close that we may return to our
                                    homes. But are determined to see it closed honerably, or die in the effort.
                        
                           
                                        Cumberland Gap
                                    . Tenn. June 27th
                        Almost continual marching for the last three weeks has kept me from writing up my
                                    journal, & I have seen so much in that time of interest that I am afraid I
                                    will never get it all wrote up.
                        On Saturday, the 7th of June we were ordered to prepare with 4 days rations &
                                    be ready to march at ½ past 4 next morning. According to order we were on
                                    hands & started, we knew not where, but knew that it would be some place, & no failure this time. The 8th, 9th & 10th
                                    marched straight ahead, making about 11 miles a day. Took the same road we did
                                    before. The 11th we laid over where we camped the night of the 10th 2 miles from
                                    Rodgers Gap, 68 Cumberland Mt. During the day the artilery cavelry & all
                                    teams got up, & some of the artilery went on up the Mt. 2 brass guns came up
                                    pulled by bulls, 3 yoke to each. The driver was setting on the canon driving with
                                    lines to the leaders. This created quite an excitement & those two pieces
                                    has since gone by the name of the bull battery. At dusk we 
                              
                                 58 Rogers Gap.
                           
                                     fell in & moved ahead. As we struck the
                                    foot of the Mt the moon was just appearing over the top. She was just full &
                                    looked so beautiful. It was a deliteful night & made the hard march more
                                    pleasant. The assent from that side of the Mt is very steep. But the expectation of
                                    a fight on the other side made us forget all fatigue. So we soon made the top. Here
                                    we found a good road right along the top of the Mt. about 3 miles long running East.
                                    The moon shone right in our face. The large oaks & walnut & chestnut
                                    trees stood on each side of the road just far enough apart to form beautiful groves.
                                    Here was good level or rolling land enough to make a good farm. Very little was said
                                    through the whole line, nothing could be heard but the tramp tramp
                                    of the men. Orderly Walingford59 struck up Lillie Dale,
                                    & 3 of us came in & it realy sounded beautiful, besides it seemed
                                    appropriate. Then Walingford raked up his memory & come out a little on the
                                    theatrical, which enlivened the crowd considerable. We rounded the point marched
                                    down through the Gap which is high precipitious rocks on each side leaving but a
                                    narrow space to pass through. Here the road is very steep & makes a turn of
                                    a right angle. We came then in to a wide shallow gulley or small valey away ahead we
                                    could see the line of the edge of the Mt. The white misty line stretched clear along
                                    the Mt. here we found the siege battery standing at the side of the road looking
                                    like great black monsters on wheels asleep. As we marched up the slope &
                                    turned the point at the top to the right where the road commences the decent, the
                                    view was most grand. I never saw any thing of it before & never shall again.
                                    To the right the Mt ran away above us, to our left it went straight down down
                                    hundreds of feet. Away to the front & left of us, we could look as far as
                                    the eye could pierce into a vast nothing. Away below us we could
                                    see the tops of the Mts ridges. The fog had settled down so that nothing could be
                                    seen but the tops. They looked perfectly straight, & even & smooth.
                                    At first I thought they were cultivated ridges. I looked up at the moon, but lo the
                                    upper edge was becoming darkened. I continued to look, did my eyes betray me, or was
                                    it so. Ah! I remembered then, it was the 11th of June. This night the moon was to be
                                        eclipsed full according to the almanac. The scene was now grand yes, it seemed strange. 
                              
                                 59 Adjutant Estes Wallingford, of 
                                                Indianapolis
                                            , Thirty-third Regiment.
                           
                                     The Gen had given orders for no talking in
                                    ranks, so all was silent except the tramp of the troops. So we went silently down,
                                    down, down, it seemed that we would never get to the foot, turning short angles
                                    & going right in the opposite direction. I was thinking of home, wondering
                                    if they were looking at the eclipse. We saw two wagons that had run over the side
                                    lay up side down against the trees away below. The last one we passed we could just
                                    see the image of a man sitting in the bed. Cap spoke to him said you had a pretty
                                    serious accident, an[y] one hurt. "No," said the fellow but one of
                                    your men just struck me with a stone on the side of the head, while I was laying
                                    here asleep, & the blood's running down my face. Some fellow I
                                    suppose had very foolishly pitched a stone into the wagon, not knowing there was
                                    anyone in it. The moon was fast getting dark & by the time we got to the
                                    foot, only streaks shone through between the trees & dark shadows were cast
                                    across the road before us by the big rocks or trees. The eclipse had just closed
                                    over the moon & nothing could be seen but a dim firey ball as we were halted
                                    & tumbled down by the side of the road to sleep on our arms. We had just
                                    rolled in our blankets when the pickets commenced firing all around below us. We
                                    were all on foot in a minute. But there was no more disturbance & in 10
                                    minutes we were all down & passing off to the land of nod. We were up at
                                    early day light to see what there was to be seen. We found we were just at the foot
                                    of the Mt. just below us was a big mill over shot, run by a big
                                    spring, the finest I ever saw. It run three mills, a cording mill, grist &
                                    saw mill. Just beyond this was a big two storied white frame house, with a nice yard
                                    & fence & shrubery. Beyond to the right & left as far as the
                                    eye could see stretched Powels valey.60 This was a pleasing time
                                    to the eye. For the first time in two months, we could look without some big Mt or
                                    some big object coming in our view.
                        About 9 oclock we started up the valey with two Regts 33 Ind. & 19 Ky. 2
                                    guns, & some Cavelry on a forageing expedition. The valey looked beautiful
                                    every thing was in the heighth of prosperity. Fields of golden wheat just ready for
                                    the reapers, corn looked very flourishing, & some grass was cut. Most of the
                                    people professed to be Union. But I have little faith in their loyalty. We got back
                                    to our camp about 3 PM. Now we thought we would have time to take a good 
                              
                                 60 The Powell River
                                        valley.
                           
                                     rest. But about the first thing we heard was,
                                    that in two hours we had to start back over the Mt. This made the boys sware. They
                                    did cuss like good fellows. They didnt give us time to get supper.
                                    But started us in about ½ an hour after getting into camp. Just about sun
                                    set we had reached the top of the Mt. Now the view that seemed so strange to us the
                                    night before presented itself in a different light altogether. The view was most
                                    delightful. Away hundreds of feet below is [us?] lay the valey, about 3 or 4 miles
                                    wide & stretching to the right & left along the Mt as far as you
                                    could see. Square fields dotted with corn, luxurient fields of wheat, a grove here
                                    & there & the farm houses scattered about, made the scene, most
                                    picturesque picturesque. It was very hot, & the loads we had to carry made
                                    us very tired, & the boys declared it an imposition to have to carry a magazine on their backs, & the 40 rounds of cartridges in
                                    our knapsacks were flung out at very halt. We passed one 30 lbr Parrott gun going up
                                    a very steep place, which about? 4 way up made a very sharp right angle. It had 26
                                    horses to it. But as fast as they turned this angle they lost all power, so they had
                                    to be taken off & it pulled up by a block & tick. When I saw how
                                    hard these cannoneers had to lift & push & what trouble they had, I
                                    was glad I was not one of them but was an Infantry soldier, & had nothing
                                    but my own little self to spur up the hill. Some of the men became
                                    perfectly fatigued & tumbled down by the side of the road pitching their
                                    guns away declaring they would go no farther. But would rather die there on the Mt
                                    or be taken prisoners But after a nights rest they all came on & in a day or
                                    two all got with the Regt again We reached our old camp & resting place just
                                    before dark. Here we remained over night making an early start next morning,
                                    & about 4 P.M. were within ½ a mile of our next old camping place
                                    just across the line into Ky. It made the people open their eyes to see us going
                                    back they didnt know what it meant. Supposed we had got whipped or scared out. We
                                    understood we were to go to 
                                        Williamsburg
                                    . But when we got to this place we met the Cavelry going back towards
                                    the Mt & said we would have to start back next morning. Now the boys cussed again. But going back over the Mt into Tenn suited them
                                    better than going to 
                                        Williamsburg
                                    . This night we had the best ground to sleep on we had had for some
                                    time. Charley Test & myself made our bed down at the root of an old tree.
                                         We were just getting to sleep when Charley
                                    jumped up, also Mtgomery & Spratal who were sleeping near us, & all
                                    yelled out, there's a rattle snake, there's a rattle snake. I laid
                                    still & laughed at them which made Charley mad. He & Sprat declared
                                    they would not sleep there, Mountgomery & I told them they could go where
                                    they pleased, that we were going to sleep there. By this time about a dozen had come
                                    around with candles, but nary ratler could be found. Charley
                                    agreed to sleep there if I would change sides with him. As he was on the side next
                                    the old log where he heard the snake. I did this & nothing
                                    more happened. One oclock next day found us back to our old camp & resting
                                    place 2 miles from the Mt. We had made a forced march of it, although it was very
                                    hot. For no particular reason though, we were mad & didnt care whether we
                                    marched fast or slow.
                        Here we rested about three hours & again started up the Mt. We made the top
                                    & the pretiest level place just before darke, near the big spring which runs
                                    off in quite a little brook. Here we tumbled down for the night. I was waked next
                                    morning by the birds, hundred of these feathered songsters were sending forth their
                                    notes of joy this beautiful Sabbath morning, the 15th of June. A mocking bird
                                    perched just above my head was mimicing all the birds imaginable. I was in hopes we
                                    would remain here part of the day & have a real sermon on the Mt. But Sunday
                                    in war is the same as any other day. We made an early start & were soon down
                                    the Mt. where we found Decorsies62 Brigade camped, also part of
                                    the artilery that had got over. We camped right at the foot in the woods. It was one
                                    of the pretiest camps I ever saw, the pretiest place to camp. Our wagons were back
                                    & not likely to get over until the next day. Our rations were getting prety
                                    short, nothing but crackers & very few of them. The boys scoured the country
                                    around for 2 or 3 miles, bringing in cornbread chickens meat & every thing
                                    else that could be eaten. They all had money & something to eat they would
                                    have at any price. On Monday the 16th 3 of our Companies went out forageing. After
                                    we had got out about 5 miles they concluded they would not need them &
                                    started

                                            Company E, Thirty-third Regiment.
                              
                                 62 Colonel John F. De Courcy, commanding, Twenty-sixth
                                            Brigade, Army of the 
                                                Ohio
                                            .
                           
                                     back. Lt. Whitson in command of our Co gave me
                                    the privilege of taking 6 men & go across the valey & bring in some
                                    forage for our own consumpsion. We struck out with the intention
                                    of having something to eat or some fun one or the other. 4 went one way & 3
                                    of us another. After crossing the valey about 2 miles we entered a cedar thicket,
                                    then passed into an open square of about 10 acres surrounded by a growth of thick
                                        cedars. It seemed to have been an old field long since
                                    neglected. Through it ran an old road that had not been used for years as the dirt
                                    was all washed out & the large naked stones remained. We followed this,
                                    & passing through the hedge of cedars on the other side, saw away ahead of
                                    us an old two storied house, almost ready to tumble through, but still with some
                                    signs of habitation. This was about ½ a mile ahead of us across a little
                                    valey with a creek runing through it, all grown up on each side with willows
                                    & scicamores, presenting rather a wild appearance. On its bank stood an old
                                    mill, its wheel broken & weatherboarding partly torn off. Around stood half
                                    a dozen old houses, with roofs caved in, doors & windows knocked out. The
                                    weeds had grown up thick around & fences were all laid waste. About a
                                    hundred yards from the creek as we passed towards it stood a large old forge built
                                    of hewn stone & about 30 feet high. It was all perfect, every stone in its
                                    place. On top of it were cedars 8 or 10 feet high. All around were old heavy
                                    castings, & acres were covered with dross & cinders. About in
                                    different places stood stone chimneys all covered with ivy. I saw it had been once a
                                    little town, but long since deserted. I thought of Goldsmith's deserted
                                    vilage, "Sweet Auburn, loveliest vilage of the plain, Thy charmes have
                                        fled."63
                        
                        We crossed the creek & made our way up to the old house, passed through the
                                    old gate which wm broken from its hinges. An old weeping willow stood in the yard.
                                    It was about 3 feet in diameter, one limb was broken & hung down, &
                                    the long dead limbs laid scattered over the ground. A short distance to the right
                                    was an old milk house fast 
                              
                                 63 A more exact quotation from Oliver
                                            Goldsmith's "Deserted Village" would have been:
                                                
                                                "Sweet Auburn! loveliest village of the plain, …
                                                    … … … These were thy
                                                    charms—but all these charms are fled."

                                                    Goldsmith (4 vols., 
                                                        London
                                                    , 1854), I, 39-40.
                                            
                                        
                           
                                     decaying & a big spring runing under it
                                    was nearly filled up. We found no one at the house but an old woman. She was sick. I
                                    asked the old lady about this old vilage. She said it was called Speed
                                        well, & had been deserted about 50 years. Its day of speed had long since played out. She said it was a very
                                    prosperous place in its day. We went back to camp with our haversacks well filled
                                    with cornbread. But the fation of making bread down here is just with water
                                    & meal, no salt nor lard.
                        On the next evening the 17th we were ordered to be ready to move at any time during
                                    the night We had about a cracker a piece. With this in our haversacks we laid down
                                    on the ground to rest until called for. I forgot to mention, on the evening before
                                    just at dusk word came up the valey that the Rebles were advancing & that
                                    our teams that had gone out forageing had been cut off. In 30 minutes we were in
                                    line & out ½ a mile from camp ready to go at it. We only wanted
                                    them to come. We had done some hard marching to find a fight and now we were anxious
                                    to have it. Here we remained about half an hour when word came that the news was all
                                    false. Some fellow had got scared & magnifyed it to a big truth. Now for our
                                    march! At 2 A M Wednesday we fell in & started towards the Gap. There were
                                    two particular objects in this move. We were to bag a party of about 2000 Rebles out
                                    about 8 miles & then march on to the Gap. Two roads started out from the
                                    camp runing up the valey 3 or 4 miles apart, so;64 One Brigade
                                    went the right hand road cuming into the main Gap road on the cross road just beyond
                                    the the Reble camp. The rest of the division came on the main road, intending engage
                                    them the others came up on the other side & bag the whole thing. But just as
                                    we were going to put the salt on the birds tail, the way she went.
                                    They had just left that morning, their fires were still burning. Here we rested
                                    & the boys scoured the grounds tired as they were. Picking up Secesh papers
                                    & C & C. Not finding them here we pushed on to the Gap, which place
                                    we came in sight of about 4 P.M. The white tents were shining in the sun, &
                                    had all the appearance of a lively camp. But we had heard from every person along
                                    the road that it had been evacuated that 
                              
                                 64 At this point occurs a small drawing indicating the
                                            valley roads and the positions of the Confederate and Union camps at 
                                                Cumberland Gap
                                            .
                           
                                     morning. Just at this time It began to thunder
                                    & lightning & the big black clouds came rolling over the Mt. Soon
                                    the rain began to pour down, & for two hours nearly, it soaked us to the
                                    hide. When it stopped raining we were within 3 miles of the Gap. The sun came out
                                    & the most beautiful rain bow appeared that I ever saw. It appeared so close
                                    & so perfect. The end didnt seem to be more than a hundred yards off. We now
                                    went for 2 miles through a thick woods where we couldnt see the works at the gap at
                                    all. We were tired & worn out, we had had but one cracker the whole day. But
                                    we all at once came right out in full view of the Gap, & all its works. The
                                    boys sent up one cheer that made the woods ring. It cheered them up & they
                                    moved on with a quick spirited step. We now began to get into the clearing where
                                    they had cut the timber out & all the hills to the right were surrounded
                                    with heavy rifle pits. A lively appearance was presented as we arrived in the little
                                    valey just at the Gap. Two brigades & two batteries had arrived before us,
                                    being in advance. Decorsies Brigade & Fosters battery had on arriving gone
                                    up into the Gap & were firing a saloot. Because they were in advance
                                    & arrived first, they claimed the taking of 
                                        Cumberland Gap
                                    . Straight before us on the far side of the valey were the Reble winter
                                    quarters neat log huts built in rows. Well roofed with good chimneys & doors
                                    & windows. The boys began ransacking them immediately, Getting good
                                    bedsteads, tables, chairs, stools, & C & C. The Rebles had left all
                                    their tents, but had slit them from top to bottom. They had left them all standing,
                                    so as to deceive us I suppose.
                        Worn out from the 20 miles march I could not visit the works that night, so tumbled
                                    down on the ground, & slept soundly, although it rained. As soon as we got
                                    our breakfast Lt Whitson & my self started to make the trip A perfect swarm
                                    of soldiers had been going up & coming down all morning. We met some with
                                    good ovens & lids, others with flour some with lard, crackers & C
                                    & C. We went around their works with our eyes open. Here was one part of
                                    Military art that we had never seen before. I cant describe it on paper. Here all
                                    the art & science of military art had been displayed. Every point that
                                    guarded a hundred yards of space was fortifyed by rifle pits, breast works,
                                    & C. They had left 5 canons, all 60 lbrs I believe. two of them had rolled
                                    over the abrupt bluff, but have since been pulled up & all
                                    are now  unspiked & ready for use. Any
                                    number of shot & shell, grape & canister lay about. Some of the
                                    shell were loaded. Some man carried one home with him down by the ford, his children
                                    were playing with it & it exploded, shattering the mans leg. He died about a
                                    week or two after from it. They had left nothing in their magazines at all. They had
                                    destroyed a great deal of lard & bacon, & flour by emptying it into
                                    a big well. Out of this the boys took a great quantity. Here at the Gap is a big
                                    Grist mill run by water from a big spring cuming right out of the side of the Mt
                                    Also a big forge & foundry, 3 or 4 houses & a store. One big two
                                    storied white frame house. There is another thing of particular interest here that
                                    has tended to divert our minds from the dull, weary monotiny of camp life. That is a
                                    large cave in the side of the Mt about 150 feet above the 
                                        Va.
                                     road.65 It has been visited by nearly everyone in
                                    our Regt & by a great many in other Regts, & a great many fine
                                    specimens have been taken out. Lt Col Henderson sent home as fine a collection as I
                                    ever saw. I have also sent home a small collection. I was in it several times, also
                                    in several other caves on top of the Mt A real interesting description might be
                                    given of this cave by a good writer, but as I dont profess to be such I shall not
                                    attempt it. I have been in the Mammoth cave Ky. and several smaller ones, but never
                                    have I found one so beautiful as this, nor half so fine. High guttered, fluted
                                    columns, the color of rich honey comb Colums of stelagmites most magnifficent, and
                                    beautiful. One column about 30 or 40 feet high & about 12 or 15 feet in
                                    diameter at the base we called "the tower of Bable." The ceiling glittered with thousands of pure white
                                    steactights [stalactites] each with a drop of water on its point. One room was full
                                    of pure white knotty formations, another, chamber adjoining it, full of pure white
                                    smooth formations. One big chamber covered about an acre & a half of space.
                                    We could not throw across it, nor throw nor see to the top. The rocks seemed to have
                                    tumbled in from the top from some great concussion earthquake or something forming a
                                    perfect conglomerated mass of big rough ugly rocks. In this chamber I got lost. I
                                    had very foolishly gone in by my self & if some of the boys hadnt have come
                                    in after me, I probubly would have staid there by my self. but I have writen a
                                    description

                                     of this and of the other caves, home so I will
                                    take no more time for it now. The Mts here are full of caves, are all
                                        hollow. & Some day I want to come down here & explore them.

                                    , Camp on top of the Mt Friday August. 22nd 1862.
                        Summer has almost gone by and my journal has been laying quietly in my knapsack. A
                                    great many things have happened throughout the general Government, through out the
                                    army, & right here in our own division. But here its the same old tune,
                                    every soldier knows it. I dont care what part of the army he is in.
                        About the 1st of July we moved out on the Tazewell66 road
                                    & camped near a fine large spring. It was the best camp we have ever had.
                                    4th of July passed off like a Sunday, there was nothing to do, & the boys,
                                    mostly went out in the country, & to the Gap & other camps
                                    &c. So the camp was left perfectly still, & I was very glad of it
                                    too for I was not well & prefered to keep still. We went on a 3 days
                                    forageing expedition into V.A. Also on one out to Tazewell. The last expedition
                                    there under Col Decorcey had quite a little fight with the rebles. I believe 3 were
                                    all we lost on our side. I was sick about 2 or 3 weeks, part of the time quite
                                    badly, in fack for 4 or 6 weeks after I was lost in the cave I was not well. I got
                                    perfectly chilled through. About the 1st of Aug false alarms got to be all the go. We were called out nearly every night. One night we thought
                                    they were coming sure. We were ordered to strike our tents & take them off
                                    & hide them. This was about 2 or 3 oclock in the morning. The sick were all
                                    started off to the gap in ambulances & we waiting for them to come up, but
                                        nary came. So a little after day light we were ordered to
                                    pitch tents again. This is the way soldiering goes, hard enough, any man knows.
                        On the 8th or 9th I believe it was about 2 oclock in the morning we were yelled out & ordered to strike tents & prepare to move.
                                    This didnt suit us for we hated to leave our camp, as a man hates to leave a good
                                    home. In fact a good camp is home.
                        
                        We had but 2 wagons, all the rest had gone after forage. So it took longer to move.
                                    But we finally got our things all off & then moved ourselves, to the gap
                                    & camped right on 
                              
                                 66 Tazewell, 
                                                Tennessee
                                            .
                           
                                     the slope of the foot of the Mt just below the
                                    VA road under the canons on top of the Mt. How different soldiers live after they
                                    have been out 6 or 8 months. The first 6 months they are out, they dont know
                                    nothing, dont know how to make a bed, dont know how to cook, or fix for a march, or
                                        shift at all. They sleep on the ground & live more
                                    like hogs than any thing else. But now our men are above sleeping on the ground.
                                    They know how to shift they live well, under the circumstances. We
                                    moved to the gap about noon & before night 2/3 of the whole Regt had him a
                                    good bed made from one to two feet from the ground, fixed up as though they knew we
                                    would stay here a month or two. Here we had the best bed we have ever had yet. Last
                                    Sunday the 17th the Rebles made their appearance at Powels
                                    river quite early, drove in our pickets & advanced as far as
                                    Pattersons, showing themselves 2 or 3 Regts strong out in the fields. Mondays
                                    cavelry pitched into them67 pretty strongly, keeping them on a
                                    short lookout. The long roll beat & the different Regts were all out in a
                                    few moments. Orders were to strike tenta right where they were, & in 5
                                    minutes every tent laid low. We took position right up back of our camp on a steep
                                    hill side, or the steep slope of the foot of the Mt Artilery was flying here
                                    & there & taking position Generals, Col's, Aids, Orderlies,
                                    & C & C, were riding here & there to & fro as light
                                    as their horses would go. It began to look like something was up. The old 30 lbr
                                    right over us & the one on the opposite Mt would speak out every few moments
                                    and send a despatch over to the Rebles in the shape of a shell. Whiz they would go, singing through the air. The Rebles were firing also, but
                                    at Mondays camp. They did no harm! We were ordered to take 80 rounds of cartridges
                                    in our haversacks making 120 in all, a regular magazine. In about an hour we came
                                    back to camp & in 3 minutes every tent was up again, & we laid down
                                    on our beds & took it easy, the canon all the time barking away. When the
                                    Rebles would shoot the boys would all yell out, guardhouse
                                    guardhouse put him in the guardhouse. A fellow by the name of Colwell Majors68 was detached from our Co to the Siege battery that was
                                    firing, & every time she would belch out the boys would yell out, give it to em Majors, give em hell,

                                    Colwell, give em another Colwell. We didnt know
                                    what moment the shells might come rattling over into us, nor didnt care. That
                                    evening we were ordered to strike tents, & the Regt moved out the Harland
                                        road,69 1½ miles on the Ky. side of the Mt It is
                                    an awful rough road runing right out the spur of the Mt.
                        The Col had picked out a most beautiful camp ground right in the woods, wagons were
                                    scarce & our things did not get up that night, we had but a cracker apiece.
                                    I munched down a half a cracker & rolled in my blanket,
                                    under some trees, & never slept better. The difficulty of getting water here
                                    was the only thing that made this a bad camp. Next day our cooking utensils came out
                                    but not our tents. So we laid around until afternoon, waiting either for our tents
                                    or the Rebles when we received orders to march back to the Gap & Decorceys
                                    & brigade came & camped where we were, & are there yet. We
                                    camped right up on the Mt. & an awful hard time we had geting our things up.
                        
                           
                                        Cumberland Gap
                                     September 5th
                        The Companies were scattered about wherever they could find ground. Our Co got right
                                    where the Rebles had leveled out places for tents. This saved work. We picked out a
                                    fine place for our tent & 
                                        Montgomery
                                     & I took possession of a Secesh bed that was already made. Here
                                    it was dreadful hard to get water. Such a task as I never want again. But it was not
                                    our luck to remain in one camp long, so in about a week we were moved down below
                                    just above the battery in the gap. & here we are yet. Just inside of the
                                    long rifle pit running up from the gap. It is the dustiest dirtyest camp we have
                                    ever had. Wood & water are both hard to get. We have been out on two or 3
                                    forageing expeditions since we have been blockaded with the expectation of a fight
                                    each time, but nary fight do we find. That is we dont go quite far
                                    enough out, & the Rebles wont come quite far enough in. This dividing line
                                    is gagued by our 30 lb Parrotts on top of the Mt. they can do fine execution from 3
                                    to 4 miles. We are afraid to go out side of their range for fear of being cut off
                                    for they have a heavy force, & they are afraid of getting inside of our
                                    range for they know that we can cut them all to pieces with artilery &
                                    infantry. Last Sunday the 31st of Aug we started out early 
                              
                                 69 Harlan, 
                                                Kentucky
                                            .
                           
                                     to capture a big lot of wheat 3 or 4 miles out,
                                    but when we got to the bottom of the hill we were halted & about faced
                                    & marched back to quarters. The Gen had just got word that the Secesh had
                                    stepped in & taken it just the night before. We marched back & had
                                    inspection, but before we were through with this were ordered out again. As we
                                    marched down the hill the canons on the hill commenced firing away at a rapid rate,
                                    we thought there was something up sure, & the boys yelled out with joy. The
                                    roads are awful dusty, we have had no rain for 3 weeks. We marched down the valey
                                    road about 1½ miles, & deployed in ambush. 2 or 3 canons had gone
                                    up on a point of a hill & those & the canons on the Mts threw their
                                    shell thick & fast. But I believe they availed but little. We were only out
                                    2 or 3 hours But when we got back to camp, I was never more fatigued from a days
                                    march. Times are awful dull here. All the talk is about half rations &
                                    surrendering. Next Sunday will be 3 weeks since we have been blockaded &
                                    have been on half rations. We have done finely until now. This morning we drew our
                                    last flour, a pound a piece. This is the last. When this is gone,
                                    beans, rice, & mixed vegetable soup will have to form our feed. Also
                                    ½ rations of bacon. It is pretty slim, but not near as hard as those at
                                    home would think. All I am afraid of is that those at home will fret & think that we are starving. It is all the talk, But no one is
                                    scared yet, or but few. 3 or 4 are in our tent now discussing the probability of
                                    surrendering & being parolled or retreating & leaving every thing.
                                    We can stand it until about a week from next Sunday. We can hold the place as long
                                    as we have got feed. Hundreds of reports go the rounds every day.
                                    About the last is that Lu Wallace70 has advanced & drove
                                    the Rebles this side of Barboursville. But I believe nothing unless I here it
                                    officialy or see it my self. We bring in some prisoners every day. Some come in
                                    & give themselves up. Tenn recruits also come in But the fewer the better of
                                    them just now.

                        Yesterday things began to look as though some move was to be made of some sort, but
                                    the fortifying still went on. Reports have come in that the Rebles are in

                                     & Frankford,71 & if this be the
                                    case, we know we cannot remain

                                     here many days longer. Today the thing seems
                                    more certain An order has been read, that the pickets for Monday, Tuesday &
                                    Wednesday shall be picked men. Men are at work drilling the rock
                                    on the 
                                        Va.

                                    blockade them. We dont expect to remain here many more days. Grub
                                    is geting most awful short. We have had no bread for a week & over except
                                    some corn bread made from meal we grate. Nearly every mess has a grater &
                                    you can hear them going at all times of day & night, like so many saw mills.
                                    But corn is very scarce, we have to go from 4 to 8 miles to get any. We have gone 5
                                    days without a bit of bread.

                                    in the stove. Soup is our principal food. We have to be careful & work every
                                    thing in so as to make our rations hitch. But not a night passes
                                    but I see men go to bed with a hungry belly.

                        The feature of things has slightly changed today But I think will not last long. Last
                                    night an order was read stating that Seigle had gained a great victory between 
                                        Louisville
                                     & Frankford & perfectly demoralized & scattered
                                    that portion of the Reble Army & that we would not leave the Gap for some ten days at least. At this the boys cheered greatly for none
                                    want to leave. So this morning the fatigue men were detailed as usual &
                                    diging & shoveling went on.
                        Tuesday 16th Sept.

                        Last night the 4th Tenn Regt. Col Johnson were drawing new guns at
                                    the Commissary, and kept up a continual yelling & noise so that I could
                                    hardly sleep. This morning as soon as it was light I looked across to the Commissary
                                    to see what was going on & saw the large square hole dug in the side of the
                                    Mt for a magazine was filled half full of guns. I knew the thing was all up now. I
                                    knew we would never remain in the Gap 10 days nor three. Men were beginning to move
                                    to & fro & every thing seemed to be geting in a hubub. Some of our
                                    boys had been over & were bringing away straps & new parts of
                                    ringing [rigging?]. After breakfast I went over. The magazine was one conglomerated
                                    mass of all sorts of guns, pitched in from the top, some in boxes never opened
                                    & which had smashed scattering the new bright barrelled pieces in all sorts
                                    of shapes. Others had been pitched in from the top by  arm loads. Here were 
                                        Springfield
                                     rifles Enfield rifles Belgium rifles Prusian rifles, French carbines 
                                        Tennessee
                                     rifles Greenwood muskets & every other kind made almost. All
                                    new & serviseable, none costing less than $14. & some as
                                    high as $40. I suppose there were 1500 in this hole. I passed on into the
                                    commissary where hundreds of soldiers had collected. At the far end the
                                    accoutrements for small arms & cavelry were stacked in boxes to the top of
                                    the building. The top of these were covered with boys with axes & hatchets
                                    prying of [f] the lids & sling the contents to the hundreds that stood
                                    around. They were yelling & talking & grabing & snatching
                                    & the greatest excitement existed As fas[t] as one box was emptied it was
                                    pitched off & another opened. The Infantry were geting new cartridge boxes
                                    belts & straps. Cavelry & artilery were geting new bridles, girths,
                                    martingales sword knots & c. As it was a general pitch in I availed myself
                                    of the opportunity & got me a new rig out & out except the gun. A
                                    great many of our boys that had no guns or guns out of rig got new ones of the same
                                    calibre. Nearly every officer got him a 
                                        Springfield
                                     or an Enfield rifle or any other kind they wanted it was a free pick.
                                    But this high slashing destructive operation soon got to such a pitch that the
                                    officers had to put a stop to it, & a guard was placed over the things. But
                                    with an order from their Captain or a commissioned officer with them, any one could
                                    get every thing he wanted. This afternoon I took 10 men & loaded 7 wagons of
                                    ammunition. We were ordered this morning to cook two days rations & be ready
                                    to march at any time. But this was a very slight job as we had very little to cook.
                                    Beef was all. Our beans & rice we could not carry cooked. We had a little
                                    corn which we grated & bi[?] & baked.

                                     & I made us some little bags out of an old fly, one for beans,
                                    one for rice, one for salt & one for sugar. Modrell is sick & is in
                                    the Hospital & I am afraid will be left & be taken prisoner so there
                                    is but the three from our mess. We have each put a tin plate & knife
                                    & fork in our haversack, & each a chunk of bacon. I have the little
                                    tin bucket fastened to my knapsack & John72 has the
                                    little coffee pot. We also have about 29$ qts of ground coffee in a sack,
                                    this is our main dependance. Night. Every thing is now ready. We have been notified
                                    that we will march at

                                     4 in the morning. Our canteens are resting
                                    quietly full of water from the mountain spring, the last canteen full probubly that
                                    we shall ever dring from it. tin cups are attached. Haversacks are full, &
                                    knapsacks packed all except the blanket. I have just as little in mine as I can get
                                    along with. I keep but two shirts, two prs socks & one pr pants &
                                    jacket. With but few little extraes. I have burned my letters except one or two. Our
                                    mess chest & stove have to be left They have become bosom friends, old
                                    friends that have served us well through long tedious marches. There are all of our
                                    dishes (except what we carry) & other little things. Our whole Kitchenary
                                    department have to be left to be smashed to pieces to keep the Rebles from geting
                                    them. Then our tent, next to a soldiers home, is next to his heart. Although black
                                    & rusty with the ware & tare and rains & snows of nearly a
                                    years hard servise & leaks a little when it rains. I love its shelter.
                                    & there is my bed, although made of Secesh puncheons, on no bed did I ever
                                    sleep sweeter. Here in my soldiers home I have read & slept &
                                    dremed, Dreamed of that other home away off in Hoosier. In my dreams I have seen all
                                    my friends there & we have talked & laughed together, but I would
                                    wake to find it all a dream & I still under canvas. The very flies on the
                                    ridge pole have become my companions. If we make good our retreat we will probubly
                                    soon get new tents. But it will be like going from an old house where you have long
                                    lived, into a new one. Among all the Companies but one trunk is to be taken. (Lieut
                                    Maze's)73 it takes all company books & papers. All others will have
                                    to go by the board. Hill has a splendid one. These things will all be smashed
                                    & tents riped up by the last that leave the Gap. I hated to leave home, I
                                    knew what I had to go through as a soldier. I knew it was a hard life. For 9 months
                                    we marched & countermarched through rain & snow mud & water
                                    just to take the Gap, & just 3 months ago day after tomorrow we took it. We
                                    marched in with empty haversacks & no rations in our
                                    wagons. Tired & hungry after a 20 miles march on half a cracker. We have
                                    lived on short rations every since & have made the very finest preparations
                                    for defense looking forward to a better day coming. But for four weeks now we have
                                    been blockaded, & have lived on short half rations.
                                    & now just three months

                                     after we leave it as we took it, with a hungry
                                    gut & a lean belly. I say I am sorry to leave it, yes,
                                    more so than I was to leave home. For we endured so much to take
                                    it, & have done so much work & expended so much money on it, that to
                                    let it fall into the hands of the Rebles, it seems to me will give them more
                                    encouragement than any thing else, besides a new footing. If it would do any good I
                                    could shed tears at having to leave it. There is not one of our men but would endure

                        Cumberland Ford, Wednesday Sept 17th/62
                        I am tired out with a hard days march of 16 miles. We were called up last night at
                                    just 12 m & marched out at 1½ oclock. The road was awful dusty
                                    & the day hot. I came nearer giving out to day than I ever did before
                                    & the boys generaly are foot sore & lame shouldered. About a half
                                    dozen picked up old Government mules along the road so thin you can almost see
                                    through them. & have them loaded with knapsacks swung across their backs.
                                    belonging to the weakest men. They lead them along with straps & roaps, it
                                    is rather amusing to hear the remarks made to them by the boys. The old camp ground
                                    & valey at the ford look natural, but are all grown up with rank grass
                                    & weeds. As the season has been very dry, water is very scarce. So we have
                                    to use river water. I have just been down for water. Right on the bank I passed over
                                    the last remains of two old mules. Found 6 or 8 men in swiming about 30 yards above
                                    & 10 or 12 washing their feet & hands & faces right where we
                                    had to get the water. But we didnt know the differance after the coffee was made. I
                                    took a good bathe & washed & dried my socks. Papaws are just ripe
                                    along the river & of the very finest quality. I have eaten so many that I am
                                    nearly sick.
                        In a fence corner, some where in knox Co. Ky. at the head of Goos[e]creek. (which is
                                    dry). Thursday Sept 18th.
                        Just 3 months ago today we marched from Rodgers Gap to 
                                        Cumberland Gap
                                     & today we have marched nearly as far (18 miles) & are
                                    as tired. It has been a better day for marching than yesterday. It rained just as we
                                    started & laid the dust & has been cloudy nearly all day. But some
                                    of our  stoutest men had to fall out by the side
                                    of the road & rest. I among them for the first time. At Flat lick we took
                                    the right hand road leading to Winchester. It is the best Mt road I ever saw,
                                    & the country is much better that that we passed through last spring going
                                    to the Ford. Corn looks fine, houses look neat & every man has a patch of
                                    sugar cane. We had this morning for breakfast a little piece of corn bread &
                                    raw bacon, on this we marched all day (also coffee,) and to night we have the same.

                                     Co Ky. Friday Sept. 19th
                        To day we have marched about 14 miles. The country geting better, it is, rather, a narrow valey. The road runs right down Goos creek. The corn is
                                    as fine as any I ever saw in Ind. & houses begin to look civilized. I saw
                                    this morning standing in a door a pretty girl, with a neat, stylish red dress on
                                    & hoops. The first thing of the kind I have seen for I cant tell how long.
                                    It realy done me good. The old Government pack mules have
                                    increased to about 20 or 30, a perfect train. We had for breakfast this morning
                                    about 4 spoons full of rice after it was cooked, & some raw meat &
                                    coffee. This we marched on all day.
                        We passed two salt works one woods. the other Old Col Garreds about a mile up the
                                    creek from here. They were both in opperation & the flores were covered with
                                    nice white salt. The creek water is so salty we can hardly use it. Fresh water is
                                    scarce. We are camped right between Old Col & young Col Garreds houses which
                                    are about 3/4 of a mile apart. The Old Col is a strong secesh. But his son is strong
                                    Union & Col of the 3rd Ky. We drew flour tonight & John Montgomery
                                    got it baked up at a house. It was made up with just water & salt &
                                    not half done but I thought it was the best bread I ever ate.
                        Some place Saturday forenoon Sept 20th
                        We are with in a mile & a half of Winchester, & are resting here to
                                    day. We may remain here several days. The day is very pleasant & a nice
                                    breeze blowing
                        This morning we made our flour up with water & salt, made it in thin cakes
                                    & baked it on our plates set up before the fire it ate well & no
                                    mistake. Also drew fresh beef. They are bringing us to it by degrees, I forgot to
                                    state yesterday that Gen Morgan staff & suit passed us about 6 miles from
                                         here. As we passed the salt works yesterday
                                    I saw a great many darkies, & several of them the very same fellows that I
                                    saw leave Crab Orchard the 2nd day of last January singing their corn songs. One
                                    fellow, that I saw dance the jigg at Colwells, knew some of our boys, &
                                    seemed as glad to see them as a brother. He walked with us about a mile. I am
                                    writing under the shade of a big elm tree just across the creek opposite the camp.
                                    The 2nd Tenn & 49th Ind have just come in & passed down on this side
                                    of the creek to camp. The 49th came in playing Dixey. Some other Regt went down the
                                    other side. Also Fosters Battery. They say that every thing was destroyed before
                                    they left the Gap. A lot of the boys are in swiming, & some laying under the
                                    shade of the trees along the bank. This elm tree I am siting under is about 7 or 8
                                    feet in diameter. About the largest I ever saw. I am hungry as a wolf, &
                                    must go & see if our beef is boiled, & try & worry down a small piece. A Corporel in the Reg by the name of Higgins74 took sick Thursday & died last night The water is
                                    very salty & not fit to use. Although last night when we came in, tired
                                    thirsty & hungry we pitched into it & cooked & made our
                                    coffee of it. Last night while I was asleep with my blanket drawn over my head some
                                    fellow took hold of my cut which was fastened to my haversack. In fumbling with the
                                    tin he woke me. I threw the blanket from of my head & yelled at him, he skedaddled double quick leaving the cut behind him. he belonged to

                        One thing I have remarked particular since I have been on this march. That is the
                                    dew. it drips from the trees in the morning like rain & our blankets are
                                    soaking
                        Tuesday Oct 6th 1862. Sciotoville 
                                        Ohio
                                    
                        
                        We have at last struck the Ohio River & crossed into
                                    free soil. It seems like getting home. Here the people come out & greet us
                                    with smiling faces & pleasant words, & this cheers us up.
                        Since I wrote up my journal at the salt works the march has been kept up at such a
                                    pitch that I have not had time to keep it up & I have forgoten many little
                                    interesting incidents that I intended to note down. Saturday evening the 20th Gen
                                    Morgan issued an order, stating that we had a long 
                              
                                 74 Corporal Richard H. Higgins, of 
                                                Bartholomew County
                                            , Company I, Thirty-third Regiment.
                           
                                     tedious march before us. Over a road that was
                                    called impractable & that we would have to go two days on one canteen of
                                    water. The case looked pretty billious, but we all were willing to stand any thing,
                                    with a prospect ahead of us of geting once more into civilizeation. But we did not
                                    find it as bad as expected. The road lay mostly along creek beds & along
                                    these pools & holes of water still stood which furnished us with plenty. 8
                                    or 10 miles was the fartherest we had to go without water. We left Sunday noon the
                                    21st marched 14 miles Camped on a little stream about 12 Midnight We passed through 
                                        Manchester
                                     that evening. A little county seat of 5 or 6 houses & a log
                                    court house.
                        We started about 4 oclock. 22nd camped at dusk on the east branch of the
                                        Ky. river. We had just got to bed when the orderly was
                                    called to draw rations. The rations consisted in a little flour bacon &
                                    coffee. We had to mix the flour up with water & salt & bake it on
                                    our plates before the fire, this took till about 10, & I tumbled down in a
                                    fence corner with burnt fingers & aching tired feet. In about half an hour
                                    we were called up, to get ready to march, this made the boys sware. It was too bad
                                    for we were tired out almost. Boon ville75 was 6 miles &
                                    we were ordered there. We made this march with but one rest. It was the hardest I
                                    ever made, the men droped by the side of the rode & declared they would
                                    rather be picked up by the secesh cavelry (who were just in our rear) than to be
                                    marched to death. We passed a steam grist mill on the Ky River.
                                    the boys yelled & cheered, for it was the first steam machine we had seen in
                                    6 months. We camped in the streets of Boonville until about sun up. It is the county
                                    seat of 
                                        Ousley county
                                    , & has a very nice brick court house. Marched 23rd to Proctor,
                                    16 miles on the Ky River middle fork. Here the Secesh had
                                    burned a fine steam flour mill that morning. This left the people without any thing.
                                    They had to get their meal as we did, by gritting it. We crossed the river &
                                    slept in a barn yard all night.
                        We rested until noon the 24th. The road along the river where whe [we] had to go was
                                    greatly out of repair, this delayed us greatly & by dark we had got but
                                    about 4 miles. The Col told us we could lay down & sleep about 2 hours, or
                                    we might be called up any moment. Hill,

                                     self went up on the side of the hill to sleep
                                    & an English man in our Co by the name of Tommy Dell76
                                    went above us & layed down behind a beach tree. Hill told him that he would
                                    get left when we were called up. But he said there was no danger. In about an hour
                                    & a half we were called up in a great hurry. I intended to go & wake
                                    Dell But they hurried us out so that by the time I got my things on I had forgotten
                                    all about him. The next morning he was missed & has not been heard from
                                    since. I suppose the Reble cavelry picked him up, for they followed close at our
                                    heals for that purpose. We marched about 5 miles over the worst road I ever saw
                                    & it was so dark you could scarcely see your file leader We came up to the
                                    rest of our Brigade & camped on each side of the road. The 25th marched at
                                    daylight, our Company was rear guard, & we were bothered greatly with the
                                    wagons on starting. About 3 P.M. we reached the North fork Ky
                                    river where we found one of our Reg & the 14th Ky camped in its
                                    bed. Here we had to wait until all the train passed. We had an immence hill to climb
                                    on the opposite side & the sand was very deep, which made very hard pulling.
                                    The men had to shove the nearly empty wagon all the way up. It was
                                    long after dark before we moved on. We had to climb the hill or Mt single file to
                                    keep out of the way of the wagons. This was very tiresome, & took a long
                                    time. We then marched 6 miles down a gradual slope without one halt, & when
                                    we saw the camp fires away below us, the men cheered & yelled, although they
                                    were completely tired out & hundreds lay along the road in the fence
                                    corners. Why Colonels will march their men so I cant tell. They ride & carry
                                    nothing we walk & carry all. We received orders on marching into camp to be
                                    ready to march at 3 A M Now the same old tune commenced. We had every thing to
                                    prepare for next day. No rations were given us. Fences were torn down, fires built,
                                    chickens squalled, geese squaked, pigs squealed, & Arm
                                    Strong mills were running furiously all through camp.
                        Friday 26th. Started at daylight report came that the enemy were a head 5000 strong.
                                    But we reached Hazle green77 12 miles on red river at dark with
                                    out molestation. Decorsey

                                     & Spears78 were
                                    allready in camp. Since we left the Ky River we have struck the
                                    ridges, & have one or two very high long bad hills to cross every day. Hazle
                                    Green is a dirty little town at a cross roads.
                        Saturday 27th drew a tin of flour to the man. Marched through town, with our Brass
                                    band playing. Our Reg is in the rear of our Brigade today & has to help up
                                    the wagons. Scouts brought word in that the Rebles had killed 2 or 8 of Decorcies
                                    men & had taken all of our cattle, & the Gen thought we would be
                                    attacked. the train was all run in close together in a little meadow, & we
                                    were ordered up double quick, the road was 2 or 3 inches in dust, but we trotted it
                                    through a mile & formed a line of battle without once thinking of our hap
                                    sacks. The train now came up & was marched through about 5 miles strongly
                                    guarded by Regt on each side in rear & front, until we were out of all
                                    danger.
                        At noon our Company was put in advance of the train, as advance guard. At dark we
                                    were with in 4 miles of West Liberty & the citizens told us that Decorcy was
                                    fighting at the town, & soon we could hear the booming of our canon. But as
                                    usual it was only shelling the woods. Got into camp at 12 M
                                    & slept along each side of the road.
                        Sunday 28th Laid over today. Had nothing to eat & the boys commenced killing
                                    hogs at day light. We are right in a secesh County & the boys say the hogs
                                    wont take the oath. West Liberty is the county seat, but the
                                    people have nearly all left.
                        Monday 29th Were called up at 2 A M & ordered to march at 4, but the trains
                                    & artilery were so long geting started that it was near 7 before we got
                                    fairly stretched out. Felt fine for marching after a days rest, & made 15
                                    miles. We are now on what is call the open fork of Sandy.80 They
                                    say we will get to the Ohio River in 4 days.
                        Tuesday 30th Marched out at 4 A.M. in about 3 miles, overtook Carter80 cuting out the blockade. Ours & Carters' Brigades were
                                    ordered ahead on an other road about 3 miles where a lot of Secesh were camped on a
                                    bluff. We drew up 
                              
                                 78 Brigadier General James G. Spears, commanding,

                                            .
                           
                                     in line of battle & shelled the woods,
                                    then climbed the hill over the bluff & scoured it completely. But nary Reble could be found. We then marched across over the hill to
                                    the main road It was now after noon & we had made but 5 miles from camp. We
                                    had a very hill [high?] hill to cross that day & made 17 miles, camped at 12
                                    M in an old orchard where there was no water.
                        Wednesday Oct 1st Started early, but the road was so blockaded that by noon we had
                                    got but a mile or so, here we struck a queer sort of a chanel. It seemed that some
                                    great stream of water had one day rushed through the hill & left a chanel
                                    from 50 to a hundred yards wide, with perpendicular rock on each side. this rock was
                                    full of holes & caves, & hung over forming complete shelters,
                                    & large trees grew right out on the edge of the overhanging rocks, here one
                                    of our men belonging to Co. D. died & was buried in a beautiful grassy spot
                                    under these high rocks. We marched this day but about 6 miles & camped on
                                    little Sandy. A gun was accidentaly discharged today in the 3rd Ky Reg. &
                                    shot a Corporel & a Lieut. the Corporel was shot through the body &
                                    died in a short time, the Lieut leg was shatttered & had to be immediately
                                    taken off.
                        Thursday Oct 2nd Grayson is but 10 miles a head, the place we have been traveling
                                    for, for days & seem to get no nearer to. But at about 2 P.M. we passed the
                                    town, & camped about 3 miles this side on little Sandy. It is but 23 miles
                                    to the Ohio River & the boys although worn out with
                                    forced marches talk more cheeringly, & it seems that they smell free soil, & it enlivens them up as the oxen smell the water 20
                                    miles off when crossing the plaines. We used our old gritters to-night we hope for
                                    the last time
                        Friday Oct 3rd. Made a very early start, & marched rapidly. It commenced
                                    raining about 9, & rained hard for about 2 hours. But as the road was all
                                    sand, right along the bank of little sandy it soon dried up & made splendid
                                    marching. We began to find Union people all along the road, & they had given
                                    away every thing to the troops that passed before us. We marched into
                                        Greenupsburg81 at 10 P.M. The boys cheering at the thought
                                    of once more seeing free soil. Very few stopped for supper, but rolled up in our
                                    blankets & were soon a sleep.

                        Saturday Oct 4th The boys are strolling the town like so many Boon Countyans. The
                                    river is full. The boys are washing all the 
                                        Tennessee
                                     & Ky soil off of them. The canons & teams are fording
                                    it is an amusing sight. One Regt had waded.82 rather a new thing
                                    to wade the Ohio River at this point. We drew crackers to day,
                                    only half rations. The boys are buying flour & having it baked.
                        Sunday Oct 5th Crossed the river this morning in a small steam ferry, & had
                                    to wade nearly a hundred yards on this side. My shoes got knocked off, & I
                                    had to take it barefoot. I marched so about 6 miles. My feet were begining to get
                                    very sore. One of the boys let me have his shoes & I made the trip fine. The
                                    people along the road came out & met us with buckets of water &
                                    smiling faces. This made us feel good, & more than once loud cheers went up
                                    for the red, white & blue that was waved by some fare hand.
                        At Wheelersburg83 the hole Division was fed, the 2nd time we have
                                    ever had any thing given to us since we started out. We got into Sciotoville at dark
                                    where we were to take the cars. When we crossed the railroad there was nothing but a
                                    confused yell, for it was the first we had seen in 6 months.
                        Monday 6th. Waited all day for the cars to take us to 
                                        Portland
                                    .84 Our boys took advantage of the time &
                                    all got tight. That is 8 or 10. It was about 4 P.M. when we got off, &
                                    arrived in 
                                        Portland
                                     about 9, where I found Mrs Coburn, & Ovid Butler85 & Frank McCready. We camped 4 miles from town. On Wednesday
                                    evening Col C told me there was some one up where his wife was boarding close to
                                    camp that wanted to see me, & who should I find but Lucy. This was a happy
                                    night to me. I was very anxious to see her.
                        Sunday 12th I have spend a very pleasant week although it has been raining most of
                                    the time. I have spent most all the time with Lucy. She starts home in the morning I
                                    am sorry to have her go. Our camp is in a very bad place for rainey weather. But we
                                    have straw & rail sheds which keep us quite warm & dry. We expect to
                                    have tents & clothing soon. It is geting quite cool & we need the
                                    clothing much.

               American Diplomacy in the Great Depression: Hoover-Stimson Foreign Policy,
                    1929-1933. By Robert H. Ferrell. Yale Historical Publications, Studies 17. (
                        New Haven
                    : Yale University Press, 1957. Pp. ix, 319. $4.60.)
            No one would contend that the period 1929-1933 marked any decisive turning point in the history of
                    American foreign policy, like the period 1914-1919, say, or 1939-1945. And yet the decisions that
                    President Herbert Hoover and his Secretary of State, Henry L. Stimson, made and the policies that
                    they implemented did in some measure affect the disintegration of the world order that was then in
                    progress and would soon culminate in the tragic events of the late 1930's. In this
                    thoughtfully conceived and brilliantly written study the author, an assistant professor of history
                    at Indiana University, has told how and why all this happened.
            The author has organized his narrative around the major events in American foreign policy during the
                    Hoover administration. His accounts of the 
                        London
                     Naval Conference of 1930, the Manchurian crisis, the Shanghai incident, the World
                    Disarmament Conference, the emergence of a new Latin American policy, and the World Economic
                    Conference are all quite full and satisfying. The story of these events was already a familiar one,
                    and the author has not added anything particularly new to our knowledge about the main outlines.
            Having said this, one should hasten to add that this book is a notable achievement and a significant
                    contribution to the literature of recent American history. For one thing Professor Ferrell has
                    brought all the fragments together and constructed the whole story, in all its interrelated
                    complexity, for the first time. Moreover, he has done prodigious, even massive, research in the
                    personal papers of the American principals, in the American and Japanese archives, and in a variety
                    of other sources. The results are everywhere evident in this volume—in the richness and
                    newness of its detail, in the freshness of its approach, and, best of all, in the obvious
                    authenticity of the narrative.
            There is, moreover, new light here on the personalities and motivations of the men who guided the
                    American ship of state during the period 1929-1933. The portraits of Hoover, Stimson, William R.
                    Castle, Charles G. Dawes, and others that emerge from these pages are vivid, sympathetic yet
                    critical, and wonderfully revealing. They are portraits of men caught up in the greatest economic
                    cataclysm of modern times, struggling to apply outworn remedies to new situations, and failing nobly
                    on the whole. The portrait of Stimson that the author draws, incidentally, is perhaps the most
                    significant of all, for it tends to confirm the unfavorable one that Professor R. N. Current
                    depicted in Secretary Stimson, a Study in Statecraft. Not least among Professor
                    Ferrell's contributions is his bibliographical essay, which surveys the immense sources and
                    literature of his period with thoroughness and revealing commentary.
            
            
               American Diplomacy in the Great Depression is the kind of book that will evoke
                    admiration and considerable controversy at one and the same time. The controversy, it should be
                    said, will rise not over the author's excellent methods but over some of his
                    interpretations. To this reviewer, for example, it seems that he has given altogether too much
                    weight to the depression as the cause of the collapse of the international political order in the
                    early 1930's. No one would argue that the depression was not momentously significant; the
                    question is whether other factors were also of major importance. This reviewer would emphasize more
                    than Professor Ferrell did the isolationist traditions and ideals of the American people and
                    especially the essentially mediocre quality of the political leadership of the democracies during
                    this period. It is begging the point somewhat to say (as Professor Ferrell does) that Hoover,
                    Stimson, and others were able men. What the world needed desperately and did not have was great
                    leadership.
            Secondly, this reviewer has to enter a word of dissent about the way that the author deals with the
                    Manchurian crisis. His treatment of this matter is really quite excellent on the descriptive level,
                    but he fails to confront what is the most important question that can be asked about American policy
                    during this episode. It is whether Stimson's policy of setting the American government in
                    stern opposition to Japanese imperialism in Manchuria bore any substantial relation to the national
                    interests of the 
                        United States
                    . This reviewer is not here suggesting that this or that answer would be correct, only
                    that Professor Ferrell does not really grapple with the problem.
            These of course are matters of individual judgment, and such criticisms are quite unimportant in view
                    of the total achievement of this volume. Professor Ferrell's first study on the Kellogg
                    Pact revealed his ability at monographic writing. The present volume shows that he has mastered the
                    techniques of general writing. We con all look forward to his promised third volume on the foreign
                    policy of the first Roosevelt administration.

               A History of Presidential Elections. By Eugene H. Roseboom. (

            H. L. Mencken once described our presidential elections as quadrennial circuses, and on many
                    occasions the proceedings at the national conventions and the antics of campaigns would seem to
                    justify such a conclusion. Yet presidential elections are necessary in the functioning of our
                    Republic, and they are a vital part of our national history. Moreover, they have been a source of
                    wonder and mystery both to the politician and the scholar. For no one can be absolutely certain what
                    a national convention will do or what way the voters will turn, and likewise no one can be
                    absolutely certain why a candidate has won or lost. This element of uncertainty and guessing has
                    made Presidential elections an elusive and exciting game for everyone in the country.
            While there has been a profusion of literature about American politics—leaders, campaigns,
                    parties, theories, and so forth—little has  been
                    written in the way of a connected account about the struggles that take place every four years for
                    the presidency. Edward Stanwood's History of the Presidency, which comes
                    closest to this, is outdated and has little to say about the elections of the twentieth century.
                    Professor Roseboom's study fills the need of treating our presidential elections as
                    distinguishable and as important events in our national history. His objective is "to
                    present the essential facte about conventions, campaigns, and elections, briefly to assess the
                    effectiveness of Presidents and other important party figures as political leaders, to indicate the
                    more significant Congressional struggles of a political character, and to explain the trends of
                    politics in the social and economic settings of the different periods, with particular attention to
                    change."
            This was a formidable task, but Professor Roseboom has done very well indeed, and has produced a very
                    useful volume that will long serve the needs of all those interested in American politics. The book
                    is a convenient summary of the main developments of presidential politics, and in general it
                    reflects the latest and best scholarship on these matters. While the book is a popular account that
                    will have a greater interest and use for the general reader and for the undergraduate, it will be a
                    handy reference for the serious student of American politics, Everyone will enjoy the lively manner
                    in which it has been written, and everyone can profit from the selective bibliography that Professor
                    Roseboom has prepared.
            The problem of emphasis and selection was a very difficult one in writing this book, and Professor
                    Roseboom anticipated criticism on this point. Overall he has done very well in solving this problem,
                    but the book might have been even more useful had he given greater attention and care to the really
                    significant and meaningful elections like those of 1800, 1828, 1860, 1912, and 1932. In all of these
                    there was a meaningful division of the parties, and the voters were presented with fundamental
                    differences in political issues and questions. The treatment of these elections in the same way as
                    the other elections is one shortcoming of this book.

            The title for the centennial edition of the 
                        Lincoln
                    -Douglas debates, Created Equal, is timely indeed. It immediately
                    brings into focus the position of the Negro in 1958 as well as 1858. Mr. Paul Angle, who edited the
                    volume, feels the arguments of the debaters evolved around three questions: the extension of
                    slavery, the status of the Negro, and the rights of the states to regulate the Negro's
                    status as they saw fit. However, one must admit that all three of the subjects have a common
                    denominator, which is the Negro.
            
            The wordage of the seven formal debates follows the version in the Collected Works of
                        Abraham 
                            Lincoln
                        
               , edited by Paul M. Angle, which gives what may be termed the authoritative
                    text a much wider circulation. A thirty-two page introduction furnishes background data, and to
                    further orient the reader in the debates as a whole Angle has included: the speech made by 
                        Lincoln
                     at 
                        Springfield
                     on June sixteenth, the speeches of both 
                        Lincoln
                     and Douglas at 
                        Chicago
                     on July ninth and tenth respectively, and the addresses of both men at 
                        Springfield
                     on the same day, July seventeenth, Douglas in the afternoon and 
                        Lincoln
                     in the evening. The preliminaries leading up to the debates and also observations by
                    the press at each meeting are presented.
            The reviewer at one time made a synopsis outline of the arguments in each of the seven debates and he
                    was struck by the constant repetition. Angle in the preface of his book states, "In the
                    debates there was much repetition,'' and again concludes, "Douglas
                    covered much the same ground" as he had on a previous occasion. In this day when
                    condensation in literature is so popular it is to be regretted that we do not have the repeats
                    expurgated and a summary of what each debater had to say on these and other pertinent subjects which
                    were under discussion: Compromise Measures, Dred Scott, Extension of Slavery, House Divided,
                            
                  Kansas-Nebraska
               , Moral Issue, Popular Sovereignty, Pro-Slavery Conspiracy,
                    Racial Equality, Sectional Party. This would allow the reader to survey all the evidence on any one
                    subject which would help to answer the question raised by Angle, "Who
                    ‘Won’ the Debates?"
            The fact that 
                        Lincoln
                     instead of Douglas was anxious to spread the argument before the people in printed
                    form; the fact that the people through the ballot gave 
                        Lincoln
                     the majority of the popular vote; and that he ultimately gained the presidency-all
                    would be considerations when the round by round points are recorded in an analysis of the results.

               The Plantation South. By Katherine M. Jones. (
                        Indianapolis
                    : The Bobbs-Merrill Company, 1957. Pp. xv, 412. Illustrations. $5.00.)
            It is now almost axiomatic to speak of the diversity in the South, of the vast differences in the
                    dialects, the regions, and the peoples of the section, even in the pre-Civil War era. Miss
                    Jones's selections from the diaries, journals, and letters of the residents of and visitors
                    to those "Souths" is again a sharp reminder of this fact. For here in an endeavor
                    to recapture only a segment of the pre-war South, the Plantation South, the variety within the area
                    is more noticeable than the similarity. In a limited way the author seems to recognize this
                    variegation by dividing her book into three main parts, one each for the tobacco, rice, and cotton
                    South. Although a convenient arrangement, it is nonetheless a somewhat artificial one. While there
                    were distinctions between the rice planter of the 
                        South Carolina
                     coastal lands and the tobacco farmer of the 
                        Kentucky
                     Bluegrass, the difference in gee  graphical
                    location and agricultural pursuit was not the only basis for differentiation. Other factors were
                    important: the generation to which an individual belonged, the political arrangements and
                    leadership, and the blend of memory and habit that established a local tradition. None of these can
                    be overlooked. These additional features are also illustrated in the passages of Miss
                    Jones's anthology, but the reader must look for them and not allow the author's
                    neat organization to form the pattern of his thinking.
            Although confirming that not even the Plantation South was of one mind, the book also illustrates
                    another common notion concerning the ante-bellum South—that the force
                    giving it unity from diversity, oneness from many, was the institution of Negro slavery. Whether he
                    was from the 
                        Virginia
                     Tidewater or the rich cotton lands of the Mississippi valley the
                    Southern planter was (almost without exception) determined in the defense of an institution upon
                    which, so he felt, his economic survival and way of life ultimately rested. Views of slavery and
                    treatment of slaves might vary from region to region or even from plantation to plantation, but the
                    general objective of the Southern slave owner was the maintenance of the South's peculiar
                    institution. Even though he might object to the system in principle, the individual planter saw no
                    easy solution to the many problems of emancipation and thus suffered the continuance of an
                    institution that the world had outgrown.
            Slavery was the topic of interest pervading the entire area. The question of slaves and slavery
                    occupied considerable space in the writings of the pre-war Southerner, at least in the writings
                    chosen by Miss Jones. Practically all of the selections discuss it in one fashion or another.
                    Sometimes there is only a prosaic schedule of the daily tasks of the slaves (pp. 245-255), at other
                    times there is a philosophical reflection concerning the effects of the institution on the South and
                    its people (p. 174), but at all times it was a matter of serious concern. Slavery was also of
                    foremost interest to travelers in the South. The appraisals of many were reasonably accurate and
                    fair-minded, while others allowed a dislike of the institution to color their judgment of its actual
                    practice. Almost everyone mentioned it and felt that somehow it accounted for the South's
                    distinctive characteristics.
            The book contains little that is new in the way of ideas, but it does offer evidence for many of the
                    old ones. Naturally the selections are limited in that they deal with only one phase of the pre-war
                    South, the plantation, but after all that is the author's purpose. As a slice of plantation
                    life in the Old South the selections are representative. The anthology covers a wide range including
                    all aspects of the plantation from labor management to entertainment to weddings and honeymoons.
                    There are excerpts from old standbys (such as Frederick Law Olmsted and Frances Kemble) and more
                    obscure sources. Occasionally one feels that too little attention is devoted to the critics of the
                    plantation regime. The brief but enlightening introductions that Miss Jones provides for each
                    selection are extremely helpful and contribute significantly to the worth of the book.

            Strange as it may seem, bibliographers have neglected the significant field of 
                        United States
                     government publications during the formative period of the Union. In contrast to the
                    many valuable catalogues identifying and classifying other kinds of printed materials, the guides to
                    the early public documents of this nation are not, in any sense, definitive. The author of these
                    essays, John H. Powell, a competent historian-librarian, examines the existing state of knowledge
                    concerning American legislative journals, declarations, statutes, and reports for the years
                    1774-1814. The standard references, Joseph Sabin, Charles Evans, Adolphus W. Greeley, Paul L. and
                    Worthington C. Ford, Benjamin Perley Poore, the Checklist of 1911, all are found
                    to be incomplete and too often inaccurate. This little book, setting down Mr. Powell's
                    Rosenbach lectures at the University of 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , is not itself a bibliography, but it learnedly discusses the problem and points the
                    way for further work in the future.
            The first publication of the Continental Congress, Mr. Powell says, was the Association in 1774, calling for American non-importation and non-exportation in trade with
                    the mother country. Another interesting and influential document of the time was the Rules and Articles for the Better Government of the Troops. Of course, the Declaration of
                    Independence was a very important publication and is here expertly analyzed from the bibliographical
                    point of view. The author agrees with Hazelton and with Boyd that the Declaration was probably not
                    signed on July 4, though he admits that the known evidence is not conclusive. He proceeds to the
                    early national period where recently available records of the Congress are extensively used to show
                    the development of a system in governmental publishing. Since almost all public documents were
                    printed by Congressional order, the rolee of the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate
                    were central. Samuel A. Otis, serving in the latter office for many years, established a mode of
                    operations that was both efficient and enduring.
            Pleasingly written and well supported by research, this volume will interest librarians and
                    historians. It is hoped that an enterprising librarian, perhaps Mr. Powell himself, will be
                    stimulated to compile the bibliography which is now lacking. And it is certain that the historian
                    will benefit by Mr. Powell's caveat with respect to the older aids now on
                    the shelves.

               Farm Crisis, 1919-1923. By James H. Shideler. (Berkeley: University of 
                        California
                     Press, 1957. Pp. x, 345. Notes, index. $5.00.)
            This book describes the period of greatest agrarian discontent between the Progressive movement and
                    the depression of 1929. The four years after World War I, so ably described by Professor Shideler.
                    were  a time of falling farm prices. Between June, 1920, and
                    May, 1921, agricultural prices fell to one-third of their former value and farmers sustained an
                    estimated net loss of $6,225,000,000. At first the farmers blamed their troubles on the
                    Federal Reserve Board plus the usual group: railroads, grain elevators, meat packers, and commodity
                    exchanges. Solutions were sought both through the government and through self organization. Demand
                    for governmental help by the Farm Bureau and other farm organizations for higher tariffs, prevention
                    of foreign imports, and better credit facilities led to a meeting of six 
                        Iowa
                     congressmen in the office of Senator William S. Kenyon on November 13, 1920. This
                    meeting formed the beginning of the Farm Bloc in Congress, a group which eventually pushed through
                    higher tariffs, farm loan acts, regulation of stockyards and packers, exemption of farmers'
                    cooperatives from the anti-trust act, and better warehousing legislation. Other farmers favored self
                    help and pushed cooperative marketing ventures of all types, the most important of which was the
                    Sapiro plan in 
                        California
                    . These marketing ideas satisfied the Republican administration much better than
                    governmental intervention of any kind.
            Harding's Secretary of Agriculture, Henry C. Wallace, was sincerely interested in helping
                    the farmers. He organized a strong department, improved the annual year book, developed crop and
                    market reporting services, and created the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. These developments soon
                    brought him into conflict with Herbert Hoover's Department of Commerce. Hoover also was an
                    empire builder and, through his interest in food control in the first World War, wanted foreign and
                    domestic marketing of agricultural products included in his department. Wallace had just as much
                    influence with Harding as did Hoover, but the Secretary of Commerce became more important when
                    Coolidge succeeded to the presidency.
            In 1922 farmers in many states defeated administration candidates for office and by this action
                    encouraged the formation of the LaFollette Progressive party of 1924. The years 1919-1923 saw the
                    development of the McNary-Haugen plan, later passed by Congress and vetoed by Coolidge, of the Farm
                    Board idea used by Hoover, and of the parity price proposal adopted by Franklin Roosevelt. The
                    details of these plans and ideas and how they waxed and waned among the various farm groups and in 
                        Washington

            Farm leaders who participated in these events should be encouraged to read this book and to comment
                    on the accuracy of its facts and its implications, so that pertinent information can be added to
                    that already known. Another book should trace the agricultural discontent during the Coolidge and
                    Hoover administrations. Unfortunately Shideler's volume has no formal bibliography of the
                    books used; hence the reader is forced to rely entirely on the footnotes for this information.

            The territory covered in this study stretches from Upper Silesia to the English Channel and North
                    Sea, but omits the British Isles, partly because they have been intensively studied by their own
                    scholars. The time span is from the early eighteenth century to 1956, thereby including the early
                    years of the European Coal and Steel Community. The tale is told up to 1913 by Professor Pounds, a
                    geographer well versed in coal and iron geology, technology, and history, and author of a noteworthy
                    volume on the Ruhr; then carried on, with some inevitable overlap, by Professor Parker, an economist
                    and economic historian who has served various government agencies concerned with the German economy
                    since 1945.
            Professor Pounds devotes about eighty pages (Part I) to the eighteenth century "Origins of
                    the Modern Industry," then 140 pages (Part 11) to the vast nineteenth century
                    "Transformation and Growth" in production of coal, iron, and steel. The research
                    has been far flung; the technical, economic, and legal factors are adequately
                    emphasized—the geological too much so; but the presentation is rather dreary. Each
                    coalfield and each iron-producing region in each country is surveyed for the eighteenth century,
                    then done all over again for the nineteenth. The result is often like reading a gazetteer. Some
                    facts and names are repeated, as when Freiherr vom Stein turns up five times without much addition
                    to our knowledge of what he did. Some places are hard to find on any of the numerous maps, and hard
                    to read (e.g., p. 82). The statement about the "spread of the [French] railway
                    net" between 1830-1850 (pp. 140-141) is not supported by the footnote reference or by any
                    other writer on French railroad history. The relative importance attributed to the Ruhr coal output
                    on pages 220 and 242 differs markedly from that indicated in the graph on page 213. And the word
                    "insignificant" in the middle of page 52 needs to be deprived of its first
                    syllable.
            Professor Parker's assignment is much simpler and he does it much more readably. The period
                    of rapid expansion, technical change, and regional concentration came to a sudden close with World
                    War I. Henceforth production moved "from catastrophe to climax in three successive waves
                    during the two world wars and the intervening Great Depression" (p. 250). There were no
                    great basic technical improvements or discoveries of new mineral resources to permit lower costs.
                    Demand fluctuated violently, with little upward trend. Integration and cartels could not provide
                    stability and security, much less revive the dearly desired former pace of growth. At best
                    "the long run situation was one of gradual expansion" (p. 345), but political
                    events bedevilled that situation. Whether the Coal and Steel Community can exorcise the devil
                    Professor Parker admits it is still too early to guess. He devotes only seventeen pages to the
                    Community's origin, plan, and "opportunity," and emerges with his fingers
                    crossed. He hopes that "liberal-minded" men and governments will continue to hold
                    the reins  of power, and is cheered by the "upsurge of
                    coal and steel production in all the major European regions in 1955 and 1956" (p. 364). But
                    will the figures of 1958 tell another tale in Europe, as in America?

            This volume is based principally on letters exchanged between Brigadier General Josiah Harmar,
                    commanding 
                        United States
                     troops on the 
                        Ohio
                    , and his subordinate, Major John Francis Hamtramck. These and other letters and
                    documents used were selected from the Harmar papers in the William L. Clements Library of the
                    University of 
                        Michigan
                    .
            Harmar was ordered by the Secretary at War, 
                        Henry
                        Knox
                    , in April, 1787, to "dispossess" a group of men "who have
                    taken possession of post St. Vincents [
                        Vincennes
                    ] in defiance of the proclamation and authority of the 
                        United States
                    " (p. 7). 
                        Vincennes
                     then had a population of 520 French and 103 American males. Most of the Americans were
                    unprincipled men who took land illegally, mistreated the Indians, and caused trouble between the
                    French and Indians. 
                        Kentucky
                     militiamen often took matters into their own hands and conducted unauthorized and
                    usually fruitless expeditions against the Indians.
            To bring order out of chaos-a rather vain hope considering the weakness of Congress—Harmar
                    established a garrison at 
                        Vincennes
                     under Major Hamtramck, an officer particularly fitted for the post because of his
                    French Canadian background and his Catholic faith. At Fort Knox, as the garrison came to be called,
                    Hamtramck spent six miserable years, 1787-1793.
            Hamtramck's letters relate innumerable hardships-sickness, food shortages, murderous Indian
                    raids, British and Spanish intrigues, arrears in pay, and countless others. Harmar does his best to
                    send supplies, first from Fort Harmar, then from Fort 
                        Washington
                    , but it is a losing battle and nothing really effective is done against the Indians
                    until

            Miss Thornbrough's editorial work is to be commended highly. An excellent introduction shows
                    how the situation at 
                        Vincennes
                     was affected by local, national, and international factors. A detailed plan of Fort
                    Knox and a map of the western country are included. Almost all persons mentioned in the letters are
                    identified in footnotes, but perhaps there should have been more attention to terms such as
                    "livers" (livres, p. 74), "Belle Reiver"
                        (Ohio River, p. 129), and "Riviere a 1'Anguille"
                        (Eel River, p. 170). Also, 
                        New Hampshire
                     was the ninth state to ratify the Constitution, not the tenth (p. 100). Everything
                    considered, this book is a significant contribution to the history of the early Old Northwest.

            Dr. Tippy, director of the Archives of DePauw university and Indiana Methodism and former pastor of
                    Christ Church (Methodist) in 
                        New York
                     City, has given in this slender volume an interesting and able portrayal of
                    "the life and times of Robert Richford Roberts, 1778-1843."
            He has given more of the life than of the times actually. If the book has any single deficiency, the
                    blame lies not with the author but with the paucity of materials from which he has worked. Direct
                    biographical data in any considerable corpus are limited to a statement dictated by Bishop Roberts
                    while sitting for a portrait painted at Indiana Asbury University (now DePauw). Combined with
                    scattered reminiscences of those who knew the bishop, a few sermon fragments, and some records of
                    the Methodist Conferences over which he presided, the primary sources still have a gaunt, underfed
                    appearance. One has the impression that Dr. Tippy has had to pad his narrative in order to
                    compensate for this defect.
            But the padding, while historically risky, arises from sound intuition. For Bishop Roberts's
                    significance to nineteenth century Methodism and to frontier Indiana is unquestionably bulkier than
                    the record which he and others failed to leave. Born in 
                        Maryland
                    , coming to 
                        Pennsylvania
                     as a boy, rising from reticent obscurity to reluctant eminence in the church, settling
                    in Indiana in 1819, traveling throughout the church (a duty which has apparently always been laid
                    upon bishops), giving much energy to the founding and proportionate substance to the strengthening
                    of Indiana Asbury, preaching effectively but undramatically-all resulted in a quiet, compelling
                    piety and in a broad, refined statesmanship which places him among the primary if lesser known
                    figures of the Midwest and of the Methodist Church.
            Indiana readers will be especially attracted by the Hoosier geographical and historical backgrounds
                    in this very human portrait. Indiana University readers will be interested in the author's
                    chapter on the controversy between early Methodists and the officials of the state university,
                    leading ultimately to the founding of DePauw, although this chapter contains no new details.
            The book is unfortunately marred by several typographical errors.
            The style is facile but not flowery, the scholarship accurate but not pedantic. Withal, Frontier
                    Bishop is a worthwhile footnote on a little known chapter in nineteenth century Indiana-Methodist
                    history and an affectionate tribute to an effective clergyman.

               History of the North Indiana Conference, 1917-1956. By Frederick A. Norwood.
                    (North Indiana Conference Historical Society, 1967. Pp. 331. Illustrations, graphs, appendices,
                    index.)
            During the last five years histories have been published concerning all three Indiana conferences of
                    the Methodist Church: Jack J. Detzler's History of the Northwest Conference of
                        the Methodist Church (1953);  Herbert L.
                    Heller's Indiana Conference of the Methodist Church, 1892-1956 (1956);
                    and the present volume, a sequel to A History of the North Indiana Conference of the
                        Methodist Episcopal Church from Its Organization in 1844 to the Present, written in 1917 by
                    H. N. Herrick and William W. Sweet.
            After a quick resume of Indiana Methodism in the nineteenth century, Dr. Norwood plunges into the
                    principal developments and highlights of Methodism in the North Indiana Conference during the
                    twentieth century. Buildings and finances, conferences and other meetings, and homes for children
                    and the aged are given attention. But emphasis is also placed on Christian education, lay Methodism,
                    social problems and concerns, preaching and evangelism, and the missionary work of Methodists in the
                    North Indiana Conference. Now and then the author indicates that the Methodists of this Conference
                    have generally been conservative regarding innovations, yet he offers much evidence that nonetheless
                    significant changes have taken place.
            Dr. Norwood's account is readable and well grounded regarding the main currents of
                    Methodism. Certain parts, however, are the result of composite research and writing and these parts
                    are of uneven value. Appendices list superintendents, ministerial appointments, ordinations,
                    retirements, lay readers, etc. Hundreds of small individual pictures are included. In short, this
                    book has a number of built-in sales features. Even so, the pictures, lists, and the like have value
                    as historical compilations.
            Though the addiction of numerous Methodists to the infamous Ku Klux Klan of the 1920's is
                    rightfully condemned, the Methodists in this book are not quite real persons. They get along
                    remarkably well together and exhibit few outcroppings of original sin. The men and women here
                    portrayed have a bit of gloss which prevents this history from being aa impartial and accurate as it
                    might otherwise have been. Moreover, one gains the impression that perhaps this problem bothered Dr.
                    Norwood as he wrote this volume.

            The problem of dealing with convicted criminals has long been of concern to society. In spite of
                    intensive attention to this problem, to date comparatively little progress has been made in finding
                    solutions. The Prison at 
                            Philadelphia
                        
                makes the following important contributions to our thinking on this: 1) It
                    rounds out and adds considerably to the historical analysis of the very important phase of American
                    penology which is usually referred to 88 the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     system. Since the scope of the book is limited to the description and analysis of the
                    Cherry Hill Prison between 1829 and 1913, it was  possible for
                    the authors to go into considerable detail and to provide the reader with a solid foundation for his
                    own evaluation of this experiment. This is particularly important since frequently the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     system has been described only superficially and in that process some of the essential
                    features of the system have been overlooked or misinterpreted. 2) The Prison at 
                            Philadelphia
                        
                also indicates some of the factors which make progress in this field so
                    difficult. It makes it clear that in the past ideas in the field of penology were not evaluated on
                    their merits but were quickly engulfed by a host of other considerations, such as political,
                    economic, religious, and emotional. Current studies in crime and penology have shown that many
                    important human motivations are involved on all levels of consideration of crime.
            By showing the complexity of motivations which on the one hand led to the development of the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     system, its execution and its defense, and on the other hand to criticisms of the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     system and the espousal of the so-called 
                        Auburn
                     system, the book shows clearly the difficulty of dealing with this issue on an
                    unemotional basis. In doing this the authors show the need for scientific research in the field of
                    penology. This case study of the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     system also demonstrates clearly that every phase of penology requires careful and
                    constant attention, from the physical structure of prisons to the training and supervision of every
                    guard. The effectiveness of the most carefully considered general plan can be destroyed if the
                    entire system is not carefully coordinated. To this reviewer this point is the most significant
                    contribution of the book.
            The book is well written. Its style and treatment of the subject matter should appeal to everybody
                    interested in these problems, regardless of the reader's background. While the book is
                    written for the student of penology, it does not assume knowledge of any of the background data but
                    is complete in itself as far as this phase of American penology is concerned.

               Let There Be Light: The Electric Utility Industry in 
                            Wisconsin
                        , 1881-1955. By Forrest McDonald. (

                    $5.95.)
            
               Let There Be Light is a comprehensive account of the birth and development of 
                        Wisconsin
                    's electric utility industry, with occasional glances at the national scene. At
                    appropriate points the author breaks the narrative to explore the complexities of volts, amperes,
                    hydroelectric dams, and holding companies. The illuminating discussion of difficult scientific and
                    financial concepts which often elude the layman is one of the strongest features of the book.
            The organization of his material reflects Mr. McDonald's fidelity to the inductive method.
                    He has treated the origins and early history of electric utilities in practically all of 
                        Wisconsin
                    's municipalities as a prelude to generalizations about state-wide
                    developments. In the  process, he has assembled a prodigious
                    number of facts about the vicissitudes of short-lived, local utility corporations. He includes
                    information about traction, hydro-electric, and central station enterprises, and their relationship.
                    The reader is led through a maze of corporation failures, mergers, and reorganizations. Mr. McDonald
                    makes a conscientious effort to draw meaningful conclusions from this bewildering array of facts. He
                    succeeds rather well, but only the most determined reader can proceed through the vast stretches of
                    municipal history which separate summary paragraphs without losing the thread.
            As long as the author concentrates on the scientific and financial aspects of the history of electric
                    utilities, he deserves unqualified admiration. When he examines the interaction between utilities
                    and political movements, he is less persuasive. His sympathy is with the utility companies in every
                    controversy. Readers are prepared for this viewpoint in the preface which postulates the futility of
                    all attempts to understand the action of a group "in terms of any set of standards but
                    their own." The author's philosophy of history thus commits him to view the
                    utilities only from their own standpoint. He performs a valuable service by correcting the biases of
                    New DeaI historians who were excessively critical of business. Yet it is difficult to accept such a
                    lofty estimate of the motives and behavior of electric utility executives as that which appears on
                    page 200. It is equally difficult to digest the implication that politicians exist primarily to
                    torment businessmen.
            The author might have achieved a more balanced perspective had he devoted space to personalities, but
                    his pioneers and promoters are consigned to the background. They function only as the instruments of
                    economic forces, and never achieve autonomy as men with fears, appetites, and emotions. Fortunately,
                    history thrives on controversy, and Mr. McDonald has given historians plenty to think about.

               Soldiers of the States: The Rob of the National Guard in American Democracy. By
                    William H. Riker. (
                        Washington
                    : Public Affairs Press, 1957. Pp. 129. Index. $3.25.)
            Although this book is a history of the militia of the 
                        United States
                    , or of the National Guard as it is now known, it is also a study in American
                    federalism. In beginning his initial chapter Professor Riker points out that "each unit of
                    the Guard is responsible to two distinct governments and serves both alternately. Each unit receives
                    financial support from two distinct appropriations recommended by two distinct chief executives and
                    passed by two distinct legislatures. In consequence, each unit of the Guard has, presumably, two
                    distinct loyalties at the same time. This form of organization is in sharp contrast to a fundamental
                    principle of military theory that a force ought to have one and only one commander." In one
                    sense this volume uses the militia or National Guard as the basis for a case study in federalism.
            After reminding readers that the colonial militia constituted an important part of the Revolutionary
                    army and after an attempt to  define or at least describe
                    federalism, Professor Riker discusses the origin of the sections concerning the militia in the
                    Constitution of 1787. Compromise was writ large here too! Soon came the Second Amendment which
                    further anchored the militia in federalism. Then the Militia Act of 1792 which established the
                    principle that all free white male citizens between 18 and 45 years of age were subject to militia
                    duty. This was "the seventeenth and eighteenth century version of universal military
                    training" (p. 21). By the middle of the nineteenth century, however, "the states
                    had, through incompetence and inaction, utterly abandoned" (p. 21) this principle. But in
                    80 doing they invented the volunteer militia system as the forerunner of the
                    National Guard.
            The militia, organized as intended by the founding fathers, was used in the War of 1812 and in
                    various Indian wars. It was only slightly used in the Mexican War and virtually not at all in the
                    Civil War and the Spanish War; these wars were fought mainly by volunteer militia. Meanwhile, as the
                    National Guard evolved out of the volunteer militia it become a sizeable proportion of the troops
                    used in World War I, World War II, and the Korean War. Considerable attention is given to the
                    development of and recent problems regarding the National Guard. The use of the militia to control
                    or suppress strikes is also reviewed.
            Some minor errors here and there seem to be attributable to inadequate proofing. In addition, one
                    might question occasional items, both of fact and opinion, and the author may be a bit optimistic
                    about the continued vitality of American federalism. Nevertheless, here is the fruit of substantial
                    research in a concise and readable volume.

               The Gun That Shaped American Destiny. By Martin Rywell. (Harriman, Tenn.:
                    Pioneer Press, 1957. Pp. 156. Numerous illustrations, appendices. Paperbound, $3.95.)
            What was the gun that shaped the American destiny? After wondering whether any such claim could be
                    made for any single gun, this reviewer tried to guess what it would be before looking inside the
                    book. His first thought was that it must be the 
                        Kentucky
                     rifle. Surely a good case could be made for the old stand-by of the frontiersman, for
                    that rifle which, with the benefit of the greased patch, showed such superiority in the Revolution
                    in the hands of 
                        Morgan
                    's men. Or was it the Colt revolver, the weapon which had served so well in the 
                        Texas
                     Revolution and in the Mexican War? Was it the 
                        Spencer
                     rifle, the famed "seven-forked lightning" of the Civil War? Or was it
                    the Winchester, "the gun that won the West?" No, it was none of these. It was the
                    Sharps rifle and carbine which appeared in the 1850's and which had limited, though
                    significant, service in the Civil War.
            The author sketches the history of the Sharps in five very brief introductory chapters. In the second
                    of these, "The Sharps Gun in American History," he takes a few lines to mention
                    that the Sharps was used by emigrants moving westward, in the fighting in 
                        Kansas
                    , by John Brown, in the Civil War, and in buffalo hunting and railroad  building in the West, and that Custer's men did not have any
                    Sharps carbines for their "last stand." Demonstration of the significance of the
                    Sharps on all these occasions seems rather strained. It is difficult to believe that the fighting in 
                        Kansas
                    , or John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry, was much different because
                    the weapon in use happened to be the Sharps. Undoubtedly the Sharps performed well when it was used
                    in the Civil War, and it was a favorite of Berdan's Sharpshooters, but surely the Spencer
                    and Henry repeaters—of which there were two or three times as many used, and which
                    affected operations considerably in the last year of the war—were of greater
                    significance.
            The principal value of this book is in its 133-page appendix which is an interesting compilation of
                    drawings, ordnance reports, testimonials, reproductions of advertisements, and patents covering the
                    Sharps firearms and patents. One of the prize exhibits is a reproduction of the targets fired by
                    Lieutenant L. C. Bruce with which he won the world championship in 1877—fourteen
                    bullseyes out of fifteen shots at 800 yards, twelve out of fifteen at 900 yards, and thirteen out of
                    fifteen at 1,000 yards, for a total score of 219 out of a possible 226, with a Sharps Long Range
                    Rifle. Altogether the book will be of greater interest to a gun collector than to the general
                    history reader.

            Adena is the archaeological designation for one of the major prehistoric burial mound complexes found
                    in the middle and upper Ohio River Valley. These mounds, some of which contain
                    several thousand cubic yards of earth, usually cover human skeletal remains, more or less
                    elaborately constructed tombs of earth and logs, and distinctive artifacts made of stone, bone,
                    shell, and copper. Almost all the information for Adena has been obtained from mounds; therefore an
                    over-all picture of Adena culture is not available.
            In 1945 the University of 
                        Kentucky
                     published The Adena People by William S. Webb and Charles E. Snow. It
                    was a comprehensive summary in trait list form of the then available data for Adena. It also
                    included sections on the chronological position of the burial complex and its relationship to other
                    prehistoric materials in the New World.
            As a result of continued excavation, much new data have accumulated in the intervening twelve years.
                    The Adena People, No. 2, is intended to make these additions available in a form consistent with the
                    earlier work and, because it is a supplement, both volumes must be consulted if one wishes to obtain
                    a picture of Adena mound structure and content.
            Two problems ultimately faced in every archaeological publication are those of time and space. The
                    recent development of radiocarbon dating techniques has provided dates from five Adena mounds. The
                    earliest is about 800 B.C.; the most recent is approximately 800 A.D.  The authors believe that the earlier of the two will eventually be
                    extended backward in time. A time span of more than sixteen hundred years is a long one and poses
                    problems of culture process.
            Adena mounds are the earliest such structures in the Ohio valley and the older
                    publication had hypothesized a Middle American origin for them. A chapter in the recent volume
                    contributed by Charles E. Snow reaffirms this position. Not only does the basic Adena physical type
                    have Middle American relationships, but the same is said to be true for "many distinctive
                    and diagnostic cultural traits" (p. 60). However, the senior authors locate "the
                    major traits of Adena" in 
                        New York
                     as early as 2450 B.C. (p. 103). Without some clarification, this is confusing.
            Three Indiana archaeological sites are added to the Adena catalogue. The L. C. Lewis Stone Mound
                    (sic) in 
                        Shelby County
                     is clearly Adena and the Cato Site, 
                        Pike County
                    , exhibits several Adena traits. However, the reviewer disagrees with the inclusion of
                    the Burkam (sic) Stone Mounds, 
                        Dearborn County
                    , in this complex. Rather, recent evidence aligns them with a number of later sites,
                    both stone mounds and villages, found in southeastern Indiana, southern 
                        Ohio
                    , and northern 
                        Kentucky
                     and designated the Newton Focus.
            This publication is certain to stimulate comments from the professional archaeologist. The less
                    specialized reader will find the description of Adena burial practices of interest. Combined with
                    the earlier Adena People, it will remain a standard reference for one of the major
                    prehistoric occupations in the Ohio valley.

               Pictorial History of Protestantism. By Vergelius Ferm. (

                    : Philosophical Library, 1957. Pp. xi, 368. Illustrations. $10.00.)
            Because of the high cost of printing, relatively few histories today contain visual aids, despite the
                    fact that educators emphasize their value. Without such aids, one tends to imagine the geographical
                    location of place names and the physical features of persons and things, and the resulting images
                    are invariably inaccurate. To obtain correct images involves the process of erasing the incorrect
                    ones. For this reason, Vergelius Ferm's pictorial history of Protestantism fills an
                    important gap.
            It is the announced purpose of the author to use his selections of pictures to provide a clearer
                    conception of Protestantism "as a witness to something," but especially as
                    "a battle-name against unwholesome infringements (be they of creeds, councils, books,
                    catechisms, theology, ecclesiastical polity, confessions, heroes) against the onmoving forces of the
                    spirit of life itself" (p. xi). It is this interest which accounts for the large number of
                    pictures devoted to the struggle for religious liberty and to the consequent divisions within the
                    numerically great denominations as well as to the many lesser groups. The startling proliferation of
                    Protestantism is apparent particularly on the American scene. There are, for example, selections for
                    nine Lutheran bodies, three Presbyterian, three Baptist, and two Methodist, and also  for many small groups such as the Churches of God, Jehovah's
                    Witnesses, and the Pentecostal Holiness Church.
            The pictures and the accompanying text cover the history of Christian witness and protest from the
                    Council of Nicaea in 325 to the ecumenical movement of today. Because of the paucity of pictures for
                    the early centuries, they are uneven in kind, quality, and value. They include contemporary works
                    and imaginary reconstructions by later artists; old woodcuts and copper and steel engravings;
                    reproductions of seals, coats of arms, title pages of books, religious music, and city plans;
                    photographs of historical religious places, buildings, museum pieces, portraits, statues, and recent
                    religious leaders; and scenes from the Martin Luther film of the Lutheran Church Productions, Inc. A
                    few of the imaginary pictures are based on incorrect legend, such as the one showing Luther and his
                    family in front of a Christmas tree and another picturing Luther's meeting with Georg von
                    Frundsberg at the Diet of Worms. Taken as a whole, the selections are excellent, the reproductions
                    clear, and the author's comments helpful.

            It is perhaps as impossible to give a meaningful review of this volume in brief compass as it is to
                    picture all of America through carefully selected illustrations. Although hundreds of
                    pictures—many of them indeed beautiful and fascinating—are reproduced here,
                    the messages which pictures tell depend more upon what is in the mind and soul of the viewer than on
                    the pictures themselves. Possibly those who know America best, both her heritage and her grandeur,
                    will appreciate this volume more than those who are unfamiliar with her heritage, her historical
                    places and landscapes.
            The commentary is very readable and exhibits a good understanding of America's historical
                    development. Pictures of homes, places, and persons are included from all regions of the country and
                    from all of the forty-eight states. But the overall view is not always balanced. There is included
                    more of beauty than of sordidness and the illustrations are more inclusive for some than for other
                    facets of American life. Nevertheless, here is a selection of pictures well worthy of careful and
                    repeated observation. The illustrations are principally drawn from the eighteenth and nineteenth
                    centuries.
            Some will likely consider this volume a bit heavy with sentimental and patriotic nuances. It would,
                    however, be impossible accurately to portray American life, especially in the nineteenth century,
                    without such nuances. They, too, are a part of the American Heritage.
