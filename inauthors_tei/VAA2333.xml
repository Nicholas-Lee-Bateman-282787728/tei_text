                    <p TEIform="p">MR. ROBERT PAGEBEOOK was &quot;blue.&quot; There was no denying the fact, and
                        for the first time in his life lie admitted it as lie lay abed one September morning with his
                        hands locked over the top of his head, while his shapely and muscular body was stretched at lazy
                        length under a scanty covering of sheet. He was snappish too, as his faithful serving man had
                        discovered upon knocking half an hour ago for entrance, and receiving a rather pointed and
                        wholly unreasonable injunction to &quot;go about his business,&quot; his sole business
                        lying just then within the precincts of Mr. Robert Pagebrook&apos;s room, to which he was
                        thus denied admittance. The old servant had obeyed to the best of Ids ability, going not about
                        his business but away from it, wondering <pb id="VAA2333-009" n="12" TEIform="pb"/> meanwhile
                        what had come over the young gentleman, whom he had never found moody before.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">It was clear that Mr. Robert Pagebrook&apos;s reflections were anything but
                        pleasant as he lay there thinking, thinking, thinkingresolving not to think and straightway
                        thinking again harder than ever. His disturbance was due to a combination of causes. His muddy
                        boots were in lull view for one thing, and he was painfully conscious that they were not likely
                        to get themselves blacked now that he had driven old Moses away. This reminded him that he had
                        showed temper when Moses&apos;s meek knock had disturbed him, and to show temper without
                        proper cause he deemed a weakness. Weaknesses were his pet aversion. Weakness found little
                        toleration with him, particularly when the weakness showed itself in his own person, out of
                        which he had been all his life chastising such infirmities. His petulance with Moses, therefore,
                        contributed to his annoyance, becoming an additional cause of that from which it came as an
                        effect.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Our young gentleman acknowledged, as I have already said, that he was out of spirits,
                        and in the very act of acknowledging it he contemned himself because of it. His sturdy manhood
                        rebelled against its own weakness, and mocked at it, which certainly was not a very good way to
                        cure it. He denied that there was any good excuse for his depression, and scourged himself,
                        mentally, for giving way to it, a process which naturally enough made him give way to it all the
                        more. It depressed him to know that he was weak enough to be depressed. To my thinking he did
                        himself very great injustice. He <pb id="VAA2333-010" n="13" TEIform="pb"/>

                        <pb id="VAA2333-011" n="15" TEIform="pb"/> was, in fact, very unreasonable with himself, and
                        deserved to suffer the consequences. I say this frankly, being the chronicler of this young
                        man&apos;s doings and not his apologist by any means. He certainly had good reason, to be
                        gloomy, inasmuch as he had two rather trouble-some things on his hands, namely, a young man
                        without a situation and a disappointment in love, or fancy, which is often mistaken for love. A
                        circumstance which made the matter worse was that the young man without a situation for whose
                        future Mr. Robert Pagebrook had to provide was Mr. Robert Pagebrook himself. This alone would
                        not have troubled him greatly if it had not been for his other trouble; for the great hulking
                        fellow who lay there with his hands clasped over his head &quot;cogitating,&quot; as he
                        would have phrased it, had too much physical force, too much of good health and consequent
                        animal spirits, to distrust either the future or his own ability to cope with whatever
                        difficulties it might bring with it. To men with broad chests and great brawny legs and arms
                        like his the future has a very promising way of presenting itself. Besides, our young man knew
                        himself well furnished for a fight with the world. He knew very well how to take care of
                        himself. He had done farm labor as a boy during the long summer vacations, a task set him by his
                        Virginian father, who had carried a brilliant intellect in a frail body to a western state,
                        where he had married and died, leaving his widow this one son, for whom in his own weakness he
                        desired nothing so much as physical strength and bodily health. The boy had grown into a sturdy
                        youth when the mother died, leaving <pb id="VAA2333-012" n="16" TEIform="pb"/> him with little
                        in the way of earthly possessions except well-knit limbs, a clear, strong, active mind, and an
                        independent, self-reliant spirit. With these he had managed to work his way through college,
                        turning his hand to anything which would help to provide him with the necessary meanskeeping
                        books, &quot;coaching&quot; other students, canvassing for various things, and doing
                        work of other sorts, caring little whether it was dignified or undignified provided it was
                        honest and promised the desired pecuniary return. After graduation he had accepted a tutorship
                        in the college wherein he had studieda position which he had resigned (about a year before the
                        time at which we find him in a fit of the blues) to take upon himself the duties of
                        &quot;Professor of English Language and Literature, and Adjunct Professor of
                        Mathematics,&quot; in a little collegiate institute with big pretensions in one of the
                        suburbs of Philadelphia. In short, he had been knocked about in the world until he had acquired
                        considerable confidence in his ability to earn a living at almost anything he might undertake.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Under the circumstances, therefore, it is not probable that this energetic and
                        self-confident young gentleman would have suffered the loss of his professorship to annoy him
                        very seriously if it had not been accompanied by the other trouble mentioned. Indeed, the two
                        had come so closely together, and were so intimately connected in other ways, that Mr. Robert
                        Pagebrook was inclined to wonder, as he lay there in bed, whether there might not exist between
                        them somewhere the relation of cause and effect. Whether there really was any other than an <pb
                            id="VAA2333-013" n="17" TEIform="pb"/> accidental blending of the two events I am sure I do
                        not know; and the reader is at liberty, after hearing the brief story of their happening, to
                        take either side he prefers of the question raised in Mr. Rob&apos;s mind. For myself, I
                        find it impossible to determine the point. But here is the story, as young Pagebrook turned it
                        over and over in his mind in spite of himself.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">President Currier, of the collegiate institute, had a daughter, Miss Nellie, who
                        wanted to study Latin more than anything else in the world. President Currier particularly
                        disliked conjugations and parsings and everything else pertaining to the study of language; and
                        so it happened that as Miss Nellie was quite a good-looking and agreeable damsel, oar young
                        friend Pagebrook volunteered to give her the coveted instruction in her favorite study in the
                        shape of afternoon lessons. The tutor soon discovered that his pupil&apos;s earnest wish to
                        learn Latin had been basedas such desires frequently are in the case of young womenupon an
                        entire misapprehension of the nature and difficulty of the study. In fact, Miss
                        Nellie&apos;s clearest idea upon the subject of Latin before beginning it was that
                        &quot;it must be <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">so</hi> nice!&quot; Her progress, therefore,
                        after the first week or two, was certainly not remarkable for its rapidity; but the tutor
                        persisted. After awhile the young lady said &quot;Latin wasn&apos;t nice at
                        all,&quot; a remark which she made haste to qualify by assuring her teacher that
                        &quot;it&apos;s nice to take lessons in it, though.&quot; Finally Miss Nellie ceased
                        to make any pretense of learning the lessons, but somehow the afternoon <hi rend="i"
                            TEIform="hi">sances</hi> over the grammar were continued, <pb id="VAA2333-014" n="18"
                            TEIform="pb"/> though it must be confessed that the talk was not largely of verbs.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">By the time commencement day came the occasional presence of Miss Nellie had become a
                        sort of necessity in the young professor&apos;s daily existence, and the desire to be with
                        her led him to spend the summer at Cape May, whither her father annually took her for the
                        season. Now Cape May is an expensive place, as watering places usually are, and so Mr. Robert
                        Pagebrook&apos;s stay of a little over two months there made a serious reduction in his
                        reserve fund, which was at best a very limited one. Before going to Cape May he had concluded
                        that he was in love with Miss Nellie, and had informed her of the fact. She had expressed, by
                        manner rather than by spoken word, a reasonable degree of pleasure in the knowledge of this
                        fact; but when pressed for a reply to the young gentleman&apos;s impetuous questionings, she
                        had prettily avoided committing herself beyond recall. She told him she might possibly come to
                        love him a little after awhile, in a pretty little maidenly way, which satisfied him that she
                        loved him a good deal already. She said she &quot;didn&apos;t know&quot; with a tone
                        and manner which convinced him that she did know; and so the Cape May season passed off very
                        pleasantly, with just enough of uncertainty about the position of affairs to keep up an interest
                        in them.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">As the season drew near its close, however, Miss Nellie suddenly informed her lover
                        one evening that her dear father had &quot;plans&quot; for her, and that of course they
                        had both been amusing themselves merely; and she said this in so innocent and so sincere a way
                        that for the moment <pb id="VAA2333-015" n="19" TEIform="pb"/> her stunned admirer believed it
                        as he retired to his room with an unusual ache in his heart. When the young man sat down alone,
                        however, and began meditating upon the events of the past summer, he was unreasonable enough to
                        accuse the innocent little maiden of very naughty trifling, and even to think her wanting in
                        honesty and sincerity. As he sat there brooding over the matter, and hall hoping that Miss
                        Nellie was only trying him for the purpose of testing the depth of his affection, a servant
                        brought him a note, which he opened and read. It was a very formal affair, as the reader will
                        see upon running his eye over the following copy:

                                            is yet due you three hundred dollars ($300) upon your salary for the late
                                            collegiate year, and I greatly regret that the treasurer informs me of a
                                            present lack of funds with which to discharge this obligation. I personally
                                            promise you, however, that the amount shall be remitted to whatever address
                                            you may give me, on or before the fifteenth day of November next. I send

                    </p>
                    <p TEIform="p">This letter had come to Mr. Robert very unexpectedly, and its immediate consequence
                        had been to send him hastily back to his city lodgings. He had arrived late at night, and
                        finding no matches in his room, which was situated in a business building where his neighbors
                        were unknown to him, he had been compelled to go to bed in the dark, without the possibility of
                        ascertaining whether or not there were any letters awaiting him on his table.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Our young gentleman was not, ordinarily, of an irritable disposition, and trifling
                        things rarely ever disturbed his equanimity, but he was forced to admit, as he lay there in bed,
                        that he had been a very unreasonable young gentleman on several recent occasions, and naturally
                        enough he began to catalogue his sins of this sort. Among other things he remembered that he had
                        worked himself into a temper over the emptiness of the match-safe; and this reminded him that he
                        had not even yet looked to see if there were any letters on the table at his elbow, much as he
                        had the night previously bewailed the impossibility of doing so at once. Somehow this matter of
                        his correspondence did not seem half so imperative in its demands upon his attention now that he
                        could read <pb id="VAA2333-017" n="21" TEIform="pb"/> his letters at once as it had seemed the
                        night before when he could not read them at all. He stretched out his hand rather languidly,
                        therefore, and taking up the half dozen letters which lay on the table, began to turn them over,
                        examining the superscriptions with small show of interest. Breaking one open he muttered,
                        &quot;There&apos;s another forty dollars&apos; worth of folly. I did not need that
                        coat, but ordered it expressly for Cape May. The bill must be paid, of course, and here I am,
                        out of work, with no prospects, and about five hundred dollars less money in bank than I ought
                        to have.!&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">I am really afraid he closed that sentence with an ejaculation. I have set down an
                        exclamation point to cover the possibility of such a thing.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">He went on with his letters. Presently he opened the last but one, and immediately
                        proceeded to open his eyes rather wider than usual. Jumping out of bed he thrust his head out of
                        the door and called</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Moses!&quot;</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">AFTER he had waked up whatever echoes there were in the building by his crescendo
                        calling for Moses, besides spoiling the temper of the night editor who was just then in the
                        midst of his first slumber in the room opposite, Mr. Rob remembered that the old colored
                        janitor, who owned the biblical name, and who for a trifling consideration ministered in the
                        capacity of servant to the personal comfort of the occupants of the rooms under his charge, was
                        never known to answer a call. He was sure to be within hearing, but would maintain a profound
                        silence until he had disposed of whatever matter he might happen to have in hand at the moment,
                        after which he would come to the caller in the sedate and dignified way proper to a person of
                        his importance. Remembering this, and hearing some ominous mutterings from the night
                        editor&apos;s room, our young gentleman withdrew his head from the corridor, put on his
                        dressing-gown and slippers, and sat down to await the leisurely coming of the serving man.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Taking up the note again he reread it, although he <pb id="VAA2333-019" n="23"
                            TEIform="pb"/> knew perfectly well everything in it, and began speculating upon what it
                        could possibly mean, knowing all the while that no amount of speculation could throw the
                        slightest ray of light on the subject in the absence of further information. He read it aloud,
                        just as you or I would have done, when there was nobody by to listen. It was as brief as a
                        telegram, and merely said: &quot;Will you please inform me at once whether we may count upon
                        your acceptance of the position offered you?&quot; It was signed with an unfamiliar name, to
                        which was appended the abbreviated word &quot;Pres&apos;t.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I shall certainly be very happy to inform the gentleman,&quot; thought
                        the perplexed young man, &quot;whether he may or may not (by the way he very improperly
                        omits the alternative &apos;or not&apos; after his &apos;whether&apos;), whether
                        he may or may not &apos;count upon&apos; (I must look up that expression and see if
                        there is good authority for its use), whether he may or may not count upon may acceptance of the
                        position offered me, just as soon as I can inform myself upon the matter. As I have not at
                        present the slightest idea of what the &apos;position&apos; is, it is somewhat difficult
                        for me to make up my mind concerning it. However, as I am without employment and uncomfortably
                        short of money, there seems to be every probability that my unknown correspondent&apos;s
                        proposition, whatever it is, will be favorably considered. Moses will come after awhile, I
                        suppose, and he probably has the other letter caged as a &apos;vallable.&apos; Let me
                        see what we have here from William.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">With this our young gentleman opened his only remaining <pb id="VAA2333-020" n="24"
                            TEIform="pb"/> letter, which he had already discovered by a glance at the postmark was from
                        a Virginian cousin. It was a mere note, in which his cousin wrote:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;A little matter of business takes me to Philadelphia next week. Shall be at
                        Girard Ho., Thrsd morn&apos;g. Meet me there at breakfast, but don&apos;t come too
                        early. Train won&apos;t get in till three, so I&apos;ll sleep a little late.
                        Sh&apos;d you wake me too early, I&apos;ll be as cross as a $20 bank-note, and make a
                        bad impression on you.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">An amused smile played over Mr. Robert&apos;s lace as he read this note over and
                        over. What he was thinking I do not know. Aloud he said:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;What a passion my cousin has for abbreviations! One would think he had a
                        grudge against words from the way in which he cuts them up. And what a figure of speech that is!
                        &apos;As cross as a twenty-dollar bank-note!&apos; Let me see, I may safely assume that
                        the letters &apos;Thrs&apos; with an elevated &apos;d&apos; mean Thursday, and
                        as this is Thursday, and as the letter was written last week, and as my watch tells me it is now
                        ten o&apos;clock, and as my boots are still unblacked, and as Moses has not yet made his
                        appearance, it seems altogether probable that my cousin&apos;s breakfast will be postponed
                        until the middle of the day if he waits for me to help him eat it. I am afraid he will be as
                        cross as half a dozen bank notes of the largest denomination issued when we meet.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Did you call, sah?&quot; asked Moses, coming very deliberately into the
                        room.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I am under the impression that I did, though it requires an extraordinary
                        exercise of the memory to recall <pb id="VAA2333-021" n="25" TEIform="pb"/> an event which
                        happened so long ago. Have you any &apos;vallables&apos; for me?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Moses <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">thought</hi> he had. This was as near an approach to
                        anything like a positive statement as Moses ever made. He would go to his room and ascertain.
                        Among many other evidences of unusual wisdom on the part of the old negro was this, that he
                        believed himself fully capable of recognizing a valuable letter whenever he saw it; and it was
                        one of his self-imposed duties, whenever the post brought letters for any absent member of his
                        constituency, to look them over and sequestrate all the &quot;vallables&quot; until the
                        return of the owner, so that they might be delivered with his own hand. Returning now he brought
                        two &quot;vallables&quot; for Mr. Pagebrook. One of them was a printed circular, but the
                        other proved to be the desired letter, which was a formal tender of a professorship in a New
                        England college, with an entirely satisfactory salary attached. Accompanying the official notice
                        of election was a note informing him that his duties, in the event of acceptance, would not
                        begin until the first of January, the engagement of the retiring professor terminating at that
                        time.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Under the influence of this news our young friend&apos;s face brightened quite as
                        perceptibly as his boots did in the hands of the old servitor. He wrote his letter of acceptance
                        at once, and then proceeded to dress for breakfast at the Girard House, whither he walked with
                        as light a step and as cheerful a bearing as if he had not been a sadly disappointed lover at
                        all.</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">ROBERT PAGEBOOK had never seen his cousin, and yet they were not altogether strangers
                        to each other. Robert&apos;s father and William Barksdale&apos;s mother were brother and
                        sister, and Shirley, the old Virginian homestead, which had been in the family for nearly two
                        centuries, had passed to young Barksdale&apos;s mother by the Voluntary act of
                        Robert&apos;s father when, upon coming of age, he had gone west to try his fortune in a
                        busier world than that of the Old Dominion. The two boys, William and Robert, had corresponded
                        quite regularly in boyhood and quite irregularly after they grew up, and so they knew each other
                        pretty well, though, as I have said, they had never met.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I am glad, very glad to see yon, William,&quot; said Robert as he
                        grasped his cousin&apos;s hand.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Now don&apos;t, I beg of you. Call me Billy, or Will, or anything else
                        you choose, old fellow, but don&apos;t call me William, whatever you do. Nobody ever did tat
                        father, and he never did except of mornings when I wouldn&apos;t get up. Then he&apos;d
                        sing out&apos; &apos;Will-<hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">yum</hi>&apos; with a, sort of a
                            <pb id="VAA2333-023" n="27" TEIform="pb"/> horsewhip snap at the end of it.
                        &apos;William&apos; always reminds me of disturbed slumbers. Call me Billy, and
                        I&apos;ll call you Bob. I&apos;ll do that anyhow, so you might as well fall into
                        familiar ways. But come, tell me how you are and all about yourself. You haven&apos;t
                        written to me since the flood; forgot to receive my last letter I suppose.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Probably I did. I have been forgetting a good many things. But I hope I
                        have not kept you too long from your breakfast, and especially that I have not made you
                        &apos;as cross as a twenty dollar bank-note.&apos; Pray tell me what you meant by that
                        figure of speech, will you not? I am curious to know where you got it and why.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Ha! ha!&quot; laughed Billy. &quot;You&apos;ll have a lively
                        time of it if you mean to unravel all my metaphors. Let me see. I must have referred to the big
                        X&apos;s they print on the bank bills, or something of that sort. But let&apos;s go to
                        breakfast at once. I&apos;m as hungry as a village editor. We can talk over a beefsteak, or
                        you can at least. I mean to be as still as a mill-pond of a cloudy night while you tell me all
                        about yourself.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">And over their breakfast they talked. But in telling his story, while he remembered
                        to mention all the details of his situation losing and his situation getting, Mr. Robert somehow
                        forgot to say anything about his other disappointment. He soon learned to know and to like his
                        cousin, and, which was more to the purpose, he began to enjoy him right heartily, in his own
                        way, bantering him on his Queer uses of English, half in sport, half in earnest, until the
                        Virginian declared that they had <pb id="VAA2333-024" n="28" TEIform="pb"/> grown as familiar
                        with each other &quot;as a pair of Irishmen at a wake.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I suppose you&apos;re off at once for your new place,
                        a&apos;n&apos;t you? This is September,&quot; said Billy after his cousin
                        had-finished so much of his story as he cared to reveal.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;No,&quot; said Robert. &quot;My duties will not begin until
                        January, and meantime I must go oil on a tramp somewhere to get my muscles, physical and
                        financial, up again. To tell the truth I have been dawdling at Cape May this summer instead of
                        going off to the mountains or the prairies, as I usually do, for a healthful and economical foot
                        journey, and the result is that my legs and arms are sadly run down. I have been spending too
                        much money too, and so cannot afford to stay around Philadelphia until January. I think I must
                        go off to some of the mountain counties, where the people think five dollars a fortune and call
                        anything less than a precipice rising ground.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, I reckon you won&apos;t,&quot; said the Virginian;
                        &quot;I&apos;ve been inviting you to the &apos;home of your fathers&apos; ever
                        since I was born, and this is the very first time I ever got you to own up to a scrap of leisure
                        as big as your thumb nail, I&apos;ve got you now with nothing to do and nowhere to go, and I
                        mean to take you with me this very evening to Virginia. We&apos;ll leave on the eleven
                        o&apos;clock train to-night, get to Richmond to-morrow at two and go up home next morning in
                        time for snack.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;But, my dear Billy&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;But, my dear Bob, I won&apos;t hear a word, and I won&apos;t take
                        no for an answer. That&apos;s poz roz and the king&apos;s <pb id="VAA2333-025" n="29"
                            TEIform="pb"/> English. I&apos;m managing this little job. You can give up your rooms
                        to-day, sell out your plunder, and stop expenses. Then you needn&apos;t open your
                        pocket-book again for so long that you&apos;ll forget how it looks inside. Put a few
                        ninepences into your breeches pocket to throw at darkeys when they hold your horse, and the
                        thing&apos;s done. And won&apos;t we wake up old Shirley? I tell you it&apos;s the
                        delightfulest two hundred year old establishment you ever saw or didn&apos;t see. As the
                        Irish attorney said of his ancestral home: &apos;there isn&apos;t a table in the house
                        that hasn&apos;t had jigs danced upon it, and there&apos;s not a chair that you
                        can&apos;t throw at a friend&apos;s head without the slightest fear of breaking
                        it.&apos; &quot;When we get there we&apos;ll have as much fun as a pack of hounds on
                        a fresh trail.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Upon my word, Billy,&quot; said the professor cousin, &quot;your
                        metaphors have the merits of freshness and originality, at the least, though now and then, as in
                        the present instance, they are certainly not very complimentary. However, it just occurs to me
                        that I have been wanting to go to Shirley &apos;ever since I was born,&apos; if you will
                        allow me to borrow one of your forcible phrases, and this really does seem to be a peculiarly
                        good opportunity deal interested in dialects and ld be worth my while to visit on, because my
                        stay at Shirley t opportunity to study some of Poz roz,&apos; now, is entirely new to me,
                        and I might make something out of it in a philological way.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Upon my word&quot; said Mr. Billy, &quot;that&apos;s a polite
                            <pb id="VAA2333-026" n="30" TEIform="pb"/> speech. If you&apos;ll only say
                        you&apos;ll go, though, I don&apos;t care the value of a herring&apos;s left fore
                        foot what use you make of me. I&apos;m yours to command and ready for any sport that suits
                        you, unless you take a notion to throw rocks at me.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Pray tell me, Billy, do Virginians ever throw rocks? I am interested in
                        muscle, and should greatly like to see some one able to throw rocks. I have paid half a dollar
                        many a time to see a man lift extraordinary weights, but the best of the showmen never dream of
                        handling anything heavier than cannon-balls. It would be decidedly entertaining to see a man
                        throwing rocks and things of that sort about, even if he were to use both hands in doing
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Nonsense,&quot; said Billy; &quot;I&apos;m not one of your
                        students getting a dictionary lesson. Waiter!&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;What will you have, sir?&quot; asked the waiter.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Some hot biscuit, please.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;They a&apos;n&apos;t no hot biscuits, sir.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well some hot rolls then, or hot bread of some sort. Cold bread for
                        breakfast is an abomination.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;They a&apos;n&apos;t no hot bread in the house, sir. We never keep
                        none. Hot bread a&apos;n&apos;t healthy, sir.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;You impertinent&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;My dear Billy,&quot; said Mr. Bob, &quot;pray keep your temper.
                        &apos;Impertinent&apos; is not the word you wish to use. The <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi"
                            >man</hi> can not well be impertinent. He is a trifle impudent, I admit, but we can afford
                        to overlook the impudence of his remark for the sake of the philological interest it has.
                        Waiter, you ought to know, inasmuch as <pb id="VAA2333-027" n="31" TEIform="pb"/> you have been
                        brought up in a land of free schools, that two negatives, in English, destroy each other, and
                        are equivalent to an affirmative; but the matter in which I am most interested just now is your
                        remark that hot bread is not <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">healthy.</hi> Your statement is perfectly
                        true, and it would have been equally true if you had omitted the qualifying adjective
                        &apos;hot.&apos; No bread can be &apos;healthy,&apos; because health and disease
                        are not attributes or conditions of inanimate things. You probably meant, however, that hot
                        bread is not wholesome, a point on &quot;which my friend here, who eats hot bread every day
                        of his life, would naturally take issue with you. Please bring us some buttered toast.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The waiter went away bewilderedquestioning the sanity of Mr. Bob in all probability;
                        a questioning in which Billy was half inclined to join him.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;What on earth do you mean, Bob, by talking in that way to a waiter who
                        don&apos;t know the meaning of one word in five that you use?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, I meant for one thing to keep you from losing your temper and so
                        spoiling your digestion. Human motives are complicated affairs, and hence I am by no means sure
                        that I can further unravel my purpose in this case.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Return we to our muttons, then,&quot; said Billy;
                        &quot;I&apos;ll finish the business that brought me here, which is only to be present at
                        the taking of a short deposition, by two or three o&apos;clock. While I&apos;m at it you
                        can get your traps together, send your trunk to the depot, and get back here to dinner by four.
                        Then we must get through the <pb id="VAA2333-028" n="32" TEIform="pb"/> rest of the time the
                        best way we can, and at eleven we&apos;ll be off. I&apos;m crazy to see you with Phil
                        once.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Phil, who is he?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Oh! Phil is a charactera colored one. I want to see how his
                        &apos;dialect&apos; will affect you. I&apos;m half afraid you&apos;ll go crazy,
                        though, under it.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Tell me&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;No, I won&apos;t describe Phil, because I can&apos;t, and no more
                        can anybody else. Phil must be seen to be appreciated. But come, I&apos;m off for the
                        notary&apos;s, and you must get you gone too, for you mustn&apos;t be late at dinner
                        that&apos;s poz.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">With this the two young men separated, the Virginian lawyer to attend to the taking
                        of some depositions, and his cousin to surrender his lodgings, pack his trunk, and make such
                        other arrangements as were necessary for his journey.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">This opportunity to visit the old homestead where his father had passed his boyhood
                        was peculiarly welcome to Mr. Robert just now. There had always been to him a sort of glamour
                        about the names Virginia and Shirley. His father&apos;s stories about his own childhood had
                        made a deep impression on the mind of the boy, and to him Shirley was a palace and Virginia a
                        fairy land. Whenever, in childhood, he was allowed to call a calf or a pig his own, he
                        straightway bestowed upon it one or the other of the charmed names, and fancied that the animal
                        grew stronger and more beautiful as a consequence. He had always intended to go to Shirley, but
                        had never done so; just as you and I, reader, have always meant to do <pb id="VAA2333-029"
                            n="33" TEIform="pb"/> several scores of things that we have never done, though we can hardly
                        say why. Just now, however, Mr. Billy&apos;s plan for his cousin was more than ever
                        agreeable to Mr. Robert for various present and unusual reasons. He knew next to nobody in or
                        about Philadelphia outside the precincts of the collegiate institute, and to hunt up
                        acquaintances inside that institution was naturally enough not exactly to his taste. He had
                        several months of time to dispose of in some way, and until Billy suggested the visit to
                        Virginia, the best he had been able to do in the way of devising a time-killer was to plan a
                        solitary wandering among the mountainous districts of Pennsylyania. Ordinarily lie would have
                        enjoyed such a journey very much, but just now he knew that Mr. Robert Pagebrook could hardly
                        find a less agreeable companion than Mr. Robert Pagebrook himself. That little affair with Miss
                        Nellie Currier kept coming up in his memory, and if the reader be a man it is altogether
                        probable that he knows precisely how the memory of that story affected our young gentleman. He
                        wanted company, and he wanted change, and he wanted out-door exercise, and where could he find
                        all these quite so abundant as at an old Virginian country house? His love for Miss Nellie, he
                        was sure, was a very genuine one; but he was equally sure that it was hopeless. Indeed, now that
                        he knew the selfish insincerity of the damsel he did not even wish that his suit had prospered.
                        This, at any rate, is what he thought, as you did, my dear sir, when you first learned what the
                        word &quot;Another&quot; means when printed with a big A; and, thinking this, he felt
                        that <pb id="VAA2333-030" n="34" TEIform="pb"/> the first thing to be done in the matter was to
                        forget Miss Nellie and his love for her as speedily as possible. How far he succeeded in doing
                        this we shall probably see in the sequel. At present we have to do with the attempt only. New
                        scenes and new people, Mr. Pagebrook thought, would greatly aid him in his purpose, and so the
                        trip to Virginia seemed peculiarly fitting. It thus comes about that the scene of this young
                        man&apos;s story suddenly shifts from Philadelphia to a Virginian country house, in spite of
                        all I can do to preserve the dramatic unity of place. Ah! if I were <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi"
                            >making</hi> this story now, I could confine it to a single room, compress its action into a
                        single day, and do other dramatic and highly proper things; but as Mr. Robert Pagebrook and Ms
                        friends were not stage people, and, moreover, as they were not aware that their goings and
                        comings would ever weave themselves into the woof of a story at all, they utterly failed to
                        regulate their actions in accordance with critical rules, and went roving about over the country
                        quite in a natural way and without the slightest regard for my convenience.</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">WHEN our two young men readied the station at which they were to leave the cars, they
                        found awaiting them there the lumbering old carriage which had boon a part of the Shirley
                        establishment ever since Mr. Billy could remember. This vehicle was known to everybody in the
                        neighborhood as the Shirley carriage, not because it was older or clumsier or uglier than its
                        fellows, for indeed it was not, but merely because every carriage in a Virginian neighborhood is
                        known to everybody quite as well as its owner is. To Mr. Robert Pagebrook, however, the vehicle
                        presented itself as an antique and a curiosity. Its body was suspended by leathern straps which
                        came out of some high semicircular springs at the back, and it was thus raised so far above the
                        axles that one could enter it only by mounting quite a stairway of steps, which unfolded
                        themselves from its interior. Swinging thus by its leathern straps, the great heavy carriage
                        body really seemed to have no support at all, and Mr. Robert found it necessary to exercise all
                        the faith there was in him in order to believe that to get inside of <pb id="VAA2333-032" n="36"
                            TEIform="pb"/> the vehicle was not a sure and speedy way of securing two or three broken
                        hones. He got in, however, at his cousin&apos;s invitation, and soon discovered that
                        although the motion of the suspended carriage body closely resembled that of a fore and aft
                        schooner in a gale, it was by no means unpleasant, as the worst that the roughest road could do
                        was to make the vibratory motion a trifle more decided than usual in its nature. A jolt was
                        simply impossible.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">As soon as he got his sea legs on sufficiently to keep himself tolerably steady on
                        his seat, Mr. Rob began to look at the country or, more properly, to study the roadside, there
                        being little else visible, so thickly grew the trees and underbrush on each side.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;How far must we drive before reaching Shirley?&quot; he asked after
                        awhile, as the carriage stopped for the opening of a gate.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;About four miles now,&quot; said his cousin. &quot;It&apos;s
                        five miles, or nearly that, from the Court House.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;The court house? Where is that?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O the Tillage where we left the train! That&apos;s the Court
                        House.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Ah! you Virginians call a village a court house, do you?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Certainly, when it&apos;s the county-seat and a&apos;n&apos;t
                        much else. Now and then court houses put on airs and call themselves names, but they
                        don&apos;t often make much of it. There&apos;s Powhatan Court House now, I believe it
                        tried to got itself called &apos;Scottsville,&apos; or something of that sort, but
                        nobody knows it as anything but Powhatan Court <pb id="VAA2333-033" n="37" TEIform="pb"/> House.
                        Our county-seat has always been modest, and if it has any name I never heard of it.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;That&apos;s one interesting custom of the country, at any rate. Pray
                        tell me, is it another of your customs to dispense wholly with public roads? I ask for
                        information merely, and the question is suggested by the fact that we seem to have driven away
                        from the Court House by the private road which we are still following.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Why, this isn&apos;t a private road. It&apos;s one of the principal
                        public roads of the county.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;How about these gates then?&quot; asked Robert as the negro boy who
                        rode behind the carnage jumped down to open another.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, what about them?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Why, I never saw a gate across a public thoroughfare before. Do you really
                        permit such things in Virginia?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O yes! certainly. It saves a great deal of fencing, and the Court never
                        refuses permission to put up a gate in any reasonable place, only the owner is bound to make it
                        easy to open on horsebackor, as you would put it, &apos;by a person riding on
                        horseback.&apos; Your see I&apos;m growing circumspect in my choice of words since
                        I&apos;ve been with, you. May be you&apos;ll reform us all, and make us talk tolerably
                        good English before yon go back. If you do, I&apos;ll give you some
                        &apos;testimonials&apos; to your worth as a professor.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;But about those gates, Billy. I am all the more interested in them now that
                        I know them as another &apos;custom of the country.&apos; How do their owners keep them
                        shut? Don&apos;t people leave them open pretty often?</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Never; a Virginian is always &apos;on honor&apos; so far as his <pb
                            id="VAA2333-034" n="38" TEIform="pb"/> neighbors are concerned, and the man who would leave
                        a neighbor&apos;s gate open might as well take to stealing at once for all the difference it
                        would make in his social standing.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">It was not only the gates, but the general appearance of the road as well, that
                        astonished young Pagebrook: a public road, consisting of a single carriage track, with a, grass
                        plat on each side, fringed with thick undergrowth, and overhung by the branches of great trees,
                        was to him a novelty, and a very pleasant novelty too, in which he was greatly interested.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Who lives there?&quot; asked Robert, as a large house came into view.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;That&apos;s The Oaks, Cousin Edwin&apos;s place.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;And who is your Cousin Edwin?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;<hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">My</hi> Cousin Edwin? He&apos;s yours too, I
                        reckon. Cousin Edwin Pagebrook. He is our second cousin or, as the old ladies put it, first
                        cousin once removed.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Pray tell me what a first cousin once removed is, will you not, Billy? I am
                        wholly ignorant on the subject of cousinhood in its higher branches, and as I understand that a
                        good deal of stress is laid upon relationships of this sort in Virginia, I should like to inform
                        myself in advance if possible.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I really don&apos;t know whether I can or not. Any of the old ladies
                        will lay it all out to you, illustrating it with their keys arranged like a genealogical tree. I
                        don&apos;t know much about it, but I reckon I can make you understand this much, as I have
                        Cousin Edwin&apos;s case to go by. It&apos;s a &apos;case in point&apos; as we
                        lawyers say. Let&apos;s see. <pb id="VAA2333-035" n="39" TEIform="pb"/> Cousin
                        Edwin&apos;s grandfather was our great grandfather; then his father was our
                        grandfather&apos;s brother, and that makes him first cousin to my mother and your father.
                        Now I would call mother&apos;s first cousin my second cousin, but the old ladies, who pay a
                        good deal of attention to these matters, say not. They say that my mother&apos;s or my
                        father&apos;s first cousin is my first cousin once removed, and his children are my second
                        cousins, and they prove it all, too, with their keys.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well then,&quot; asked Robert, &quot;if that is so, what is the
                        exact relationship between Cousin Edwin&apos;s children and my father or your
                        mother?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O don&apos;t! You bewilder me. I told you I didn&apos;t know
                        anything about it. You must get some old lady to explain it with her keys, and when she gets
                        through you won&apos;t know who you are, to save you.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;That is encouraging, certainly,&quot; said Mr. Robert.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O it&apos;s no matter! You&apos;re safe enough in calling everybody
                        around here &apos; cousin&apos; if you&apos;re sure they a&apos;n&apos;t any
                        closer kin. The fact is, all the best families here have intermarried so often that the
                        relationships are all mixed up, and we always claim kin when there is any ghost of a chance for
                        it. Besides, the Pagebrooks are the biggest tadpoles in the puddle; and so, if they
                        don&apos;t&apos; cousin&apos; all their kin-folks people think they&apos;re
                        stuck-up.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Thank yon, Billy; but tell me, am I, being a Pagebrook, under any
                        consequent obligation to consider myself a tadpole during my stay in Virginia?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Billy&apos;s only answer was a laugh.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Now, Billy,&quot; Robert resumed, &quot;tell me about the <pb
                            id="VAA2333-036" n="40" TEIform="pb"/> people of Shirley. I am sadly ignorant, you
                        under-top, and I do not wish to make mistakes. Begin at top, and tell me how I shall call them
                        all.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, there&apos;s father; you will call him Uncle Carter, of course.
                        He is Col. Carter Barksdale, you know.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I knew his name was Carter, of course, but I did not know he had ever been
                        a military man.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;A military man! No, he never was. What made you think that?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Why you called him&apos; Colonel.&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O that&apos;s nothing! You&apos;ll find every gentleman past middle
                        age wearing some sort of title or other. They call father &apos; Colonel
                        Barksdale,&apos; and Cousin Edwin&apos; Major Pagebrook,&apos; though neither of
                        them ever saw a tent that I know of.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Ah! another interesting custom of the country. But pray go on.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, mother is &apos; Aunt Mary,&apos; you know, and then
                        there&apos;s Aunt Catherine.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Indeed! who is she? Is she my aunt?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I really don&apos;t know. Let me see. No, I reckon not; nor mine
                        either, for that matter. I think she&apos;s father&apos;s fourth or fifth cousin, with a
                        remove or two added, possibly, but you must call her &apos;Aunt&apos; anyhow; we all do,
                        and she&apos;d never forgive you if you didn&apos;t. You see she knew your father, and I
                        reckon ho called her &apos;Aunt.&apos; It&apos;s a way we have here. She is a maiden
                        lady, you understand, and Shirley is her home. You&apos;ll find somebody of that sort in
                        nearly every house, and they&apos;re a delightful sort of somebody, too, to have round.
                        She&apos;ll <pb id="VAA2333-037" n="41" TEIform="pb"/> post you up on relationships. She can
                        use up a whole key-basket full of keys, and run &apos;em over by name backwards or forwards,
                        just as you please. You needn&apos;t follow her though if you object to a headache. All
                        you&apos;ve got to do is to let her tell you about it, and you say &apos;yes&apos;
                        now and then. She puts me through every week or so. Then there&apos;s Cousin Sudie, my
                        father&apos;s niece and ward. She&apos;s been an orphan almost all her life, and so
                        she&apos;s always lived with us. Father is her guardian, and he always calls her
                        &apos;daughter.&apos; You&apos;ll call her &apos;Cousin Sue,&apos; of
                        course.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Then she is akin to me too, is she?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Of course. She&apos;s father&apos;s own brother&apos;s
                        child.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;But, Billy, your father is only my uncle by marriage, and I do not
                        understand how&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O bother! If you&apos;re going to count it up, I reckon there
                        a&apos;n&apos;t any real relationship; but she&apos;s your cousin, anyhow, and
                        you&apos;ll offend her if you refuse to own it. Call her &apos;Cousin,&apos; and be
                        done with it.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Being one of the large Pagebrook tadpoles, I suppose I must. However, in
                        the case of a young lady, I shall not find it difficult, I dare say.&quot;</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">MR. ROBERT had often heard of &quot;an Old Virginian welcome,&quot; but
                        precisely what constituted it he never knew until the carnage in which he rode drove around the
                        &quot;circle&quot; and stopped in front of the Shirley mansion. The first thing which
                        struck him as peculiar about the preparations made for his reception was the large number of
                        small negroes who thought their presence necessary to the occasion. Little black faces grinned
                        at him from behind every tree, and about a dozen of them peered out from a safe position behind
                        &quot;ole mas&apos;r and ole missus.&quot; Mr. Billy had telegraphed from Richmond
                        announcing the coming of his guest, and so every darkey on the plantation knew that
                        &quot;Mas&apos; Joe&apos;s son &quot;was &quot;a comin&apos; wid
                        Mas&apos; Billy from de Norf,&quot; and every one that could find a safe hiding place in
                        the yard was there to see him come.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Col. Barksdale met him at the carriage while the ladies were in waiting on the porch,
                        as anybody but a Virginian would put it<hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">in</hi> the porch, as they
                        themselves would have phrased it. The welcome was of the right hearty order which nobody ever
                        saw outside of Virginia <pb id="VAA2333-039" n="43" TEIform="pb"/> a welcome which made the
                        guest feel himself at once a very part of the establishment.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Inside the house our young friend found himself sorely puzzled. The furniture was old
                        in style but very elegant, a thing for which he was fully prepared, but it stood upon absolutely
                        hare white floors. There were both damask and lace curtains at the windows, but not a vestige of
                        carpet was anywhere to be seen. Mr. Robert said nothing, but wondered silently whether it was
                        possible that he had arrived in the midst of house-cleaning. Conversation, luncheon, and finally
                        dinner at four, occupied his attention, however, and after dinner the whole family gathered in
                        the porchfor really I believe the Virginians are right about that preposition. I will ask Mr.
                        Robert himself some day.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">He soon found himself thoroughly at home in the old family mansion, among relatives
                        who had never been strangers to him in any proper sense of the term. Not only was Mrs. Barksdale
                        his father&apos;s sister, but Col. Barksdale himself had been that father&apos;s nearest
                        friend. The two had gone west together to seek their fortunes there; but the Colonel had
                        returned after a few years to practice his profession in his native state and ultimately to
                        marry his friend&apos;s sister. Mr. Robert soon felt himself literally at home, therefore,
                        and the feeling was intensely enjoyable, too, to a young man who for ten years had not known any
                        home other than that of a bachelor&apos;s quarters in a college community. His reception at
                        Shirley had not been the greeting of a guest but rather the welcoming of a long wandering son of
                        the house. <pb id="VAA2333-040" n="44" TEIform="pb"/> To his relatives there he seemed precisely
                        that, and their feeling in the case soon became his own. This &quot;clannish-ness,&quot;
                        as it is called, may not be peculiar to Virginia of all the states, but I have never seen it
                        half so strongly manifested anywhere else as there.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Toward evening Maj. Pagebrook and his son Ewing rode over to call upon their cousin
                        Robert, and after the introductions were over, &quot;Cousin Edwin&quot; went on to talk
                        of Robert&apos;s father, for whom he had felt an unusual degree of affection, as all the
                        relatives had, for that matter, Robert&apos;s father having been an especial favorite in the
                        family. Then the conversation became more general.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;When are you going to out that field of tobacco by the prize barn, Cousin
                        Edwin?&quot; asked Billy. &quot;I see it&apos;s ripening pretty rapidly.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Yes, it is getting pretty ripe in spots, and I wanted to put the hands into
                        it yesterday,&quot; replied Maj. Pagebrook; &quot;but Sarah Ann thought we&apos;d
                        better keep them plowing for wheat a day or two longer, and now I&apos;m afraid
                        it&apos;s going to rain before I can get a first cutting done.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;How much did you get for the tobacco you sent to Richmond the other day,
                        Edwin?&quot; asked the colonel.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Only five dollars and three cents a hundred, average.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;You&apos;d have done a good deal better if you&apos;d sold in the
                        spring, wouldn&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Yes, a good deal. I wanted to sell then, but Sarah Ann insisted on holding
                        it till fall. By the way, I&apos;m <pb id="VAA2333-041" n="45" TEIform="pb"/> going to put
                        all my lots, except the one by the creek, in corn next year, and raise hardly any
                        tobacco.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;All but the creek lot? Why that&apos;s the only good corn land you
                        have, Edwin, and it isn&apos;t safe to put tobacco in it either, for it overflows a
                        little.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Yes, I know it. But Sarah Ann is discouraged by the price we got for
                        tobacco this year, and doesn&apos;t want me to plant the lots next season at all.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Why didn&apos;t you bring Cousin Sarah Ann over and come to dinner
                        to-day, Cousin Edwin?&quot; asked Miss Barksdale, coming out of the dining-room, key-basket
                        in hand, to speak to the guests.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Oh! we&apos;ve only one carnage horse now, you know. I sold the black
                        last week, and haven&apos;t been able to find another yet.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Sold the black! Why, what was that for, Cousin Ed! I thought you specially
                        liked him&quot; said Billy.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;So I did; but Sarah Ann didn&apos;t like a black and a gray together,
                        and she wouldn&apos;t let mo sell the gray on any terms, though I could have matched the
                        black at once. Winger has a colt well broken that&apos;s a perfect match for him. Come,
                        Ewing, we must be going. Sarah Ann said we must be home to tea without fail. You&apos;ll
                        come to The Oaks, Robert, of course. Sarah Ann will expect you very soon, and you
                        mustn&apos;t stand on ceremony, you know, but come as often as you can while you stay at
                        Shirley.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;What do you think of Cousin Edwin, Bob?&quot; asked Billy when the
                        guests had gone.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;That he is a very excellent person, and&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-042" n="46" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;And what? Speak out. Let&apos;s hear what you think.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, that he is a very dutiful husband.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Bob, I&apos;d give a pretty for your knack at saying things. Your
                        tongue&apos;s as soft as a feather bed. But wait till you know the madam. You&apos;ll
                        say&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;My son, you shouldn&apos;t prejudice Robert against people he
                        doesn&apos;t know. Sarah Ann has many good qualitiesI suppose.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, then, I don&apos;t suppose anything of the sort, else she would
                        have found out how good a man Cousin Edwin is long ago, and would have behaved herself better
                        every way.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;William, you are uncharitable!&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Not a bit of it, mother. Your charity is like a microscope when it is
                        hunting for something good to say of people. Did you ever hear of the dead Dutchman?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Do pray, Billy, don&apos;t tell me any of your anecdotes now&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Just this one, mother. There was a dead Dutchman who had been the worst
                        Dutchman in the business. &quot;When the people came to sit up with his corpsedon&apos;t
                        run, mother, I&apos;m nearly throughthey couldn&apos;t find anything good to say about
                        him, and as they didn&apos;t want to say anything bad there was a profound silence in the
                        room. Finally one old Dutchman, heaving a sigh, remarked: &apos;Vell, Hans vas vone goot
                        schmoker, anyhow.&apos; Let me see. Cousin Sarah Ann gives good dinners, anyhow, only she
                        piles too much on the table. See how charitable I am, mother. I have actually found and
                        designated the madam&apos;s one good point,&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-043" n="47" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Come, come, my son,&quot; said the clone, &quot;you
                        shouldn&apos;t talk so.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Shortly after tea the two young men pleaded the weariness of travelers in excuse for
                        an early bed going. Mr. Bob was offered his choice between occupying alone the Blue Room, which
                        is the state guest chamber in most Virginian houses, and taking a bed in Billy&apos;s room.
                        He promptly chose the latter, and when they were alone, he turned to his cousin and asked:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Billy, have you such a thing as a dictionary about?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Nothing hut a law dictionary, I believe. Will that do?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Really I do not know. Perhaps it might.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;What do you want to find?&quot; asked Billy.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I only wish to ascertain whether or not we arrived here in time for
                        &apos; snack.&apos; You said we would, I believe.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, we did, didn&apos;t we?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;That is precisely what I wish to find out. Having never heard of
                        &apos;snack&apos; until you mentioned it as one of the things we should find at Shirley,
                        I have been curious to know what it is like, and so I have been watching for it ever since we
                        got here. Pray tell me what it is?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, that&apos;s a good one. I must tell Sudie that, and get her to
                        introduce you formally to-morrow.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;It is another interesting custom of the country, I suppose.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Indeed it is j and it isn&apos;t one of those customs that are
                        &apos;more honored in the breach than the observance,&apos; either.&quot;</p>

                        <hi rend="i">Mr. Pagebrook makes a Good Impression.</hi>
                    </head>
                    <p TEIform="p">YOUNG Pagebrook was an early riser. Not that he was afflicted, with one of those
                        unfortunate consciences which, make of early rising a penance, by any means. He was not
                        prejudiced against lying abed, nor bigoted about getting up. He quoted no adages on the subject,
                        and was not illogical enough to believe that getting up early and yawning for an hour or two
                        every morning would bring health, wisdom, or wealth to anybody. In short, he was an early riser
                        not on principle but of necessity. Somehow his eyelids had a way of popping themselves open
                        about sunrise or earlier, and his great brawny limbs could not be kept in bed long after this
                        happened. He got up for precisely the same reason that most people lie abed, namely, because
                        there was nothing else to do. On the morning after his arrival at Shirley he awoke early and
                        heard two things which attracted his attention. The first was a sound which puzzled him more
                        than a little. It was a steady, monotonous scraping of a most unaccountable kindsomewhat like
                        the sound of a carpenter&apos;s plane and some like that of a saw. Had it been out of doors
                        he <pb id="VAA2333-045" n="49" TEIform="pb"/> would have thought nothing of it; but clearly it
                        was in the house, and not only so, but in every part of the house except the bedrooms. Scrape,
                        scrape, scrape, scrape, scrape. What it meant he could not guess. As he lay there wondering
                        about it he heard another sound, greatly more musical, at which he jumped out of bed and began
                        dressing, wondering at this sound, too, quite as much as at the other, though he knew perfectly
                        well that this was nothing more than a human voiceMiss Sudie&apos;s, to wit. He wondered if
                        there ever was such a voice before or ever would be again. Not that the young woman was singing,
                        for she was doing nothing of the sort. She was merely giving some directions to the servants
                        about household matters, but her voice was music nevertheless, and Mr. Bob made up his mind to
                        hear it to better advantage by going down-stairs at once. Now I happen to know that this young
                        woman&apos;s voice was in no way peculiar to herself. Every well-bred girl in Virginia has
                        the same rich, full, soft tone, and they all say, as she did, &quot;grauss,&quot;
                        &quot;glauss&quot; &quot;bausket,&quot; &quot;cyarpet,&quot;
                        &quot;cyart,&quot; &quot;gyarden,&quot; and &quot;gyirl.&quot; But it so
                        happened that Mr. Bob had never heard a Virginian girl talk before lie met Miss Barksdale, and
                        to him her rich German a&apos;s and the musical tones of her voice were peculiarly her own.
                        Perhaps all these things would have impressed him differently if &quot;Cousin
                        Sudie&quot; had been an ugly girl. I have no means of determining the point, inasmuch as
                        &quot;Cousin Sudie&quot; was certainly anything else than ugly.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Mr. Robert made a hasty toilet and descended to the <pb id="VAA2333-046" n="50"
                            TEIform="pb"/> great hall, or passage, as they call it in &quot;Virginia. As he did so
                        he discovered the origin of the scraping sound which had puzzled him, as it puzzles everybody
                        else who hears it for the first time. Dry &quot;pine tags&quot; (which is Virginian for
                        the needles of the pine) were scattered all over the floors, and several nergo women were busy
                        polishing the hard white planks by rubbing them with an indescribable implement made of a
                        section of log, a dozen corn husks (&quot;shucks,&quot; the Virginians call them a
                        &quot;corn husk&quot; in Virginia signifying a <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">cob</hi>
                        always), and a pole for handle.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Good morning, Cousin Robert. You/re up soon,&quot; said the little
                        woman, coming out of the dining-room and putting a soft, warm little hand in his great palm.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Now to young Pagebrook this was a totally new use of the word
                        &quot;soon,&quot; and I dare say he would have been greatly interested in it but for the
                        fact that the trim little woman who stood there, key-basket in hand, interested him more.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;You&apos;ve caught me in the midst of my housekeeping, hut never mind:
                        only be careful, or you&apos;ll slip on the pine tags; they&apos;re as slippery as
                        glass.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;And is that the reason they are scattered on the floor?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Yes, we polish with them. Up North you wax your floors instead,
                        don&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Yes, for balls and the like, I believe, hut commonly we have
                        carpets.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;What! in summer time, too?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O yes! certainly. Why not?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-047" n="51" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Why they&apos;re so warm. We take ours up soon in the spring, and never
                        put them down again until fall.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">This time Mr. Robert observed the queer use of the word &quot;soon,&quot; but
                        said nothing about it. He said instead:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;What a lovely morning it is! How I should like to ride horseback in this
                        air!&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Would you let mo ride with you?&quot; asked the little maiden.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Such a question, Cousin Sudie!&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Now I am free to confess that this last remark was unworthy Mr. Pagebrook. If not
                        ungrammatical, it is at least of questionable construction, and so not at all like Mr.
                        Pagebrook&apos;s usage. But the demoralizing effect of Miss Sudie Barksdale&apos;s
                        society did not stop here by any means, as we should see in due time.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;If you&apos;d really like to ride, I&apos;ll have the horses
                        brought,&quot; said the little lady.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;And you with me?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Yes, if I may.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I shall be more than happy.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Dick, ran up to the barn and tell Uncle Polidore to saddle Patty for me and
                        Graybeard for your Mas&apos; Robert. Do you hear? Excuse me, Cousin Robert, and
                        I&apos;ll put my habit.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Ten minutes later the pair reined in their horses on the top of a little hill, to
                        look at the sunrise. The morning was just cool enough to be thoroughly pleasant, aid the
                        exhilaration which comes of nothing else so surely as of rapid riding began to tell upon the
                        spirits of <pb id="VAA2333-048" n="52" TEIform="pb"/> both. Cousin Sudie was a, good rider and a
                        graceful one, and she knew it. Robert&apos;s riding hitherto had been done, for the most
                        part, in cities, and on smooth roads; but he held his horse with a firm hand, and controlled him
                        perforce of a strong will, which, &quot;with great personal fearlessness and a habit of
                        doing well whatever he undertook to do at all, and undertaking whatever was expected of him,
                        abundantly supplied the lack he had of experience in the rougher riding of Virginia on the less
                        perfectly trained horses in use there. He was a stalwart fellow, with, shapely limbs and perfect
                        ease of movement, so that on horseback he was a very agreeable young gentleman to look at, a
                        fact of which Miss Sudie speedily became conscious. Her rides were chiefly without a cavalier,
                        as they were usually taken early in the morning before her cousin Billy thought of getting up;
                        and naturally enough she enjoyed the presence of so agreeable a young gentleman as Mr. Rob
                        certainly was, and her enjoyment of his companyshe being a womanwas not diminished in the least
                        by the discovery that to his intellectual and social accomplishments, which were very genuine,
                        there were added a handsome face, a comely person, and a manly enthusiasm for out-door exercise.
                        When he pulled some wild flowers which grew by the road-side without dismountinga trick he had
                        picked up somewhereshe wondered at the ease and grace with which it was done; when he added to
                        the flowers a little cluster of purple berries from a wild vine, of which I do not know the
                        name, and a sprig of sumac, still wet with dew, sue admired his taste; and when he gallantly
                        asked <pb id="VAA2333-049" n="53" TEIform="pb"/> leave to twine the whole into her hair, for her
                        hat had come off, as good-looking young women&apos;s hats always do such occasions, she
                        thought him &quot;just nice.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">It is really astonishing how rapidly acquaintanceships form under favorable
                        circumstances. These two young people were shy, both of them, and on the preceding day had
                        hardly spoken to each other at all. When they mounted their horses that morning they were almost
                        strangers, and they might have remained only half acquaintances for a week or a fortnight but
                        for that morning&apos;s ride. They were gone an hour, perhaps, in all, and when they sat
                        down to breakfast they were on terms of easy familiarity and genuine friendship.</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">AFTER breakfast Robert walked out with Billy to see the negroes at work cutting
                        tobacco, an interesting operation always, and especially so when one sees it for the first time.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Gilbert,&quot; said Billy to his &quot;head man,&quot;
                        &quot;did you find any ripe enough to cut in the lot there by the prize barn?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;No sah; dat&apos;s de greenest lot of tobawkah on de plantation, for
                        all &apos;twas plaunted fust. I dunno what to make uv it.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Why, Billy, I thought Cousin Edwin owned the &apos;prize&apos;
                        barn!&quot; said Robert.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;So he doeshis.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Are there two of them then?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Two of them? What do you mean? Every plantation has its prize barn, of
                        course.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Indeed! Who gives the prizes?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Ha! ha! Bob, that&apos;s good; only you&apos;d better ask <hi

                        you&apos;ll get yourself laughed at. A prize barn is simply the barn in which we prize
                        tobacco.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-051" n="55" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;And what is &apos; prizing&apos; tobacco?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Possibly &apos;prize&apos; a&apos;n&apos;t good English,
                        Bob, but it&apos;s the standard Ethiopian for pressing, and everybody here uses it. We press
                        the tobacco in hogsheads, you know, and we call it prizing. It never struck me as a peculiarly
                        Southern use of the word, but perhaps it is for all that. You&apos;re as sharp set as a
                        circular saw after dialect, a&apos;n&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I really do not know precisely how sharp set a circular saw is, but I am
                        greatly interested in your peculiar uses of English, certainly.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Upon returning to the house Billy said:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Bob I must let you take care of yourself for two or three hours now, as I
                        have some papers to draw up and they won&apos;t wait. Next week is court week, and
                        I&apos;ve got a great deal to do between now and then. But you&apos;re at home you know,
                        old fellow.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">So saying Mr. Billy went to his office, which was situated in the yard, while Robert
                        strolled into the house. Looking into the dining-room he saw there Cousin Sudie. Possibly the
                        young gentleman was looking for her. I am sure I do not know. But whether he had expected to
                        find her there or not, he certainly felt some little surprise as he looked at her.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Why, Cousin Sudie, is it possible that you are washing the
                        dishes?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O certainly! and the plates and cups too. In fact, I wash up all the things
                        once a day.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Pray tell me, cousin, precisely what you understand by
                        &apos;dishes,&apos; if I&apos;m not intruding,&quot; said Robert.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-052" n="56" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O not at all! come in and sit down. You&apos;ll find it pleasanter
                        there by the window. &apos;Dishes?&apos; Why, that is a dish, and that and
                        that,&quot; pointing to them.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I see. The word &apos;dishes&apos; is not a generic term in
                        Virginia, but applies only to platters and vegetable dishes. What do you call them in the
                        aggregate, Cousin Sudie? I mean plates, platters, cups, saucers, and everything.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Why &apos;things,&apos; I suppose. We speak of &apos;breakfast
                        things,&apos; &apos;tea things,&apos; &apos;dinner things.&apos; But why
                        were you astonished to see me washing them, Cousin Robert?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Perhaps I ought to have known better, but the fact is I had an impression
                        that Southern ladies were wholly exempt from all work except, perhaps, a little embroidery or
                        some such thing.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O my! I wish you could see me during circuit court week, when Uncle Carter
                        and Cousin Billy bring the judge and the lawyers home with them at all sorts of odd hours; and
                        they always bring the hungriest ones there are too. I fall at once into a chronic state of
                        washing up things and don&apos;t recover until court is over.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;But really, cousinpardon me if I am inquisitive, for I am greatly
                        interested in this life here in Virginia, it so new to mehow is it that <hi rend="i"
                            TEIform="hi">you</hi> must wash up things at all?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Why, I carry the keys, you know. I&apos;m housekeeper.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, but you have servants enough, certainly, and to spare.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O yes! but every lady washes up the things at least once a day. It would
                        never do to trust it altogether to the servants, you know.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-053" n="57" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <figure entity="VAA2333-3" TEIform="figure">

                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;None of them are sufficiently careful and trustworthy, do you
                        mean?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, not exactly that; but it&apos;s our way here, and if a lady were
                        to neglect it people would think her a poor housekeeper.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Are there any other duties devolving upon Virginian housekeepers besides
                        &apos;washing up things?&apos; You see I am trying to learn all I can of a life which is
                        as charmingly strange to me as that of Turkey or China would be if I were to go to either
                        country.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Any other duties? Indeed there are, and you shall learn what they are, if
                        you won&apos;t find it stupid to go my rounds with me. I&apos;m going now.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I should find dullness itself interesting with you as my fellow observer of
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Right gallantly said, kind sir,&quot; said Miss Sudie, with an
                        exaggerated curtsy. &quot;But if you&apos;re going to make pretty speeches I&apos;ll
                        get impudent directly. I&apos;m dreadfully given to it anyhow, and I&apos;ve a notion to
                        say one imprudent thing right now.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Pray do. I pardon you in advance.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, then, what makes you say &apos;Virginian housekeepers?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;What else should I say?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Why, Virginia housekeepers, of course, like anybody else.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;But &apos;Virginia&apos; is not an adjective, cousin. You would not
                        say &apos;England housekeepers&apos; or &apos;Franco housekeepers,&apos; would
                        you?&quot; asked Robert.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;No, but I would say &apos;New York housekeepers,&apos;
                        &apos;Massachusetts <pb id="VAA2333-055" n="60" TEIform="pb"/> housekeepers,&apos; or
                        &apos;New Jersey housekeepers,&apos; and so I say &apos;Virginia
                        housekeepers,&apos; too. I reckon you would find it a little troublesome to carry out your
                        rule, wouldn&apos;t you, Cousin Robert?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I am fairly beaten, I own; and in consideration of my frank acknowledgment
                        of defeat, perhaps you will permit <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">me</hi> to be a trifle
                        impudent.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;After that gallant speech you made just now, I can hardly believe such a
                        thing possible. But let me hear you try, please.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O it&apos;s very possible, I assure you!&quot; said Robert.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;See if it is not. What I want to ask is, why you Virginians so often use
                        the word &apos;reckon&apos; in the sense of &apos;think&apos; or
                        &apos;presume,&apos; as you did a moment since?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Because it&apos;s right,&quot; said Sudie.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;No, cousin, it is not good English,&quot; replied Robert.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Perhaps not, but it&apos;s <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">good
                        Virginian</hi>, and that&apos;s better for my purposes. Besides, it must be good English.
                        St. Paul used it twice.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Did he? I was not aware that the Apostle to the Gentiles spoke English at
                        all.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Come, Cousin Robert, I must give out dinner now. Do you want to carry my
                        key-basket?&quot;</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">MY friend who writes novels tells me that there is no other kind of exercise which so
                        perfectly rests an over-tasked brain as riding on horseback does. His theory is that when the
                        mind is overworked it will not quit working at command, but goes on with the labor after the
                        tools have been laid aside. If the worker goes to bed, either he finds it impossible to go to
                        sleep or sleeping he dreams, his mind thus working harder in sleep than if he were awake.
                        Walking, this novelist friend says, affords no relief. On the contrary, one thinks better when
                        walking than at any other time. But on horseback he finds it impossible to confine his thoughts
                        to any subject for two minutes together. He may begin as many trains of thought as he chooses,
                        but he never gets past their beginning. The motion of the animal jolts it all up into a jumble,
                        and rest is the inevitable result. The man&apos;s animal spirits rise, in sympathy, perhaps,
                        with those of his horse, and as the animal in him begins to assert itself his intellect yields
                        to its master and suffers itself to become quiescent.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-057" n="62" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">Now it is possible that Mr. Robert Pagebrook had found out this fact about horseback
                        exercise, and determined to profit by it to the extent of securing all the intellectual rest he
                        could during his stay at Shirley. At any rate, his early morning ride with &quot;Cousin
                        Sudie&quot; was repeated, not once, but every day when decided rain did not interfere. He
                        became greatly interested, too, in the Virginian system of housekeeping, and made daily study of
                        it in company with Miss Sudie, whose key-basket he carried as she went her rounds from
                        dining-room to smoke-house, from smoke-house to store-room, from store-room to garden, and from
                        garden to the shady gable of the house, where Miss Sudie &quot;set&quot; the churn every
                        morning, a process which consisted of scalding it out, putting in the cream, and wrapping wet
                        cloths all over the head of it and far up the dasher handle, as a precaution against the
                        possible results of carelessness on the part of the half dozen little darkeys whose daily duty
                        it was to &quot;chun.&quot; Mr. Robert soon became well versed in all the mysteries of
                        &quot;giving out&quot; dinner and other things pertaining to the office of housekeeperan
                        office in which every Virginian woman takes pride, and one in the duties of which every wellbred
                        Virginian girl is thoroughly skilled. (Corollarygood dinners and general comfort.)</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Old &quot;Aunty&quot; cooks are always extremely slow of motion, and so the
                        young ladies who carry the keys have a good deal of necessary leisure during their morning
                        rounds. Miss Sudie had a pretty little habit, as a good many other young women there have, of
                        carrying a book in her key-basket, so that she might read while aunt <pb id="VAA2333-058" n="63"
                            TEIform="pb"/> Kizzey (I really do not know of what proper noun this very common one is an
                        abbreviation) made up her tray. Picking up a volume he found there one morning, Robert continued
                        a desultory conversation by saying:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;You don&apos;t read Montaigne, do you, Cousin Sudie?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O yes! I read everythingor anything, rather. I never saw a book I
                        couldn&apos;t get something out of, except Longfellow.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Except Longfellow!&quot; exclaimed Robert in surprise.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Is it possible you don&apos;t enjoy Longfellow? Why, that is heresy of
                        the rankest kind!&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I know it is, but I&apos;m a heretic in a good many things. I hate
                        Longfellow&apos;s hexameters; I don&apos;t like Tennyson; and I can&apos;t
                        understand Browning any better than he understands himself. I know I ought to like them all, as
                        you all up North do, but I don&apos;t.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Mr. Robert was shocked. Here was a young girl, fresh and healthy, who could read
                        prosy old Montaigne&apos;s chatter with interest; who knew Pope by heart, and Dryden almost
                        as well; who read the prose and poetry of the eighteenth century constantly, as he knew; and
                        who, on a former occasion, had pleaded guilty to a liking for sonnets, but who could find
                        nothing to like in Tennyson, Longfellow, or Browning. Somehow the discovery was m agreeable one
                        to him though he could hardly say why, and so he chose not to pursue the subject further just
                        then. He said instead:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;That is the queerest Virginianism I&apos;ve heard yet &apos;you

                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Sometimes. Why?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Do you remember what he says about custom and grammar?&quot;</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">MR. ROBBET left the house on his way to The Oaks in an excellent humor with, himself
                        and with everybody else. His cousin Billy and his uncle Col. Barksdale were both absent, in
                        attendance upon a court in another county, and so Mr. Robert had recently been left almost alone
                        with Miss Sudie, and now that they had become the very best of friends our your man enjoyed this
                        state of affairs right heartily. In truth Miss Sudie was a young lady Tory much to Mr.
                        Robert&apos;s taste, in saying which I pay that your gentleman as handsome a compliment as
                        any well regulated man could wish.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Mr. Robert walked briskly out of the front gate and down the road, enjoying the
                        bright sun and the rich coloring of the October woodlands, and making merry in his heart by
                        running over in his memory the chats he had been having of late with the little woman who
                        carried the keys at Shirley. If he had been forced to tell precisely what had been said in those
                        conversation, it must be confessed that a stranger would have found very little of interest in
                        the repetition, but somehow the recollection <pb id="VAA2333-061" n="66" TEIform="pb"/> brought
                        a frequent smile to our young friend&apos;s face and put an additional springiness into Ms
                        step. His intercourse with this cousin by brevet may not have been especially brilliant or of a
                        nature calculated to be particularly interesting to other people, but to him it had been
                        extremely agreeable, without doubt.</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">As Phil tnrned away Dr. Harrison rode up.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Good morning, Mr. Pagebrook. On your way to The Oaks?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I was, but if you are going to Shirley I will walk back with you!&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O no! no! I am only going to stop there a moment. I am on my way to se some
                        patients at Exenholm, and as I had to go past Shirley I brought the mail, that&apos;s all.
                        I&apos;ll not be there ten minutes, and I know they&apos;re expecting you at The Oaks. I
                        brought Ewing along with me from the Court House. Foggy had been too much for him
                        again.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Why the boy promised me lie would not gamble again.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Oh! it&apos;s hardly gambling. Only a little game of loo. Every
                        gentleman plays a little. I take a hand myself, now and then; but Foggy is a pretty old bird,
                        you know, and he&apos;s too much, for your cousin. Ewing oughtn&apos;t to play with <hi
                            rend="i" TEIform="hi">him</hi>, of course, and that&apos;s why I brought him away with
                        mo. By the way, we&apos;re going to got a fox up in a day or two and show you some sport.
                        The tobacco&apos;s <pb id="VAA2333-063" n="68" TEIform="pb"/> all cut now, and. the dogs are
                        in capital orderas thin as a lath. You must be with us, of course. &quot;We&apos;ll get
                        up one in pine quarter, and he&apos;s sure to run towards the river; so you can come in as
                        the hounds pass Shirley.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I should like to see a fox hunt, certainly, hut I have no proper
                        horse,&quot; said Robert.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Why, where&apos;s Graybeard? Billy told me he had turned him over to
                        you to use and abuse.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;So he did, and he is riding his bay at present. But Graybeard is quite lame
                        just now.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Ride the bay then. Billy will be back from court tonight, won&apos;t
                        he?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Yes; but he will want to join in the chase, I suppose.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I reckon he will, but he can ride something else. He don&apos;t often
                        care to take the tail, and he can see as much as he likes on one of his
                        &apos;conestogas.&apos; I&apos;ll tell you what you can do. Winger&apos;s got a
                        splendid colt, pretty well broken, and you can get him for a dollar or two if you
                        a&apos;n&apos;t afraid to ride him. You must manage it somehow, so as to be &apos;in
                        at the death!&apos; I want you to see some riding.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Mr. Robert promised to see what he could do. He greatly wanted to ride after the
                        hounds for once at least, though it must be confessed he would have been better pleased had the
                        hounds to be ridden after belonged to somebody else besides the gentleman familiarly known as
                        &quot;Foggy,&quot; a personage for whom Mr. Robert had certainly not conceived a very
                        great liking. That the reader may know whether his prejudice was a well-founded one or not <pb
                            id="VAA2333-064" n="69" TEIform="pb"/> it will be necessary for me to go hack a little and
                        gather up some of the loose threads of my story, while our young man is on his way to The Oaks.
                        I have been so deeply interested in the ripening acquaintanceship between Mr. Rob and Miss Sudie
                        that I have neglected to introduce some other personages, less agreeable perhaps, hut not less
                        important to the proper understanding of this history. Leaving young Pagebrook on the road,
                        therefore, let me tell the reader, in a new chapter, something about the people he had met
                        outside the hospitable Shirley mansion.</p>

                    </head>
                    <p TEIform="p">DR. CHARLES HARBISON&quot; was a young man of twenty-five or six, a distant
                        relative of the Barks-dalesso distant indeed that he would never have known himself as a
                        relative at all, if he and they had not been Virginians. He &quot;was a young man of good
                        parts, fond of field sports, reasonably well behaved in all external matters, hut without any
                        very fixed moral principles. He was a gentleman, in the strict Virginian sense of the term. That
                        is to say he was of a good family, was well educated, and had never done anything to disgrace
                        him-self; wherefore he was received in all gentlemen&apos;s houses as an equal. He drank a
                        little too freely on occasion, and played bluff and loo a trifle too often, the elderly people
                        thought; but these things, it was commonly supposed, were only youthful follies. He would grow
                        out of them marry and settle down after awhile. He was on the whole a very agreeable person to
                        be with, and very much, of a gentleman I his manner.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Foggy&quot; Raves was an anomaly. His precise position in the social
                        scale was a very difficult thing to discover, <pb id="VAA2333-066" n="71" TEIform="pb"/> and is
                        still more difficult to define. His father had bee an overseer, and so &quot;Foggy&quot;
                        was certainly not a &quot;gentleman.&quot; Other men of parentage similar to his knew
                        their places, and when business made it necessary for them to visit the house of a gentleman
                        they expected to be received in the porch if the weather were tolerable, and in the dining-room
                        if it were not. They never dreamed of being taken into the parlor, introduced to the family, or
                        invited to dinner. All these things were well recognized customs; the line of demarkation
                        between &quot;gentlemen&quot; and &quot;common people&quot; was very sharply
                        drawn indeed. The two classes lived on excellent terms with each other, but they never mixed.
                        The gentleman was always courteous to the common people out of respect for him-self; while the
                        common people were very deferential to every gentleman as a matter of duty. Now this man Raves
                        was not a &quot;gentleman.&quot; That much was clear. And yet, for some inscrutable
                        reason, his position among the people who knew him was not exactly that of a common man. He was
                        never invited into gentlemen&apos;s houses precisely as a gentleman would have been, it is
                        true; and yet into gentlemen&apos;s houses he very often went, and that upon invitation too.
                        When young men happened to he keeping bachelors&apos; establishments, either temporarily or
                        permanently, &quot;Foggy&quot; was sure to be invited pretty frequently to see them. As
                        long as there were no ladies at home &quot;Foggy&quot; knew himself welcome, and he had
                        played whist and loo and bluff in many genteel parlors, into which he never thought of going
                        when there were ladies on the plantation. He kept a fine pack of hounds <pb id="VAA2333-067"
                            n="72" TEIform="pb"/> too, and was clearly at the liead of the &quot;fox-hunting
                        interest&quot; of the county; and this was an anomaly also, as fox-hunting is an eminently
                        aristorcratic sport, in which gentlemen engage only in compancy with gentlemenexcept in
                        &quot;Foggy&apos;s&quot; case.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Precisely what &quot;Foggy&apos;s&quot; business was it is difficult to
                        say. He was constable, for one thing, and <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">ex-officio</hi> county
                        jailor. One hall the jail building was fitted up as his residence, and there he lived, a
                        bachelor some fifty years old. He hired out horses and buggies in a small &quot;way now and
                        then, but his earnings were principally made at &quot;bluff&quot; and
                        &quot;loo.&quot; Once or twice Colonel Barksdale and some other gentlemen had tried to
                        oust &quot;Foggy&quot; from the jail, believing that his establishment there was ruining
                        a good many of the young men, as it certainly was. Failing in this they had him indicted for
                        gambling in a public place, but the prosecution failed, the court holding that the
                        jailor&apos;s private rooms in the jail could not be called a public place, though all rooms
                        in a hotel had been held public within the meaning of the statute.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">This man&apos;s Christian name was not &quot;Foggy,&quot; of course,
                        though hardly anybody knew what it really was. He had won his sobriquet in early life by paying
                        the professional gambler, Daniel K. Foggy, to teach him &quot;how to beat
                        roulette,&quot; and then winning his money back by putting his purchased knowledge to the

                        was a good fellow. He would go far out of his way to oblige anybody, and, as was pretty

                        faro bank. He played cards merely for amusement, he said, and there was a popular tendency to
                        believe his statement. The betting was simply to &quot;make it interesting,&quot; and
                        sometimes the play did grow very &quot;interesting&quot; indeedinteresting to the extent
                        of several hundred dollars frequently.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Now only about a week before the morning on which. Mr. Robert met Dr. Harrison, he
                        had gone to the Court House for the purpose of calling upon the doctor. &quot;While there
                        young Harrison had proposed that they go up to Foggy&apos;s, explaining that Foggy was
                        &quot;quite a character, whom you ought to know; not a gentleman, of course, but a good
                        fellow as ever lived.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Upon going to Foggy&apos;s, Robert had found his cousin Ewing Pagebrook there
                        playing cards. The boyfor he was not yet of agewas flushed and excited, and Robert saw at a
                        glance that he had been losing heavily. On Robert&apos;s entrance he threw down his cards
                        and declared himself tired of play.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I&apos;ll arrange that, Foggy,&quot; said the boy, with a nod.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O any time will do!&quot; replied the other. &quot;How
                        d&apos;ye do, Charley? Come in.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Dr. Charley introduced Robert, and the latter, barely recognizing Foggy&apos;s
                        greeting, turned to Ewing and asked:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;What have you been doing, Ewing? Not gambling, I hope.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O no! certainly not,&quot; said Foggy; &quot;only a little game of
                        draw-poker, ten cents ante.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, but how much have yon lost, Ewing?&quot; asked <pb
                            id="VAA2333-070" n="76" TEIform="pb"/> Robert. &quot;How much more than you can pay in
                        cash, I mean? I see you haven&apos;t settled the score.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Ewing was inclined to resent his cousin&apos;s questioning, but his rather weak
                        head was by no means a match for his cousin&apos;s strong one. This great hulking Robert
                        Page-brook was &quot;big all over,&quot; Billy Barksdale had said. His will was law to
                        most men when ho chose to assert it strongly. He now took his cousin in hand, and made Mm
                        confess to a debt of fifty dollars to the gambler. Then turning to Foggy ho said:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Mr. Raves, you have won all of this young man&apos;s money and fifty
                        dollars more, it appears. Now, as I understand the matter, this fifty dollars is &apos;a
                        debt of honor,&apos; in gambling parlance, and so it must be paid. But you must acknowledge
                        that you are more than a match for a mere boy, and you ought to &apos;give him
                        odds.&apos; I believe that is the correct phrase, is it not?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Yes, that&apos;s right; but how can you give odds in
                        draw-poker?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I am going to show you, though I am certainly not acquainted with the
                        mysteries of that game. Yon and he think he owes you fifty dollars. Now my opinion is that he
                        owes you nothing, while you owe him the precise amount of case you have won from him; and I
                        propose to effect a compromise. The law of Virginia is pretty stringent, I believe, on the
                        subject of gambling with people under age, and if I were disposed I could give you some trouble
                        on that score. But I propose instead to pay you ten dollarsjust enough to make a receipt worth
                        whileand to take your receipt in full for the amount <pb id="VAA2333-071" n="77" TEIform="pb"/>
                        due. I shall then take my cousin home, and he can pay me at his leisure. I s that satisfactory,
                        sir?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Mr. Robert was in a towering rage, though his manner was as quiet as it is possible
                        to conceive, and his voice was as soft and smooth as a woman&apos;s. Had Foggy been disposed
                        to presume upon his antagonist&apos;s? apparent calmness and to play the bully, he would
                        unquestionably have got himself into trouble of a physical sort there and then. To speak
                        plainly, Robert Pagebrook was quite prepared to punish the gambler with his fists, and would
                        undoubtedly have made short work of it had Foggy provoked him with a word. But Foggy never
                        quarreled. He knew his business too well for that. He never gave himself airs with gentlemen. He
                        knew his place too well. He never got himself involved in any kind of disturbance which would
                        attract attention to himself. He knew the consequences too well. He was always quiet, always
                        deferential, always satisfied; and so, while he had no reason to anticipate the thrashing which
                        Robert Pagebrook was aching to give him, he nevertheless was as complacent as possible in his
                        reply to that gentleman.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Why certainly, Mr. Pagebrook. I never meant to take the money at all. I
                        only wanted to frighten our young friend here, and teach him a lesson. He thinks he can play
                        cards when he can&apos;t, and I wanted to &apos;break him of sticking eggs,&apos;
                        that&apos;s all. I meant to let him think he had to pay me so as to scare him, for I feel an
                        interest in Ewing. &apos;Pon my word I do. Now let me tell you, Ewing, we&apos;ll call
                        this square, and you mustn&apos;t play no more, You play honest now, but if you keep on
                        you&apos;ll <pb id="VAA2333-072" n="78" TEIform="pb"/> cheat a little alter awhile, and when
                        a man cheats at cards, Ewing, he&apos;ll steal. Mind, I speak from experience, for
                        I&apos;ve seen a good deal of this thing. Come, Charley, you and Mr. Pagebrook,
                        let&apos;s take something. I&apos;ve got some splendid Shield&apos;s
                        whisky.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Mr. Pagebrook summoned sufficient courtesy to decline the alcoholic
                        hospitality-without rudeness, and, with his cousin, took his leave.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Ewing entreated Robert to keep the secret he had thus stumbled upon, and Robert
                        promised to do so upon the express condition that Ewing would wholly refrain from playing cards
                        for money in future. This the youth promised to do, and our friend Robert congratulated himself
                        upon his success in saving his well-meaning but rather weak-headed cousin from certain ruin.</p>

                    </head>
                    <p TEIform="p">IN view of the circumstances detailed in the preceding chapter, it was quite natural
                        that Robert Pagebrook should feel some annoyance when he learned from young Harrison that his
                        cousin had again fallen into the hands of Foggy Raves. And he did feel annoyance, and a good
                        deal of it, as he resumed his walk toward The Oaks. Aside from his interest in his cousin,
                        Robert disliked to be beaten at anything, and to find that the gambler had fairly beaten him in
                        his fight for the salvation of Ewing was anything but agreeable to him. Then again his cousin
                        had shown himself miserable weak of moral purpose, and weaknesses were always unpleasant things
                        for Robert Pagebrook to contemplate. He had no sympathy with irresolution of any sort, and no
                        patience with unstable moral knees. He was half angry and wholly grieved, therefore, when he
                        heard of Ewing&apos;s violation of his promise. His first impulse was to go before the next
                        grand jury and secure Foggy&apos;s indictment for gambling with a minor, but a maturer
                        reflection convinced him that while this would be an agreeable thing to do under <pb
                            id="VAA2333-074" n="80" TEIform="pb"/> the circumstances, it would be an unwise one as well.
                        To expose Ewing was to ruin him hopelessly, Robert felt, knowing as he did that reformation in
                        the face of public disgrace requires a good deal more of moral stamina than Ewing Pagebrook ever
                        had. Precisely what to do Robert did not know. He would, talk with. Cousin Sudie about the
                        matter, and see what she thought was best. Her judgment, he had discovered, was particularly
                        good, and it might help him to a determination.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">This thinking of Cousin Sudie brought back to his mind Phil&apos;s hint as to the
                        purpose of Dr. Harrison&apos;s visit, and his face burned as the conviction came to him that
                        this man might be Cousin Sudie&apos;s accepted or acceptable lover. He knew well enough that
                        Harrison called frequently at Shirley; but surely Cousin Sndie would have mentioned the man
                        often in conversation if he had been largely in her mind. Would she though? This was a second
                        thought. Was not her silence, on the contrary, rather an indication that she did think of the
                        man? If she recognized him as a lover, would she not certainly avoid all unnecessary mention of
                        his name? &quot;Was not Phil likely to be pretty well informed in the case? All these things
                        ran rapidly through his perturbed mind. But why should he worry himself over a matter that in no
                        way concerned him? <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">He</hi> was not interested in Cousin Sudie except
                        as a friend. Of course not. Was not his heart still sore from its suffering at the hands of Miss
                        Nellie Currier? No; upon the whole he was forced to confess that it was not. In truth he had not
                        thought of that young lady for at least a fortnight; and now that he did <pb id="VAA2333-075"
                            n="81" TEIform="pb"/> think of her he could not possibly understand how or why he had ever
                        cared for her at all. But he was not in love with Cousin Sudie. Of that he was certain. And yet
                        he could not avoid a feeling of very decided annoyance at the thought suggested by
                        Phil&apos;s remark. He new young Harrison very slightly, but ho was accustomed to take
                        men&apos;s measures pretty promptly, and ho was not at all satisfied with this one as a
                        suitor for Cousin Sudie. He knew that Foggy was the young physician&apos;s pretty constant
                        associates. He knew that Harrison drank at times to excess, and he felt that he was not over
                        scrupulous upon nice points of morality. In short, our pretty indignation when he met Maj.
                        Pagebrook&apos;s overseer, Winger. A negotiation immediately ensued, ending in an agreement
                        that Robert should ride the black colt so long as Graybeard&apos;s lameness should continue,
                        paying Winger a moderate hire for the animal.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The bargain concluded, Winger dismounted and Robert took his place on the
                        colt&apos;s back, borrowing Winger&apos;s saddle until his return to Shirley in the
                        evening.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Horseback exercise is a curious thing, certainly, in some of its effects. When Robert
                        was afoot that morning several things had combined, as we have seen, to make him gloomy,
                        despondent, and generally out of sorts. Ewing&apos;s backsliding had annoyed him, and the
                        possibility or probability of Phil&apos;s accuracy of information and judgment in the matter
                        of Cousin Sudie and Dr. Harrison had depressed him sorely. When he found himself on <pb
                            id="VAA2333-076" n="82" TEIform="pb"/> the back of this magnificent colt, whose delight it
                        was to carry a strong, fearless rider, he fell immediately into hearty sympathy with the high
                        spirits and bounding pulses of the animal. He struck out into a gallop, and in an instant felt
                        himself in a far brighter world than that which he had been traversing ten minutes since. His
                        spirits rose. His hopefulness returned. The world became better and the future more promising.
                        Mr. Robert Pagebrook felt the unreasonable but thoroughly delightful exhilaration to which Billy
                        Barksdale referred when he said, &quot;Bob is the happiest fellow in the world; he gets glad
                        sometimes just because he is alive.&quot; That was precisely the state of affairs. Mr.
                        Robert on this high-mettled horse was superlatively alive, and was glad because of it. There is
                        more of joy than many people know in the mere act of living; but it is only they who have clear
                        consciences, springy muscles, and perfect health of both mind and body who fully share this joy.
                        Robert Pagebrook had all of these, and was astride a perfect horse to boot; and that, as all
                        horsemen know, is an important element in the matter.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">He galloped on toward The Oaks, leaving his troubles just where he mounted his house.
                        He forgot Ewing&apos;s apostasy; he forgot Dr. Harrison, but he remembered Cousin Sudie, and
                        that right pleasantly too. Naturally enough, being on horseback, he projected himself into the
                        future, which is always a bright world when one is galloping toward it. He would heartily enjoy
                        the coming fox-chaseparticularly on such an animal as that now under him. Then his thoughts
                        pushed themselves still <pb id="VAA2333-077" n="83" TEIform="pb"/> further forward, and he
                        dreamed dreams. His full professorship would pay him a salary sufficient to justify him in
                        setting up a little establishment of his own, and he should then know what it was to have a home
                        in which there should be love and purity and peace and domestic comfort. The woman who was to
                        form the center of all this bliss was vaguely undefined as to identity and other details. She
                        existed only in outline, in the picture, but that outline strikingly resembled the young woman
                        who carried the key-basket at Shirleyan accidental resemblance, of course, for Mr. Robert
                        Pagebrook was positive that he was not in love with Cousin Sudie.</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">HOW largely Mr. Robert&apos;s high spirits were the result of rapid riding on a
                        good horse, and how far other causes aided in producing them, I am wholly unprepared to say.
                        Whatever their cause was they were not destined to last long after he dismounted at The Oaks.
                        Indeed his day at that country seat was not at all an agreeable one. His cousin Sarah Ann was a
                        rather depressing person to be with at any time, and there were circumstances which made her
                        especially so on this particular occasion. Cousin Sarah Ann had a chronic habit of being
                        ostentatiously sorry for herself, which was very disagreeable to a healthy young man like
                        Robert. She nursed and cherished her griefs as if they had been her children, and like children
                        they grew under the process. She had several times told Robert how lonely she was since the
                        death of her mother, three years before, and with tears in her eyes she had complained that
                        there was nobody to love her now that poor mother was gonea statement which right-thinking and
                        logical Robert felt himself almost guilty in hearing from a woman with a <pb id="VAA2333-079"
                            n="85" TEIform="pb"/> husband and a house full of children. She complained a good deal of
                        her poverty, too, a complaining which shocked this truthful young man, knowing, as he did, that
                        his cousin Edwin was one of the wealthiest men in the country round about, with a good
                        plantation at home, a very large and profitable one in Mississippi, twenty or thirty business
                        buildings, well leased, in Richmond, a surplus of money in bank, and no debts whatever, which
                        last circumstance served to make him almost a curiosity in a state in which it was hardly
                        respectable to owe no money. She complained, too, that her boys were dull and her girls not
                        pretty, both of which complaints were very well founded indeed. When Robert on his first visit
                        pretty house, she replied:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Oh! I can&apos;t pretend to live in an aristocratic house like your
                        Aunt Mary&apos;s. I didn&apos;t inherit a family mansion&apos;s you know, and so we
                        had to build this house. It hasn&apos;t a bit of wainscoting, you see, and no old pictures.
                        I reckon I a&apos;n&apos;t as good as you Pagebrooks, and somehow my husband
                        a&apos;n&apos;t as aristocratic as the rest of you. I reckon he&apos;s only a
                        half-blood Pagebrook, and that&apos;s why he condescended to marry poor me.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">This was Cousin Sarah Ann&apos;s favorite way of speaking of herself, and she
                        said &quot;poor me&quot; with a degree of pathos in her tone which always brought tears
                        to her eyes.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">On the present occasion, as I have said, there were circumstances which enabled this
                        estimable lady to make herself unusually disagreeable. She had a fresh affliction, and so she
                        reveled in an ecstasy of woe. It was her ambition <pb id="VAA2333-080" n="86" TEIform="pb"/> in
                        life to be exceptionally miserable, and accordingly she welcomed sorrow with a keenness of
                        relish which few people can possibly know. She wouldn&apos;t be happy in heaven, Billy
                        Barksdale said, unless she could convince people there that she was snubbed by the saints and
                        put upon by the angels.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">When Robert arrived at The Oaks that morning Major Pagebrook met him at the gate,
                        according to custom, but without Ms customary cheerfulness of countenance. He offered no
                        explanation, however, and Robert asked no questions. The two went into the parlor, Robert
                        catching sight of Ewing in the orchard back of the house, but having no opportunity to speak to
                        the young man.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Robert had not been in the parlor many minutes before Major Pagebrook went out and
                        Cousin Sarah Ann entered and greeted him with her handkerchief to her eyes. She made one or two
                        ostentatious efforts to control herself, and then ostentatiously burst into tears.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Oh! Cousin Robert, I didn&apos;t mean to betray myself this way. But
                        I&apos;m so miserable. Ewing has been led away again by that man, Foggy Raves.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I am heartily sorry to know it, Cousin Sarah Ann, replied Robert.
                        &quot;Did lie lose much?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O Ewing never gambles! I don&apos;t mean that. Thank heaven my boy
                        never plays cards, except with small stakes for amusement. But he went over to the Court House
                        last night to stay with Charley Harrison, and they went up to Foggy&apos;s and they drank a
                        little too much. And now Cousin Edwin (Mrs. Pagebrook always called her husband Cousin Edwin) is
                        terribly angry about it and <pb id="VAA2333-081" n="87" TEIform="pb"/>

                        <pb id="VAA2333-082" n="89" TEIform="pb"/> has scolded the poor boy cruelly, cruelly. He even
                        threatened to cut him off with nothing at all in his will, and leave the poor boy to starve. Men
                        are so hard-hearted! The idea that I should live to hear my boy talked to in that way, and by
                        his own father too, almost kills me. Poor me! there&apos;s nobody to love me now.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Tell me, Cousin Sarah Ann,&quot; said Robert, &quot;for I am deeply
                        concerned in Swing&apos;s behalf, and I moan to reform him if I candoes he often get
                        drunk?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Get drunk! My boy never gets drunk! You talk just like Cousin Edwin. He
                        only drinks a little, as all young gentlemen do, and if he drinks too much now and then
                        I&apos;m sure it isn&apos;t s very dreadful as you all make it out. I don&apos;t see
                        why the poor boy must be kept down all the time and scolded and scolded and talked about, just
                        because he does like other people; and that&apos;s what distresses me. Cousin Edwin scholds
                        Ewing, and then scolds me for taking the poor boy&apos;s part, and it&apos;s more than I
                        can bear. And new you talk about &quot;reforming&apos; him!&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Robert explained that he had misunderstood the cause of Cousin Sarah Ann&apos;s
                        grief, but he thought it would be something worse than useless to tell her that she was ruining
                        the boy, as he saw clearly enough that she was. He turned the conversation, therefore, and
                        Cousin Sarah Ann speedily dried her eyes.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;You&apos;re riding Mr. Winger&apos;s horse, I see. What&apos;s
                        become of Graybeard?&quot; she asked, after a little time.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;He is a little lame just now. Nothing serious, but I thought I would hire
                        Winger&apos;s colt until he gets well.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Ah! I understand. The rides soon in the morning <pb id="VAA2333-083" n="90"
                            TEIform="pb"/> must not be given up on any terms. But you&apos;d better look out, Cousin
                        Robert. I&apos;m sorry for you if you lose your heart there.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Why, Cousin Sarah Aim, what do you mean? I really am not sure that I
                        understand yon.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Oh! I say nothing; but those rides every morning and all that housekeeping
                        that I&apos;ve heard about, arc dangerous things, cousin. I was a belle once
                        myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">It was one of Cousin Sarah Ann&apos;s favorite theories that she knew all about
                        bellehood, having been a belle herselfthough nobody else ever knew anything about that
                        particular part of her career.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, Cousin Sarah Ann, I do not think I have lost my heart, as you phrase
                        it; but prapy tell me why you should be sorry for me if I had?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Mr. Robert was at first about to declare positively that he had not fallen in love
                        with Cousin Sudie, but just at that moment it occurred to him that he might possibly be mistaken
                        about the matter, and being thoroughly truthful he chose the less positive form of denial,
                        supplementing it, as we have seen, with a question.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, for several reasons,&quot; replied Cousin Sarah Ann:
                        &quot;they do say that Charley Harrison is before you there, and anyhow, it would never do.
                        Sudie hasn&apos;t got much, you know. Her father didn&apos;t leave her anything but a
                        few hundred dollars, and that&apos;s all spent long ago, on her clothes and
                        schooling.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Mr. Robert Pagebrook certainly did not wish ill to Cousin Sudie, and yet he was
                        heartily though illogically glad when ho learned that that young lady was poor. <pb
                            id="VAA2333-084" n="91" TEIform="pb"/> The feeling surprised him, but he had no time in
                        which to analyze it just then.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Why, Cousin Sarah Ann, you certainly do not think me so mercenary as yur
                        remark would seem to indicate?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Oh! it&apos;s well enough to talk about not being mercenary, but I can
                        tell you that some money on one side or the other is very convenient. I know by experience what
                        it is to be poor. I might have married rich if I&apos;d wanted to, but I had lofty notions
                        like you.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The reader will please remember that I am no mere responsible for Mrs.
                        Pagebrook&apos;s syntax than for her sins.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;But, Cousin Sarah Ann,&quot; said Robert, &quot;you would not wish
                        one to marry a young woman&apos;s money or lands, would you?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;That&apos;s only your romantic way of putting it. I don&apos;t see
                        why you can&apos;t love a rich girl as well as a poor one, for my part. If you had plenty of
                        money yourself it wouldn&apos;t matter; but as it is you ought to marry so as to hang up
                        your hat.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I confess I do not exactly understand you figure of speech, Cousin Sarah
                        Ann! What do you mean by hanging up my hat?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Didn&apos;t you ever hear that before? It&apos;s a common saying
                        here, when a man marries a girl with a good plantation and a &apos;dead daddy,&apos; so
                        there can&apos;t be any doubt about the land being her&apos;sthey say he&apos;s got
                        nothing to do but walk in and hang up his hat.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">This explanation was lucid enough without doubt, but it, and indeed the entire
                        conversation, was extremely disagreeable to Robert, who was sufficiently old-fashioned to <pb
                            id="VAA2333-085" n="92" TEIform="pb"/> think that marriage was a holy thing, and ho, being a
                        man of good taste, disliked to hear holy things lightly spoken of. He was relieved, therefore,
                        by Maj. Pagebrook&apos;s entrance, and not long afterwards he was invited to go up to the
                        blue-room, the way to which he knew perfectly well, to rest awhile before dinner.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">In the blue-room he found Ewing, with a headache, lying on a lounge. The youth had
                        purposely gone thither, probably, in order that his meeting with Robert might be a private one,
                        for meet him he must, as he very well knew, at dinner if not before.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Robert sat down by him and held his head as tenderly as a woman could have done, and
                        speaking gently said:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I am very sorry to find you suffering, Ewing. You must ride with me after
                        dinner, and the air will relieve your head, I hope.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The boy actually burst into tears, and presently, recovering from the paroxysm, said:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I didn&apos;t expect that, Cousin Robert. Those are the first kind
                        words I&apos;ve heard to-day. Mother has called me hard names all the morning.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Your <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">mother!</hi>&quot; exclaimed Robert,
                        thrown off his guard by surprise, for he would never have thought of questioning the boy on such
                        a subject.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O yes! she always docs. If she&apos;d ever give me any credit when I do
                        try to do right, I reckon I would try harder. But she calls me a drunkard and gambler when-every
                        there is the least excuse for it; and if I don&apos;t do anything wrong she says I am pokey
                        and a&apos;n&apos;t got any spirit. She told me this morning she didn&apos;t mean to
                        leave me <pb id="VAA2333-086" n="93" TEIform="pb"/> anything in her will, because I&apos;d
                        squander it. You know all pa&apos;s property is in her name now. I got mad at last and told
                        her I knew she couldn&apos;t keep me from getting my share, because nearly half of
                        everything here belonged to Grandfather Taylor and is willed to us children when we come of age.
                        She didn&apos;t know I knew that, and when I told her&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Come, Ewing, don&apos;t talk about that. You have no right to tell me
                        such things. Bathe your head now, and hold it up as a man should. You are responsible to
                        yourself for yourself, and it is your duty to make a man of yourselfsuch a man as you need not
                        he ashamed of. If you think you do not receive the recognition you ought for your efforts to do
                        well, you should rememher that things are not perfectly adjusted in this world, so far at least
                        as we can understand them. The reward of manliness is the manliness itself; and it is well worth
                        living for too, even though nobody recognizes its existence but your-self. Of that, however,
                        there need be no fear. People will know you, sooner or later, precisely as you are.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Robert had other encouraging things to say to the youth, and finally said:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Now, Ewing, I shall ask you to make no promises which you may not be strong
                        enough to keep; but if you will promise me to make an earnest effort to let whisky and cards
                        alone, and to make a man of yourself, refusing to be led by other people, I will talk with your
                        father and to aid you with every encouragement in his power for the future.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-087" n="94" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Why, Cousin Robert, pa never says anything to me. When ma scolds lie just
                        goes out of the house, and he don&apos;t come in again till he&apos;s obliged to. It
                        a&apos;n&apos;t pa at all, it&apos;s ma, and it a&apos;n&apos;t any use to
                        talk to her. I&apos;ll be of age pretty soon, and. then I mean to take my share of
                        grandpa&apos;s estate, and put it into money and go clear away from here.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Robert saw that it would be idle to remonstrate with the young man at present, and
                        equally idle to interfere with the domestic governmental system practiced by Cousin Sarah Ann.
                        He devoted himself, therefore, to the task of getting Ewing to bathe his head; and after a
                        little time the two wont down to dinner, Ewing thinking Robert the only real friend he could
                        claim.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">His head aching worse after dinner than before, ho declined Robert&apos;s
                        invitation to go to Shirley, and our friend rode back alone.</p>

                        Sarah Ann, and yet it can not be said that our young gentleman was buoyant of spirit as he rode
                        from The Oaks to Shirley. Eiving&apos;s case had depressed him, and Cousin Sarah Ann had
                        depressed him still further. His confidence in woman nature was shaken. His ideas on the subject
                        of women had been for the most part evolvedwrought out, <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">a priori</hi>,
                        from his mother as a premise. He had known all the time that not every woman was his
                        mother&apos;s equal, if indeed any woman was; he had observed that some-times vanity and
                        weakness and in one case, as we know, faithlessness entered into the composition of women, but
                        he had never conceived of such a compound of &quot;envy, hatred and malice, and all
                        uncharitableness&quot; as his cousin Sarah Ann certainly was; and. as he applied the
                        quotation mentally he was constrained also to utter the petition which accompanies it in the
                        litany&quot;Good Lord deliver us!&quot; This woman was a mystery to him. She not only
                            <pb id="VAA2333-089" n="96" TEIform="pb"/> shocked but she puzzled him. How anybody could
                        consent to be just such, a person as she was was wholly incomprehensible. Her departures from
                        the right line of true womanhood were so entirely purposeless that he could trace them to no
                        logical starting-point. He could conceive of no possible training or experience which ought to
                        result in such a character as hers.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">After puzzling himself over this human problem for half an hour he gave it up, and
                        straightway began to work at another. He asked himself how it could be possible that Cousin
                        Sudie should be attracted by Dr. Charley Harrison. Possibly the reader has had occasion to work
                        at a similar problem in his time, and if so I need not tell him how incapable it proved of
                        solution. Of the fact Robert was now convinced, and the fact annoyed him. It annoyed him too
                        that he could not account for the fact; and then it annoyed him still more to know that he could
                        be annoyed at all in the case, for he was perfectly sureor nearly sothat he was not himself in
                        love with his little friend at Shirley. And yet he felt a strange yearning to battle in some way
                        with young Harrison, and to conquer him. He wanted to beat the man at something, it mattered
                        little what, and to triumph over him. But he did not allow himself even mentally to formulate
                        this feeling. If he had he would have discovered its injustice, and cast it from him as
                        unworthy. His instinct warned him of this, and so he refused to put his wish into form lest he
                        should thereby lose the opportunity of entertaining it.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">With thoughts like these the young man rode homewards, <pb id="VAA2333-090" n="98"

                        humors when he sat down in the parlor at Shirley.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The conversation, in some inserutable way, turned upon Cousin Sarah Ann, and Robert
                        so far forgot himself as to express pleasure in the thought that that lady was in no way akin to
                        himself.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;But she is kin to you, Robert,&quot; said Aunt Catherine.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;How can that be, Aunt Catherine?&quot; asked the young gentleman.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Show him with the keys, Aunt Catherine, show him with the keys,&quot;
                        said Billy, who had returned from court that day. &quot;Come, Sudie, where&apos;s your
                        basket? I want to see if Aunt Catherine can&apos;t muddle Bob&apos;s head as badly as
                        she does mine sometimes. Here are the keys. Explain it to him, Aunt Catherine, and if he knows
                        when you get through whether he is his great grandfather&apos;s nephew or his
                        uncle&apos;s son once removed, I&apos;ll buy his skull for tissue paper at once. A skull
                        that can let key-basket genealogy through it a&apos;n&apos;t thick enough to grow hair
                        on.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The task was one that the old lady loved, and so without paying the slightest
                        attention to Billy&apos;s bantering she began at once to arrange the keys from
                        Sudie&apos;s basket upon the floor in the shape of a complicated genealogical table.
                        &quot;Now my child,&quot; said she, pointing to the great key at top, &quot;the
                        smoke-house key is your great great grandmother, who was a Pembroke. The Pem-brokes were always

                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Always considered smoke-house keys remember, Bob.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Will you keep still, William? The Pembrokes <pb id="VAA2333-092" n="100"
                            TEIform="pb"/> were always considered an excellent family. Now your great great grandmother,
                        Matilda Pembroke, married John Pemberton, and had two sons and one daughter, as you see. The
                        oldest son, Charles, had six daughters, and his third daughter married your grandfather
                        Pagebrook, so she was your grandmotherthe store-room key, you see&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;See, Bob, what it is to be well connected,&quot; said Billy;
                        &quot;your own dear grandmother was a store-room key.&quot;</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Ah! do I? I only wanted him to remember who his grandmother was.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well,&quot; said the old lady, &quot;Matilda Pomberton&apos;s
                        daughter, yo rgreat grand aunt, married a man of no familya carpenter or somethingthe corn-house
                        key there.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;There it is, Bob. A&apos;n&apos;t you glad you descended from a
                        respectable smoke-house key, through an aristocratic store-room key, instead of having a
                        plebeian corn-house key in the way? There&apos;s nothing like blue blood, I tell you, and
                        ours is as blue as an indigo bag; a&apos;n&apos;t it, Aunt Catherine?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Will you never learn, Billy, not to make fun of your ancestors? I have
                        explained to you a hundred times how much there is in family. Now don&apos;t interrupt me
                        again. Let me see, where was I? O yes! Your great grand aunt married a carpenter, and his
                        daughter Sarah was your second cousin if you count removes, fourth cousin if you don&apos;t.
                        Now Sarah was your Cousin Sarah Ann&apos;s grandmother, as you see; so Sarah Ann is your
                        third <pb id="VAA2333-093" n="101" TEIform="pb"/> cousin if you count removes, and you sixth
                        cousin if you don&apos;t. Do you understand it now?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Of course he does,&quot; said Billy; &quot;but I must break up the
                        family now, as I see Polidore&apos;s waiting for the madam&apos;s great grandfather, to
                        wit, the corn-house key. Come Bob, let&apos;s go up to the stable and see the horses
                        fed.&quot;</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">NOT many days after Robert&apos;s uncomfortable dinner at The Oaks, a servant
                        came over with a message from Major Pagebrook, to the effect that a grand fox-chase was arranged
                        for the next morning. Foggy and Dr. Harrison had originated it, but Major Pagebrook&apos;s
                        and several other gentlemen&apos;s hounds would run, and Ewing invited his cousins, Robert
                        and Billy, to take part in the sport. Accordingly our two young gentlemen ate an early breakfast
                        and rode over to that part of The Oaks plantation known as &quot;Pine quarter,&quot;
                        where the first fox-hunt of the season was always begun. They arrived not a moment too soon, and
                        found the hounds just breaking away and the riders galloping after them. The first five miles of
                        country was comparatively open, a fact which gave the fox a good start and promised to make the
                        chase a long and a rapid one.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Robert Pagebrook had never seen a fox-chase, and his only knowledge of the sport was
                        that which he had gleaned from descriptions, but he was on a perfect horse <pb id="VAA2333-095"
                            n="103" TEIform="pb"/> as inexperienced as himself; lie was naturally very fearless; he was
                        intensely excited, and it was his habit to do whatever he believed to be the proper thing on any
                        occasion. From books he had got the impression that the proper thing to do in fox-hunting was to
                        ride as hard as he could straight after the hounds, and this he did with very little regard for
                        consequences. He galloped straight through clumps of pine, &quot;as thick,&quot; Billy
                        said, &quot;as the hair on Absalom&apos;s head,&quot; while others rode around them.
                        He plunged through creek &quot;low grounds&quot; without a thought of possible mires or
                        quicksands. He knew that fox-hunters made their horses jump fences, but he knew nothing of their
                        practice in the matter of knocking off top rails first, and accordingly ho rode straight at
                        every fence which happened to stand in his way, and forced his horse to take them all at a
                        flying leap.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">On and on he went, straight after the hounds, his pulse beating high and his brain
                        whirling with excitement. The more judicious hunters of the party would have been left far
                        behind but for the advantage they possessed in their knowledge of the country and their
                        consequent ability to anticipate the fox&apos;s turnings, and to save distance and avoid
                        difficulties by following short cuts. Robert rode right after the hounds always.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;That cousin of yours is crazy,&quot; said one gentleman to Billy;
                        &quot;but what a magnificent rider ho is.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Why don&apos;t you stop your cousin?&quot; asked another,
                        &quot;he&apos;ll kill himself, to a certainty, if you don&apos;t.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O I will!&quot; replied Billy, &quot;and I&apos;ll remonstrate
                        with all the streaks of lightning I happen to overtake, too.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-096" n="104" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">I&apos;m sure to catch a good many of them before I come up with him.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The fox &quot;doubled&quot; very little now, and it became evident that ho
                        was making for the Appomattox River, but whether he would cross it or double and run back was
                        uncertain. Billy earnestly hoped he would double, as that might enable him to see Robert and
                        check his mad riding, if indeed that gentleman should manage to reach the river with an
                        unbroken, neck.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">On and on they went, fox running for dear life, hounds in perfect trim and full cry,
                        and riders each bent upon &quot;taking the tail&quot; if possible. Robert remained in
                        ad-could force his horse, and making the animal knock down those which he could not leap. His
                        horse blundered at a ditch once and fell, but recovered himself with his rider still erect in
                        the saddle, before anybody had time to wonder whether his neck was broken or not. Billy now was
                        a new danger ahead of his cousin. They were nearing the river, and the fox, an old red one, who
                        knew his business, was evidently running for a crossing place where mire and quicksands
                        abounded. Of this Robert knew nothing, and after his performances thus far there was no reason
                        to hope that any late-coming caution would save him now. A thicket of young oaks lay just ahead,
                        and the hound going through it Robert followed quite as a matter of course. Billy saw here his
                        chance, and putting spurs to his horse he rode at full speed around the end of the thicket,
                        hoping to reach the other side in time to intercept his cousin, in whose behalf he was now
                        really <pb id="VAA2333-097" n="105" TEIform="pb"/> alarmed. As lie swept by the end ol the
                        thicket, however, he passed two gentlemen whom he could not see through the bushes, but whoso
                        voices he knew very well. They were none other than Mr. Foggy Eaves and Dr. Charles Harrison,
                        and Billy heard what they were saying.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;You <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">must</hi> take the tail, Charley, and not let
                        that city snob get it. The tool rides like Death on the pale horse, and don&apos;t seem to
                        know there ever was a fence too high to jump. He&apos;d try to take the Blue Ridge at a
                        flying leap if it got in his way. I&apos;d rather kill a dozen horses than let him beat us.
                        He put his finger into our little game with that saphead Ewing, and&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;But my horse is thumped now, Foggy.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, take mine then. He&apos;s fresh. I sent him over last night to
                        meet me here, and I just now changed. I&apos;ve hurt my knee and can&apos;t ride. Take
                        my horse and ride him to death but what you beat that&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">This was all that Billy had time to hear, but it was enough to change his entire
                        purpose. He no longer thought of Robert&apos;s neck, but hurried on for the sole purpose of
                        spurring his cousin up to new exertion. He reached the edge of the thicket just as Robert came
                        out bareheaded, having lost his hat in the brush. His face was bleeding, too, from scratches and
                        bruises received in the struggle through the oak thicket. The river was just ahead, but the fox
                        doubled to the right instead of crossing.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Come, Bob,&quot; said Billy, &quot;you&apos;ve got to take the
                        tail to-day or die. Foggy and Charley Harrison have been setting up a game on you, and Charley
                        has a fresh horse, <pb id="VAA2333-098" n="106" TEIform="pb"/> borrowed from Foggy on purpose to
                        beat you. But this double gives you a quarter start of him. Don&apos;t <hi rend="i"
                            TEIform="hi">run</hi> your horse up hills, or you&apos;ll blow him out, and shy off from
                        such thickets as that. You can ride round quicker than you can go through. <hi rend="i"
                            TEIform="hi">Don&apos;t break your</hi> NECK, BUT TAKE THE TAIL ANYHOW.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">He fairly yelled the last words at Robert, who was already a hundred yards ahead of
                        him and getting further of every second.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The effect of his words on his cousin was not precisely what might have been
                        expected. Before this Robert had been intensely excited and had enjoyed being so, but his
                        excitement had been the result of his high spirits and his keen zest for the sport in which he
                        was engaged. He had astonished everybody by the utter recklessness of his riding, but had not
                        shared at all in their astonishment or known that his riding was reckless. He had ridden hard
                        simply because lie thought that the proper thing to do and because lie enjoyed doing it. He rode
                        now for victory. His features lost the look of wild enjoyment which they had worn, and settled
                        themselves into a firm, hard expression of dogged determination. Here was his opportunity to do
                        battle with young Harrison; and from Billy&apos;s manner, rather than from his words, he
                        knew that the contest was not one of generous rivalry on Harrison&apos;s part. He felt that
                        there was a contemptuous sneer somewhere back of Billy&apos;s words, and the thought nettled
                        him sorely. But he did not lose his head in the excitement. On the contrary, he felt the
                        necessity now for care and coolness, and accordingly he immediately took pains to <pb
                            id="VAA2333-099" n="107" TEIform="pb"/> become both cool and careful. He knew that Harrison
                        had an advantage in knowing the country, and he resolved to share that advantage. To this end he
                        brought his horse done to an easy canter and waited for Harrison to come up. He then kept his
                        eye constantly on his rival and used him as a guide. When Harrison avoided a thicket he avoided
                        it also. If Harrison left the track of the hounds for the sake of cutting off an angle, Robert
                        kept by his side. This angered Harrison, who had counted confidently upon having an advantage in
                        these matters, and under the influence of his anger he spurred his horse unnecessarily and soon
                        took a good deal of his freshness out of him.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The two rode on almost side by side for miles. The fox was beginning to show his
                        fatigue, and it was evident that the chase would soon end. Both the foremost riders discovered
                        this, and both put forth every possible exertion to win. Just ahead of them lay a very dense
                        thicket through which ran a narrow bridle-path barely wide enough for one horse, as Robert know,
                        for the thicket lay on Shirley plantation, the fox having run back almost immediately over his
                        own track. It was evident now that &quot;the catch&quot; would occur in the field just
                        beyond this thicket, and it was equally evident that as the two could not possibly ride abreast
                        along the bridle-path, the one who could first put his horse into it would almost certainly be
                        first in at the death. They rode like madmen, but Robert&apos;s horse was greatly fatigued
                        and Harrison shot ahead of him by a single length into the path. There was hardly a chance for
                        Robert now, as it was impossible in <pb id="VAA2333-100" n="108" TEIform="pb"/> any case for him
                        to pass his rival in the thicket, and he could see that the dogs had already caught the fox in
                        the field, less than a rod beyond its edge.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I&apos;ve got you now, I reckon,&quot; shouted Harrison looking
                        back, but at the moment his horse stumbled and fell. Robert could no more stop his own horse
                        than he could have stopped a hurricane, and the animal fell heavily over Harrison, throwing
                        Robert about ten feet beyond and almost among the dogs. Getting up he ran in among the bellowing
                        hounds and, catching the fox in his hand, he held him up in full view of the other gentlemen,
                        now riding into the field from different directions and cheering as lustily as possible.</p>

                    </head>
                    <p TEIform="p">QUITE naturally Robert was elated as lie stood there bare-headed, and received the
                        congratulations of his companions, who had now come up and gathered around him. Loudest among
                        them, was Foggy, who leaping from his horse cried out:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;By Jove, Mr. Pagebrook, I must shake your hand. I never saw prettier riding
                        in my life, and I&apos;ve seen some good riding too in my time. But where&apos;s your
                        horse? Did you turn Mm loose when you jumped off?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">This served to remind Robert of the animal and of Harrison too, and going hastily
                        into the thicket he found the Doctor repairing his girth, which, had been broken in the fall.
                        The Doctor was not hurt, nor was his horse injured in any way, but the black colt which had
                        carried Robert so gallantly lay dead upon the ground. An examination showed that in falling he
                        had broken his neck.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">It was not far that our young friend had to walk to reach Shirley, but a weariness
                        which he had not felt before crept over him as he walked. His head ached sorely, <pb
                            id="VAA2333-102" n="110" TEIform="pb"/> and as the excitement died away it was succeeded by
                        a numbness of despondency, the like of which he had never known before. He had declined to
                        &quot;ride and tie&quot; with Billy, thinking the task a small one to walk through by a
                        woods path to the house, while Billy followed the main road. With his first feeling of
                        despondency came bitter mortification at the thought that he had allowed so small a thing as a
                        fox-chase to so excite him. The exertion had been well enough, but ho felt that the object in
                        view during the latter half of the chase, namely, the defeat of young Harrison, was one wholly
                        unworthy un worthy of him, and the color came to his cheek as he thought of the energy he had
                        wasted on so small an undertaking. Then he remembered the gallant animal sacrificed in the blind
                        struggle for mere victory, and he could hardly force the tears back as the thought came to him
                        in full force that the nostrils which had quivered with excitement so short a time since, would
                        snuff the air no more forever. He felt guilty, almost of murder, and savagely rejoiced to know
                        that the death of the horse would entail a pecuniary loss upon himself, which would in some
                        sense avenge the wrong done to the noble brute.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The numbness and weariness oppressed him so that he sat down at the root of a tree,
                        ad remained there in a state of half unconsciousness until Billy came from the house to look for
                        him. Arrived at the house he went immediately to bed and into a fever which prostrated him for
                        nearly a week? during which time he was not allowed to talk much; in point of fact he was not
                        inclined to talk at all, except to Cousin Sudie, who moved quietly in and <pb id="VAA2333-103"
                            n="111" TEIform="pb"/> out of the room as occasion required and came to sit by his bedside
                        frequently, after Billy and Col. Barksdale quitted home again to attend court in another of the
                        adjoining counties, as they did as soon as Robert&apos;s physician pronounced him out of
                        danger. At first Cousin Sudie was disposed to enforce the doctor&apos;s orders in regard to
                        silence; but she soon discovered, quick-witted girl that she was, that <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi"
                            >her</hi> talking soothed and quieted the patient, and so she talked to him in a soft, quiet
                        voice, securing, by violating the doctor&apos;s injunction, precisely the result which the
                        injunction was intended to secure. As soon as the fever quitted him Robert began to recover very
                        rapidly, but he was greatly troubled about the still unpaid-for horse.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Now he knew perfectly well that Cousin Sudie had no money at command, and he ought to
                        have known that it was a very unreasonable proceeding upon his part to consult her in the
                        matter. But love laughs at logic as well as at locksmiths, and so our logical young man very
                        illogically concluded that the best thing to do in the premises was to consult Cousin Sudie.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I am in trouble, Cousin Sudie,&quot; said he, as sat with her in the
                        parlor one evening, &quot;about that horse. I know Mr. Winger is a poor man, and I ought to
                        pay him at once, but the truth is I have hardly any money with me, and there is no bank nearer
                        than Richmond at which to get a draft cashed.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;You have money enough, then, somewhere?&quot; asked Cousin Sudie.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O yes! I have money in bank in Philadelphia, but <pb id="VAA2333-104"
                            n="112" TEIform="pb"/> Winger has already sent me a note asking immediate payment, and
                        telling me he is sorely pressed for money; and I dislike exceedingly to ask his forbearance even
                        for a week, under the circumstances.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Why can&apos;t you get Cousin Edwin to cash a check for you?&quot;
                        asked the business-like little woman; &quot;he always has money, and will do it gladly, I
                        know.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;That had not occurred to me, but it is a good suggestion. If you Trill lend
                        me your writing-desk I will write and &quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Ah, there comes Cousin Edwin now, and Ewing too, to see you,&quot; said
                        Mss Sudie, hearing their voices in the porch.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The visitors came into the parlor, and after a little while Sudie withdrew, intent
                        upon some household matter. Ewing followed her. Robert spoke frankly of his wish to pay
                        &quot;Winger promptly, and asked:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Can you cash my check on Philadelphia for me, Cousin Edwin, for three
                        hundred dollars? Don&apos;t think of doing it, pray, if it is not perfectly
                        convenient.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O it isn&apos;t inconvenient at all, &quot;said Major Pagebrook.
                        &quot;I have more money at home than I like to keep there, the bank in Richmond and have it
                        credited to me quite as well as not. In fact I&apos;d rather do it than not, as
                        it&apos;ll save expressage on maney.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Accordingly Robert drew a check for three hundred dollars on his bankers in
                        Philadelphia, making it payable to Major Pagebrook, and that gentleman undertook to pay the
                        amount that evening to Winger. Shortly after <pb id="VAA2333-105" n="113" TEIform="pb"/> this
                        business matter had been settled, Ewing and Miss Sudie returned to the parlor and the callers
                        took their departure.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Robert and Sudie sat silent for some time watching the flicker of the fire, for the
                        days were cool now and fires were necessary to in-door comfort. How long their silence might
                        have continued but for an interruption, I do not know; but an interruption came in the breaking
                        of the forestick, which had burned in two. A broken reveries may sometimes be resumed, but a
                        pair of broken reveries never are. Had Mr. Robert been alone he would have rearranged the fire
                        and then sat down to his thoughts again. As it was he rearranged the fire and then began to talk
                        with Miss Sudie.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I am glad to get that business off my hands. It worried me,&quot; he
                        said.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;So am I,&quot; said his companion, &quot;very glad
                        indeed.&quot; There must have been something in her tone, as there was certainly nothing in
                        her words, which led Mr. Page-brook to think that this young lady&apos;s remark had an
                        unexpressed meaning back of it. He therefore questioned her.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Why, Cousin Sudie? had it been troubling you too?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;No; but it would have done so, I reckon.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I do not understand you. Surely you never doubted that I would pay for the
                        horse, did you?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;No indeed, but&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;What is it Cousin Sudie? tell me what there is in your mind. I shall feel
                        hurt if you do not.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I ought not to tell you, but I must now, or you will <pb id="VAA2333-106"
                            n="114" TEIform="pb"/> imagine uncomfortable things. I know why Mr. Winger wrote you that
                        note.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;You know why? There was some reason then besides his need of
                        money?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;He was not pressed for the money at all. That wasn&apos;t the
                        reason.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;You surprise me, Cousin Sudie. Pray tell me what you know, and
                        how.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, promise me first that yon won&apos;t get yourself into any
                        trouble about itno, I have no right to exact a blind promisebut do don&apos;t get into
                        trouble. That detestable man, Foggy Eaves, made Mr. Winger uneasy about the money. He told him
                        you were &apos;hard up&apos; and paid him, and I&apos;m glad you beat Charley
                        Harrison in the fox-chase, too.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">With this utterly inconsequent conclusion, Cousin Sudie commenced rocking violently
                        in her chair.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;How do you know all this, Cousin Sadie?&quot; asked Robert.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Ewing told me this evening. I&apos;d rather you&apos;d have killed
                        a dozen horses than to have had Charley Harrison beat you.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Why, Cousin Sudie?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O he&apos;s at the bottom of all this. He always is. Foggy is his
                        mouth-piece. And then he told Aunt Catherine, the day you went to The Oaks, that he
                        &apos;meant to have some fun when he got you into a fox-hunt on Winger&apos;s
                        colt,&apos; He said you&apos;d find out how much your hand-some city riding-school style
                        was worth when you got <pb id="VAA2333-107" n="116" TEIform="pb"/>

                    <p TEIform="p">Now it would seem that Cousin Sudie&apos;s rejoicing must have been of a singular
                        sort, as she very unreasonably burst into tears while in the very act of declaring herself glad.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Mr. Robert Pagebrook was wholly unused to the task of soothing a woman in tears. It
                        was his habit, under all circumstances, to do the thing proper to be done, but of what the
                        proper thing was for a man to do or say to a woman in tears without apparent cause, Mr. Robert
                        Pagebrook had not the faintest conception, and so he very unreasonably proceeded to take her
                        hand in his and to tell her that he loved her, a fact which he himself just then discovered for
                        the first time.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Before he could add a word to the blunt declaration, Dick thrust his black head into

                    <p TEIform="p">THE reader thinks, doubtless, that Master Dick&apos;s entrance at the precise
                        time indicated in the last chapter was an unfortunate occurrence, and I presume Mr. Pagebrook
                        was of a like opinion at the moment. But mature reflection convinced him that the interruption
                        was a peculiarly opportune one. He was a conscientious young man, and was particularly
                        punctilious in matters of honor; wherefore, had lie been allowed to complete the conversation
                        thus unpremeditatedly begun, without an opportunity to deliberate upon the things to be said, he
                        would almost certainly have suffered at the hands of his conscience in consequence. There were
                        circumstances which made some explanations on his part necessary, and he knew perfectly well
                        that these explanations would not have been properly made if Master Dick&apos;s interruption
                        had not come to give him time for reflection.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">All this he thought as he drank his tea; for when supper was announced both he and
                        Miss Sudie went into the dining-room precisely as if their talk in the parlor had been of no
                        unusual character. This they did because <pb id="VAA2333-110" n="119" TEIform="pb"/> they were
                        creatures of habit, as you and I and all the rest of mankind are. They were in the habit of
                        going to supper when it was ready, and it never entered the thought of either to act differently
                        on this particular occasion. Miss Sudie, it is true, ran up to her room for a momentto brush her
                        hair I presumebefore she entered the dining-room, but otherwise they both acted very much as
                        they always did, except that Robert addressed almost the whole of his conversation during the
                        meal to his Aunt Mary and Aunt Catherine, while Miss Sudie, sitting there behind the tea-tray,
                        said nothing at all. After tea the older ladies sat with Robert and Sudie in the parlor, until
                        the early bed-time prescribed for the convalescent young gentleman arrived.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">It thus happened that there was no opportunity for the resumption of the interesting
                        conversation interrupted by Dick, until the middle of the forenoon next day. Miss Sudie, it
                        seems, found it necessary to go into the garden to inspect some late horticultural operations,
                        and Mr. Robert, quite accidentally, followed her. They discussed matters with Uncle Joe, the
                        gardener, for a time, and then wandered off toward a summer-house, where it was pleasant to sit
                        in the soft November sunlight.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The conversation which followed was an interesting one, of course. Let us listen to
                        it.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;The Tines are all killed by the frost,&quot; said Cousin Sudie.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Yes; you have frosts here earlier than I thought,&quot; said Robert.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O we always expect frost about the tenth of October; <pb id="VAA2333-111"
                            n="120" TEIform="pb"/> at least the gentlemen never feel safe if their tobacco
                        isn&apos;t cut by that time. This year frost was late for us, but the nights are getting
                        very cool now, a&apos;n&apos;t they?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Yes; I found blankets very comfortable even before the tenth of
                        October.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;It&apos;s lucky then that you wa&apos;n&apos;t staying with
                        Aunt Polly Barksdale.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Why? and who is your Aunt Polly?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Aunt Polly? Why she is Uncle Charles&apos;s widow. She is the model for
                        the whole connection; and I&apos;ve had her held up to me as a pattern ever since I can
                        remember, but I never saw her till about a year ago, when she came and staid a week or two with
                        us; and between ourselves I think she is the most disagreeably good person I ever saw. She <hi
                            rend="i" TEIform="hi">is</hi> good, but somehow she makes me wicked, and I don&apos;t
                        think I&apos;m naturally so. I didn&apos;t read my Bible once while she staid, and I do
                        love to read it. I suppose I shall like to have her with me in heaven, if I get there, because
                        there I won&apos;t have anything for her to help me about, but here &apos;I&apos;m
                        better midout&apos; her.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I quite understand your feeling; but you haven&apos;t told me why
                        I&apos;m lucky not to have her for my hostess these cold nights.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O you&apos;d be comfortable enough now that tobacco is cut; but when
                        Cousin Billy staid with her, a good many years ago, he used to complain of being coldhe was only
                        a boyand ask her for blankets, and she would hold up her hands and exclaim: &apos;Why,
                        child, your uncle&apos;s tobacco isn&apos;t cut yet! It will never do to say
                        it&apos;s cold enough for blankets when your poor uncle hasn&apos;t got his <pb
                            id="VAA2333-112" n="121" TEIform="pb"/> tobacco cut. Think of your uncle, child! he
                        can&apos;t afford to have his tobacco all killed.&apos; But come, Cousin Robert, you
                        mustn&apos;t sit here; besides I want to show you an experiment I am trying with winter
                        cabbage.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">This, I believe, is a faithful report of what passed between Robert and Sudie in the
                        summer-house. I am very well aware that they ought to have talked of other things, but they did
                        not; and, as a faithful chronicler, I can only state the facts as they occurred, begging the
                        reader to remember that I am in no way responsible for the conduct of these young people.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The cabbage experiment duly explained and admired, Mr. Robert and Miss Sudie walked
                        out of the garden and into the house. There they found themselves alone again, and Robert
                        plunged at once into the matter of which both had been thinking all the time.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Cousin Sudie,&quot; he said, &quot;have you thought about what I
                        said to you last night?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Yesa little.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I will not ask you just yet <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">what</hi> you have
                        thought,&quot; said Robert, taking her unresisting hand into his, &quot;because there
                        are some explanations which I am in honor bound to make to you before asking you to give me an
                        answer, one way or the other. When I told yon I loved you, of course I meant to ask yon to be my
                        wife, but that I must not ask you until you know exactly what I am I want you to know precisely
                        what it is that I ask you to do. I am a poor man, as you know. I have a good position, however,
                        with a salary of two thousand dollars a year, and that is more than sufficient for the <pb
                            id="VAA2333-113" n="122" TEIform="pb"/> support of a family, particularly in an inexpensive
                        college town; so that there is room for a little constant accumulation. If I marry, I shall
                        insure my life for ten thousand dollars, so that my death shall not leave my wife destitute. I
                        have a very small reserve fund in bank toothirteen hundred dollars now, since I paid for that
                        horse. And there is still throe hundred dollars due me for last year&apos;s work. These arc
                        my means and my prospects, and now I tell you again, Sudie, that I love you, and I ask you
                        bluntly will you marry me?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The young lady said nothing.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;If you wish for time to think about it Sudie&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I suppose that would be the proper way, according to custom; but,&quot;
                        raising her eyes fearlessly to his, &quot;I have already made up my mind, and I do not want
                        to act a falsehood. There is nothing to be ashamed of, I suppose, in frankly loving such a man
                        as you, Robert. I will ho your wife.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The little woman felt wonderfully brave just then, and accordingly, without further
                        ado, she commenced to cry.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The reader would be very ill-mannered indeed should he listen further to a
                        conversation which was wholly private and confidential in its character; wherefore let us close
                        our ears and the chapter at once.</p>

                    </head>
                    <p TEIform="p">THE next two or three days passed away very quickly with Mr. Robert and Miss Sudie.
                        Robert made to his aunt a statement of the results, without entering into the details of his
                        conferences with Miss Sudie, and was assured of Col. Barksdale&apos;s approval when that
                        gentleman and Billy should return from the court they were attending. The two young people,
                        however, were in no hurry for the day appointed for that return to come. They were very happy as
                        it was. They discussed their future, and laid many little plans to be carried out after awhile.
                        It was arranged that Robert should return to Virginia at the beginning of the next long
                        vacation; that the wedding should take place immediately upon his coming; and that the two
                        should make a little trip through the mountains and, returning to Shirley, remain there until
                        the autumn should bring Robert&apos;s professional duties around again.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">They were in the very act of talking these matters over for the twentieth time, one
                        afternoon, when Maj. Pagebrook <pb id="VAA2333-115" n="124" TEIform="pb"/> rode up. He seemed
                        absent and nervous in manner, and after a few moments of general conversation asked to see
                        Robert alone upon business. When the two were closeted together Maj. Pagebrook opened his
                        pocket-book and taking out a paper he slowly unfolded it, saying: &quot;I have just received
                        this, Robert, and I suppose there is a duplicate of it awaiting you in the
                        post-office.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Robert looked at the paper in blank astonishment.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;What does this mean?&quot; he cried; &quot;my draft protested!
                        &quot;Why I have sixteen hundred dollars in that bank, and my draft was for only three
                        hundred.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;It appears that the bank has failed,&quot; said Maj. Page-brook.
                        &quot;At least I reckon that&apos;s what the Richmond people mean. They say, in a note
                        to me, that it &apos;went to pot&apos; a week ago. It seems there are a good many banks
                        failing this fall. I hope you won&apos;t lose everything, though, Robert.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The blow was terrible one to the young man. In a moment he took in the entire
                        situation. To lose the money he had in bank was to be forced to begin the world over again with
                        absolutely nothing; but at any rate he could pay the debt he owed to his cousin very shortly,
                        and to be free form debt is in itself a luxury to a man of his temperament. He thought but a
                        moment and then said:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Cousin Edwin, I shall have to ask you to carry that protested draft for me
                        a few days if you will. There is some money due me on the fifteenth of this month, find it is
                        now the ninth. I asked that it should be sent to me <pb id="VAA2333-116" n="125" TEIform="pb"/>
                        here, but I shall go to Philadelphia at once, and I&apos;ll collect it when I get there and
                        send you the amount. I promise you faithfully that it shall be remitted by the fifteenth at the
                        Tory furthest.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O don&apos;t trouble yourself to be so exact, Robert,&quot; replied
                        Maj. Pagebrook. &quot;Send it when you can; I&apos;m in no very great hurry. Sarah Ann
                        says we must invest all our spare money in the new railroad stock; but I needn&apos;t pay
                        anything on that till the twenty-third, so there will be time enough. But for that I
                        wouldn&apos;t care how long I waited.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I shall not let it remain unpaid after the fifteenth at furthest,&quot;
                        said Robert. &quot;I do not like to let it lie even that long.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Maj. Pagebrook took his departure and Robert told Sudie of the bad news, telling her
                        also that he must leave next morning for Philadelphia, to see if it were possible to save
                        something from the wreck of the bank.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Besides,&quot; said he, &quot;I must get to work. There are nearly
                        two months of time between now and the first of January, and I cannot afford to lose it now that
                        I have lost this money.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;What will you do, Robert? You can&apos;t do anything teaching in that
                        time.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;No, but I can do a good many things. I write a little now and then for the
                        papers and magazines, for one thing. I can pick up something, I think, which will at least pay
                        expenses.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">He then told her of his arrangement with Maj. Pagebrook about the protested draft,
                        and finished by repeating <pb id="VAA2333-117" n="126" TEIform="pb"/> what that gentleman had
                        said about the investment in railroad stock.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">This troubled Miss Sudie more than all the rest, and Robert seeing it pressed her for
                        a reason. But no reason would she give, and Robert was forced to content himself with the
                        thought that his trouble naturally brought, trouble to her. To her aunt, however, she expressed
                        her conviction that Cousin Sarah Ann had suggested the railroad investment merely for the sake
                        of compelling her husband to press Robert for payment. She was troubled to know that the payment
                        must be deferred even for a few days, but rejoiced in the knowledge of Robert&apos;s ability
                        to discharge his indebtedness speedily. It galled her to think of the unpleasant things which
                        the amiable mistress of The Oaks would manage to say about Robert pending the payment. There was
                        no help for it, however, and so the brave little woman persuaded herself that it was her duty to
                        appear cheerful in order that Robert might be so; and whatever Miss Sudie believed to be her
                        duty in any case Miss Sudie did, however difficult the doing might be. She accordingly wore the
                        pleasantest possible smile and the most cheerful of countenances whenever Robert was present,
                        doing every particle of her necessary crying in her own room and carefully washing away all
                        traces of the process before opening the door.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Robert made all his preparations for departure that afternoon, and on the following
                        the Court House in the family carriage. When he arrived there he got what letters there were for
                        him in the post-office, read them, and talked a few moments with <pb id="VAA2333-118" n="127"
                            TEIform="pb"/> Ewing Pagebrook, who had spent the preceding night with Foggy and Dr.
                        Harrison, and was now deeply contrite and rather anxious than otherwise that Robert should scold
                        him. There was no time, however, even for the giving of advice, as the train had now come, and
                        Robert must go at once. A hasty hand-shaking closed the interview, and Robert was gone.</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">WHEN Robert arrived in Philadelphia his first care was to make inquiries with regard
                        to the bank in which his money was deposited. He learned that it had suspended payment about one
                        week before, and that its affairs were in the hands of an assignee. This was all he could find
                        out on the afternoon of his arrival, and with this he was forced to content himself until the
                        next day, when he succeeded with some little difficulty in securing an interview with the
                        assignee. To him he said: &quot;My only purpose is to ascertain the exact state of the
                        bank&apos;s affairs, in order that I may know what to do.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;That I cannot tell you, sir. The books are still in confusion, and until
                        they can be straightened out it is impossible to say what the result will be.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Tell me, then, are the assets anything like equal to the
                        liabilities?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;That is exactly what the books must show. I can&apos;t say till we get
                        a statement.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;You can at least tell me then,&quot; said Robert, provoked at the
                        man&apos;s reticence, &quot;whether there are any assets at all, or not.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;No, I can make no statement until the books are examined. Then a complete
                        exhibit of affairs will be made.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Pardon me,&quot; said Robert, &quot;but this question is one <pb
                            id="VAA2333-120" n="129" TEIform="pb"/> of serious moment to me. You have been examining
                        this bank&apos;s affairs for a week, I believe?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Yes, about a week.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;You must have some idea, then, whether or not there is likely to be
                        anything at all left for depositors, and you will oblige me very much indeed by giving me your
                        personal opinion on the subject. I understand how impossible it is to give exact figures; but
                        you cannot have failed to discover by this time whether or not the assets the amount of the
                        bank&apos;s liabilities. I would like the little information you can give me, however
                        inexact it may be.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;My dear sir,&quot; said the assignee, &quot;I&apos;m afraid you
                        don&apos;t understand these things. Our statement is not ready yet, and I can not possibly
                        tell you what its nature will be until it is.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;When will it be ready, sir?&quot; asked Robert.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;That I can not say as yet, but it will be forthcoming in due time, sir; in
                        due time.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Will it require a week, or a month, or two or three months? You can, at
                        least, make an approximate estimate of the time necessary for its preparation.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, no,&quot; said the man of business, &quot;I should not to
                        make any promises; I am hard at work, and the statement will be ready in due time, sir; in due
                        time.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Robert left the man&apos;s presence thoroughly disgusted. Thinking the matter
                        over he concluded that the affairs of the bank must be in a very bad way. Otherwise, he argued,
                        the man would not be so silent on the subject.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Now the assignee was perfectly right in saying that <pb id="VAA2333-121" n="130"
                            TEIform="pb"/> Robert did not understand those things. If he had understood them he would
                        have known that the reticence from which he thus argued the worst, meant just nothing at all.
                        Business men are not apt to commit themselves unnecessarily in any case, and especially in such
                        a case as the one concerning which Robert had been inquiring. The bank might have been utterly
                        bankrupt or entirely solvent, and that assignee would in either case have given precisely the
                        same, answers to our young friend&apos;s questions. He knew nothing with absolute certainty
                        as yet, and could know nothing certainly until the last column of figures should be added up and
                        the final balances struck. Then he could make a statement, but until then he would say nothing
                        at all. He acted after his kind. Business is business; and, as a rule, business moil know only
                        one way of doing things.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Robert, however, was not a business man. He knew nothing about these things, and
                        accordingly, making no allowance for a business habit as one of the factors in the problem, he
                        proceeded to argue that if the affairs of the bank were in the least degree hopeful the man
                        would have said so. As he had carefully and persistently avoided saying anything of the kind,
                        Robert could only conclude that there was no hope at all to be entertained.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">He quickly determined, therefore, to waste no more time. Abandoning his sixteen
                        hundred dollars as utterly lost, he packed his valise and went at once to New York to find work
                        of some kind. How lie succeeded we shall test see from his letter to Cousin Sudie, from which I
                        am allowed to quote a passage or two.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-122" n="131" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I am very busy with some topical articles, as the newspaper folk call them.
                        That is to say, I am visiting factories of various kinds and writing detailed accounts of their
                        operations, coupling with the facts gathered thus, a gossipy account of the origin, history,
                        etc., of the industry. I find the work very interesting, and it promises to be quite
                        remunerative too. I fell into it by accident. About a year ago I spent an evening with a friend,
                        Mr. Dudley, in New York, and while at Ms house his seven year old boy stowed me some of his
                        toyslittle German contrivances; and I, knowing something about the toys and the people who make
                        themyou know I made a summer trip through Europe oncefell to telling him about them. His father
                        was as much interested as he, but the matter soon passed from my mind. When I came over here a
                        week ago to look for something to do I visited the office of this paper, hoping that I should be
                        allowed to do a little reporting or drudgery of some sort till something better should turn up.
                        Who should I find in the editor&apos;s chair but my friend Dudley. I told him my errand, and
                        his reply was:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;&apos;I haven&apos;t a moment now, Pagebrook, but you&apos;re
                        the very man I want; come up and see me this evening. We dine at half-past six, and over our
                        roast-beef I can explain fully what I mean.&apos;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I went, as a matter of course, and at dinner Dudley said:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;&apos;Our paper, Pagebrook, is meant to be a kind of American Penny
                        Magazine. That is to say, we want to fill it full of <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">entertaining</hi>
                        information, partly for the sake <pb id="VAA2333-123" n="132" TEIform="pb"/> of the information
                        but more for the sake of the entertainment. Now I have tried at least fifty people, in the hope
                        of finding somebody who could tell, in writing, just such things as you told our Ben when you
                        were here a year ago. I never dreamed of getting you to do it, but you&apos;re just the man,
                        and about the only one, too, I begin to think. Now, if you&apos;ve a mind to do it, I can
                        keep you busy as long as you like. I don&apos;t mean to confine you to this particular kind
                        of work, but I&apos;d rather have articles of that sort than any others, and the publishers
                        won&apos;t grumble if I pay you twenty dollars apiece for them. They mustn&apos;t exceed
                        two of our columnssay two thousand words in allbut if you can&apos;t tell your story in any
                        particular instance within those limits, you can make two articles out of it. I&apos;ve
                        already told your toy story, but you can easily hunt up plenty of other things to tell about.
                        Common things are bestthings people see every day but know nothing about.&apos;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I set to work the next day, and have been busy ever since. I like to visit
                        factories and learn all the petty details of their operations, and I find that it is the petty
                        details which go to make the description interesting. I like the work so well that I almost wish
                        I had no professorship, so that I might follow as a business this kind of writing, and some
                        other sorts in which I seem to succeed for I do not confine myself to one class of articles, or
                        to one paper either, for that matter, but am trying my hand at a variety of things, and I find
                        the work very fascinating. But it is altogether better, I suppose, that I should retain my
                        position in the college, even if I could <pb id="VAA2333-124" n="133" TEIform="pb"/> be sure of
                        always finding as good a market as I do just now for my wares, which is doubtful. I have lost
                        the whole of my little reserve fundas the bank seems hopelessly broken; and if I had nothing to
                        depend upon except the problematic sale of articles, I would do you a wrong to ask you to let
                        our wedding-day remain fixed. As it is, my salary from the college is more than sufficient for
                        our support, and as my expenses from now until the time appointed will be very small indeed, I
                        shall have several hundred dollars accumulated by that time; wherefore if Uncle Carter does not
                        object, pray let our plans remain undisturbed, will you not, Sadie?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The rest of this letter, which is a very long one, is not only personal in its
                        character, but is also of a strictly private nature; and while I am free to copy here so much of
                        this and other letters in my possession as will aid me in the telling of my story, I do not feel
                        myself at liberty to let the reader into the sacred inner chambers of a correspondence with
                        which we have properly no concern, except as it helps us to the understanding of this

                    <p TEIform="p">WHEN the letter from which a quotation was made in the preceding chapter came to Miss
                        Sudie, that young lady was not at Shirley but at The Oaks, where Ewing was lying very ill. He
                        had been prostrated suddenly, a few days before, and from the first had been delirious with
                        fever. The doctor had appeared unusually anxious regarding his patient ever since he was first
                        summoned to sec him, and Cousin Sarah Ann having given way to her alarm at the evident danger in
                        which her son lay to such an extent as to be wholly useless to herself or to anybody else, Miss
                        Sudie had been called in to act as temporary mistress of the mansion.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The very next mail after the one which brought her letter, had in it one from Robert
                        addressed to Ewing himself. Miss Sudie, upon discovering it in the bag, carried it to Cousin
                        Sarah Ann, and was very decidedly shocked when that estimable lady without a word broke the seal
                        and read the letter, putting it carefully away afterwards in Ewing&apos;s desk, of which she
                        had the key.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-126" n="135" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">Miss Sudie said nothing, however, and the matter was almost forgotten when in the
                        evening the doctor came and sat down by the sick boy&apos;s bed.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I think it my duty to tell you,&quot; said he to Cousin Sarah Ann,
                        &quot;that the crisis of the disease is rapidly approaching, and I must wait here until it
                        passes. Your son is in very great danger; but we shall know within a few hours whether there is
                        hope for him or not. I confess that while I hope the best I fear the worst.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Mrs. Pagebrook was thoroughly overcome by her fright. She loved her son, in her own
                        queer way; and being a very weak woman she gave way entirely when she understood in how very
                        critical a condition the boy was. It was necessary to exclude her from the room, and the doctor
                        remained, with Miss Sudie and Maj. Pagebrook. About midnight he stood and looked intently at the
                        sick man&apos;s features, listening also to his hard-coming breath. He stood there full half
                        an hourthen turning to Miss Sudie, he said:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;It&apos;s of no use, Miss Barksdale. Our young friend is beyond hope.
                        He cannot live an hour. Perhaps you&apos;d better inform his mother.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">But before Miss Sudie could leave the bedside, Ewing roused himself for a moment, and
                        tried to say something to her.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Tell RobertI got sick the very daytwenty-one&quot; This was all Miss
                        Sudie could hear, and she thought the patient&apos;s mind was wandering still, as it had
                        been throughout his illness. And these incoherent words were the last the young man ever
                        uttered.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-127" n="136" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">About a week after Ewing&apos;s death Cousin Sarah Ann said to Maj. Pagebrook:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Cousin Edwin, are you ever going to collect that money from Robert? He
                        promised to pay you on or before the fifteenth of November, and now it&apos;s nearly the
                        last of the month and you haven&apos;t a line of explanation from him yet. I told you he
                        wouldn&apos;t pay it till we made him. You oughtn&apos;t to&apos;ve let him run away
                        in your debt at all, and you wouldn&apos;t either, if you&apos;d a&apos;listened to
                        me. Why don&apos;t you write to him?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, I don&apos;t like to press the poor fellow. He&apos;s lost
                        his money you know, and I reckon he finds it hard to pull through till January. He&apos;ll
                        pay when he can, I reckon.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O that&apos;s always the way with you! For my part I don&apos;t
                        believe he had any money in the bank; and his besides he said there was some money coming to him
                        on his salary, and he promised faithfully to pay you out of that. I told you ho
                        wouldn&apos;t, because I knew him. He tried to make out he was so much superior to the rest
                        of us, and talked about &apos;reforming&apos; poor Ewing, just as if the poor boy was a
                        drunkard andandandif you don&apos;t write <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">I</hi> will, and
                        I&apos;ll make him pay that money too, or I&apos;ll know why.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The conversation ended as such conversations usually did in Maj. Pagebrook&apos;s
                        family, namely, by the abrupt departure of that gentleman from the house.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Cousin Sarah Ann evidently meant what she said, and her husband was no sooner out of
                        the house than she got out her desk and wrote; not to Robert, however, but to <pb
                            id="VAA2333-128" n="137" TEIform="pb"/> Messrs. Steel, Hint &amp; Sharp, attorneys and
                        counselors at law, in New York city. Her note was not a long one, but it told the whole story of
                        Robert&apos;s indebtedness from a not very favorable point of view, and closed with a
                        request that the attorneys should &quot;push the case by every means the law
                        allows.&quot; This note was signed not with Cousin Sarah Ann&apos;s own but with her
                        husband&apos;s name, and her first proceeding, after sealing the letter, was to send it by a
                        servant to the post-office. She then ordered her carriage and drove over to Shirley.</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">COUSIN SARAH ANN talked a good deal. Ill-natured people sometimes said she talked a
                        good deal of nonsense, and possibly she did, but she never talked without a purpose, and she
                        commonly managed to talk pretty successfully, too, so far as the accomplishment of her ends was
                        concerned. In the present case, while I am wholly unprepared to say exactly why she wanted to
                        talk, I am convinced that this excellent lady&apos;s visit to Shirley was undertaken solely
                        for the purpose of securing an opportunity to talk.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Arrived there, she greeted her friends with her black-bordered handkerchief over her
                        eyes, and for a time seemed hardly able to speak at all, so overpowering was her emotion. Then
                        she said:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I wouldn&apos;t think of visiting at such a time as this, of course,
                        but Shirley seems so much like home, and I felt like I must have somebody to talk to who could
                        sympathize with me. Dear Sudie was <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">so</hi> good to me duringduring it
                        all.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">After a time Cousin Sarah Ann composed herself, and <pb id="VAA2333-130" n="139"
                            TEIform="pb"/> controlled her emotion sufficiently to converse connectedly without making
                        painful pauses, though her voice continued from first to last to be uncomfortably suggestive of
                        recent weeping.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Have you had any news of Robert lately?&quot; she asked; &quot;I do
                        hope he&apos;s doing well.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;We&apos;ve had no letters since Sudie&apos;s came while she was at
                        your house,&quot; said Colonel Barksdale. &quot;He was doing very well then, I believe,
                        though he thought there was no hope of recovering anything from the bank.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I&apos;m <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">so</hi> sorry,&quot; said Cousin
                        Sarah. Ann, &quot;for I love Robert. He was so like an older brother to my poor boy. I feel
                        just like a mother to him, and I can&apos;t bear to have anybody say anything against
                        him.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Nobody ever does say anything to his discredit, I suppose,&quot; said
                        Col. Barksdale. &quot;He is really one of the finest young men I ever knew, and the very
                        soul of honor, too. He comes honestly by that, however, for his father was just so before
                        him.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;That&apos;s just what I tell Cousin Edwin,&quot; said Cousin Sarah
                        Ann. &quot;I tell him dear Robert means to do right, and will do it just as soon as ever he
                        can. Poor fellow! he has been <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">so</hi> unfortunate. Somebody must have
                        made Cousin Edwin suspicions of him, else he wouldn&apos;t think so badly of poor
                        Robert.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Why, Sarah Ann, what do you mean?&quot; asked Col. Barksdale.
                        &quot;Surely Edwin has no reason to think ill of Robert.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;No, that he hasn&apos;t; and that&apos;s what I tell him. But
                        lie&apos;s been prejudiced and won&apos;t hear a word. He <pb id="VAA2333-131" n="140"
                            TEIform="pb"/> says nothing about it to anybody but mo, but ho really suspects Robert of
                        meaning to cheat Mm, ana&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Cheat him!&quot; cried all in a breath, &quot;Why, how can that
                        be?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O it <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">can&apos;t</hi> be, and so I tell Cousin
                        Edwin; but he insists that Robert told him he would pay that three hundred dollars on or before
                        the fifteenth, and I reckon the poor boy hasn&apos;t been able to do it, or he
                        would.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Why, Sarah Ann, yon don&apos;t tell mo that Robert has failed to pay
                        Edwin that money!&quot; said the Colonel.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Why, I thought you know that, or I wouldn&apos;t have told you about
                        it. No, he hasn&apos;t sent it yet; but he will, of course, if I can keep Cousin Edwin from
                        writing him violent letters about it.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Hasn&apos;t he written to explain the delay?&quot; asked the
                        Colonel.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;No; and that&apos;s what Cousin Edwin always reminds me of when I try
                        to take Robert&apos;s part. He says if ho meant to be honest he would have written. I tell
                        him I know how it is. I can fully understand Robert&apos;s silence. He has failed to get
                        money when he expected it, I reckon, and has naturally hated to write till he could send the
                        money. Poor boy! I&apos;m afraid he&apos;ll overwork himself and half starve himself,
                        too, trying to get that money together, when we could wait for it just as well as not.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;There certainly can be no apology for his failure to write, after promising
                        payment on a definite day.&quot; Said Col. Barksdale; &quot;and I am both surprised and
                        grieved that he should have acted in so unworthy a way!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-132" n="141" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">With this the Colonel arose and paced the room in evident anger. Robert&apos;s
                        champion, Cousin Sarah Ann, could not stand this.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Surely <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">you</hi> are not going to turn against
                        poor Robert without giving him a hearing, are you, Cousin Carter? I thought you too just for
                        that, though I should never have mentioned the subject at all if I hadn&apos;t thought you
                        all knew about it, and would take Robert&apos;s part like me.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I shall give him a hearing,&quot; said the Colonel; &quot;but in
                        the meantime I must say his conduct has been very singularvery singular indeed.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O he&apos;s only thoughtless!&quot; said the excellent woman, in
                        her anxiety to shield &quot;dear Robert.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;No; he is not thoughtless. He never is thoughtless, whatever else he may
                        be. If you wish to defend him, Sarah Ann, you must find some other excuse for his conduct.
                        Confound the fellow! I can&apos;t help loving him, but if he isn&apos;t what I took him
                        for, I&apos;ll&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The Colonel did not finish, his threat; perhaps he hardly knew how.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Now, Cousin Carter, please don&apos;t you fly into a passion like
                        Cousin Edwin does,&quot; said Cousin Sarah Ann, pleadingly, &quot;but wait till you find
                        out all the facts. Write to Robert, and I&apos;m sure he will explain it all. I wish I
                        hadn&apos;t said a word about it.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;You did perfectly right, perfectly,&quot; said Colonel Barksdale.
                        &quot;If Robert has failed in a point of honor, I ought to know it, because in that case I
                        have a duty to doa painful one, but a duty nevertheless.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-133" n="142" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O you men have no charity at all. You&apos;re <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi"
                            >so</hi> hard on one another, and I&apos;m so sorry I said anything about it. Good-by,
                        Cousin Mary. Good-by, Sudie dear. Come and see me, won&apos;t you? I miss you <hi rend="i"
                            TEIform="hi">so</hi> trouble. Come often. Come and stay some with me. Do. That&apos;s a

                    <p TEIform="p">And so Cousin Sarah Ann drove away, rejoicing in the consciousness that she had
                        vigorously defended the absent Robert; and perhaps rejoicing too in the conviction that that
                        gentleman could not possibly explain his conduct to the satisfaction of Colonel Barksdale.</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">MISS SUDIB BARKSDALE was a very brave little woman, and she needed all her courage on
                        the present occasion. She felt the absolute necessity there was that she should sit out Cousin
                        Sarah Ann&apos;s conversation, and she sat it out, in what agony it is not hard to imagine.
                        When that lady drove away Miss Sudie ran off to her room, where she remained for two or three
                        hours. Upon her privacy we will not intrude.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Col. Barksdale called Billy from his office, and giving him the newly discovered
                        facts, asked his opinion. Billy was simply thunderstruck.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I can&apos;t understand it,&quot; said he; &quot;Bob certainly
                        had that money coming to him from his last year&apos;s salary, for he told me about it the
                        day we first met in Philadelphia, If Bob isn&apos;t a man of honor, in the strictest sense
                        of the term, I never was so deceived in anybody in my life. And yet this business looks as ugly
                        as home-made sin. Bob knew perfectly well that if you or I had been at home when he left we
                        wouldn&apos;t have allowed his protested draft to stand over at all, but would have paid it
                        on <pb id="VAA2333-135" n="144" TEIform="pb"/> the spot. He knew too that if ho
                        couldn&apos;t pay when he promised he could have written to me or to you explaining the
                        matter, and we would have lent him the money for twenty years if necessary. I don&apos;t
                        understand it at all. It looks ugly. It looks as if lie meant to make that money
                        clear.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, my son,&quot; said Col. Barksdale, &quot;I&apos;ll give
                        him one chance to explain at any rate. I&apos;ll write to him immediately.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Accordingly the old gentleman went to his library and was engaged for some time in
                        writing. After awhile there came a knock at his door, and Miss Sudie entered.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Come in, daughter,&quot; said he, tenderly. &quot;I want to talk
                        with you.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I thought you would,&quot; said the sad-eyed little maiden,
                        &quot;and that&apos;s why I came. I wanted our talk to be private.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;You&apos;re a good girl, my child.&quot; Then, after a pause,
                        &quot;This is bad news about Robert.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Yes; and from a bad source,&quot; said Sudie.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I do not understand you, daughter.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;We have the best of authority, Uncle Carter, for saying that&apos; men
                        do not gather grapes of thorns!&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;But, my child, I suppose there can be no doubt of the facts in this case,
                        so far as we have them. We know the circumstances of Robert&apos;s indebtedness to Edwin,
                        and whatever her motives may have been, Sarah Ann would hardly venture to say that he has
                        neither paid nor written in explanation of his failure to do so, if he had done
                        either.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-136" n="145" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Perhaps not.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Robert ought to have paid at any cost to himself if it were possible; and
                        if it were not, then he should have written in a frank, manly way, explaining his inability to
                        fulfill his promise. Appearances are so strongly against him that I have written with very
                        little hope of eliciting any satisfactory reply,&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Will you mind letting me see what you have written, Uncle Carter?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;No; yon may read the letter. Here it is.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Miss Sudie read it. It ran thus:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I have just now learned that you have wholly failed to fulfill your solemn
                        and deliberate promise, made on the eve of your departure from Shirley, to the effect that you
                        would, without fail, take up your protested draft for three hundred dollars ($300), held by your
                        Cousin Major Edwin Pagebrook, on or before the fifteenth (15th), day of this current month. It
                        is now the thirtieth (30th), and hence your promise is fifteen (15) days over due. I learn also
                        that you have failed to write in explanation of your delinquency or in any way to account or
                        apologise for it. Permit me to say that as your conduct presents itself to me at this time, it
                        is unworthy the gentleman which you profess to be, and I now demand of you either that you shall
                        give me immediately a satisfactory explanation of the matterand that, I must confess, sir, seems
                        hardly possibleor that you shall at once write to my niece and adopted daughter, releasing her
                        from her engagement with you.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Having finished reading the letter Sudie handed it back <pb id="VAA2333-137" n="146"
                            TEIform="pb"/> to her uncle without a word of comment. Not that she was in this or in any
                        other case afraid to express her opinion. Her uncle knew very well when he gave her the letter
                        that she would say absolutely nothing about it until he should ask her, and he knew equally well
                        that upon asking her he would get a perfectly honest expression of her thought, whatever it
                        might happen to be. But Colonel Barksdale was, for the time, afraid to ask her opinion. He was a
                        brave man and an honest one. He was known throughout the state as a lawyer of great ability and
                        as a gentlemen of the most undoubted sort. And yet at this moment he found himself afraid of a
                        young girl, who stood in the relation of daughter to him a girl who was never violent in word or
                        act, a girl who honored him as a father and loved him with all her heart. He knew she would
                        unhesitatingly speak the truth, and it was the truth of which he was afraid. He had not been
                        aware, when he wrote, of any disposition to do Robert injustice, else, being a just man, he
                        would have spurned the thought torn him; but now that he felt bound to ask Miss Sudie for her
                        opinion of his course, he became uncomfortably conscious that there had been other impulses than
                        just ones governing him in his choice of language. At last he asked the dreaded question.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;What do you think, daughter?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I think you have not done yourself justice, Uncle Carter, in writing such a
                        letter as that. The letter is like you, at all.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-138" n="147" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Do you mean why and wherefore?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Yes. Why and wherefore, Sudie?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Because it is not like you to do an act of injustice, and when you are
                        betrayed into one your misrepresent yourself.&quot; child?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;But wherein is my letter an act of injustice, my child?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;IT assumes unproved guilt; and I believe even criminals are entitled to a
                        more favorable starting-point than that in their efforts to clear themselves.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;But, Sudie, I have not assumed that Robert is guilty. I have asked him to
                        explain.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Yes; and in the very act of asking him to explain to you, his judge, you
                        lave assured him from the bench that the court believes an explanation impossible.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Have I? Let me see.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">After looking at the letter again he resumed:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I believe you are right about that; I will rewrite the letter, omitting the
                        objectionable clause. Is that all Sudie?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Perhaps when you come to rewrite the letter you will see that its tone is
                        as unjust as any words could possibly be. It seems so to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Let me try my hand again, daughter. Keep your seat please while I write a
                        new letter instead of rewriting the old one.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;There. How will that do?&quot; he asked, as he handed the young woman
                        this hastily-written note.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;M<hi rend="sc" TEIform="hi">Y</hi> D<hi rend="sc" TEIform="hi">EAR</hi>

                        trust you will be able to <pb id="VAA2333-139" n="148" TEIform="pb"/> contradict or explain. It
                        is that you have failed to keep your promise in the matter of your indebtedness to Major
                        Pagebrook, and that you have not even offered a word by way of apology or explanation. The
                        peculiar relations in which you now stand to my family justify me, I think, in asking you to
                        explain a matter which, unexplained, must reflect upon your character as an honorable man.
                        Please write to me by return mail.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;That is more like you, Uncle Carter. But I am sorry to find that you are
                        convinced, in advance, of Robert&apos;s guilt. You propose to sit in judgment upon his case,
                        and a court should not only appear but be free from bias.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Why, my daughter, I can hardly see how there can be any possible excuse in
                        a case like this. You cannot deny that both facts and appearances are against him.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I doubt whether we have the facts yet, Uncle Carter. Aside from my
                        knowledge of Cousof Sarah Ann Page-brook&apos;s general character, I saw her do a
                        dishonorable thing once. I saw her open and read a letter which was not addressed to her, and I
                        have no faith whatever in her, or in any statement which comes from her or through
                        her.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Colonel Barksdale was probably not sorry that the conversation was interrupted at
                        this point by the entrance of a servant announcing a client. He felt that it would be idle to
                        argue with Sudie in a matter in which her feelings were strongly enlisted, and he felt that in
                        calling Robert to an account he was doing a simple duty. He was, there fore, rather pleased than
                        otherwise to have an accident <pb id="VAA2333-140" n="149" TEIform="pb"/> terminate a
                        conversation which did not promise to terminate itself agreeably.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Miss Sudie went to her room and wrote to Robert on her own account. I am not at
                        liberty to print her letter here, as I should greatly like to do, but the reader will readily
                        guess its general nature. She told Robert in detail everything that had been said concerning him
                        that day. She told him of her uncle&apos;s anger, and of the probability that everybody
                        would believe him guilty if he failed to establish his innocence; but she assured him that she,
                        at least, had no idea of doubting him for a moment.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;For your sake, &quot;she wrote,&quot; I hope you will be able to
                        offer a convincing explanation; but whether you can do that or not, Robert, <hi rend="i"
                            TEIform="hi">I know</hi> that you are true and manly, and not even facts shall ever make me
                        doubt your truth. I may never be able to see how your action has been right, but I shall know,
                        nevertheless, that it has been so. My woman love is truer, to me at least, than logictruer than
                        facttruer than truth itself.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">All this was very illogicalvery unreasonable, but very natural. It was &quot;just
                        like a woman&quot; to set her emotions up in a holy place and compel her reason to do homage
                        to them as to a god. And that is the very best thing there is about women, too. Your and I, sir,
                        would fare badly if in naming a woman wife we could not feel assured that her love will ever
                        override her reason in? matters concerning us.</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">THE law firm of Steel, Flint &amp; Sharp was a thoroughly well constituted one.
                        Its organization was an admirable example of means perfectly adapted to the accomplishment of
                        ends. It was not an eminent firm but it was an eminently successful one, particularly in the
                        lines of business to which it gave special attention, and the leading one of these was
                        collecting doubtful debts, as Cousin Sarah Ann had learned from one of the firm&apos;s cards
                        which had fallen in her way. Indeed it was the accidental possession of this card which enabled
                        her to put the matter of Robert&apos;s indebtedness into the hands of New York attorneys,
                        and I suspect that she would never have thought of doing so at all but for the enticing words,
                        fairly printed upon the card &quot;particular attention given to the collection of doubtful
                        debts, duo to non-residents of Hew York.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">A prophet, we know, is not without honor save in his own country, and so it is not
                        strange that the people who familiarly knew the countenances of the gentlemen <pb
                            id="VAA2333-142" n="151" TEIform="pb"/> composing the firm of Steel, Flint &amp; Sharp,
                        esteemed these gentlemen less highly than did those other people, resident outside of New York,
                        who could know these counselors at law only through their profusely distributed cards and
                        circulars. Such was the fact; and as a result it happened that the clients of the firm were
                        chiefly people who, living in other parts of the country, were compelled to intrust their
                        business in New York to the hands of whatever attorneys they believed were the leading ones in
                        the metropolis. And it was to let people know who were the leading lawyers of the city, that
                        Messrs. Steel, Flint &amp; Sharp industriously scattered their cards and circulars
                        throughout the country.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Who Mr. Steel was I do not know, and I am strongly inclined to suspect that the rest
                        of the world, including his partners, were in a state of equal ignorance. He was never seen
                        about the firm&apos;s offices, and never represented anybody in court, but he was frequently
                        referred to by his partners, especially when clients were disposed to complain of apparently
                        exorbitant charges.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Mr. Steel can not give his attention to a case, sir, for nothing. His
                        reputation is at stake, sir, in all we undertake. I really do not feel at liberty to ask Mr.
                        Steel to authorize any reduction in this case, sir. He gave his personal attention to the papers
                        his personal attention, sir.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">And this would commonly send clients away suppressed, if not satisfied.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Mr. Flint was well enough known. He managed the business of the firm. It was he who
                        always knew precisely <pb id="VAA2333-143" n="152" TEIform="pb"/> what Mr. Steel&apos;s
                        opinion was. He alone, of all the world, was able to speak positively of matters concerning Mr.
                        Steel. Mr. Sharp was his junior in the firm, though considerably his senior in years. For Mr.
                        Sharp Mr. Flint entertained not one particle of respect, because that gentleman was not always
                        what his name implied. Mr. Sharp left to himself would have beer, hopelessly honest and
                        straightforward. He would have gone to the dogs, speedily, Mr. Flint said, but for his
                        association with himself.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;But you have excellent ability in your way, Sharp, excellent
                        ability,&quot; lie would say when m a good humor. &quot;You are a capital executive
                        officera very good lieutenant. Your ideas of what to do in any given case are not always good,
                        but when I tell you what to do you do it, Sharp. I always know you will do what I tell you, and
                        do it well too.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Mr. Sharp usually came to the office an hour earlier than Mr. Flint did, in order
                        that he might have everything ready for Mr. Flint&apos;s examination when that gentleman
                        should arrive. He read the letters, drew up papers, and was prepared to give his partner in each
                        case the facts upon which his opinion or advice was necessary.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">On the morning of December 3d, Mr. Flint came softly into his office and, after
                        hanging up his overcoat and warming his hands at the register, went into his inner den, saying,
                        as he sat down:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I&apos;m ready for you now, Sharp.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Mr. Sharp arose from his desk and entered the private room? with his hands full of
                        papers.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-144" n="153" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;What&apos;s the first thing on docket, Sharp?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, here&apos;s a collection to be made. Debtor, Robert Pagebrook,
                        temporarily in the city. Boarding place not known. Writes for the newspapers, so I can easily
                        find him. Creditor Edwin Pagebrook, of Court House, Virginia. Debtor got creditor to cash draft
                        for three hundred dollars. Draft protested. Debtor came away, and promised to take up paper by
                        fifteenth November. Hasn&apos;t done it. Instructions &apos;push
                        him.&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Any limitations?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;No.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;What have you done?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Nothing yet; I&apos;ll look him up to-day and dun him.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Yes, and let him get away from you. Sharp do you know that Julius Csar is
                        dead?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Certainly.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I&apos;m glad to hear that you do know something then. Don&apos;t
                        you see the point in this case? Go and make out affidavits on information. This fellow Robert
                        what&apos;s his name is a &apos;transient,&apos; and we&apos;ll get an order of
                        arrest all ready and then you can dun him with some sense. Have your officer with you or
                        convenient, and if he don&apos;t pay up, chuck him in jail. That&apos;s the way to do
                        it. Never waste, time dunning &apos;transients&apos; when there&apos;s a ghost of a
                        chance to cage them.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, but there don&apos;t seem to be any fraud here. The man seems to
                        have had funds in the bank, only the hank suspended.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Sharp, you&apos;ll learn a little law after awhile, I hope.
                        Don&apos;t you know the courts never look very sharply after <pb id="VAA2333-145" n="154"
                            TEIform="pb"/> cases where transients are concerned? How do we know he had money in the
                        hank? Is there anything to show it?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;No; I believe not.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, then, don&apos;t yon go to making facts in the interest of the
                        other side. Let him make that out if he can. You just draw your affidavits to suit our purposes,
                        not his. Go on to state that he drew a certain bill of exchange, and represented that he had
                        funds, and so fraudulently obtained money, and all that; and then go on to say that his draft
                        upon presentation was protested, and that instead of making it good he absconded. Be sure to say
                        absconded, Sharp, it&apos;s half the battle. Courts haven&apos;t much use for men that
                        abscond and then turn up in New York. Make your case strong enough, though. We only swear on
                        information, you know, so if we do put it a little strong it don&apos;t matter. There. Go
                        and fix it up right away, and then catch your man.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">A few hours later, as Robert Pagebrook sat writing in his room, Mr. Sharp and another
                        man were shown in. Mr. Sharp opened the conversation.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;This is Mr. Pagebrook, I believe?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Mr. Robert Pagebrook?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Thank you. My name is Sharp, of the firm of Steel, Flint &amp; Sharp.
                        That&apos;s our card, sir. I have called to solicit the payment, sir, of a small amount due
                        Mr. Edwin Pagebrook, who has written asking us to collect it for him. The amount is three
                        hundred dollars, I <pb id="VAA2333-146" n="156" TEIform="pb"/>

                        </figure>
                        <pb id="VAA2333-147" n="157" TEIform="pb"/> think. Yes. Here is the draft. Can you let me have
                        the money to-day, Mr. Pagebrook?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I have already remitted one third the amount, sir,&quot; said Robert,
                        &quot;and I hope to send the remainder in installments very soon. At present it is simply
                        impossible for me to pay anything more.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Have you a receipt for the amount remitted?&quot; asked the lawyer.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;No. It was sent only yesterday. But if you will hold the draft a week or
                        ten days longer, I will be able, within that time, to earn the whole of the amount remaining
                        due, and your client will advise you, I am sure, of the receipt of the hundred dollars already
                        sent.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;We are not authorised to wait, sir,&quot; said Mr. Sharp.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;On the contrary our instructions are positive to push the case.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;But what can I do?&quot; asked Robert. &quot;I have already sent
                        every dollar I had, and until I earn more I can pay no more.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;The case is a peculiar one, sir. It has the appearance of a fraudulent debt
                        and an attempt to run away from it. I must do my duty by my client, sir; and so this gentleman,
                        who is a sheriff&apos;s officer, has an order for your arrest, which I must ask him to serve
                        if you do not pay the debt to day.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Let him serve it at once, then,&quot; said Robert. &quot;I can not
                        pay now.&quot;</p>

                    </head>
                    <p TEIform="p">AS Robert was unable to give bail without calling upon his friend Dudley, which he
                        determined not to do in any case, he was taken to the jail and locked up. Upon his arrival there
                        he employed a messenger to carry a note to a young lawyer with whom he happened to be slightly
                        acquainted, asking him to come to the jail at once. When he arrived Robert said to him:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Let me tell you in the outset, Mr. Dyker, that I have no money and no
                        friends; wherefore if you allow me to consult you at all, it must be with the understanding that
                        I cannot possibly pay you for your services until I can make the money. If you are willing to
                        trust me to that extent, we can proceed to business.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;You are very honorable, sir, to inform me, before-hand, of this fact. Pray
                        go on. I will do what I can for you.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;In the first place, then,&quot; said Robert, &quot;I am a little
                        puzzled to know how or why I am locked up. You have the papers, will yon tell mo how it
                        is?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-149" n="159" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O it&apos;s plain enough. Yon arc held under an order of
                        arrest.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;But I don&apos;t understand. I thought imprisonment for debt was a
                        thing of the past, in this country at least, and my only offense is indebtedness. Is it possible
                        that men may still be imprisoned for debt in America?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, that is about it,&quot; said the lawyer. &quot;We have
                        abolished the name but retain the thing in a slightly modified formin New York at least.
                        Theoretically you are not imprisoned, but merely held to answer. The plaintiffs have made out a
                        case of fraud and non-residence, and so they had plain sailing.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;But I always understood that our constitution or our law or something else
                        secured every man against imprisonment except by due process of law, and gave to every accused
                        person the right to be confronted with his accusers, to cross-examine witnesses, and to have his
                        guilt or innocence passed upon by a jury of his countrymen.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;That is the theory; but there are some classes of cases which are
                        practically exceptions, and yours is one of them.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Then,&quot; said Robert, &quot;it is true, is it, that an American
                        may be arrested and sent to jail without trial, upon the mere strength of affidavits made by
                        lawyers who know nothing of the facts except what they have heard from distant, irresponsible,
                        and personally interested clients affidavits upon information, I believe you call
                        them?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, you put it a little strongly, perhaps, but those are the facts in New
                        York. Respectable lawyers, however, are careful to satisfy themselves of the facts before <pb
                            id="VAA2333-150" n="160" TEIform="pb"/> proceeding at all in such cases; and so the law,
                        which is a very convenient one, rarely ever works injustice, I think not once in twenty times, I
                        should say.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;But,&quot; said Robert, &quot;the personal liberty of every
                        nonresident and some resident debtors is, or in some cases may be, dependent solely upon the
                        character of attorneys, as I understand you.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;In some cases, yes. But pardon me. Had we not better come to the matter in
                        hand?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;As we are not a legislature perhaps it would be better,&quot; said
                        Robert. He then proceeded to relate the facts of the case, beginning with his drawing of the
                        draft in good faith, its protest, and his consequent perplexity.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I did not &apos;abscond&apos; at all,&quot; he continued,
                        &quot;but came the away to see if I could save something from the wreck of the bank, and to
                        seek work. In leaving, I promised to pay the debt on or before the fifteenth of last month,
                        feeling certain that I could do so. I failed to do it, through never mind, I failed to do it,
                        but I have been trying hard ever since to get the money and discharge the obligation. I
                        yesterday remitted a hundred dollars, and should have sent the rest as fast as I could make it.
                        These are the facts. Now how am I to get out of here?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;You have nobody to go your bail?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Nobody.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;And no money?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;None. I sold my watch in order to get money on which to live while I was
                        looking for work.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-151" n="161" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;You did have money enough to your credit in that bank to have made your
                        draft good if the bank hadn&apos;t suspended?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;You can swear to that?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Certainly.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Then I think we can manage this matter without much difficulty. We can
                        admit the facts but deny the fraudulent intent, in affidavits of our own, and get discharged on
                        that ground. I think we can easily overthrow the theory of fraud by showing that you actually
                        had the money in bank and swearing that you drew against it in good faith.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Pardon me; out in doing that I should be bound, should I not, in honor if
                        not in law, to state all the facts of the case in my affidavit? The theory of the proceeding is
                        that I am putting the court in possession of all the facts and withholding nothing, is it
                        not?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Wellyes. I suppose it is.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Then let us abandon that plan forthwith.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;But my dear sir&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Pray don&apos;t argue the point. My mind is fully made up. Is there no
                        other mode of securing my release?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Yes; you might schedule out under article 5 of the Non-Imprisonment Act, I
                        think.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;How is that?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;It is a sort of insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding, by which you come into
                        courtany court of recordand offer to give up everything you have to your creditors, giving a
                        sworn catalogue of all your debts and all your <pb id="VAA2333-152" n="162" TEIform="pb"/>
                        property, and praying release on the ground that you are unable to do more.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, as I have literally nothing in the way of property just now, that
                        mode of procedure seems to fit my case precisely,&quot; said Robert, whose courage and good
                        humor and indomitable cheerfulness stood him in good stead in this time of very sore trial. The
                        world looked gloomy enough to him then in whatever way he chose to look at it, but the instinct
                        of fight was large within him, and in the absence of other joys he felt a savage pleasure in
                        knowing that his life henceforth must be a constant struggle against fearful oddsodds of
                        prejudice as well as of poverty; for who could now take him by the hand and say to others this
                        is my friend?</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;It&apos;s too late to accomplish anything to-day, Mr.
                        Page-brook,&quot; said the lawyer, looking at his watch; &quot;but I will effect, I
                        think, pretty quick. Good evening, sir.&quot;</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">WHEN the lawyer had gone Robert sat down to deliberate upon the situation and to
                        decide what was to be done in matters aside from the question of his release. He had that
                        morning received Col. Barksdale&apos;s letter and Miss Sudie&apos;s. These must be
                        answered at once, and he was not quite certain how he should answer them. After turning the
                        matter over he determined upon his course and, according to his custom, having determined what
                        to do he at once set about doing it. Having brought a supply of paper and envelopes from his
                        room he had only to borrow pen and ink from the attendant.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">His first letter was addressed to the president of the college from which he had
                        received his appointment as professor, and it consisted of a simple resignation, with no
                        explanation, except that contained in the sentence:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I can ill afford to surrender the position or the salary, but there are
                        painful circumstances surrounding me, fuller statement of the case.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">To Col. Barksdale he wrote:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Your letter surprises me only in its kindness and <pb id="VAA2333-154"
                            n="164" TEIform="pb"/> gentleness of tone. Under the circumstances I could have forgiven a
                        good deal of harshness. For your forbearance, however, you have my hearty thanks. And now as to
                        the subject matter of your note: I am sorry to say I can offer neither denial nor satisfactory
                        explanation of the facts alleged against me. I must bear the blame that attaches to what I have
                        done, and bearing that blame I know my duty to you and your family. I shall write by this mail
                        to Miss Barksdale volunteering a release, which otherwise you would have a right to demand of
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Sealing this and directing it, Robert came to the hardest task of allthe writing of a
                        letter to Cousin Sudie.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I hardly know how to write to you,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Your
                        generous faith in me in spite of everything is more than I had any right to expect, and more, I
                        think, than you have any right, in justice to yourself, to give me. I thank you for it right
                        heartily, but I feel that I must not accept it. When you listened to my words of love and gave
                        them a place in your heart, I was a gentleman without reproach. Now a, stain is upon my name,
                        which I can never remove. The man to whom you writes you this from a jail. I send this letter,
                        therefore, to offer you a release from your engagement with me, if know mo or even to remember
                        me hereafter. Forget me, then, or, if you cannot wholly forget, remember me only as an
                        adventurer, who for a paltry sum sold his good name.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Good-by. I wish you well with all my heart.&quot; As ho sealed these
                        letters Robert felt that his hopes for <pb id="VAA2333-155" n="165" TEIform="pb"/> the future
                        were scaled up with them, and that the post which should bear them away would carry with it the
                        better part of Iris life. And yet he did not wholly surrender himself to despair, as a weaker
                        man might have done. The old life was gone from him forever. The only people whom he had known
                        as in any sense his own would grasp his hand no more, and if they ever thought of him again it
                        would be only to regret that they had known him at all. All this he felt keenly, but it did not
                        follow that still a young man, and there was time enough for him to make a new life for
                        himselfto find new friends and to do some worthy work in the world; and to the planning of this
                        new life he at once addressed himself.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">He would teach no longer, and now that he had cut himself loose from that profession
                        there was opportunity to do something at the business which he had found so agreeable of late.
                        He would devote himself hereafter wholly to writing, and at the first opportunity lie would
                        become a regular member of the staff of some paper. Even if his earnings with his pen should
                        prove small, what did that matter? He could never think of marrying now, and a very little would
                        suffice to supply all his wants, his habits of life being simple and regular. It he knew, he

                    <p TEIform="p">THE men who make up mails and handle great bags full of letters every day of their
                        lives grow accustomed to the business, I suppose, and learn alter awhile to regard the bags and
                        their contents merely as so many pounds of &quot;mail matter.&quot; Otherwise they would
                        soon become unfit for their duties. If they could weigh those bags with other than material
                        scalesif they could know how many human hopes and fears; how much of human purpose and human
                        despair; how many joys and how much of wretchedness those bags contain; if they could hear the
                        moans that utter themselves inside the canvas; if they could know the varying purposes with
                        which all those letters have been written, and the various effects they are destined to produce;
                        if our mail carriers could know and feel all these things, or the half of them, we should
                        shortly have no mail carriers at all. But fortunately there are prosaic souls enough in the
                        world to make all necessary mail agents and postmasters, and undertakers and grave-diggers out
                        of.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">In the small mail bag thrown off at the Court House one December morning, there was
                        one little package of <pb id="VAA2333-157" n="167" TEIform="pb"/> New York lettersthree letters
                        in all, but on those three letters hung the happiness of several human lives. Of one of them we
                        shall learn nothing for the present. The other two, from Robert Pagebrook to his uncle and Miss
                        Bardsdale, we have already been permitted to read. When these were received at Shirley, Miss
                        Sudie took hers to her own room and read it there, after which she sat down and answered it.
                        Col. Barksdale read his with no surprise, as he had not been able to imagine any possible
                        explanation of Robert&apos;s conduct; and now that that gentleman frankly confessed that
                        there was none, he accepted the confession as a bit of evidence in the case, fro which he had
                        waited merely as a matter of form. It was his duty now to talk again with his niece, but felt an
                        especial tenderness now that she must be suffering sorely. He quietly inquired where she was,
                        and learning that she was in her own room, he refrained from summoning her himself, and gave her
                        maid particular instructions to allow no one else to intrude upon her privacy upon any pretense
                        whatsoever.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Lucy,&quot; he said, to the colored woman, &quot;your Miss Sudie
                        wishes to be alone for awhile. Sit down in the passage near her dor, but don&apos;t knock,
                        and don&apos;t allow any one else to knock. When she wishes to see any one she will open the
                        door herself, and until then I do not want her disturbed.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Then going into the dining-room, where Dick was polishing the mahogany with a large
                        piece of cork, he said: &quot;Dick, go out to the office and ask your Mas&apos; Billy if
                            <pb id="VAA2333-158" n="168" TEIform="pb"/> he will be good enough to come to me in the
                        library. I want to talk with him.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;When Billy came in his father showed him Robert&apos;s letter.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;The thing looks very ugly,&quot; said the younger gentleman.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Very ugly, indeed,&quot; said his father; &quot;but the confounded
                        rascal holds up his head under it all, and acts as honorably in Sudie&apos;s case as if he
                        had never acted otherwise than as a gentleman should. He is a puzzle to me. But, of course, this
                        must end the matter. We can have nothing whatever to do with him hereafter.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;But how is it, father, that they have managed to imprison him?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I presume they have secured an order of arrest under that New York statute
                        which seems to have been devised as a means of securing to creditors all the advantages of
                        imprisonment for debt without shocking the better sense of the community, which is clearly
                        against such imprisonment. The majority of people rarely ever pay any attention to the fact so
                        long as they are spared the name of odious things. No debtors&apos; prison would he allowed
                        to stand in the United States, of course, but the common jails answer all purposes when a way
                        for getting debtors locked up in them has been devised.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;But how does it happen, father,&quot; asked Mr. Billy, &quot;that
                        only New York has such a statute?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, in New York the commercial interest overrides every other, and
                        commercial men naturally attach undue importance to the collection of debts, and look with <pb
                            id="VAA2333-159" n="169" TEIform="pb"/> favor upon everything which tends to facilitate it.
                        These things always reflect the feeling rather than the opinion of a community. In new
                        countries, where horses are of more importance than anything else, horse-stealing is pretty sure
                        to he punished with death, either by law or by the mob, which is only public sentiment embodied.
                        Here in Virginia you know how impossible it is to get anything like an effective statute for the
                        suppression of dueling, simply because the ultimate public sentiment practically approves of
                        personal warfare. But, I confess, I did not know that the New York statute could be stretched to
                        cover a case like Robert&apos;s. As I understand it, there must be some evidence of fraud in
                        the inception of the transaction.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;They proceed upon affidavits, I believe,&quot; said Billy,
                        &quot;and when that is done it isn&apos;t hard to make out a case, if the attorney is
                        unscrupulous enough.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;That&apos;s true. But isn&apos;t it curious that Edwin should have
                        proceeded so promptly to harsh measures? He is so mild of temper that this surprises
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Cousin Edwin doesn&apos;t always act out his own character, you know,
                        father. His wife is the stronger willed of the two.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;True. I hadn&apos;t thought of that. However, it serves the young
                        rascal right.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">At this point of the conversation Cousin Sudie&apos;s knock was heard at the
                        inner door, and Col. Barksdale opening the outer one said:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;You&apos;d better go out this door, &quot;William. It would
                        embarrass Sue to find you here just now.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-160" n="170" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Come in my daughter,&quot; lie said, admitting Miss Sudie.
                        &quot;Sit down. I am greatly pained, on his account as well as yours, to find that Robert
                        has no explanation to offer. But, of course, this ends it all, and you must take a little trip
                        somewhere, my dear, until you forget all about it. &quot;Where shall we go?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I do not care to go anywhere, Uncle Carter,&quot; replied the little
                        maiden, without the faintest echo of a sob in her voice. &quot;I am sorry for poor Robert,
                        but not because I think him guilty of any dishonorable action, for indeed I do not.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;But, my dear, it will never do&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Pray hear me out, Uncle Carter, and then I will listen to anything you have
                        to say. I love you as a father, as you know perfectly well. Indeed I have never known you as
                        anything else. I have always obeyed you unquestioningly, and I shall not begin to disobey you
                        now. I shall do precisely what you tell me to do, <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">so long as I remain
                            in your house.&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;What do you mean by that, daughter?&quot; asked her uncle, startled by
                        the singular emphasis which Miss Sudie gave to the last clause of the sentence.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Merely this, Uncle Carter. I cannot consent to do that which my conscience
                        teaches me is a crime, even at your command; but while I remain at Shirley as a daughter of the
                        hours I must obey as a daughter. If you command me to do anything which I cannot do without
                        sinning against my conscience, then I must not obey you, and when I can&apos;t obey you I
                        must cease to be your daughter. I shall conceal nothing from you, Uncle <pb id="VAA2333-161"
                            n="171" TEIform="pb"/> Carter; you knew that, and I beg of you don&apos;t command me to
                        do the things which I must not do. I love you and it would kill meno, it would not do that, but
                        it would pain me more than I can possibly say, to leave Shirley.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Col. Barksdale leaned his head sorrowfully upon his hand. He loved this girl and held
                        her as his own. Moreover, he had solemnly promised his dying brother to care for her always as a
                        father cares for his children, and an oath could not have been more sacred in his eyes than this
                        promise was. Without raising his head he asked:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;You mean, Sudie, that you will not accept Robert&apos;s
                        release?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Yes, uncle, that is what I mean.&quot; This was sorrowfully and gently
                        said, but firmly too.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;He has offered to release you; has he not?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;And in so offering, did he express or hint a wish that you should not
                        accept his release?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;No. On the contrary he assumed that I would Here is his letter. Read it if
                        you please.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Col. Barksdale read the letter, with which the reader is already familiar, and,
                        handing it back, said:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;A very proper and manly letter.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Because it came from a very proper and manly man,&quot; said Miss
                        Sudie.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;You don&apos;t believe he has been guilty of the dishonorable acts laid
                        to his charge, then?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Of the acts, yes. Of the dishonor, no,&quot; said the girl.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-162" n="172" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;On what ground do you base your persistent good opinion of him?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;On my persistent faith in him.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Your faith is very unreasonable, my dear.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Perhaps so, but it exists nevertheless.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Yes, sir; and I have brought my answer for you to read, if you care to do
                        so,&quot; she said, taking her letter out of her desk, which lay in her lap, and giving it
                        to her uncle, who read as follows:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;M<hi rend="sc" TEIform="hi">Y</hi> D<hi rend="sc" TEIform="hi">EAR</hi>
                            R<hi rend="sc" TEIform="hi">OBERT</hi>:I am not in the least surprised by your letter. I
                        knew you would offer to release me from my engagement, because I Knew you were a man of honor. I
                        have never for a moment doubted that, and I do not doubt it now. Your character weighs more with
                        me than any mere facts can. I know you are an honorable man, and knowing that I shall not let
                        other people&apos;s &apos;listened to your words of love, and gave them a place in my
                        heart,&apos; you were, as you say, &apos;a gentleman without reproach&apos;; and the
                        reproach which lies upon you now does not make you less a gentleman. It is an unjust reproach,
                        and your manliness in bearing it and offering to accept its consequences, only serves to mark
                        you still more distinctly as a gentleman. Shall I be less honorable, less fearlessly true than
                        you? When I gave you my heart and promised you my hand, you had friends in abundance. Now that
                        you have none, I have no idea of withdrawing either the gift or the promise.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;You say you can never clear your name of the stain <pb id="VAA2333-163"
                            n="173" TEIform="pb"/> which is upon it now. For that I am heartily sorry, for your sake,
                        but as I know that the stain does not rightly belong there it becomes my duty and my pleasure to
                        bear it with you. I shall retain my faith in you and my love for you, and I shall profess them
                        too on all proper occasions, and when you claim me as your wife I shall hold up Mrs. Robert
                        Pagebrook&apos;s head as proudly as I now hold Susan Barksdale&apos;s.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Under other circumstances I should have thought it unmaidenly to write in
                        this way, but there must be no doubt of my meaning now. If you ever ask a release from your
                        promise, with or without reason, I trust you know me well enough to know that it will be granted
                        but from ray promise I shall ask none. Another reason for the frankness of this letter is that I
                        want you, in your I should certainly never trust such a letter in any but the cleanest of hands.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Uncle Carter will see this before it goes, and he will know, as it is right
                        that he should, that I have not availed&apos; myself of yonr proffered release. . . . .

                    <p TEIform="p">The omitted sentences with which the letter closed are not for our eyes. Even Colonel
                        Barksdale refused to read them, feeling that they were sacred, and that the permission given him
                        to read the letter extended no further than the end of the sentence last set down in the extract
                        above given.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Returning the sheet he said: &quot;I suppose you have written this after giving

                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I never act without knowing what I am doing, Uncle Carter.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, my child, I think you are wrong, but I shall not ask you to do
                        anything which your conscience condemns. I shall not ask you to withhold your letter, or to
                        alter it, but I would prefer that you hold it until tomorrow, so that you may be quite sure you
                        want to send it as it is. Will you mind doing that?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;No, Uncle Carter. I will keep it till to-morrow, if you wish, but I shall

                        forehead, she left him, not to return to her room as a more sentimental woman would have done,
                        but to go about her daily duties, with a sober face, it is true, but with all her accustomed

                    <p TEIform="p">WHEN Miss Sudie left him Col. Barksdale again sent for his son and told him of that
                        young woman&apos;s unreasonable determination.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I expected that, father, and am not at all surprised,&quot; said the
                        young man.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Why, my son? Had you talked the matter over with her?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;No. But I know Sudie too well to expect her to give up her faith in Bob
                        while he is under a cloud and in trouble too. She has a mighty good head on her shoulders; but
                        what&apos;s a woman&apos;s head worth when her heart pulls the other way? She overrides
                        her own reason as coolly as if it were worth just nothing at all, and puts everybody
                        else&apos;s out of the way with the utmost indifference. I know her of old. She used to take
                        my part that way whenever I got into a boyish scrape, and before she had done with it she always
                        convinced me, along with ererybody else, that I had done nothing to be ashamed of. The fact is,
                        father, I like that in Sudie. She&apos;s the truest little woman I ever saw, and she sticks
                        to her friends like mutton gravy to the roof of your mouth,&quot; said Billy, unable, <pb
                            id="VAA2333-166" n="176" TEIform="pb"/> even at such a time as this, to restrain his passion
                        for strange metaphors.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;The trait is a noble one, certainly,&quot; said the old gentleman;
                        &quot;but for that very reason, if for no other, we must do what we can to keep her from
                        sacrificing herself to a noble faith in an unworthy man. Don&apos;t you think so?</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Without doubts But what can we do? You say you do not feel free to control
                        her.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;We can at least do our duty. I have talked with her, and now I want you to
                        do the same. She will not shun the conversation, I think, for she is a brave girl.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I will see what I can do, father,&quot; said the young man.
                        &quot;Possibly I may persuade her to let the matter rest where it is, for the present at
                        least, and even that will be something gained.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Col. Barksdale was right in thinking that Miss Sudie would not seek to avoid a
                        conversation with Billy. On the contrary she wished especially to say something to this young
                        gentleman, and for that very purpose she sought him in the office. He and she had been brought
                        up as brother and sister, and there was no feeling of restraint between them now that they were
                        grown man and woman.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Cousin Billy,&quot; she said, sitting down near him, &quot;I want
                        to talk with you about Robert. I want to remind you, if you will let me, of your duty to
                        him.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;What do you conceive my duty to be in the case, Sudie?&quot; asked
                        Billy.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;To defend him,&quot; said Miss Sudie.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-167" n="177" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;But how can I do that, Sudie, in face of the facts?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;You believe then that Robert Pagebrook, whom yon know thoroughly, has done
                        the dishonorable things laid to his charge?</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well,&quot; said Billy, feeling himself hardly prepared for this kind
                        of attack, &quot;I confess I should never have thought him capable of doing such
                        things.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Why would you never have thought him capable of doing them, Cousin
                        Billy?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O well, because he always seemed to be such an honorable fellow,&quot;
                        said Billy.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;You did believe him honorable, then?&quot; asked this young female
                        Socrates.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Certainly; you know that Sudie.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;On what did you base that belief, Cousin Billy?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Why, on his way of doing things, on my knowledge of him, of
                        course;&quot; replied Billy.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, then, is that knowledge of him of no value now?&quot; asked
                        Sudie.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;How do you mean?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I mean does your knowledge of Robert weigh nothing now? Are yon ready to
                        believe on imperfect evidence, that Robert Pagebrook, who you know was an honorable man, is not
                        now an honorable man? Doesn&apos;t character weigh anything with you? Do you believe his
                        character has changed, or do you think it possible that he simulated that character and did it
                        so perfectly as to deceive us all? Doesn&apos;t it seem more probable that there is some
                        mistake about this business? In short, how can you believe Robert guilty of a thing which yon
                        know very <pb id="VAA2333-168" n="178" TEIform="pb"/> well he wouldn&apos;t do for his head?
                        If you &apos;wouldn&apos;t have believed it,&apos; why do you believe it?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Mr. Billy was stunned. He had been prepared for tears. He had expected to find in
                        Sudie an unreasoning faith. He had looked for an obstinate determination on her part to adhere
                        to her purpose. But for this kind of illogical logic he had made no preparation whatever. It had
                        never entered his head that Miss Sudie would seriously undertake to argue the matter. The
                        evidence against Robert he had accepted as unquestionable, and he had not expected Miss Sudie to
                        question it in this way.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;But, Cousin Sudie, you overlook the fact that Robert has confessed the very
                        thing which you say is unlikely.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;No; he has not confessed anything of the sort. Indeed he seems to have
                        carefully avoided doing so. In his letter to Uncle Carter he merely says, &apos;I can offer
                        neither denial nor explanation of the facts alleged against me.&apos; To me he only says,
                        &apos;a stain is upon my name.&apos; He nowhere says, I am guilty.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;But, Sudie,&quot; said Billy, &quot;if he a&apos;n&apos;t
                        guilty, why can&apos;t he offer either &apos;denial or explanation&apos;?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;That I do not know; but I don&apos;t find it half as hard to believe
                        that there may be good reasons for that, as to believe that an honorable mana man whom we both
                        know to be an honorable onehas done a dishonorable thing.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;But, Sudie, why didn&apos;t Bob borrow the money of father or of me, if
                        he honestly couldn&apos;t pay? He knew we would gladly lend it to him.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-169" n="179" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I&apos;m glad you mentioned that. If Robert had wanted to swindle
                        anybody, how much easier it would have been for him to write to you or Uncle Carter, saying he
                        couldn&apos;t pay and asking you to take up his protested draft for him. He knew you would
                        have done it, and he could then have accomplished his purpose without any exposure. Almost any
                        excuse would have satisfied you or Uncle Carter, and so the thing would have gone on for years.
                        Wouldn&apos;t he have done exactly that, Cousin Billy, if he had wanted to swindle anybody?
                        Men don&apos;t often covet a bad name for its own sake.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Clearly, Sudie, I am getting the worst of this argument. You are a better
                        sophist than I ever gave you credit for being. But it&apos;s hard to believe that black is
                        white. I&apos;ll tell you what I&apos;ll do, though, Sudie. I&apos;ll do my very
                        best to believe that there is some sort of faint possibility that facts a&apos;n&apos;t
                        facts, and hold myself, as nearly as I can, in readiness to believe that something may turn up
                        in Bob&apos;s favor. If anything were to turn up I&apos;d be as glad of it as
                        anybody.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;But I&apos;m not satisfied with that, Cousin Billy.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;What more do you ask, Sudie?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;That you shall hold yourself in readiness to help turn something up
                        whenever an opportunity offers. Keep a sharp lookout for things which may possibly have a
                        bearing upon this matter, and follow up any clue you may get. Won&apos;t you do that or my
                        sake, Cousin Billy?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I&apos;d do anything for your sake, Sudie, and I&apos;d give a
                        hundred dollars for your faith.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">And so ended the conversation. Mr. Billy, it must be <pb id="VAA2333-170" n="180"

                        himself. But as he himself put it: &quot;What on earth was a fellow to do with a faith which
                        made incontestable truths out of impossibilities, and scattered facts before it like a flock of
                        partridges?&quot; Mr. Billy fully appreciated the unreasonableness of Miss Sadie&apos;s
                        logic, and yet, in spite of all, he could not help entertaining a sort of half hope that
                        something would occur to &quot;vindicate Roberta hope born of nothing more substantial than
                        Miss Sudie&apos;s enthusiastic belief in her lover.</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">ON the morning after Robert&apos;s incarceration, his attorney came at the

                        his discharge.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I have the affidavits all ready, I believe, Mr. Page-brook, and we have
                        only to make a complete list of your property.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;That will be easily done, sir,&quot; said Robert, with a feeling of
                        grim amusement; &quot;as I have literally nothing except my trunk and its
                        contents.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;You have your claim on that bank for money deposited. I suppose that must
                        be included, though, it is only a <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">chose</hi> in action.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O put it in, by all means,&quot; said Robert. &quot;I do not wish
                        to misrepresent anything or to withhold anything. I only wish the <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi"
                            >chose</hi> in action, as you call it, were of sufficient value to discharge the debt. I

                        have this thing to pay.&apos;</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;But it will not free me in honor sir. It will give me time, however; and
                        the very first use I shall make of that time will be to earn the money with which to pay off
                        this, my only debt. I should never ask a discharge at all if the asking supposed any purpose on
                        my part to avoid the payment of the debt. Pardon me; this talk must sound odd to you, coming
                        from a man in my present position. I forgot that I am an absconding debtor. You will think my
                        talk a cheap kind of honesty, costing nothing.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;No, Pagebrookif you will allow me to drop the &apos;Mister&apos;I
                        should trust you in any transaction, though I have not known you a week. I don&apos;t
                        believe you are an absconding debtor, and I&apos;m not going to believe it on the strength
                        of any oaths Messrs. Steel, Flint &amp; Sharp may make.&quot; As he said this the young
                        lawyer took Robert&apos;s hand, and Robert found himself wholly unable to litter a word by
                        way of reply. He did not want to shed tears in the presence of his jail attendants, but the
                        lawyer saw them standing in his eyes, and prevented any effort at replying by turning at once to
                        the matter in hand.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Come, Pagebrook,&quot; he said, &quot;this isn&apos;t business.

                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;The Essex,&quot; said Robert.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;The Essex!&quot; said the lawyer. &quot;What was that I saw in the

                        Bank, of this city, which suspended payment some weeks since, will resume business to-morrow.
                        Its affairs were found to be in a very favorable condition, and at a meeting of the
                        stockholders, held to-day, the deficit in its assets was covered, and its capital made good by
                        subscription. It is not thought that any run will be made upon it, but ample preparations have
                        been made to meet such a contingency.&apos;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Again I congratulate you, right heartily.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;This means then, that my sixteen hundred dollars that was the total amount
                        of my depositis intact, and that I may cheek against it as soon as I choose, does it?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Certainly.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Then let us suspend our preparations for securing my release. I will pay
                        out of this instead of begging out. I will draw at once for enough to cover this debt and your
                        fees, and ask you to put the draft into bank for collection. We will have returns by the day
                        after to-morrow, doubtless, and I shall then go out of here with my head up.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;We&apos;ll end this business sooner than that, Page-brook,&quot;
                        said the lawyer. &quot;Draw your draft, I&apos;ll indorse it, take it to the bank where
                        I deposit, get it cashed at once, and have you out of here in time for a two o&apos;clock
                        lunch. You&apos;ll lunch with me, of course.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Pardon me, but you have no means of knowing that I have any money in that
                        bank,&quot; said Robert.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-174" n="184" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Yes, indeed I have.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Your word. I told you I would trust you.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Robert looked at the man a moment, and then taking his hand, said:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I accept your confidence frankly. Thank you. Draw the draft, please, and I
                        will sign it.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The draft was soon drawn, and at two o&apos;clock that day just twenty-four hours
                        after his arrestRobert sat down to lunch with his friend, in a down-town eating-house.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">While the two gentlemen were engaged with their lunch, Robert&apos;s friend
                        Dudley, who had been eating a chop at the farther end of the room, espied his acquaintance, and
                        approaching him said:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;How are you, Pagebrook? Are you specially engaged for this
                        afternoon?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;No, I believe not,&quot; said Robert. &quot;I have nothing to do
                        except to finish an article which I want to offer you to-morrow, and I can do that to-night.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Suppose you come up to the office, then, after you finish your lunch. I
                        want to talk with you.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I will be there within half an hour, if that will suit you,&quot; said
                        Robert.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Very well; I&apos;ll expect you.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Accordingly, Robert bade his friend adieu after lunch, and went immediately to the
                        editor&apos;s room.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Mr. Dudley closed the door, first saying to his messenger, who sat in the anteroom;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I shall be busy for some time, Eddie, and can&apos;t see <pb
                            id="VAA2333-175" n="185" TEIform="pb"/> anybody. If any one calls, tell him I am closeted
                        with a gentleman on important business and can see nobody. Now, Pagebrook,&quot; he resumed,
                        taking his seat, &quot;you ought to quit teaching.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Why?&quot; asked Robert.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, you&apos;re a born writer certainly, and if I am not greatly
                        mistaken, a born journalist too. You have a knack of knowing just what points people want to
                        hear about. I&apos;ve been struck with that in every article you have written for me, and
                        especially in this last one. Do you know I&apos;ve rejected no less than a dozen
                        well-written articles on that very subject, just because they treated every phase of it except
                        the right one, and didn&apos;t come within a mile of that. Now you&apos;ve hit it
                        exactly, as you always do. You&apos;ve got hold of precisely the things that nobody knows
                        anything about and everybody wants to know all about, and that&apos;s journalism.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Robert. &quot;You really think, then, that I
                        might make myself a successful journalist if I were to try?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I know you would. You have precisely the right sort of ideas. You
                        discriminate between the things that are wanted and the things that are not. I have long since
                        discovered that this thing that men call writing ability and journalistic ability isn&apos;t
                        like anything else. It crops out where you would never look for it, and where you think it ought
                        to be it isn&apos;t. You can&apos;t coax or nurse it into existence to save your life.
                        If a man has it he has it, and if he hasn&apos;t it ho hasn&apos;t it, and nobody can
                        give it to him. It isn&apos;t contagious, and I honestly <pb id="VAA2333-176" n="186"
                            TEIform="pb"/> believe it isn&apos;t acquirable. And that&apos;s why I&apos;m
                        certain of you. You&apos;ve shown that you have it, and one showing is as good as a
                        hundred.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I am greatly pleased,&quot; said Robert, &quot;to know that you
                        think so well of me in this respect, for I have resigned my professorship and determined to make
                        my way, to the best of my ability, as a journalist, hereafter?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;You have?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Yes; I sent my letter of resignation yesterday.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I&apos;m heartily glad of it, old fellow, and selfishly glad, too, for
                        it was to persuade you to do that that I sat down to talk to you. You see my health is not very
                        good lately; the fact is I have been using the spur too much, and am pretty well run down with
                        overwork. The publishers have been urging me to get an assistant, and the trouble is to get one
                        who can really relieve me of a share of the work. I can get plenty of people to undertake it,
                        hut I have to go over their work to be sure of it, and it&apos;s easier to do it myself from
                        the first. Now you are just the man I want, if you can stand the salary. The publishers will let
                        me pay forty dollars a week. You can make more than that from the outside, I suppose, but
                        it&apos;s better to be in a regular situation, I think. How would you like to try the
                        thing?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Nothing could be more to my taste. I think I should like this better than
                        daily paper work, and besides it gives one a better opportunity for growth. But before we talk
                        any more about it I feel myself in honor bound to tell you what has happened to me lately. If
                        you care then to repeat your offer, I shall gladly accept it, but if you feel <pb
                            id="VAA2333-177" n="187" TEIform="pb"/> the slightest hesitation about it, I shall not blame
                        you for not renewing it.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">And Robert told him everything, but Dudley declined to believe that there had been
                        any just cause for the arrest, or that Robert had in any way violated the strictest canons of
                        honor.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">This young man seemed, indeed, to be perfect master of the art of making people
                        believe in him in spite of the most damaging facts. Miss Sudie&apos;s faith in him never
                        wavered for an instant. Even Billy had to keep a synopsis of the evidence against his cousin
                        constantly in mind to keep himself from &quot;believing that he couldn&apos;t sec
                        through glass,&quot; as he phrased it. The New York lawyer, summoned to get the young man
                        out of jail, backed his faith in him, as we have seen, by indorsing his draft for several
                        hundred dollars; and now Dudley, after hearing a plain statement of the facts from
                        Robert&apos;s own lips, dismissed them as of no consequence, and set up his own unreasonable
                        faith as a complete answer to them. He renewed his offer, and Robert accepted it, becoming
                        office editor of the weekly paper for which he had recently been writing.</p>

                    </head>
                    <p TEIform="p">IT now becomes necessary to a proper understanding of this history that we shall go
                        back a day or two, to the day, in fact, on which Robert&apos;s letters were received at
                        Shirley. I said there were three New York letters in the mail-bag thrown off at the Court House
                        that morning. The third letter there referred to was from the law firm of Steel, Flint &amp;
                        Sharp. It was addressed to Edwin Pagebrook, Esq., and quite by accident it fell into that
                        gentleman&apos;s hands. I say by accident, because Cousin Sarah Ann had taken unusual
                        precautions to prevent precisely this result. After writing to the lawyers, it occurred to that
                        estimable lady that a reply would come in due time, and that as she had taken the liberty of
                        signing her husband&apos;s name to her letter, the reply would be addressed to him rather
                        than to her, and she greatly feared that he would have an opportunity to read it. She
                        particularly wished that this should not happen. She knew her mild-mannered and long-suffering
                        husband thoroughly, and, while she felt free to torment him in various ways, she had learned,
                        from one or two bits of <pb id="VAA2333-179" n="189" TEIform="pb"/> experience, that it was not
                        the part of wisdom to tax his endurance too far. Accordingly she took pains to prevent him from
                        visiting the Court House while she was expecting the letter. She laid various plans for the
                        purpose of keeping him occupied on the plantation every day, and took care to secure the first
                        look into the family post-bag whenever the servant returned with it. On the morning in question,
                        however, as Maj. Pagebrook was riding over his plantation, inspecting work, he met a neighbor
                        who was going to the Court House, and having some small matters to attend to there he determined
                        to join the neighbor in his ride. Upon his arrival he called for his letters, and so it came
                        about that the note in which Messrs. Steel, Flint &amp; Sharp, &quot;begged to inform
                        him&quot; of Robert&apos;s arrest in accordance with his instructions, fell into his
                        hands. At first he was puzzled, and thought there must have been some mistake, but after awhile
                        a glimmering of the truth dawned upon him, and in his smothered way he was exceedingly angry. He
                        had condemned Robert&apos;s misconduct as severely as anybody, but had never dreamed of
                        proceeding to harsh measures in the matter. Besides, it was only the day before that
                        Robert&apos;s remittance of one hundred dollars had come to him, and, in acknowledging its
                        receipt, he had partially satisfied his resentment by telling his cousin &quot;what he
                        thought of him,&quot; and to learn now that the young man was in jail for the fault, and
                        apparently at his behest, was sorely displeasing to him. And worse than all, his wife had taken
                        an unwarrantable liberty in the affair, and this he determined to resent. He mounted his horse,
                            <pb id="VAA2333-180" n="190" TEIform="pb"/> therefore, and was on the point of starting
                        homeward when Dr. Harrison accosted him.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Good morning, Maj. Pagebrook. May I speak to you a moment?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Good morning, Charles.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Has there been any administrator appointed for Ewing&apos;s
                        estate?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;No, not yet. I reckon I must take out papers next court day, as he was of
                        age when he died. It&apos;s only a matter of form, I reckon, as there are no
                        debts.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, my only reason for asking is I hold Ewing&apos;s note for two
                        hundred and twenty-five dollars. I&apos;m in no hurry, only I wanted to act regularly and
                        get it in shape by presenting it.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;You have Ewing&apos;s note? Why, what is it for?&quot; asked Major
                        Pagebrook in astonishment.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Borrowed money,&quot; answered the doctor.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Borrowed money? But how did he come to borrow it?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, the fact is Ewing got to playing bluff with Foggy one day just before
                        he got sick, and Foggy <unclear TEIform="unclear">fleeeed</unclear> him pretty badly, and I lent
                        him the money to pay out with. He didn&apos;t want to owe it to Foggy, you know.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Have you the note with you?&quot; asked Maj. Pagebrook.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;No. It&apos;s in my office; but I can get it if you&apos;d like to
                        look at it.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;No; it&apos;s no matter, if you can tell me the date.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;It bears date November 19th, I think.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Just one day after he came of age,&quot; said Maj. <unclear
                            TEIform="unclear">Page-</unclear>
                        <pb id="VAA2333-181" n="191" TEIform="pb"/> brook. &quot;Well, I&apos;ll see about it,
                        Charles,&quot; and with this the two gentlemen separated.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Major Pagebrook rode homeward, meditating upon the occurrences of the morning. He had
                        determined to manage his own business hereafter without tolerating improper interference upon
                        the part of his wife, and he was in position to do this, too, except with regard to the home
                        plantation, which, as Ewing had informed Robert, was held in Cousin Sarah Ann&apos;s name.
                        Major Pagebrook was a quiet man a and long-suffering one. He liked nothing so much as peace, and
                        to keep the peace he had always yielded to the more aggressive nature of his wife. But he felt
                        now that the time had come for him to assert his supremacy in business matters, and he
                        determined to assert it very quietly but very positively. One point was as good as another, he
                        thought, for the purpose, and this newly-discovered debt of Ewing&apos;s gave him an
                        excellent occasion for the self-assertion upon which he had resolved. Several times of late he
                        had mildly suggested to Cousin Sarah Ann the propriety of putting Ewing&apos;s papers into
                        Billy Barksdale&apos;s hands for examination, so that the boy&apos;s affairs might be
                        properly and legally adjusted. To every such suggestion Cousin Sarah Ann, who carried the key of
                        Ewing&apos;s portable desk, had turned a deaf ear, saying that there were no debts one way
                        or the other, and that she &quot;wouldn&apos;t have anybody overhauling the poor
                        boy&apos;s private papers.&quot; Now, however, Major Pagebrook had made up his mind to
                        put the desk into Bill&apos;s hands without asking the excellent lady&apos;s consent.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-182" n="192" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Don&apos;t take my horse, Jim,&quot; he said to his servant upon
                        arriving at home, &quot;I am going to ride again presently. Just tie him to the rack till I
                        want him.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Going into the house, he met Cousin Sarah Ann, to whom he said:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Sarah Ann, I will write my own letters and attend to my own business
                        hereafter, and I&apos;ll thank you not to sign my name for me again. You have placed me in a
                        very awkward position, and I can&apos;t explain it to anybody without exposing you.
                        Understand me now, please. I will not tolerate any such interference in future.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Ordinarily Cousin Sarah Ann would have been ready enough with a reply to such a
                        remark as this, but just now she was fairly frightened by her husband&apos;s tone and
                        manner. She saw at a glance that he was in very serious earnest, and she knew him well enough to
                        know that it would not do to provoke him further. She was always afraid of him, even when she
                        was riding rough-shod over him. When he seemed most submissive and she most aggressive, she was
                        in the habit of scanning his countenance very carefully, as an engineer watches his steam gauge.
                        When she saw steam rising, she usually had the safety valvea flood of tearsready for immediate
                        use. Just now she saw indications of an explosion, which appalled her, and she dared not face
                        the danger for a moment. Without reply, therefore, she sank, weeping, into the nearest chair,
                        while her husband walked into her room, opened her wardrobe, and took from it the little desk in
                        which his son&apos;s letters and papers were locked. Coming back to her he said:</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-183" n="194" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <figure entity="VAA2333-9" TEIform="figure">
                        <p rend="center" TEIform="p">&quot;VERY WELL, THEN.&quot;</p>
                    </figure>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-184" n="195" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I will take the key to this desk, if you please.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">She looked up with a frightened countenance, and asked:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;What for?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I want to open the desk.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;What are you going to do with it?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I&apos;m going to put it into my lawyer&apos;s hands.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Wait then. I must look over the papers first.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;No; Billy will do that.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;But there&apos;s some of mine in it, private ones.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;It doesn&apos;t matter. Billy will sort them and return yours to
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;But, he <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">sha&apos;n&apos;t</hi> look at my
                        papers.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Give me the key, Sarah Ann.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I can&apos;t. It&apos;s lost.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Very well then,&quot; said he, taking his knife from his pocket,
                        breaking the frail lock, and walking out of the house without another word.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Cousin Sarah Ann was thoroughly overcome. She knew that her husband had received the
                        reply to her letter, which she had meant to receive herself, and she knew too that her mastery
                        over him was at an end, for the present at least. Worse than all, she knew that the desk and its
                        contents would inevitably go into Billy Barksdale&apos;s hands, and she had her own reasons
                        for thinking this the sorest affliction possible to her. There was no help for it now, however,
                        and she could do nothing except throw herself on her bed and shed tears of bitter mortification,
                        vexation, and dread.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Meanwhile Major Pagebrook galloped over to Shirley, <pb id="VAA2333-185" n="196"
                            TEIform="pb"/> with the desk under his arm. The conversation already reported between Billy
                        and Miss Sudie, was hardly more than finished when he dismounted and walked into the young
                        lawyer&apos;s office.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">He opened his business by telling Billy about the note held by Dr. Harrison.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I don&apos;t understand it,&quot; he said. &quot;Harrison says
                        the note is dated November 19th, which was just one day after Ewing came of age, and I remember
                        that Ewing was taken sick on the morning of his birthdayvery sick, as you know, and never left
                        his bed afterwards.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;When was Ewing at the Court House last?&quot; asked Billy.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Not since the day Robert left.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Did he owe Harrison any money that you know of?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;No; but Harrison says Foggy won that much from him, and he had to borrow to
                        pay it.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;You are sure, however, that Ewing could not possibly have had a chance to
                        sign the note after he came of age?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Of course he couldn&apos;t. He was delirious from the very first, and
                        we never left him.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I think I see how it is,&quot; said Billy. &quot;Foggy and Charley
                        Harrison are too intimate for any straight dealings. I <unclear TEIform="unclear"
                        >reckon</unclear> Charley was as deeply interested in the winnings as Foggy was, but they have
                        made Ewing execute the note to Charley for money borrowed to pay Foggy with so that it would be
                        legally good. They made him date it ahead, too, so that it would appear to have been executed
                        after Ewing came of age. They <pb id="VAA2333-186" n="197" TEIform="pb"/> didn&apos;t
                        anticipate his sickness, and they haven&apos;t thought to compare dates. I think we can beat
                        them this time, when they get ready to sue.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;But we mustn&apos;t let them sue, Billy,&quot; said Major
                        Pagebrook. &quot;I would never consent to plead the baby act or to get out of it by any
                        legal quibble if the signature is genuine, as I reckon it is. That wouldn&apos;t be
                        honorable. No, I shall pay the note off; and I only want to know whether I must charge it to
                        Ewing&apos;s estate or not, after taking out administration papers. If I can, I ought to, in
                        justice to the other children. If I can&apos;t, I must pay it myself. Look into it, please,
                        and let me know about it. I have brought you Ewing&apos;s desk, so you can look over all his
                        papers and attend to all his affairs for me. I want to get everything straight.&quot; So
                        saying he took his leave.</p>

                    </head>
                    <p TEIform="p">NOT until the next morning did Mr. Billy find time to examine the papers in
                        Ewing&apos;s desk. Indeed, even then he deemed the matter one of very little consequence,
                        inasmuch as the papers, whatever they might happen to be, were probably of no legal importance,
                        being of necessity the work of a minor. There might be memoranda there, however, and possibly a
                        will disposing of personal property, which, under the law of Virginia, would be good if executed
                        by a minor over eighteen years of age.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">In view of these possibilities, therefore, Billy sat down to the task of examining
                        the papers, which were pretty numerous, such as they were. After awhile he became interested in
                        the very miscellaneousness of the assortment. Little memoranda were thereof the date on which a
                        horse had been shod; of the amount paid for a new pair of boots; of the times at which the boy
                        had written letters to his friends, and of a hundred other unimportant things. There were bits
                        of poor verse, too, such as may be found in the desk of almost every boy.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-188" n="199" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">Old letters, full of nothing, were there in abundance, but nothing which could
                        possibly be of any value to anybody. On all the letters, except one, was marked, in
                        Ewing&apos;s handwriting, &quot;To be burned without reading, in case of my
                        death.&quot; The one exception attracted Billy&apos;s attention, and opening it, he was
                        surprised to find Robert Pagebrook&apos;s name appended to it. It was, in fact, the letter
                        which Cousin Sarah Ann had opened during her son&apos;s last illness. After reading it Mr.
                        Billy sat down to think. Presently, looking at his watch, he went to the door and called a
                        servant.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Go and ask your Miss Sudie to put two or three shirts, and some socks and
                        handkerchiefs into my satchel for me, and then you go and tell Polidore to saddle Gray-beard and
                        the bay, and get ready to go with me to the Court House directly. Do you hear?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The servant made no answer to the question with which Mr. Billy closed his speech.
                        Indeed that gentleman expected none. Virginians always ask &quot;do you hear?&quot; when
                        they give instructions to servants, and they never get or expect an answer. Without the
                        question, however, they would never secure attention to the instruction. To say, &quot;do so
                        and so,&quot; without adding, &quot;do you hear?&quot; would be the idlest possible
                        waste of words on the part of any one giving an order to the average Virginian house servant.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Mr. Billy was in the habit of making sudden journeys on business, without giving the
                        slightest warning to the family except that contained in a request that his satchel or
                        saddle-bags be packed, so that Miss Sudie was not in <pb id="VAA2333-189" n="200" TEIform="pb"/>
                        the least surprised when his present message came to her. She was surprised, however, when,
                        instead of riding away without a word of farewell, as he usually did, he came into the house,
                        and, kissing her tenderly, said:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Keep your spirits up, Sudie, and don&apos;t let things worry you too
                        much. I&apos;m going to Richmond on the two o&apos;clock train, and don&apos;t know
                        how long I&apos;ll be gone. Good-by, little girl,&quot; and he kissed her again. All
                        this was quite out of character, Miss Sudie felt. Billy was affectionate enough, at all times,
                        but he detested leave-takings, and always avoided them when he could. To seek one was quite
                        unlike him, and Miss Sudie was puzzled to know what prompted him to do it on this particular
                        occasion. He rode away, however, without offering any explanation whatever.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Mr. Billy went to Richmond, as he had said he intended doing, but he did not remain
                        there an hour. He went to the cashier of a bank, a gentleman with whom he was well acquainted,
                        got from him a letter of introduction to a prominent man in Philadelphia, and left for that city
                        on the first train.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Arriving in Philadelphia about nine o&apos;clock the next day, Mr. Billy ate a
                        hasty breakfast and proceeded to the little collegiate institute in which Robert had once been a
                        professor, as the reader will remember. Introducing himself to President Currier he asked for a
                        private interview, and was invited for the purpose into Dr. Currier&apos;s inner office.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I believe, doctor,&quot; he said, after telling that gentleman who he
                        was, &quot;that there was something due Professor <pb id="VAA2333-190" n="201" TEIform="pb"
                        /> Pagebrook on his salary at the time his connection with this college terminated, was there
                        not?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Yes, sir; there was about three hundred dollars due him, if I remember
                        correctly, but it has been paid, I think.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Have you any way of ascertaining precisely how and when?&quot; asked
                        Billy.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Yes; my own letter-book should show. Let me see,&quot; turning over the
                        leaves, &quot;Ah, here it is. A draft for the amount was sent to him by letter on the eighth
                        of November, addressed to Court House, Virginia.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Billy. &quot;The draft, I suppose, was
                        regular New York Exchange?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Of course.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Would you mind telling me from what bank you bought it, and to whose order,
                        in the first place, it was made payable? Pardon my asking such questions, but I need this
                        information for use in the cause of justice.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;O you need offer no apology, I assure you, sir,&quot; returned the
                        president. &quot;I have nothing to conceal in the matter. The draft was drawn by the
                        Susquehanna Bank, and to my order, I think. Yes, I remember indorsing it.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; said Billy. &quot;You are very courteous, and
                        I am indebted to you for information which I should have found it difficult to get from any
                        other source. Good morning, sir.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Leaving the college, which was situated in one of the suburbs, Mr. Billy took a
                        carriage and drove into the city. There he delivered his letter of introduction, and <pb
                            id="VAA2333-191" n="202" TEIform="pb"/> secured from the gentleman to whom it was addressed
                        a personal introduction to the cashier of the Susquehanna Bank. To this latter person he said:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I am looking up evidence in a case, and, if I am not greatly mistaken, you
                        can help me in an effort to set a wrong right. On the eighth of last month you sold a draft on
                        New York for three hundred dollars, payable to the order of David Currier. Now, in the ordinary
                        course of business I suppose that draft has been returned to you after payment.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Yes, if it was paid before the first of the month. We settle with our New
                        York correspondents once a month. I&apos;ll look at the last batch of returned checks and
                        see.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Thank you. I should be glad to see the indorsements on the paper, if
                        possible.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The cashier went to the vault, and returning with a large bundle of canceled checks
                        soon found the one wanted. Billy turned it over and examined the indorsements on the back. Then,
                        turning to the banker, he asked:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Would it be possible for me to get temporary possession of this draft by
                        depositing the amount of its face with you until its return?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;You merely wish it for use in evidence?&quot; asked the banker.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;That&apos;s all,&quot; said Billy.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;You can take it, then, without a deposit, Mr. Barksdale. It is of no value
                        now, but we usually keep our canceled exchange, so I shall be obliged if you will return this

                    <p TEIform="p">This was precisely what Robert had come to Philadelphia to secure, and after finding
                        what the indorsements on the draft were, he would willingly have paid its face outright, if that
                        had been necessary, to get possession of it.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Who knows what the value of a bit of writing may be, even after its purpose has to
                        all appearance been fully answered? I know a great commercial house in which it is an inexorable
                        law that no bit of paper once written on in the way of business shall ever be destroyed, however
                        valueless it may seem to be; and on more than one occasion the wisdom of the rule has been
                        strikingly made manifest. So it was with this paid, canceled, and returned draft. Worthless in
                        all eyes but his, to Billy it was far more precious than if it had been crisp and new, and
                        payable to his own order.</p>

                        <hi rend="i">The younger Mr. Barksdale Asks to be put upon His Oath.</hi>
                    </head>
                    <p TEIform="p">IT was nearly noon when the train which brought Billy Barksdale back from
                        Philadelphia stopped at the Court House, and that young gentleman went from the station
                        immediately to the court room, where the Circuit Court, as he knew, was in session.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Has the grand jury been impaneled yet?&quot; he asked the
                        commonwealth&apos;s attorney.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Yes; it has just gone out, but as usual there is nothing for it to do, so
                        it will report &apos;no bills&apos; in an hour or so, I reckon.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Have me sworn and sent before it then,&quot; said Billy. &quot;I
                        think I can put it in the way of finding something to do.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The official was astonished, but he lost no time in complying with the rather
                        singular request. Billy went before the grand jury, and remained there for a considerable time.
                        This was a very unusual occurrence in every way, and it quickly produced a buzz of excitement in
                        and about the building. There was rarely ever anything for grand juries to do in this quiet
                        county, and when there <pb id="VAA2333-194" n="205" TEIform="pb"/> was anything it usually
                        hinged upon some publicly known and talked of matter. Everybody knew in advance what it was
                        about, and the probable result was easy to predict. Now, however, all was mystery. A prominent
                        young lawyer had been sworn and sent before the grand jury at his own request, and the length of
                        time during which he was detained there effectually dispelled the belief which at first
                        obtained, that he merely wanted to secure the presentment of some negligent road overseer. Even
                        the commonwealth&apos;s attorney could not manage to look wise enough, as he sat there
                        stroking his beard, to deceive anybody into the belief that he knew what was going on. The
                        minutes were very long ones. The excitement soon extended beyond the court house, and everybody
                        in the village was on tiptoe with suppressed curiosity. The court room was full to overflowing
                        when Billy came quietly out of the grand jury&apos;s apartment and took his seat in the bar
                        as if nothing out of the ordinary course of affairs had happened.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">It did not tend to allay the excitement, certainly, when the deputy sheriff on duty
                        at the door of the jury room beckoned to the commonwealth&apos;s attorney and that gentleman
                        went up-stairs three steps at a time, disappearing within the chamber devoted to the secret
                        inquest and remaining there. When half an hour later Major Edwin Pagebrook was called, sworn and
                        sent up as a witness, wild rumors of a secret crime among the better classes began to circulate
                        freely in the crowd, starting from nowhere and gradually taking definite shape as they spread
                        from one to another of the eager villagers.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-195" n="206" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">The excitement was now absolutely painful in its intensity, and even the judge
                        himself began walking restlessly back and forth in the space set apart for the bench.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">When Major Pagebrook came out of the room with a downcast face he went immediately
                        home, and Rosenwater, a merchant in the village, was called. When he came out, distinct efforts
                        were made to worm the secret from him. He was mindful of his oath, however, and refused to say
                        anything.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Finally the members of the grand jury marched slowly down stairs, and took their
                        stand in front of the clerk&apos;s desk.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Poll the grand jury,&quot; said the judge. When that ceremony was over,
                        the question which everybody in the building had been mentally asking for hours was formulated
                        by the court.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Gentlemen of the grand jury, have you any presentments to make?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;We have, your honor,&quot; answered the foreman.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Read the report of the grand jury, Mr. Clerk.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The official rose and after adjusting his spectacles very deliberately, read aloud:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;We, the grand jury, on our oaths present Dr. Charles Harrison and James
                        Madison Raves, for forgery and for a conspiracy to defraud Edwin Pagebrook, on or about the
                        tenth day of November in this present year within the jurisdiction of this honorable
                        court.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The crowd was fairly stunned. Nobody knew or could guess what it meant. The
                        commonwealth&apos;s attorney was the first to speak.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-196" n="207" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;As the legal representative of the commonwealth, I move the court to issue
                        a warrant for the arrest of Charles Harrison and James Madison Raves, and I ask that the grand
                        jury be instructed to return to their room and to put their indictments in proper
                        form.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The two men thus accused of crime being present in court were taken in charge by the
                        sheriff.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;It the commonwealth&apos;s attorney has no further motions to make in
                        this case,&quot; said the judge, &quot;the court will take a recess, in order to give
                        time for the preparation of indictments in due form.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;May it please the court,&quot; said the official addressed, &quot;I
                        have only to ask that your honor will instruct the sheriff to separate the two prisoners during
                        the recess. I do not know that this is necessary, but it may tend to further the interests of
                        justice.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;The court sees no reason to refuse the request,&quot; said the judge.
                        &quot;Mr. Sheriff, you will see that your, two prisoners are not allowed to confer together
                        in any way until after the reassembling of the court, at four o&apos;clock.&quot;</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">PRECISELY what Dr. Harrison&apos;s emotions were when he found himself in the
                        sheriff&apos;s hands, nobody is likely ever to know, as that gentleman was always, of
                        taciturn mood in matters closely concerning himself, and on the present occasion was literally
                        dump.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">With Foggy the case was different. He was always a prudent man. He was not given to
                        the taking of unnecessary risks, for the sake of abstract principles. He made no pretensions to
                        the possession of heroic fortitude under affliction, and he had no special reputation for
                        high-toned honor to lose. The clutch of the law was to him an uncomfortable one, and he was
                        prepared to escape it by any route which might happen to be open to him. This disposition upon
                        his part was all important factor in the problem which Billy had set out to solve. He knew Foggy
                        was a moral coward, and upon his cowardice he depended, in part, for the success of his
                        undertaking.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">As soon as court adjourned the commonwealth&apos;s attorney requested the members
                        of the grand jury to make <pb id="VAA2333-198" n="209" TEIform="pb"/> themselves as comfortable
                        as might be while he should be engaged in the preparation of formal indictments against the two
                        prisoners. Going then to his office he closeted himself with Billy Barksdale, who had preceded
                        him thither by his request.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;You&apos;ll help me with this prosecution, won&apos;t you
                        Billy?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;With as good a will as I ever carried to a fish fry,&quot; said Billy.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, then,&quot; said the attorney, &quot;tell me just how the
                        thing stands. I confess I&apos;m all in a jumble about it. Begin at the beginning and tell
                        the whole story. Then we&apos;ll know where we stand and how to proceed.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Accordingly Billy recounted the history of the protested draft; the promise to pay;
                        its nonfulfillment and the trouble which ensued. He then continued: &quot;My suspicions as
                        to the real facts of the case were aroused by accident. Maj. Pagebrook consulted me a few days
                        ago about a note signed by Ewing Pagebrook, drawn in favor of Charley Harrison, which, Harrison
                        said, had been given him when he advanced money to Ewing with which to pay a gambling debt to
                        Foggy. That note was evidently dated ahead, as it bore date of November 19th, one day after
                        Ewing attained his majority, when, in fact, the boy was taken ill on the morning of his
                        twenty-first birthday, and never left his bed afterwards. This confirmed me in the belief that
                        Foggy and Harrison were confederates in their gambling operations. They fleeced the boy, and
                        then had him borrow the money with which to pay from Harrison, and give a note for it, so as to
                            <pb id="VAA2333-199" n="210" TEIform="pb"/> make the consideration good; and they took pains
                        to have him date it ahead, so as to get rid of the minority trouble. This by itself would have
                        amounted to nothing, but in looking over Ewing&apos;s papers I found a letter there from Bob
                        Pagebrook, which I happened accidentally to know was received during Ewing&apos;s illness.
                        Here it is. I&apos;ll read it.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;&apos;M<hi rend="sc" TEIform="hi">Y</hi> D<hi rend="sc" TEIform="hi"
                            >EAR</hi> E<hi rend="sc" TEIform="hi">WING</hi>:I can not tell you how grieved I am at the
                        news your letter brings me. I can ill afford to lose the three hundred dollars which I intrusted
                        to you to hand to your father, and even if you do make it good when you come of age, as you so
                        solemnly promise me you will, I am, meanwhile, placed in a very awkward position with regard to
                        it. I promised your father to pay him that money by a certain day, and was greatly pleased, as
                        you know, when, upon arriving at the Court House on my way north, I found the remittance
                        awaiting me there, as it enabled me to make the payment in advance of the time agreed upon. When
                        I, in my haste to catch the train, gave you the check to give to your father, I dismissed the
                        subject from my mind, and set about the work of repairing my fortunes with a light heart, little
                        thinking that matters would turn out as they have.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;&apos;But while I am sorely annoyed by the fact that this may place me
                        in an awkward position, I am willing to trust my reputation in your hands. Remember that you are
                        now bound in honor, not merely to pay this money as soon as you shall attain your majority, but
                        also to protect me from undeserved disgrace by frankly stating the facts of the case to your
                        father in the event of his entertaining <pb id="VAA2333-200" n="211" TEIform="pb"/> doubts of my
                        integrity. This much you are in honor bound to do in any case, and you have also given me your
                        word that you will do it. If your father shall seem disposed to think me not unduly dilatory in
                        the matter of payment, you need tell him nothing. You may spare yourself that mortification,
                        send me the money, and I will remit it to him, merely saying that unavoidable circumstances
                        which I am not at liberty to explain have prevented the earlier payment which I intended to
                        make.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;&apos;But in agreeing to do this, Ewing, I am moved solely by my desire
                        to shield you from disgrace and consequent ruin. When I gave, you that money for your father it
                        was a sacred trust, and in converting it to other uses you not only wronged me, but you made
                        yourself guilty of something very like a crime. Pardon me if I speak plainly, for I am speaking
                        only for your good and I speak only to you. I want you to understand how terribly wrong and
                        altogether dishonorable your act was, so that you may never be guilty of another such. I am not
                        disposed to reproach you, but I do want to warn you. You are the son of a gentleman, and you
                        have no right to bring disgrace upon your father&apos;s name. You ought not to gamble, and
                        if you do gamble you have no right to surrender your honor in payment of your losses. I promise
                        you, as you ask me to do, that I will not tell what you have done; and you know I never break a
                        promise under any circumstances whatever. But in promising this I place my own reputation in
                        your keeping depending upon you, in the event of necessity, to frankly acknowledge your fault,
                        so that I may not <pb id="VAA2333-201" n="212" TEIform="pb"/> appear to have run away from a
                        debt which in fact I have paid.&apos;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;When I read that letter,&quot; continued Billy, &quot;I began to
                        see daylight. Bob had given his word of honor to Ewing not to expose him. Ewing had died before
                        he could make the money matter good, and Bob, like the great, big, honorable, dear old fellow
                        that he is, allowed himself to go to jail and bear the reputation of an absconding debtor,
                        rather than break his promise to the dead boy. He paid the money again, too. I suspected, of
                        course, that Foggy and Charley Harrison were mixed up in the matter some way, particularly as
                        the very last visit Ewing ever made to the Court House was made on the day that Bob went away. I
                        went to Philadelphia, and there found the canceled draft, drawn in favor of David Currier;
                        indorsed to Robert Pagebrook; and by him indorsed to Edwin Pagebrook. Then followed, as you
                        know, an indorsement to James M. Raves, signed &apos;E. Pagebrook.&quot; That, of
                        course, was written by Ewing, who at the suggestion of these two men made the draft over to
                        themor to one of themby signing his own name, which happened, when written with the initial
                        only, to be the same as his father&apos;s. Foggy then indorsed it to Harrison, and he, being
                        respectable, had no difficulty in getting Rosenwater to cash it for him. It never entered
                        Rosenwater&apos;s head, of course, to question any of the signatures back of
                        Harrison&apos;s. Now my theory is that this draft did not cover Ewing&apos;s losses by
                        two hundred and twenty-five dollars; and so the two thrifty gentlemen made the boy execute the
                        note that <pb id="VAA2333-202" n="213" TEIform="pb"/> Harrison holds for that amount, dating it
                        ahead, and making it for borrowed money.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;You&apos;re right, Barksdale, without a doubt,&quot; said the
                        commonwealth&apos;s attorney; &quot;but how are we going to make a jury see it?
                        There&apos;s plenty of evidence to found an indictment on, but I&apos;m afraid there
                        a&apos;n&apos;t enough to secure a conviction.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;That&apos;s true,&quot; said Billy. &quot;But we must do our
                        very best. If we can&apos;t convict both, we may one; and even if we fail altogether in the
                        prosecution, we will at least expose the rascals, and this county will be too hot for them
                        afterwards. Foggy is always shaky in the knees, and if we give him half a chance will turn
                        state&apos;s evidence. Why not sound him on the subject?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Foggy needed very little sounding indeed. At the first intimation that there might be
                        hope for him if he would tell what he knew he volunteered a confession, which bore out
                        Billy&apos;s theory to the letter. From his statement, too, it appeared that Harrison was
                        the author of the whole scheme. He had overborne Ewing&apos;s scruples, and by dint of
                        threats compelled him to commit a practical forgery by writing his own name in such a way as to
                        make it appear to be his father&apos;s. While Foggy was at it he made a clean breast,
                        telling all about his partnership with Harrison in the gambling operations, and admitting that
                        the note Harrison held was dated ahead and given solely for a gambling debt.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The commonwealth&apos;s attorney agreed to enter a <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi"
                            >nolle prosequi</hi> in Foggy&apos;s case, and to transfer him, at the trial, from the

                    <pb id="VAA2333-203" n="214" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">When Billy came out from this conference he found Major Pagebrook awaiting an
                        opportunity to speak to him. The major, it seems, after going home had returned to the Court
                        House.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Billy,&quot; he said, &quot;I know now about that letter from
                        Robert to Ewing. Sarah Ann has told me she read it when it came. What is to be done about
                        it?&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Nothing,&quot; said Billy, &quot;except that you will of course
                        return Robert the extra three hundred dollars he has paid you.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Of course I&apos;ll do that. But I meanthe fact is I don&apos;t
                        want that letter to appear on the trial. You will have to tell where you got it, and it will
                        come out, in spite of everything, that Sarah Ann knew of it.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, Cousin Edwin, what am I to do? This has been a wretched business from
                        first to last. Poor Bob has suffered severely for Ewing&apos;s fault, andI must speak
                        plainlythrough Cousthrough your wife&apos;s iniquity. Not only has he had to pay the money
                        twice, he has been sent to jail, and but for a lucky accident his reputation as an honorable man
                        would have been destroyed forever, and that merely to gratify your wife&apos;s petty and
                        unreasonable spite against him. It became my duty to unravel this mystery for the sake of
                        freeing Bob from an unjust and undeserved disgrace. In doing that I have accidentally stumbled
                        upon the discovery of a crime, and even if it were not illegal I am not the man to compound a
                        felony. For you I am heartily sorry, but your wife is only reaping what she has sown. I would do
                        anything honorable to spare your feelings, Cousin Edwin, but I can not help <pb id="VAA2333-204"
                            n="215" TEIform="pb"/> giving evidence in this case. I really do not see, however, precisely
                        how Bob&apos;s letter can be used as evidence. If it had been sufficient in itself to
                        establish the facts to which it referred I should have used it to set Bob right, and the thing
                        would have ended there. But Bob&apos;s statement was of course an interested one, and I
                        feared that after a time, if not immediately, gossip would seize upon that point and say the
                        whole thing was made up merely to clear Bob. I knew he would never show Ewing&apos;s letter
                        to which his was a reply, and so I set myself to work hunting up the draft. I don&apos;t see
                        how the letter can well come up on the trial, but if it should become necessary for me to tell
                        about it, I must tell all about it, of course.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Major Pagebrook walked away, his head bowed as if there were a heavy weight upon his
                        shoulders, and Billy pitied him heartily. This woman, who, in her ground-less malignity, had
                        wrought so much wrong and brought so much of sorrow upon the good old man, was his wife, and he
                        could not free himself from the fact or its consequences. He had never willingly done a wrong in
                        his life, and it seemed peculiarly hard that he should now have to suffer so sorely for the sins
                        of the woman whom he called wife.</p>

                    <p TEIform="p">UPON leaving Major Pagebrook Billy mounted his horse and galloped away toward
                        Shirley, not caring to remain till the court should reassemble at four, as there could hardly be
                        any business done beyond the formal presentation of the indictments by the grand jury and the
                        committal of the prisoners to await trial.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">When he entered the yard gate at Shirley he found his father, who had returned from
                        the court house some time before, awaiting him.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I have not told Sudie, my son,&quot; said the old gentleman.
                        &quot;I found it hard to keep my lips closed, but you have managed this affair grandly, my
                        boy, and you ought to have the pleasure of telling the story in your own way. Go into the
                        office, and I&apos;ll send Sudie to you.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Miss Sudie was naturally enough alarmed when her uncle, repressing everything like an
                        expression of joy, and in doing that managing to look as solemn as a death warrant, told her
                        that Billy wanted to see her in the office immediately. But Billy&apos;s look, as she
                        entered, reassured her. He met her just inside the door, and taking her face between his hands,
                        said:</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-206" n="218" TEIform="pb"/>

                    <pb id="VAA2333-207" n="219" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I&apos;m as proud and as glad as a boy with red morocco tops to his
                        boots, little girl.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;What about, Cousin Billy?&quot; asked Miss Sudie in a tremor of
                        uncertainty.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Because I&apos;ve been doing the duty you set me. I&apos;ve been
                        &apos;turning something up.&apos; I&apos;ve torn the mask off of that dear old
                        rascal Bob Pagebrook, and shown him up in his true colors. It&apos;s just shameful the way
                        he&apos;s been deceiving us, making us think him an absconding debtor and all that when he
                        a&apos;n&apos;t anything of the sort. He&apos;s as true asas you are. There;
                        that&apos;s a figure of speech he&apos;d approve if he could hear it, and he shall too.
                        I&apos;m going to write him a letter to-night, telling him just what I think of
                        him.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">There was a little flutter in Miss Sudie&apos;s manner as she sat down, unable to
                        stand any longer.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Tell me about it, please,&quot; was all she could say.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;Well, in a word, Bob&apos;s all right, with a big balance over.
                        He&apos;s as straight as a well rope when the bucket&apos;s full. Let me make you
                        understand that in advance, and then I&apos;ll tell my story.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">And with this Billy proceeded in his own way to tell the young woman all about the
                        visit to Philadelphia and its results. When he had finished Miss Sudie simply sat and looked at
                        him, smiling through her tears the thank-fulness she could not put into words. When after awhile
                        she found her voice she said some things which were very pleasant indeed to Mr. Billy in the
                        hearing.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The next day&apos;s mail carried three letters to Mr. Robert Pagebrook. What Miss
                        Sudie said in hers I do not know, <pb id="VAA2333-208" n="220" TEIform="pb"/> and if I did I
                        should not tell. Col. Barksdale wrote in a stately way, as he always did when he meant to be
                        particularly affectionate, the gist of his letter lying in the sentence with which he opened it,
                        which was:</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">&quot;I did not know, until now, how much of your father there is in
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Mr. Billy&apos;s letter would make the fortune of any comic paper if it could be
                        published. Robert insists that there were just three hundred and sixty-five hitherto unheard of
                        metaphors in the body of it, and twenty-one more in the postscript. He says he counted them
                        carefully.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Naturally enough, after all that had happened, everybody at Shirley wanted Robert to
                        come back again as soon as possible, and one and all entreated him to spend the Christmas there.
                        This he promised to do, but at the last moment he was forced to abandon his purpose in
                        consequence of the utter failure of Mr. Dudley&apos;s health, an occurrence which left
                        Robert with the entire burden of the paper upon him, and made it impossible for him to leave New
                        York during the holidays. Even with Robert there the publishers were anxious about the
                        management of the paper at so critical a time; but Robert&apos;s single-handed success fully
                        justified the confidence Mr. Dudley had felt and expressed in his ability to conduct the paper,
                        and when, a month later, Dudley resigned entirely, to go abroad in search of health, our friend
                        Robert Pagebrook was promoted to his place and pay, having won his way in a few months to a
                        position in his new profession which he had not hoped to gain without years of patient toil.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2333-209" n="221" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <p TEIform="p">The rest of my story hardly needs telling. The winter was passed in hard work on
                        Robert&apos;s part, but the work was of a sort which it delighted him to do. He knew the
                        worth of printed words, and rejoiced in the possession of that power which the printing-press
                        only can give to a man, multiplying him, as it were, and enabling him to give utterance to his
                        thought in the presence of an audience too vast and too widely scattered ever to be reached by
                        any one human voice. It was a favorite theory of his, too, that printed words carry with them
                        some of the force expended upon them by the press itselfthat a sentence which would fall
                        meaningless from its author&apos;s lips may mold a score of human lives if it be put in
                        type. He was and is an enthusiast in his work, and never apostle went forth to preach a new
                        gospel with more of earnestness or with a stronger sense of responsibility than Robert Pagebrook
                        brings with him daily to his desk.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">The winter softened into spring, and when the spring was richest in its promise there
                        was a quiet wedding at Shirley.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">My story is fully told, but my friend who writes novels insists that I must not lay
                        down the pen until I shall have gathered up what he calls the loose threads, and knitted them
                        into a seemly and unraveled end.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Major Pagebrook, dreading the possible exposure of his wife&apos;s misconduct,
                        placed money in the hands of a <pb id="VAA2333-210" n="222" TEIform="pb"/> friend, and that
                        friend became surety for Dr. Harrison&apos;s appearance when called for trial. Of course Dr.
                        Harrison betook himself to other parts, going, indeed, to the West Indies, where he died of
                        yellow fever a year or two later. Foggy disappeared also, but whither he went I really do not
                        know.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Billy Barksdale is still a bachelor, and still likes to listen while Aunt Catherine
                        explains relationships with her keys.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Col. Barksdale has retired from practice, and lives quietly at Shirley.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Cousin Sarah Ann is still Cousin Sarah Ann, but she lives in Richmond now, having
                        discovered years ago that the air of the country did not agree with her.</p>
                    <p TEIform="p">Robert and Sudie have a pretty little place in the country, within half an
                        hour&apos;s ride of New York, and I sometimes run out to spend a quiet Sunday with Cousin
                        Sudie. Robert I can see in his office any day. Their oldest boy, William Barksdale Pagebrook,
                        entered college last September.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">THE Rose is the only flower that can be said to have a history. It is popular now, and
                    was so centuries ago. In his work upon the Rose, Mr. Parsons has gathered up the curious legends
                    concerning the flower, and gives us an Idea of the esteem in which it was held in former times. A
                    simple garden classification has been adopted, and the leading varieties under each class enumerated
                    and briefly described. The chapters on multiplication, cultivation, and training, are very full, and
                    the work is <unclear TEIform="unclear">altogetner</unclear> the most complete of any before the

                    but have stricken out much of the poetry which, to the cultivator, may have seemed irrelevant, if
                    not worthless. For the interest of the classical scholar, we have retained much of the early history
                    of the Rose, and its connection with the manners and customs of the two great nations of a former
                    age.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;The amateur will, we think, find the labor of selection much diminished by the
                    increased simplicity of the mode we have adopted, while the commercial gardener will in nowise be
                    injured by the change.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;In directions for culture, we give the results of our own experience, and have
                    not hesitated to avail ourselves of any satisfactory results in the experience of others, which
                    might enhance the utility of the work.&quot;</p>

                <p TEIform="p">A home! A home in the country! and a home made beautiful by taste! Here are three ideas
                    which invest with a triple charm the subject of this exquisite volume. We know of nothing which
                    indicates a more healthy progress among our countrymen than the growing taste for such homes. The
                    American people are quick to follow a fashion, and it is getting to be the fashion to have a place
                    in the country, and to beautify it; and this is at once fed and guided by such books as this, which
                    lay down the just principles of landscape gardening; and teach all how to use the means at their
                    disposal. This book is prepared with careful judgment. It includes many plans, and furnishes minute
                    instruction for the laying out of grounds and the planting of trees. We have found very great
                    pleasure in a first inspection, and doubt not that when another summer returns, we shall find the
                    book as practically useful, as it is beautiful to the eye and exciting to the imagination.<hi

                <p TEIform="p">We have from Orange Judd &amp; Co. a magnificent manual, entitled <hi rend="i"
                        TEIform="hi">Beautifying Country Homes; a Hand-Book of Landscape Gardening.</hi> It is a brief
                    treatise on landscape gardening and architecture, explaining the principles of beauty which apply to
                    it, and making just those practical suggestions of which every builder and owner of a little land,
                    who desires to make the most of it in the way of convenience and taste, stands in need, in regard to
                    lawns, drainage, roads, drives, walks, grading, fences, hedges, treestheir selection and their
                    groupingflowers, water, ornamentation, rock-work, tools, and general improvements. The chapter on
                    &quot;improving new places economically&quot; would be worth much more than the cost of the
                    book ten times over to many persons. The whole is illustrated, not only by little sketches, but by a
                    series of full-page lithographs of places which have a been actually treated in accordance with the
                    principles laid down, with lists of trees and shrubs, and other useful suggestions. We have never
                    met with any thingand we have given a good deal of attention to the subject, and bought a great many
                    books upon itwhich seemed to us so helpful and, in general, so trustworthy as this treatise, which
                    we heartily commend. We omitted to say that it has been done by Mr. J. Weidenmann, Superintendent of
                    the City Park, and of Cedar Hill Cemetery, Hartford, Conn.<hi rend="i" TEIform="hi"
