            EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION
            The articles that make up this thematic issue of the Indiana Magazine of History were delivered first
                    at a conference on the Northwest ordinances held at Indiana University, September 4-6, 1987. Over a
                    period of two days approximately three hundred par–ticipants, interested laymen,
                    students, and scholars, heard a series of papers analyzing the ordinances. The papers provoked much
                    discussion from the audience, confirming the organizers' conviction that serious meetings
                    of this sort can attract a varied gathering of people, many of whom are not involved professionally
                    in the scholarly world. The Indiana University History Department and the Alum–ni
                    Association sponsored the 
                        Bloomington
                     conference jointly.
            The conference formed part of a wider celebration of the ordi–nances that involved
                    activities in the five states of the Old North– west and 
                        Minnesota
                    . Besides the conference in 
                        Bloomington
                     and similar proceedings held in the other states, one of the highlights of the
                    celebration was an exhibit of materials designed to illumi–nate the Constitution and the
                    ordinances and scheduled to appear at six major libraries and historical societies in the Midwest.
                    The initiative in organizing this celebration came from Frank B. Jones, former director of the
                    Indiana University Alumni Association. Funds for these activities were generously contributed by the
                    Na–tional Endowment for the Humanities, the Commission on the Bi–centennial of
                    the 
                        United States
                     Constitution, Indiana University, the Lilly Endowment, the George and Frances Ball
                    Foundation, and the John W. Anderson Foundation.
            In this bicentennial year attention to the ordinances seemed particularly appropriate for the
                    Midwest. In a symbolic way the ordinances have long been seen, certainly in the states between the 
                        Ohio
                     and 
                        Mississippi
                    , as documents of constitutional import, simi–lar if not equal to the
                    Constitution itself. Popular wisdom, of course, has been inclined to celebration rather than
                    critical examination and for good reason. If the ordinances proved to be ambiguous
                    doc–uments as the republic advanced across the continent, they estab–lished
                    general principles that have served well the American inclination to reach beyond itself. State
                    equality, partible inheri–tance, a wide distribution of land, public support for
                    education, and a preference for freedom over slavery were only some of the ideals that found
                    expression in the ordinances. Often at odds with the realities of American life and slow to
                    realization, they have in time become enduring testimony to the genius of the founding
                    genera–tion. Scholarly attention has been inclined to stress the distance that so often
                    persisted between principle and reality, though the point could not have been made if the principle
                    had not itself been part of the reality. Oddly the ordinances have been neglected  in the last generation. The articles printed in this issue, each by a
                    major scholar in the field, constitute an important effort to revital–ize a critical area
                    of American history.
            On the cover of the issue appears one of the Vaughan portraits of George 
                        Washington
                     painted by Gilbert Stuart. The painting, now owned by Indiana University, was the gift
                    of Eli Lilly and served as the centerpiece of the traveling exhibition. 
                        Washington
                     took no direct part in the making of the ordinances, but the article by W. W. Abbot in
                    this issue will amply demonstrate his centrality in the opening of the West. As a frontispiece we
                    have reproduced a watercolor by Lefevre J. Cranstone, a mid–nineteenth century
                    art–ist, that offers a vivid glimpse of the water route followed by so many of the early
                    settlers.

                    's involvement with the American West was lifelong, beginning when he was
                    sixteen years old and ending only with his death. From start to finish 
                        Washington
                    's interest in his country's advancing frontier was both personal and
                    political. Private interest and public advantage were for him seldom at odds as he extended or
                    developed his holdings in the West and at the same time promoted public measures that made for the
                    greater security and accessibility–and value–of such lands. A full review of 
                        Washington
                    's enduring, complex, and deep involvement with the West and its land might
                    indicate something heretofore missed about how George 
                        Washington
                     and his times joined forces to make a great man or, to paraphrase Thomas Jefferson on 
                        Washington
                    , how nature and fortune combined to make a man great.1
            
            On the day after he crossed the Blue Ridge Mountains for the first time—it was a fine
                    Saturday in March, 1748—the sixteen-year–old 
                        Washington
                     reported that the men in the surveying party rode their horses along the Shenandoah
                    River "through most beautiful Groves of Sugar Trees & spent the best part of the
                    Day in admiring the Trees & richness of the Land."2 Before he
                    was twenty 
                        Washington
                     had surveyed for himself, or had bought, a number of tracts of fertile land on the 
                        Virginia
                     frontier totaling at least two thousand acres.3 At his death nearly
                    one–half century later, he owned more than forty–five thousand acres of
                    carefully chosen western lands in

            From his initial trip to the Shenandoah until his marriage early in 1759 shortly before his
                    twenty–seventh birthday, 
                        Washington
                     more often than not was on the frontier, first as a very young surveyor and then for
                    five years as a scarcely less precocious colonel of a regiment of soldiers. It was as a military man
                    that 
                        Washington
                     became familiar with the trans–Allegheny West and began to dream of what the
                    future held for its fertile land and navigable streams.
            In 1753 the governor of 
                        Virginia
                    , Robert Dinwiddie, sent young 
                        Washington
                     over the mountains to the 
                        Ohio
                     country to deliver a warning to the commandant of the French forces there. The next
                    year, when 
                        Washington
                     became colonel of the 
                        Virginia
                     troops, he was again out on the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     frontier, on land he was in a few years to own, when he was attacked and forced to
                    surrender to a party of French soldiers and Indians, setting in motion, as it happened, a great war
                    for empire between Britain and 
                        France
                    . He was back in the west in 1755 with General Edward Braddock on the day that
                    Braddock's army was ambushed and routed as it approached Fort Duquesne, the fort that the
                    French had recently built at the forks of the 
                        Ohio
                    . Three years later he was once again marching through the 
                        Ohio
                     country in the successful campaign against Fort Duquesne mounted by General John Forbes
                    during the summer and fall of 1758. 
                        Washington
                     was in command of one of the three brigades of Forbes's army when the army
                    finally reached the abandoned and burned out fort in November. After returning to 
                        Williamsburg
                     in December of 1758, he did not go back to the 
                        Ohio
                     country until his journey there in 1770, then not again until his shorter visit of
                    1784; but 
                        Washington
                    's view of the West, and of its importance, which he held even through his
                    presidency and to his death, had by 1758 been firmly fixed.
            In the early stages of the Forbes campaign 
                        Washington
                     engaged in a bitter controversy that revealed how completely his experiences of the
                    previous four years had convinced him of the crucial importance of the transmontane west to the
                    future of his country, at that time 
                        Virginia
                    , soon to be the 
                        United States
                    . Upon learning in July that for his army's march to the 
                        Ohio
                     Forbes proposed to cut a new road from Raystown (now 
                        Bedford
                    ) in 
                        Pennsylvania
                     rather than to use the old Braddock road from Winchester in 
                  Virginia, Washington
                persuaded himself that the British general had been duped by
                    men in 
                        Pennsylvania
                    . The Pennsylvanians would,

                                Washington
                            's landholdings in his

                            's Western Lands (Strasburg, Va., 1930). A great deal
                            more may be gained from the texts and annotation in the Diaries and the
                            various chronological series of the new edition of 
                                Washington

                     foresaw, use the new road after the war to monopolize trade with a burgeoning West
                    rather than allowing commerce to flow, in the way 
                        Washington
                     believed it otherwise would and should, along Braddock's road into 
                        Virginia
                    . For six weeks the young provincial officer fought, right up to the brink of
                    insubordination, first to sway the British general and then to thwart him as Forbes moved to begin
                    construction of a new road. Finally, on September 1, 1758, bemoaning "the luckless Fate of
                    poor 
                        Virginia
                     to fall a Victim to the views of her Crafty Neighbours," 
                        Washington
                     hinted to John Robinson, speaker of the 
                        Virginia
                     House of Burgesses, that he (
                        Washington
                    ) should be sent to 
                        London
                     to reveal to George III the wrongheadedness, if not the duplicity, of the man who was
                    the king's general and 
                        Washington
                    's commanding officer.5
            
            Besides this strong sense that whatever the future held for the West would vitally affect the people
                    in the East, 
                        Washington
                     also gained from the war what was to be a very large personal stake in the region
                    beyond the mountains. In 1754 Governor Dinwiddie issued a proclamation declaring that two hundred
                    thousand acres in the West should be set aside for the men participating in 
                        Virginia
                    's military expedition of that year, the one ending with 
                        Washington
                    's surrender at Fort Necessity; and at the end of the war in 1763 a royal
                    proclamation held out the promise of land in America for the army officers who had fought there in
                    the war against 
                        France
                    . Before any grants could be made under either of the proclamations, the British
                    government in 1763 closed the land beyond the mountains to further settlement. Even with the
                    frontier closed, 
                        Washington
                     continued to look upon the West as holding out the best hope both of enrichment for
                    enterprising Virginians, himself included, and of an eventual return to prosperity for 
                        Virginia
                    's faltering economy.
            In 1767 
                        Washington
                     urged a friend and neighbor who had fallen on bad times to pull up stakes and move out
                    to lands soon to be available in western 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , "where an enterprizing Man with very little Money may lay the foundation of a

            Showing himself willing to put his money where he was advising others to put theirs, three months
                    later, on September 17, 1767, he wrote to his old comrade–in–arms William
                    Crawford on the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     frontier, asking him "to look me out a Tract of about 1500, 2000, or more
                    acres somewhere in your Neighbourhood" and find "some method to secure it
                    immediately from the attempts of any other" to lay claim to it. Crawford found a suitable
                    tract and surveyed it for his friend, and the next year 
                        Washington
                     secured title to it, his first land west of the Alleghenies, on the Youghiogheny River
                    thirty five miles southeast of Fort Pitt7 Many more acres to the south and west
                    were soon to be his.
            In the same letter that he wrote to Crawford about land in 
                  Pennsylvania, Washington
                proposed
                    that the two of them join forces "in attempting to secure some of the most valuable Lands
                    in the Kings part" to the West. 
                        Washington
                     pointed out that anyone "who neglects the present oppertunity of hunting out
                    good Lands & in some measure Marking & distinguishing them for their own (in order
                    to keep others from settling them)" would be left out in the cold, for the Proclamation of
                    1763 forbidding settlement was certain to "fall" within "a few
                    years." Crawford was to "be at the trouble of seeking out the Lands"
                    while 
                        Washington
                     took upon himself the task of securing them as soon as there was a possibility of doing
                    so. He would also "be at all the Cost & charges of Surveying Patenting " 
                        Washington
                     warned Crawford to "keep this whole matter a profound Secret" by
                    "a silent management… snugly carried on by you under the pretence of hunting
                    other Game." As soon as there was the "bear possibility" of the 
                        Ohio
                     country's being opened up, 
                        Washington
                     would "have the lands immediately Surveyed to keep others off."
            In the end it was 
                        Washington
                     himself, though accompanied by Crawford, who went down the 
                        Ohio
                     in search of good land. The tracts that he selected were to be surveyed not for himself
                    and Crawford alone, however. On December 15, 1769, 
                        Washington
                     petitioned the 
                        Virginia
                     governor and council for two hundred thousand acres of land for the former

                    Proclamation of 1754.8 The council agreed that 
                        Washington
                     and his associates could, in no more than twenty surveys, claim two hundred thousand
                    acres of vacant land to the south and east of the Ohio River in an area
                    recently made available for settlement as a consequence of two Indian

                     and Great Kanawha rivers identifying approximately two hundred thousand acres that
                    Crawford was later to survey in twenty–five surveys. From 1771 through 1773 
                        Washington
                     oversaw Crawford's activities and the collecting of money to defray the cost
                    of Crawford's surveys, and he personally managed the distribution of the surveyed land to
                    the old officers and soldiers or to their heirs. His own share of the two hundred thousand acres and
                    the shares he acquired from others added up to more than twenty–three thousand acres
                    stretching for forty unbroken miles along the Great Kanawha River and nearly ten thousand acres on
                    the banks of the

            Aside from strictly personal affairs and perhaps his involvement in 
                        Virginia
                    's resistance to British policy between 1773 and 1775, 
                        Washington
                     devoted more time and attention to managing the acquisition and distribution of western
                    land for himself and his old comrades than to anything else between the French and Indian War and
                    the Revolution. While with one hand in the early 1770s he was getting western land into private
                    hands and amassing great holdings for himself, with the other he was doing what he could to promote
                    the future development of these western lands by involving himself in a public project that was to
                    become of consuming interest to him after the Revolution. In 1770 
                        Washington
                     wrote about the great advantage to Virginians and Marylanders of "making
                    Potomack the Channel of commerce between Great Britain and that immense territory, which is
                    unfolding to our view."10 To hasten the day when the Potomac would
                    become "the Channel of conveyance of the extensive & valuable Trade of a rising
                        Empire,"11
                    
                        Washington
                     in 1772 helped push through the 
                        Virginia
                     General Assembly a bill to raise money "for opening and extending the
                    Navigation of the River Potowmack from Fort Cumberland to Tide
                        Water."12 Opposition from 
                        Baltimore
                     merchants and the war halted the project for the time being, and Indian unrest defeated

                     secure his claim to the land and hasten the day when it would
                    become profitable.
            During the war years 
                        Washington
                     was, of course, not able to devote much attention to his western lands, but immediately
                    after the war his western claims became a main concern. In the first six months of 1784 after his
                    return to 
                        Mount Vernon
                    , he took steps to have legal title to the various parcels of his western lands
                    confirmed by the state of 
                        Virginia
                    , and he began to search for ways to make his holdings productive and profitable. He
                    wrote and talked to people about what could be done with these lands; he ran notices in newspapers
                    and distributed handbills, in 
                        Maryland
                     and in 
                        Pennsylvania
                     as well as in 
                        Virginia
                    , inviting settlers to take up and improve small parcels under long–term
                    leases; and he tried to identify and make contact with people abroad who might be induced to come to
                    America and become his tenants.13 A trip he made in September, 1784, to inspect
                    his western holdings was cut short by reports of Indian violence, and he was not able to go down the 
                        Ohio
                     to the Great Kanawha as he had done in 1770. On his return from the frontier, however,
                    he single–mindedly and almost single–handedly mounted a campaign to have a
                    company formed for developing a water passage up the Potomac, over to the 
                        Ohio
                    , and from there to Lake Erie beyond. Here in 1784, as in 1773, personal profit and
                    local advantage were very much at work; but changes wrought by independence, both in the
                    relationship of the union of states to the West and in 
                        Washington
                    's own perceptions, also were at work, fundamentally altering 
                        Washington
                    's view of the potential dangers and advantages posed by the West for the
                    thirteen confederated states. His activities in the fall and early winter of 1784–1785
                    merit examination in some detail.
            A year earlier, in 1783, after touring upstate 
                        New York
                     with Governor George Clinton shortly before he left the army, 
                        Washington
                     wrote the French philosophe François Jean Chastellux on October 12, 1783,
                    about his trip: "Prompted by these actual observations," he concluded in his
                    letter, "I could not help taking a more contemplative & extensive view of the vast
                    inland navigation of these 
                        United States
                    … & could not but be struck with the immense diffusion &
                    importance of it … . I shall not rest contented 'till I have explored the
                    Western Country, & traversed those Lines… which have given bounds to a new
                    Empire." A few months later, back at 
                  Mount
                        Vernon, Washington
                received a
                    letter from Thomas Jefferson dated March 15 urging him to give up "the sweets of retirement
                    & repose" for a time in order to assume "the superintendance"
                        
                  
                     13 Much of his correspondence at this time deals with one or another
                            of these matters, but see particularly his letters to Samuel Lewis, February 1, to Thomas
                            Lewis, February 1, to John Harvie, February 10, to Gilbert Simpson, February 13, to John
                            Witherspoon, March 10, and his Advertisement, March 10, all in 1784.
               
                     of a project to open up the navigation of the upper James and
                    Potomac rivers and to connect them with streams flowing into the 
                        Ohio
                    . After expressing his strong support for the project and his equally strong doubts that
                    sufficient public funds could be got for it, 
                        Washington
                     on March 29 conceded that "the immense advantages which this Country would
                    derive from the measure would be no small stimulus [for me] to the undertaking; if that undertaking
                    could be made to comport with those ideas, & that line of conduct with which I meant to
                    glide gently down the stream of life."
            Jefferson knew that more than the "sweets of retirement" were at stake for 
                        Washington
                    , and neither he nor anyone else would have had trouble understanding what 
                        Washington
                     meant by "those ideas, & that line of Conduct" by which he
                    was bound. When the hero of the Revolution laid down his arms in December, 1783, and returned to his
                    farm, the world discovered a new Cincinnatus and began to bestow on 
                        Washington
                     the fame that was to place him among the great men of history.14
                    
                        Washington
                     well understood, and said as much often enough, that the fame being bestowed on him by
                    the world, and yet to be ratified by posterity, required that he act the part until the end, lest it
                    be diminished or ultimately lost. This is what 
                        Washington
                     was referring to when he spoke of the "line of Conduct" that he had
                    set for himself. His heightened, seemingly excessive concern for his reputation, especially apparent
                    in his correspondence in the 1780s, was not entirely, or perhaps even primarily, for its own sake.
                    His fame, though to be cherished for its own particular worth, had, as he and Jefferson and the rest
                    knew, its great symbolic value for a newly independent people. If the need arose, its weight could
                    be thrown into the balance to preserve the union of states and save the Revolution. The question in 
                        Washington
                    's mind in the spring of 1787, for instance, and in the minds of his advisers,
                    as the record shows,15 was whether his hard–won reputation must be
                    put on the line to give the constitutional convention its best chances of succeeding or whether it
                    should beheld in reserve as a rallying point in the crisis that would ensue if

                            on many occasions led you to commit to danger your fame itself, rather than hazard for a

                     the convention failed. It was not as easy a decision as one
                    might now suppose.
            Despite the strength of the forces that pushed and pulled him into retirement in 1784, 
                        Washington
                     did not, of course, wait until duty called in 1787 to put what he had learned and what
                    he had become to the public use. He was hardly settled under his fig tree and vine a t 
                        Mount Vernon
                     before he began to persuade himself that Jefferson was right, that he might properly
                    perform one last service for his country. To assure 
                        Washington
                     that his efforts to enlist the great man in this important public project did not arise
                    from selfish or unworthy motives, Jefferson had written that he himself was someone "not
                    owning, nor ever having a prospect of owning one inch of land on any water either the Patowmac or 
                        Ohio
                    ." In his reply 
                        Washington
                     wrote: "I am not so disinterested in this matter as you are; but I am made
                    very happy to find a man of discernment and liberality (who has no particular interest in the plan)
                    thinks as I do, who have Lands in the Country the value of which would be enhanced by the adoption
                    of such a scheme." Although 
                        Washington
                     recognized that both public and private interests were involved and was aware of the
                    connections as well as the distinctions between the two, his initial hesitation about taking the
                    lead in the Potomac River project probably had less to do with any fears that his motives would be
                    misunderstood than with how his early emergence from his much vaunted retirement would be perceived.
                    In any case, by the end of the summer of 1784 his mind seems to have been made up.
            When he set out in September to inspect his western lands, 
                        Washington
                     confided to his diary that "one object of my journey" was
                    "to obtain information of the nearest and best communication between the Eastern &
                    Western Waters; & to facilitate as much as in me lay the Inland Navigation of the
                    Potomack." Because of the "discontented temper of the Indians," he
                    decided not to go down the 
                        Ohio
                    , but he quizzed the frontiersmen about navigable streams and about land portages
                    between the Potomac and the 
                        Ohio
                     and between the 
                        Ohio
                     and the Great Lakes. After a month on horse–back he arrived back at 
                        Mount Vernon
                     in October, 1784, with misplaced confidence that convenient passage from the great
                    falls of the Potomac all the way to 
                        Detroit
                     on Lake Erie could be achieved with relative ease. Early in the journey prospects for
                    success had been brightened for him when he watched a model of James Rumsey's boat
                    mechanically propelling itself upstream.16
            
            After his return to 
                        Mount Vernon
                        Washington
                     waited less than a week to write 
                        Virginia
                     Governor Benjamin Harrison a remarkable

                                Washington
                            's journal of his trip to the frontier is printed in 
                                Washington
                            
                            Diaries, IV, 1–71, quotations pp. 4, 21.
               
                     letter in which he effectively put himself at the head of a
                    public campaign to use the Potomac to develop better access to the West and tie it to the East. He
                    urged Harrison to mark his administration "as an important e r a in the Annals of this
                    Country" by taking two specific steps to promote inland navigation: first, Harrison should
                    arrange for the state to have the James and Potomac rivers surveyed "to their respective
                    sources" and to have the same done for those "Waters East & West of the 
                        Ohio
                    , which invite our notice by their proximity, & the ease with which Land
                    transportation may be had between them & the Lakes on one side, & the rivers Potomac
                    & James on the other"; and, second, if the 
                        Virginia
                     assembly could not be persuaded to provide the funds–and 
                        Washington
                     expected this to be the case–he should induce it to pass a bill empowering
                    private citizens to set up a company for "extending the navigation of Potomac or James
                        river."17
            
            In this letter to Harrison written on October 10, and in those he wrote to others later in the fall
                    of 1784 regarding the navigation of the Potomac, 
                        Washington
                     set out his enlarged views of the West. It becomes clear why inland navigation was the
                    one thing that could draw the hero of the Revolution back into the public arena so quickly and
                    unequivocally. He was convinced, as he wrote Harrison, that the 
                        Ohio
                     country would "settle faster than any other ever did, or any one would
                    imagine." The hordes of new settlers inevitably would demand outlets for their products.
                    Whoever provided the outlets–the Spanish to the south, the British to the north, or the
                    Americans to the east–would win their allegiance. It is a matter "of great
                    political importance," 
                        Washington
                     wrote Jacob Read in Congress on November 3, "to prevent the trade of the
                    Western territory from settling in the hands, either of the Spanish or British," for if
                    "the trade of that Country should flow through the Mississipi or St Lawrence…
                    they would in a few years be as unconnected with us, indeed more so, than we are with South
                    America." 
                        Washington
                     saw "a separation or a war" as a "consequence" if
                    Britain and 
                        Spain
                    , "instead of throwing stumbling blocks in their way as they
                    now do, should hold out lures for [the settlers'] trade and alliance." When
                    writing to Henry 
                        Knox
                     a month later, on December 5, about his endeavors "to stimulate my Countrymen
                    to the extension of the inland navigation of the rivers Potomac and James," he made his
                    point unmistakably clear, declaring that "if this Country … cannot, by any easy
                    communication be drawn this way… they will become a distinct people from
                    us–have different views–different interests, & instead of adding
                    strength to the Union, may in case of a rupture with either of those powers [
                        Spain
                     or Britain], be a formidable & dangerous neighbour."

                        Washington
                    's solution was to provide Westerners easy access to eastern markets.
                    "The more communications are opened" between East and West, 
                        Washington
                     wrote George Plater of 
                        Maryland
                     on October 25, "the closer we bind that rising world (for indeed it may be so
                    called) to our interests; and the greater strength shall we acquire by it … . These when
                    viewed upon a Commercial scale, are alone sufficient to excite our endeavors; but the political
                    object is, in my estimation, immense." He pointed to the advantages that would accrue to
                    the states of 
                        Maryland
                     and 
                        Virginia
                     and to particular individuals in them as well from an active trade with the West along
                    the Potomac. "But," he wrote Plater, "I consider this business in a far
                    more extensive point of view–and the more I have revolved it, the more important it
                    appears to me; not only as it respects our commerce, but our political interests, and the well
                    being, & strength of the Union also." It was to advance national goals that 
                        Washington
                     came out of retirement to create the Potomac River Company;18 the
                    enrichment of 
                        Virginia
                     and of some Virginians was now, at best, a secondary consideration for him.
            While 
                        Washington
                     himself never lost sight of the larger implications–the "political
                    object"--of inland navigation, in order to gain support for his Potomac project in the 
                        Virginia
                     and 
                        Maryland
                     legislatures he emphasized the wealth that would flow into the region from increased
                    trade with the West–trade, he warned, that would be lost to the more
                    commercial–minded Pennsylvanians and New Yorkers if the people did not act promptly. When
                    calling upon the legislatures of 
                        Virginia
                     and 
                        Maryland
                     to create a private company for opening the upper Potomac to navigation, he reminded
                    them that the company must be given the power "to hold out sufficient inducements to engage
                    men to hazard their fortunes in an arduous undertaking."19 Later when
                    he was seeking funds for the company from men such as the Marquis de 
                        Lafayette
                     and Robert Morris, he was careful to hold out for investors the prospect of great gains
                    from fees collected on the waterways.20 As he reminded James 
                        Madison
                     on December 3, when 
                        Madison
                     was preparing to shepherd the bill creating the Potomac River Company through the 
                        Virginia
                     legislature, "the motives which predominate most in human affairs is
                    self–love and self–interest." To get his company and to get it going 
                        Washington
                     talked as of old about sectional advantage and private gain, but he also spoke to
                    investor and politician about his basic concern: how links to the West could well determine the
                    future safety and prosperity of the Union.

                     did more than talk and write. Nor was he content only to lend the prestige of his name,
                    though even that in any other connection he consistently refused to do. He instead intervened,
                    directly and decisively, to secure prompt interstate cooperation in forming a company to his liking
                    for opening up communication to the West by way of the Potomac River. Convinced of the feasibility
                    of the project by what he had learned on his recent journey to the West, 
                        Washington
                     in October set to work, marshaling support for it among his friends and neighbors on
                    both sides of the Potomac. A large number of these met in 
                  Alexandria, Virginia
               , on
                    November 14 and drafted a bill for creating a company to finance and oversee the opening of the
                    upper Potomac for navigation. In the meantime 
                        Washington
                     was in touch with the governor and with friends in the 
                        Virginia
                     legislature in 
                        Richmond
                    , and on November 13 or 14 he arrived at the state capital for ten days to talk,
                    particularly to James 
                        Madison
                     and Joseph Jones in the House of Delegates, about creating a Potomac River Company.21 Within a week of leaving 
                        Richmond
                     he was in 
                        Annapolis
                     where, as he reported to 
                        Madison
                     on December 3 after his return to 
                        Mount Vernon
                    , he found "opportunities of conversing with some of the leading characters in
                    the different branches of the Legislature of 
                        Maryland
                    , on the subject of inland navigation, and the benefits which might arise from a
                    commercial intercourse with the Western Territory." He suggested to 
                        Madison
                     that to save time and to "prevent dissimilar proceedings," which
                    would be "as unproductive as no bill" a t all, the two legislatures should
                    "depute one or more members to meet at some intermediate place, and agree … upon
                    an adequate bill to be adopted by both States." The two legislatures were agreeable, and 
                        Washington
                     was named one of three 
                        Virginia
                     commissioners to meet with the Marylanders.22 By December 3 he was
                    back in 
                        Annapolis
                     where he acted as the sole 
                        Virginia
                     commissioner. Working with a joint committee of the 
                        Maryland
                     legislature, he secured a draft of a Potomac River bill that met his wishes. The 
                        Maryland
                     legislature passed the bill on December 28 with only nine dissenting votes.23

                                Alexandria
                             a letter to

                             in which he reported that the 
                                Alexandria
                             meeting had completed its business and that he had enclosed a copy of the bill
                            it had drafted for 
                                Washington

                        Washington
                     had his Potomac River Company, and on May 17,1785, he became its first president, a
                    position he held until he became president of the 
                        United States
                    . Before he was done with that job, he had put to use all he had learned about the West
                    since 1748.
            No attempt has been made in this discussion of George 
                        Washington
                    , the West, and the Union to define where 
                        Washington
                    's activities in the fall of 1784 fit into the genealogy of the federal union
                    formed in 1789, though clearly they do fit. Even less has the impact of 
                        Washington
                    's ideas and deeds on the Old Northwest been measured, though, again, they were
                    not without influence. The evidence presented does suggest, however, that 
                        Washington
                    's long experience with the West and his strongly held views about its
                    importance, leading in 1784 to his active participation in measures to bind it to the newly
                    confederated states, more than anything else, except the war itself, served to prepare him for the
                    role of nation builder. The West made the 
                        Virginia
                     farmer lift his eyes to prospects beyond his own fields and his native 
                        Virginia
                    . In his brief years of retirement after the war, it stretched his mind, stirred his
                    imagination, enlisted his energies, and nourished his hopes for the future. It kept the old hero in
                    trim for the demands of 1787 and 1789. As 
                        Madison
                     put it when giving Jefferson an account of 
                        Washington
                    's role in the establishment of the Potomac River Company, "The
                    earnestness with which he espouses the undertaking is hardly to be described, and shews that a mind
                    like his, capable of great views & which has long been occupied with them, cannot bear a
                    vacancy; and surely he could not have chosen an occupation more worthy of succeeding to that of
                    establishing the political rights of his Country."25

            I have been teaching the survey course of American history for forty years; and from the beginning of
                    that long career I have always tried to underscore the importance and value of the Articles of
                    Confederation by pointing out that it was the Congress under the Articles that passed the Northwest
                    Ordinance, one of the most important, progressive, and far–reaching legislative acts in
                    our history. It is, in fact, difficult to come up with a piece of legislation passed by Congress
                    under the Constitution that is as significant. What is ironic is that the record of the vote on the
                    Northwest Ordinance shows only eighteen delegates present in Congress on July 13, 1787, when it was
                    passed, and most of the eighteen were supposedly second–rate in ability and relatively
                    unknown. The important men in the country at the time were attending the Constitutional Convention
                    in 
                        Philadelphia
                    –--or, like Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, were out of the country. A
                    number of years later, in 1830, Daniel Webster had occasion to invoke the Ordinance on the floor of
                    the Senate during his celebrated reply to Robert Y. Hayne. Said he: "we are accustomed,
                    sir, to praise the lawgivers of antiquity … but I doubt whether one single law of any
                    lawgiver, ancient or modern, has produced effects of more distinct, marked, and lasting character
                    than the ordinance of '87… . We see its consequences at this moment, and we
                    shall never cease to see them, perhaps, while the 
                        Ohio
                     shall flow."1 A handsome salute, and one well taken.
            There is always the danger of indulging in hyperbole when speaking of the consequences of the
                    Ordinance; what was achieved, what was provided, things like "Free Schools, Free Churches,
                    Free Soil, Free Men," etc. What I should like to attempt here, however, is a discussion of
                    some of the more political ramifications of this extraordinary document, ramifications that
                    profoundly altered conceptions

                     about the nature of the Union and served as a bulwark for the
                    preservation of the Republic.
            I must confess that my conclusions are personal and based on subjective evidence. Also, they are
                    based on research not of the Northwest Territory itself but of the Southwest Territory, specifically
                    the early history of 
                        Tennessee
                     and to a much lesser extent the early history of 
                        Kentucky
                    . Lest this focus appear unrelated, I would remind you that although 
                        Tennessee
                     and 
                        Kentucky
                     were not territorially connected to the area of what became 
                        Ohio
                    , Indiana, 
                  Illinois, Michigan
               , and 
                        Wisconsin
                    , they fell under the Ordinance's principal provisions as they moved from
                    frontier to statehood, just as many other states thereafter. And they entered the Union before any
                    of those from the Northwest: 
                        Kentucky
                     in 1792, 
                        Tennessee
                     in 1796. Except for the provisions concerning slavery, and perhaps those dealing with
                    the Indians, the remaining articles of the Ordinance had a tremendous impact on both 
                        Tennessee
                     and 
                        Kentucky
                    , and perhaps the experience in these two states suggests some important conclusions
                    about what happened in the Northwest. I might also point out that between 1781 and 1802 the 
                        United States
                     received over 400,000 square miles from states with western land claims, of which only
                    265,000 square miles fell within the Northwest Territory; yet, the Ordinance affected all of that
                    area.
            As is obvious, the Ordinance, in a number of specific and important ways, established a governmental
                    policy not only for the Northwest but for the entire public domain in the future.2
            
            What is possibly unique and most important in the Ordinance, I believe, is that it successfully
                    prevented the republic from collapsing immediately into an empire, and this it did by providing (or,
                    rather, anticipating) a new concept of Union. I am not sure "collapsing" is the
                    appropriate operative word here, but I cannot think of a better one offhand. It has been my
                    experience in reading and studying history that all republics become empires sooner or later before
                    their ultimate decline and fall. Once they acquire territory beyond the original limits, of
                    necessity they evolve into empires. Note the Roman Republic; note the Venetian Republic; note the
                    French Republic. And there are many other examples.
            Certainly in the 
                        United States
                     in the 1780s there was a great deal of talk about empire, then and later. On the
                    frontier westerners worried about empire, about the imperial or colonial intentions of the East, and
                    they talked about it quite freely. Back east a t the seat of government they also talked about
                    empire—sometimes indirectly, such as how the West could best be exploited and controlled.
                    Later, Jefferson himself spoke of an "empire for liberty" when referring

                                Indianapolis

                     to 
                        Louisiana
                    , and it was not uncommon for others to think in imperial terms when discussing the
                    future of the West. Andrew Jackson, for example, had a dream of empire that included all Spanish
                    North America.
            What spared Americans from moving immediately and directly into a structure of imperialism was the
                    Northwest Ordinance, in that it decreeed the stages and means by which territories would become
                    states equal to all other states in the Union. Colonial status, or exploitation by the older
                    ("original") states, could not and did not happen. What is ironic, of course, is
                    that the North–west Ordinance did, in fact, impose colonial rule on the territory in its
                    initial stage. A governor, secretary, and judges were appointed by the central government in the
                    east to administer the territory. Even so, statehood was inevitable once the territory reached the
                    prescribed population; and that inevitability had a profound impact on the West—the
                    entire West, as it turned out—both within and without the Northwest Territory.
            I regard the Ordinance as the great bulwark of the republic because I believe a real threat existed
                    at the end of the eighteenth century that this country might so easily have taken the wrong turn
                    toward an imperialistic approach to the West and thereby have created for itself insuperable
                    problems that would have spelled its immediate doom. What exacerbated the situation was the constant
                    danger of treason against the 
                        United States
                     by Westerners. The presence of 
                        Spain
                     and Great Britain always constituted a threat to the Union, and the presence of the
                    Indians added to the threat because they were the pawns in the international political game. It
                    seemed obvious that if the West were to remain in the hands of the 
                        United States
                     following the Revolution then something had to be done about the British and Spanish,
                    for they continued to retain considerable portions of land within the 
                        United States
                    , north and south.
            This external threat to the nation was matched by the internal threat to its safety; namely, the
                    anger and frustration Westerners felt toward the central government in failing to rid them of the
                    Indian problem or dealing effectively with foreign interference with their trade, such as the
                    Spanish interference from 
                        New Orleans
                    . Moreover, they were convinced that a conspiracy existed in the East to keep them out
                    of the confederacy except as dependent colonists.
            I can explain better what I mean by using the history of 
                        Tennessee
                     as a case in point. During the Revolution Scotch–Irish from
                            
                  Pennsylvania, Virginia
               , and 
                        North Carolina
                     moved steadily westward and squatted on land both north and south of the Ohio
                        River. Years later, during the debate on preemption in 1841, Senator Willie P. Mangum
                    was accused of implying that squatters in the west were "a sort of 
                        North Carolina
                     blue beards, who are rugged, dirty, brawling, browbeating monsters, six feet high,
                    whose vocation is  robbing, drinking, fighting, and terrifying
                    every peaceable man in the community."3 Since such an opinion was
                    prevalent during the post–Revolutionary years as well, it is small wonder that the
                    Congress felt these ruffians needed a strong and stable government in the West. No doubt, these
                    brawling, browbeating monsters had two main concerns in migrating west: their economic livelihood
                    and the presence and danger of the Indian. To address these concerns they turned to all manner of
                    deception, intrigue, and conspiracy.
            The Scotch–Irish who came to 
                        Tennessee
                     were always described as "greedy after land." They were outside the
                    bounds of any organized government and so in 1772 took it upon themselves to establish the Watauga
                    Association, which provided for a sheriff, clerk, and a court with legislative and judicial powers.
                    They assumed that the Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768 had settled the problem of land ownership
                    because the Iroquois (who had only a shadowy claim to the region) relinquished all the land south of
                    the 
                        Ohio
                     to the mouth of the 
                        Tennessee
                    . Of course the Indians in the immediate area did not see it quite that way, especially
                    the Cherokees who carried out a fierce war against the 
                        Tennessee
                     settlers in 1776. There was the real danger a t this time that a British army would
                    march from West 
                        Florida
                     with Creeks, Chickasaws, and Cherokees to attack the entire frontier of 
                        Virginia
                     and 
                        North Carolina
                    . Fortunately, it did not happen, but the presence of the British and the Spanish
                    increasingly influenced the politics of the southwestern frontier. Eventually the Cherokees were
                    defeated and forced to sign treaties relinquishing their rights, but that did not end the raids,
                    especially from the Chickamauga towns.
            When the Revolution ended, 
                        England
                     ceded the Floridas back to 
                        Spain
                    , and 
                        Spain
                     claimed that the northern boundary of her territory was the mouth of the Yazoo to the
                    Appalachicola, not the 31st parallel. She established forts in West 
                        Florida
                    , exercised control of the 
                        Mississippi
                     on both sides of the river as far north as the mouth of the 
                        Ohio
                     (and beyond that point on the west side), and concluded important treaties with the
                    Indians. Thus, at the conclusion of the Revolution the 
                        United States
                     was no more able to drive the Spanish from the southwest than it was to expel the
                    British from the northwest.
            When the Congress asked the states to cede their western land claims to the general government, 
                        North Carolina
                     chose to cede only its unappropriated lands. Prior to the session William Blount, in
                    1783, got the 
                        North Carolina
                     legislature to pass the so–called Land Grab Act, which offered
                    unappropriated lands in what was to become 
                        Tennessee
                     for a price of $5.00 per one hundred acres, a handsome bit of legislative
                    skullduggery that created huge fortunes 
                  
                     3

                     for several future Tennesseans. Many of these entrepreneurs were
                    immediately ready for home rule; thus, when they heard of Jefferson's Ordinance of 1784,
                    they quickly formed the new state of 
                        Franklin
                    , believing that statehood would be an immediate process. But nothing happened. The
                    Congress sat on its collective hands, and it did so, in part, because, as Robert F. Berkhofer has
                    pointed out, Jefferson's Ordinance of 1784 merely provided a framework of general rules for
                    establishing government in the West and was not intended to take effect immediately.4 Naturally, 
                        North Carolina
                     took exception to the presumption of the 
                        Franklin
                     settlers in declaring their separation and ordered the arrest of John Sevier, the
                    governor of 
                        Franklin
                    , for daring to initiate this treason against the state. Sevier responded by contacting
                    an agent of the Spanish envoy to the 
                        United States
                     and initiating the so–called Spanish Intrigue. What is unusual and very
                    interesting is that this plunge into treasonable conspiracy does not occur in the Northwest as it
                    does in the Southwest.
            According to some contemporaries the aim of the 
                        Franklin
                     movement from the beginning was not only the separation from 
                        North Carolina
                     but from the 
                        United States
                     as well. Certainly by 1786 the danger of secession was real, and it was accompanied by
                    several other intrigues with the Spanish who by this time sprawled along the entire Gulf of Mexico
                    and up the Mississippi River. (I must say that I was staggered when I
                    researched the Archivo des Indias in Seville, 
                        Spain
                    , and discovered so many documents that proved the treachery, fickleness, and
                    untrustworthiness of the Americans.)
            
               
                        Spain
                    's American policy after the war, a policy that continued for decades, was
                    based on her recognition of the need to protect her colonial possessions from the greed and cunning
                    of scheming American frontiersmen. To safeguard her North American empire 
                        Spain
                     did several things: she claimed the territory northward from the gulf to the

                     and Ohio rivers, rejecting the American contention that the 31st
                    parallel separated the 
                        United States
                     from her possessions; she closed the 
                        Mississippi
                     to stifle the growth of the American settlements; she negotiated alliances with the
                    Creek, Choctaw, and Chickasaw Indians; and she encouraged the American secession movements as they
                    steadily emerged in the West.
            The intrigues with 
                        Spain
                     by Americans and the secession movement were intensified because of the conciliatory
                    policy of Congress toward the southern Indians (e.g., the Treaty of 
                        Hopewell
                     of 1785 and 1786) and the effort by John Jay, the secretary of foreign

                     affairs, to negotiate a treaty with the Spanish in 1786 by which
                    the 
                        United States
                     would abandon the right to navigate the Mississippi River for
                    twenty-five or thirty years in exchange for commercial concessions. The treaty never materialized,
                    but the West exploded in anger that such an idea had even been contemplated.
            The Spanish were also accused of inciting and arming the Indians to attack 
                        Tennessee
                     settlements, and they did in fact provide supplies to the Creeks under the Spanish
                    treaty of 1784. The Creeks launched a general war upon 
                        Georgia
                     and 
                        Tennessee
                     settlers in 1786, and it was widely believed that the only way these attacks could be
                    stopped was for the West to secede from the Union and ally itself with 
                        Spain
                    . Alexander McGillivray, the Creek chieftain who had important trade relations with a
                    Scotch trading company in Pensacola, told the Spanish that the 
                        Tennessee
                     settlers had been so devastated by Indian raids that they were willing to submit to any
                    conditions for peace and would even become subjects of the king of 
                        Spain
                    . According to McGillivray the settlers said they were determined "to free
                    themselves from a dependence on Congress."5
            
            Dr. James White, a 
                        North Carolina
                     congressman who in the words of one recent historian had a dream of empire for
                    "Greater 
                        Franklin
                    ,"6 told Don Diego de Gardoqui, the Spanish minister to the 
                        United States
                    , that the western settlements would separate from the 
                        United States
                     if 
                        Spain
                     would reopen the Mississippi River, provide a military alliance
                    and commercial concessions, and permit them to expand their territory down the Tennessee
                        River past the Muscle Shoals to the headwaters of the 
                        Alabama
                     and Yazoo rivers. These settlers were empire builders—born
                    expansionists—and I do not think they ever changed. Gardoqui sent White to 
                        Franklin
                     to act as a Spanish agent to deny charges that 
                        Spain
                     incited the Indians, and Gardoqui added that 
                        Spain
                     was "much disposed" to provide 
                        Franklin
                     with "all the protection they ask." White later told the Spanish
                    governor at Havana that the Franklinites "wished to place themselves under the protection
                    of the King" of 
                        Spain
                    .7 Again the archives in Seville provide many documents that attest
                    to the fact that the Franklinites were "very ardent" about the "future
                    probability of an alliance and a concession of commerce" with 
                        Spain
                    . The people of 
                        Franklin
                    , claimed the Spanish, had "come to realize upon what part of the world and
                    upon which nation depend their future happiness and security."8 And it
                    was not the 
                        United States
                    .

            When Congressman White reached 
                        New Orleans
                    , he found that not only were the Franklinites in communication with the Spanish but
                    that an even newer settlement in 
                        Tennessee
                     along the banks of the Cumberland River was also conspiring with
                    them. The Cumberland settlement, where Andrew Jackson settled when he left 
                        North Carolina
                    , had already begun correspondence with Don Estevan Miró, governor of 
                        Louisiana
                    , in the hope of winning free navigation of the 
                        Mississippi
                    . They realized that a small community, such as theirs, would be wiped out by the
                    Indians if they (the Indians) had the help and protection of the Spanish. Since the 
                        United States
                     government could do nothing, the Cumberland settlement offered to secede and take an
                    oath of allegiance to the king of 
                        Spain
                    . In return the residents would be left alone to manage their local affairs and would
                    have free access down the 
                        Mississippi
                    . They even went so far as to name their district after the governor, calling it the
                    Mero district in the hope that this flattery would conciliate him. Jackson got involved in this
                    affair, and Thomas P. Abernethy in his excellent book From Frontier to Plantation
                    wondered aloud how a rank outsider like Jackson could inject himself into the secret councils of
                    high politics unless the Spanish conspiracy was common knowledge.9 Indeed, it
                    was.
            In 
                        Kentucky
                     there was a similar situation. There was also present one of the arch conspirators of
                    all time, James Wilkinson. He came to 
                        Kentucky
                     from 
                        Maryland
                     around 1783 and quickly established himself as a leader of the movement to separate 
                        Kentucky
                     from 
                        Virginia
                    . Wilkinson demanded radical action, and there was plenty of talk about establishing an
                    independent nation. There were, of course, problems with the Indians, and the British still remained
                    holed up in their forts along the Canadian border, which posts they were supposed to vacate
                    according to the terms of the peace treaty that ended the Revolution. Wilkinson went to 
                        New Orleans
                     and arranged a deal with the Spanish by which he personally would be granted monopoly
                    rights to 
                        New Orleans
                     if he would in return work for 
                        Kentucky
                    's separation from the 
                        United States
                     and eventual union with 
                        Spain
                    . At a convention held in 
                        Kentucky
                     shortly thereafter, Wilkinson and his friends called for a declaration of independence
                    from 
                        Virginia
                     and from the 
                        United States
                    . It was decided to take the issue to the people and not by very much was the question
                    of separation rejected.
            The demand for home rule in 
                        Kentucky
                     and 
                        Tennessee
                     became more and more intense a t the same time that the central government repeatedly
                    stalled over addressing this problem. Consequently, Spanish agents constantly traveled on various
                    errands

                                    Tennessee

                     throughout the American West and across the Ohio
                        valley during this period; and American speculators, entrepreneurs, informers, and
                    opportunists regularly visited 
                        New Orleans
                     in the hope of concluding advantageous deals.
            Perhaps it is stretching credulity to suppose that these Americans could seriously consider a
                    permanent union with 
                        Spain
                    , but an awful lot of people at the time thought it could and would happen. And the
                    evidence in the Spanish archives is staggering. Of course, some Westerners were always loyal to the 
                        United States
                    ; and others no doubt deliberately intrigued with the Spanish in order to frighten an
                    older state, such as 
                        North Carolina
                    , into ceding her western lands to the 
                        United States
                    .
            But it should be remembered that the 
                        Mississippi
                     was a burning question in American politics from 1784 onward. Westerners, cut off by
                    the mountains from the East and lacking the means to reach markets of the world except through the 
                        Mississippi
                    , discovered they had few or no ties to the "original" states. The
                    constant squabbling between individual eastern states during this so–called Critical
                    Period further discouraged Westerners. Easterners did not understand western problems, according to
                    Tennesseans and Kentuckians, and were too caught up with their own seemingly petty concerns to
                    address western problems–problems that involved westerners' very existence. Then
                    the failure of Congress to do anything about creating new states after 
                        Virginia
                    's cession in 1784, particularly with regard to 
                        Kentucky
                    ; the abortive attempts at state making by the Tennesseans in establishing 
                        Franklin
                    , coupled with the inability of the government to expel the British and Spanish from
                    American territory; and John Jay's negotiations with the Spanish to yield the 
                        Mississippi
                    –all of these developments seriously threatened the future territorial
                    integrity of the 
                        United States
                    . It seemed as though the future allowed only two possible courses of action: either the
                    East impose colonial rule on the West and suffer the consequences or watch as a British and/or
                    Spanish absorption of the West take shape. George 
                        Washington
                     spoke of this danger in a letter to Benjamin Harrison, governor of 
                        Virginia
                    , on October 10, 1784:
                        I need not remark to you Sir, that the flanks and rear of the 
                                United States
                             are possessed by other powers, and formidable ones too; nor how necessary it is
                            to apply the cement of interest, to bind all parts of the Union together by indissoluble
                            bonds, especially that part of it, which lies immediately west of us, with the middle
                            states. For, what ties, let me ask, shou'd we have upon those people? How entirely
                            unconnected with them shall we be, and what troubles may we not apprehend, if the Spaniards
                            on their right, and Gt. Britain on their left, instead of throwing stumbling blocks in their
                            way as they now do, should hold out lures for their trade and alliance. What, when they get
                            strength, which will be sooner than most people conceive … will be the
                            consequence of their having formed close connexions with both, or either of those powers in
                            a commercial way? It needs not, in my opinion, the gift of prophecy to foretell.
                        
                        The Western settlers, (I speak now from my own observation) stand as it were upon a pivot;
                            the touch of a feather, would turn them any way."10
                  
                    
            
            What made the difference, what completely turned the situation around, was the passage of the
                    Northwest Ordinance. Now the West knew that Congress had a policy with respect to the territories
                    and that that policy meant colonial rule until such time as the settlers were prepared to take their
                    place as co–equals with the other states in the Union. The 
                        United States
                     would expand, not as an empire with subject peoples and territory but by the addition
                    of new, sovereign states; and these states, in the words of the Ordinance, would be "on an
                    equal footing with the original States in all respects whatsoever."
            It was a new concept of Union. No longer was the 
                        United States
                     a static collection of independent states quarreling among themselves over vested
                    rights. This new concept was a dynamic expression of an expanding country controlled by a central
                    government in which new states would be added to the Union by its authority and action. Control
                    remained at the center and thereby strengthened the national government; and all the states were
                    absolutely equal, no matter when—how early or late—they entered the Union.
            Not that the Ordinance ended conspiracy and intrigue or the dreams of empire these "robbing,
                    drinking, brawling, browbeating monsters" constantly harbored. The peculiar conditions of
                    western life invited reckless and desperate schemers, and their wild plans continued into the
                    nineteenth century: for example, Citizen Edmund Charles Genêt fomented western hatred of
                    the Spanish; George Rogers Clark organized an expedition to seize the entire length of the 
                        Mississippi
                    ; Senator William Blount was expelled from the 
                        United States
                     Senate because he tried to induce 
                        England
                     to send an army from 
                        Canada
                     to 
                        Louisiana
                     and the Floridas by way of Lake 
                        Michigan
                     and the 
                        Mississippi
                    ; and, of course, there was James Wilkinson and Aaron Burr. Burr not only involved
                    Wilkinson in his schemes but Jackson as well. And Henry 
                        Clay
                     of 
                        Kentucky
                     acted as Burr's counsel when Burr was hauled before a grand jury on charges of
                    raising troops for illegal purposes. What daring empire builders these "browbeating
                    monsters" were!
            In 
                        Tennessee
                     they trifled with treason and used the threat of secession to force 
                        North Carolina
                     first into ceding her western lands and then into ratifying the Constitution. Even so,
                    when the South–west Territory was finally established, these Tennesseans were still not
                    satisfied because the Northwest Ordinance (which was applied

                     to them with some modification) denied them home rule. They
                    wanted their own territorial legislature and then statehood as quickly as possible. What attracted
                    them, of course, as it did most other Westerners, was the new concept of Union as advanced by the
                    Northwest Ordinance, which granted them equality and full status as a sovereign state once they had
                    completed the three stages. The inevitability of statehood was clear to them, and that made all the
                    difference in the world. The Northwest Ordinance also provided (necessarily) a strengthened central
                    government that would soon win them, first, access to, and then, ownership of, the
                        Mississippi valley and its mouth at 
                        New Orleans
                    . This was not a concept of a Union indifferent to the needs of its newest partners;
                    this Union, in the words of Peter S. Onuf, became the "guarantor of collective
                        interests."11 As such, it strengthened the Republic and provided
                    the surest bulwark against those who would betray it or plunge it disastrously into empire building.
                    The moment this new concept of Union occurred–that is, the moment the 
                        United States
                     moved from a static American state system to a dynamic form that allowed for national
                    expansion by the deliberate process of adding new states under the guidance of the central
                    authority—in that moment the states having entered this Union no longer retained the
                    right of secession. Or so Jackson argued. He strongly advocated states rights, and he always
                    believed that this new and dynamic concept of Union in no way eliminated states rights; still, he
                    maintained that secession as the right of any state to redress its grievances was forfeited even
                    before the Constitution went into effect. Perhaps under the old static system secession was a legal
                    instrument to protect state rights. Not so under the new system. And I think Jackson was right. Not
                    that I care particularly about fixing an exact time when secession was lost to the states, but I
                    frankly cannot think of a better moment. It has generally been supposed that secession vanished as a
                    right when this country became a Union of people, rather than a confederation of states. Perhaps. I
                    am more inclined to accept the position that secession was lost when the concept
                    of Union changed. And it visibly and perceptibly changed when eighteen relatively unknown and
                    unaccomplished men enacted the Northwest Ordinance of 1787.

            A historian who takes part in the celebration of a public anniversary risks the sort of situation in
                    which Perry Miller, the great historian of New 
                        England
                     Puritanism, found himself in 1948 at the tercentenary of the 
                        Cambridge
                     Platform. The mayor of 
                        Cambridge
                     extolled that 
                        Puritan
                     code as the veritable fount of American democracy; Miller of course denied it was
                    anything of the kind; and the mayor duly thanked him for affirming that it was. Whatever popular
                    tradition the Northwest Ordinance enjoys today presumably has to do not only with democratic
                    self–government but with a social democracy of self–reliant, egalitarian
                    pioneer farmers living in a distinctively midwestern "open country
                        neighborhood."1 So it was commemorated in 1937 in the form of a
                    procession of sesquicentennial oxcarts passing through my 
                        Ohio
                     town.
            Sober historians, however, as early as Jacob Burnet's recollected Notes on the Early
                    Settlement in 1847 down through Frederick Merk's lectures that I attended a t 
                        Harvard
                     in 1947, have tended to dissent from this nostalgic tradition. Insofar as social
                    democracy did eventually develop in the Old Northwest, it was due to subsequent amendment of the
                    ordinances of the 1780s, especially to progressive easing of the original 640–acre
                    minimum purchase in the Ordinance of 1785 to, by 1820, the 80 acres that an ordinary farmer could
                    afford; to, still later, the Preemption Act of 1841 that gave the squatter first choice; and to the
                    Homestead Act of 1862 that offered 160–acre farms free. Only thus gradually, in
                    Burnet's traditional republican phrases, were "men of limited means"
                    enabled to become "freeholders, and independent cultivators of their own domain, who,
                    otherwise, must have been hirelings

                     to the wealthy, or have swelled the ranks of the idle and the
                    dissipated"—the social policy that he believed ought to have been followed all
                        along.2 The Ordinance of 1787 was never amended so explicitly, and a
                    generation ago the legal historian Francis S. Philbrick laboriously debunked it as not democratic at
                    all, labeling it instead "a true colonial system" that permitted less
                    self–government than under British rule before the Revolution.3 And
                    now Peter S. Onuf concludes that the two ordinances were little concerned with social arrangements,
                    democratic or undemocratic, but rather with economic development of the West and with land sales as
                    a steady source of revenue for the much–indebted federal government.4
                    To the degree that Congress, then or later, did address itself to social ends, as Mary E. Young has
                    observed, it equated "the disposal of land to small holders with settlement, and settlement
                    with development."5 Social policy was merged into economic policy.
            And yet however ill–founded in fact the popular sense of the ordinances of the 1780s may
                    be, that sense itself is a historical reality. It is above all a tradition of family farms and
                    independent small businesses, a tradition which is still compelling enough to command special
                    subsidies, tax advantages, and exemption from foreclosure for their proprietors—even
                    benefit pop–music concerts like those in aid of starving African children. Because it is
                    a libertarian tradition, Americans are apt to think first, when the Ordinance of 1787 comes to mind,
                    of its final clause, which forthrightly (it seemed) prohibited slavery everywhere northwest of the 
                        Ohio
                    —a clause so unlike the compromises and euphemisms in the Constitution that
                    was also drafted in the summer of 1787. And the opening clause, though less often remarked upon, was
                    no less remarkable, prescribing as it did equal inheritance by all siblings, daughters as well as
                    sons. For whatever reason, the place of the ordinances of the 1780s in the national tradition may be
                    as significant as all the factual niggling by historians.
            So deep–running a tradition certainly calls for more detailed research—which,
                    however, it is only beginning to get. Instead of a microscopic view, what I can offer runs to the
                    telescopic, the longest

                     possible setting in time and space, beginning with the remotest
                    possible origins of the tradition. This view goes back not just to 1620 or 1607 but some thousands
                    of years, literally beyond tradition to that time so immemorial that even the memory of the folk
                    runneth not, to the long–forgotten but recently unearthed era of the first agricultural
                    settlement of northern Europe, especially, of course, of Britain. An American historian will be
                    struck by prefigurings of, if not exactly precedents for, settlement of the Old Northwest.
                    Archaeologists detect that the pre–Celtic aboriginals, two or three millennia B.C.,
                    carried out the first clearance of the forest cover in long rectangular swathes, regularly oriented
                    north–west to southeast, doggedly crossing streams and otherwise ignoring topography,
                    roughly in the manner of the federal survey system of 1785 which nineteenth century European critics
                    thought so unnatural. These clearances seem to have provided a "planned
                    frame–work within which individual fields were laid out"—small square
                    fields of less than an acre, the sort that farmers continued to use through the Celtic and Roman
                    eras and the first several hundred years of Anglo–Saxon occupation.6
                    As the archaeologist P. J . Fowler observes, "fields in later prehistoric southern
                    Britain… were generally rectangular in shape, whatever the geology, with a tendency
                    towards squarishness."7 The similarity to the later American pattern is
                    not surprising if, as the geographer Hildegarde Binder Johnson says of "colonial settlement
                    patterns of western and non–western … societies" alike,
                    "planners resort to rectangularity all over the world."8
                    Certainly right–angled grids were no latter–day invention of William Penn for
                    laying out 
                        Philadelphia
                     between its parallel rivers, as historians of Roman and medieval city planning have
                        shown.9 The square–headedness of the human mentality evidently
                    penetrates a good many archaeological levels below that eighteenth century Enlightenment rationality
                    sometimes associated with the Land Ordinance of 1785.
            The whole picture of prehistoric Britain now looks oddly familiar: "an enormous
                    effort," Fowler concludes, "by a few million people during the last two millennia
                    BC to bring large tracts of country under systematic control, not only on the grand scale with their
                    field systems, but also in the detail of many thousands of kilometres of field boundary, every
                    single centimetre of which was constructed in a variety of ways from an imaginary line to major

                     bank and ditch."10 Ages passed,
                    however, before this landscape emerged into recorded history, and "a thousand years and
                    more of illiterate farming is bound to have blurred the original arrangements," blurred
                    them even beyond the reach of folk tradition.11 By the High Middle Ages the
                    typical English landscape had rounded off the corners and bent the lines to fit the natural
                    topography. Adjacent villages typically lay, more or less parallel to each other, across a stream
                    valley, from one height of land to the one opposite—rather like the "crests and
                    divides" pattern in the presurvey French townships of 
                        Wisconsin
                    .12 The prehistoric pace of settlement and modification of course
                    was speeded up by many times in the Old Northwest. Already, Johnson detects, the terminology, at
                    least, of the rectangular survey system of 1785 is fading from colloquial 
                        Wisconsin
                     speech in favor of more "natural" descriptions of farmland.13 Perhaps someday those squares too will have to be rediscovered by
                    archaeologists.
            There are other strikingly familiar touches in the prehistoric settlement of Britain. Trees were
                    cleared by the slash–and–burn method of girdling and burning and then
                    scratch–plowing around the stumps until the seasons rotted them away–that same
                    laborsaving but prodigally wasteful Brandwirtschaft which in nineteenth century America shocked so
                    many observers used to the long since tidied–up landscapes of Europe. It was a slow
                    process even so—perhaps a third of a square mile, about two hundred acres, could be
                    cleared by a family in the course of one hundred years. Sometimes the farmer's task was
                    eased by already existing clearances, the product, as in North America, of fires set by the previous
                    population of hunters, the first postglacial inhabitants of 5000–4000 B.C.14
            
            Archaeology tells us next to nothing, however, about prehistoric social relations. The little that
                    can be inferred again prefigures the Old Northwest. As Stuart Piggott has observed, "in no
                    instance have the exiguous remains recovered in Britain been capable of interpretation as centres
                    larger than a farm or homestead," one, moreover, "of the
                    ‘natural’ or ‘nuclear’ family type, conventionally set
                    at about five persons… . The archaeological evidence, such as it is, favours a
                    predominance of settlements of Einzelhof type over larger aggregations of village
                        status."15
            
            Although it is impossible to say that these were "family farmers" of the later
                    familiar sort, the evidence from Old English

                     placenames tends to confirm the concept. A place whose name
                    includes the suffix "ing"—Birmingham, 
                        Washington
                    —must have been settled, it used to be thought, by an Anglo–Saxon
                    war band, the first part of the placename commemorating its chieftain. That would make them communal
                    settlements from the first. Now the eponymous Dark Age Beorma of Birmingham or Wassa of 
                        Washington
                     appears, rather, to have been simply the head of the family which originally settled
                    the farm or took it over from some Welsh predecessor, the Birmingas or Washingas being his
                    proliferating descendents, real or nominal. The suffixes "ham" and, a bit later,
                    "ton" were also first applied to individual farmsteads. "Ham" is
                    cognate with the German heim, English "home," and Scots "hame";
                    "ton"—which later came to suggest a larger community, a
                    town—was originally "tun," a farm, and in Scots still is
                    "toun," as in the fermtoun or joint farm—of East 
                        New Jersey
                     as well as Lowland 
                        Scotland
                    .16
            
            Among all the regional and local permutations of medieval 
                        England
                     that sort of farm persisted: perhaps half the rural population around 1300 were holders
                    of the twelve-to-fifteen-acre halfvirgate or yardland upon which a family could subsist.17 In the most advanced villages of the Midlands at some point between 800 and
                    1300 each family's holding of little square fields was restructured—there is no
                    record anywhere of this process of disenclosure to match the familiar one of enclosure later
                    on—and reassigned into a home–lot in a nucleated village and
                    "strips" (properly oxgangs or selions) in the surrounding open arable fields.18 That mature agrarian system proved to be too advanced for the primitive
                    settlements of colonial America, even in those New 
                        England
                     townships where the first generation tried to transplant it. But some of the
                    accompanying institutions of medieval farming society did persist in America, as late as the Old
                    Northwest. Americans have always sensed, at least, that their tradition of local
                    self–government had transatlantic roots–attributed a century ago to an
                    Anglo–Saxon or a Germanic racial trait, though suppressed for some hundreds of years by 
                        Norman
                     feudalism. But no such ethnic theory is required, as 
                        Warren
                     Ault demonstrated more than twenty years ago: medieval English villagers, that is, the
                    fifteen–acre smallholders among them, were regulating their own local affairs throughout
                    the Middle Ages. Although most of them in most villages held their land from a lord of the manor,
                    these neighbors devised their own bylaws or ordinances

                     for their agriculture and herding. The consensus that was
                    necessary for this self–government, especially in the cooperative open–field
                    villages, was no doubt arrived a t the more easily, in the High Middle Ages, because of the high
                    degree of social homogeneity—ethnic, religious, cultural—at least in any one
                    village by that time.19
            
            English medievalists have been interested in two other phenomena: first, the remarkably free local
                    market for land and, second, the no less remarkably permissive customary pattern of inheritance. In
                    both cases the practical degree of personal liberty quite belied the legal technicalities of
                    manorial tenure with which medievalists used to be preoccupied. It turns out that law was one thing,
                    local custom quite another.
            The local land market—which consisted of one farmer's leasing odd acres from
                    another, less often the sale of one family's entire farm to another—was
                    determined by the ups and downs of individual and demographic circumstances, with little
                    interference from the lord, the legal proprietor of the manor. As long as the lord was paid the
                    fines due for such transfers, he seems (virtually everywhere that has been studied) to have found
                    this open land market as much to his advantage as to his tenants'. The farmer's
                    purpose in acquiring more land was not so much capitalistic—for the sake of accumulation
                    and self—gentrification-as it was simply to pass on to one son (more if possible) the
                    twelve to fifteen acres that would support the same self–reliant status that the father
                    had held. Only when the agrarian system was thrown into disarray—by the plague in the
                    late fourteenth century, ultimately by commercial modernization in the sixteenth and seventeenth
                    centuries and after—did some farmers find the opportunity for capitalistic accumulation
                    and aggrandizement.20
            
            Inheritance likewise followed local custom, which varied from place to place but everywhere was far
                    more liberal than seigniorial. Technically, a tenant holding reverted to the lord on the
                    tenant's death, to be regranted to whomever the lord pleased; actually, the manor lord has
                    yet to be discovered who did not customarily prefer, of course on payment of the usual fine, the son
                    or sons or other relatives whom the deceased had named in his will. Sometimes, if the father lived
                    long enough, he conveyed the farm before his death but stipulated a sort of retirement contract for
                    his and his wife's maintenance as a condition of the son's holding the property.

            Daughters, and sons for whom there was not enough land for self–sustaining farms, received
                    personal property or cash or the assurance of some such support by the heir to the land. The purpose
                    of these inheritance customs was the same as that of the land market: to maintain, generation after
                    generation, the family on its holding. As Cicely Howell has summed it up, for one Leicestershire
                    village, the system "was expected to support all adult members [of a family], either by
                    supplying each with a share of land where possible, or [as was more usual] by supporting one nuclear
                    family and a number of celibate adults."21 If all these practices
                    foreshadowed the early days of the Old Northwest, so too, eventually, would the shift away from them
                    in seventeenth century 
                        England
                    . In social terms modernization involved no longer simply maintaining the family
                    securely on its traditional land but instead seeking to acquire and accumulate capital as
                    such—and much the same change occurred in the Old Northwest some two or three hundred
                    years later.
            Between 
                        England
                     and the Northwest, of course, lay colonial America in all its regional variety: the New 
                        England
                     town, the open–country neighborhood of the Middle Colonies, and the farm and
                    plantation variant of the latter in the South. For all the regional differences, there seems to have
                    been a common underlying reason why the mass of English and other European settlers left the
                    homeland: to escape the effect of modernization, whether actually at hand or only threatened, on
                    their own social status. As the modern commercial economy grew, it offered less and less place for
                    self—reliant smallholding farmers or independent master artisans, or for the traditional
                    homogeneous community of such neighbors. Colonial emigration selected men and families of that
                    middling rural sort out of the much broader social spectrum throughout the colonial era and indeed
                    through the nineteeth century and into the twentieth. (If it be objected that by recent calculation
                    many or most indentured servants and other poor immigrants were from a lower social status, it would
                    be hard to demonstrate that they did not hope to gain, sometimes to regain, the middling level.)
                    This perennial characteristic of American immigration must have accentuated in the 
                        United States
                     a version of the traditional, premodern, quite archaic social mentality of the medieval
                    villager. Perhaps it is this, more than anything else, that has, ironically, made America
                    exceptional in the modern world.22

            The undeveloped colonial economic environment naturally favored the less highly developed forms of
                    Old World local society—a throwback, so to speak, to the scattered farmsteads and
                    crossroads hamlets of prehistoric or unimproved, uncommercial medieval society. Those early New 
                        England
                     towns that deliberately laid out nucleated villages and open fields—too
                    labor–intensive in the circumstances—soon reverted to the more primitive
                        arrangements.23 It took the noneconomic purposes of the Puritans to keep up
                    New 
                        England
                    's reputation for communal neighborliness—and so too the Quakers and
                    German sectarians of the Middle Colonies. Elsewhere, something like the prehistoric settlement
                    pattern prevailed from the start: open–country neighborhoods of detached family
                    farmsteads—"plantations" of greater or smaller size—in a
                    landscape of forests that the aboriginal hunting population had burned off only here and there.
                    Since America reversed the mature European ratio of a short supply of land to an oversupply of
                    labor, closely settled communities were neither required nor even possible. Even so, communities
                    continued to be about as homogeneous as in the traditional Old World, especially in ethnic makeup:
                    almost solidly English in New 
                        England
                     and, with exceptions, the Chesapeake; either Dutch or English in rural 
                        New York
                    , and also Lowland Scots in East Jersey; English, German, or Scotch–Irish in
                    separate localities in 
                        Pennsylvania
                     and its mid–eighteenth century spillover into the southern backcountry;
                    something more of an amalgam, perhaps, among the English, French Protestants, Highland Scots, and
                    others in the Carolinas and 
                        Georgia
                    ; and, in the Old Northwest, the Catholic French inhabitants of 
                  Vincennes, Kaskaskia
               , Cahokia, 
                        Prairie
                     du Chien, and 
                        Detroit
                    —though all the ethnic enclaves except the French Catholics were divided by
                    religious schisms in the mid–eighteenth century.
            And the social norm was still the self–reliant family farm. However many indentured
                    servants and other poor newcomers failed to attain that ideal, most colonists did, whether they
                    were, on the one hand, well–established freeholders—sons succeeding
                    fathers—or, on the other, disreputable squatters trying to hold onto a piece of the
                    public land. There has been a flood of historical research on colonial
                    communities—happily no longer automatically condemned as antiquarian—which has
                    moved (as in 
                        England
                    ) from questions of government, economy, and social structure to inheritance and the
                    land market. In a pathbreaking new book Toby L. Ditz finds that inheritance in 
                        Connecticut
                     was very much what it had been in Old

                     least one or two of the sons, more if each could be provided
                    with enough land to support his own family. Under the "particularly hospitable
                    [demographic] conditions" of early New 
                        England
                    , "the desire to secure the independent status of as many children as
                    possible" was often fulfilled. And, again as in 
                        England
                    , a 
                        Connecticut
                     daughter was customarily left not land but personal property to enhance her chance to
                    become some independent farmer's wife. The father, who was much more likely to survive to
                    retirement than in 
                        England
                    , was the more certain to ensure his and his wife's comfortable old age by a
                    very explicit contract when he turned over control of the property. The overall result for local
                    society was "rough equality among new households, while overlapping rights [among siblings
                    and their spouses] linked household to household" in a network of kinship within
                    "stable rural communities organized by complex networks of exchange."24
            
            In 
                        Connecticut
                     this customary pattern of inheritance persisted into the nineteenth century in spite of
                    the progressive modernization—Yankeeization—that other recent historians have
                    pointed out in the commercial economy. The contrast with the southern tidewater regions is striking:
                    the mortality rate disrupted traditional family life among the malaria–defenseless
                    newcomers to the southern tidewater in the seventeenth century, and the relatively enormous estates
                    that some tobacco and then rice planters accumulated in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth
                    centuries made them, and their pattern of inheritance, more like the English gentlemen farmers who
                    were thriving in the early–modern commercial market than like their less fortunate
                    neighbors whose smallholdings they often engrossed. As the Chesapeake demography stabilized in the
                    eighteenth century, however, the family—indeed, great networks of
                    kinfolk—recovered to something like the patriarchal norm of premodern 
                        England
                     and New 
                        England
                    .25 In short, most parts of the country were coming out at a
                    comparably old–fashioned social point. As James A. Henretta and others have argued, well
                    into the nineteenth century "the [traditional] lineal family–not the [modern]
                    conjugal unit and certainly not the unattached individual"–was still the ideal,
                    if only because opportunity for "accumulative, acquisitive behavior" that might
                    produce greater success was still limited.26 Even speculation in real estate,

                     dabbled in, in a vast speeding–up of the Old World
                    local land market, aimed more at realizing traditional family goals than at amassing capital for
                    modern entrepreneurial purposes.27
            
            From this standpoint the increasing regularity in the physical layout of new townships on the New 
                        England
                     frontier and elsewhere in the eighteenth century—which has always been taken
                    as an index of modernization (anticipating the Land Ordinance of 1785)—may instead be
                    seen as another reversion to the primitive, even to the prehistoric. In the seventeenth century the
                    usual metes–and–bounds fashion of setting the boundaries of farms and other
                    local divisions–from this tree to that rock and along such and such a
                    stream—conformed to the natural terrain almost as much as the highly developed English
                    landscape to which the first settlers had been accustomed. The
                    metes–and–bounds pattern has been called "a social phenomenon rather
                    than a system of surveys.28 By the 1730s, however, as Amelia C. Ford's
                    lively little book related some eighty years ago, 
                        Massachusetts
                     began to lay off new settlements in "rows of contiguous rectangular townships
                    in advance of settlement"—though not yet oriented due north–south,
                    east–west, nor "exactly six miles square."29 After
                    midcentury such surveys were common: the 
                        New Hampshire
                     grants in 
                        Vermont
                    ; the 
                        Connecticut
                     settlements on the disputed upper Susquehanna; a few places in 
                  New York, South
                        Carolina
               , and elsewhere.30 Scattered farmsteads in
                    squared–off new settlements: how would the trad.itiona1 family persist in this retreat to
                    the primitive?
            The size of land purchases that would be available turns the question in the opposite, modern
                    direction. In 1774 the British government, as part of its stillborn attempt to reorganize colonial
                    administration, adopted a general system of prior survey and land–office auctions of lots
                    of from 100 to 1,000 acres. Although the Revolution intervened, independent 
                        Virginia
                     stepped in with sale of 400–acre lots–much larger than the
                    traditional 50–acre headrights that Thomas Jefferson proposed to give to landless
                    families. If the sale of such large tracts was the "colossal mistake" that Thomas
                    Perkins Abernethy called it—a failure to secure "diffusion of small landholdings
                    among the people"—he, like Jefferson, was invoking an agrarian tradition closer
                    to medieval custom than to modern practice.31 The ordinances of the 1780s
                    continued this oddly inegalitarian

                    Philbrick has charged and Onuf implied, as contrary, as Abernethy alleged, to the folk tradition of
                    the family farm and to the homogeneous local community of such families, those social ideals with
                    which the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 is popularly associated—and which still inspire
                    celebration in 1987?
            Certainly the poor squatters, most of them Scotch–Irish from over the recently established
                    western border of 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , whom Army Ensign John Armstrong and his twenty soldiers forcibly evicted from their
                    scattered settlements just inside the still unorganized territory in April, 1785, felt the new
                    federal policy violated the family–community tradition. (They kept coming back.)32 Under the Land Ordinance of 1785 the minimum size of lots for
                    purchase—one square mile—was several times what an ordinary farmer needed or
                    what a squatter could afford. As already noted, nineteenth century Congresses gradually moderated
                    the terms of sale, and historians have agreed that the original terms, in order to raise revenue,
                    had departed too far from the family–farm tradition of the prospective settlers.33 As one agricultural historian has observed, "The young Nation parted
                    at once with… the natural right of man to a fair allotment of whatever unused land he
                    might find, and embraced the idea that the vacant lands in the west should be used as … a
                    fund to extinguish the Nation's debts… ."34 Onuf
                    agrees: "the formulation of congressional land policy in 1784–1785 represented
                    an effort to create a national market in western lands."35 The need for
                    revenue, acute as it was in the 1780s, also led Congress to rush to accept the wholesale bid of the
                    New 
                        England
                     investors in the 
                        Ohio
                     Land Company for much of southeastern 
                        Ohio
                     and of others for sizable chunks of the southwestern corner. Those projects were of the
                    sort that speculators had been promoting on the colonial frontiers for forty years past.
            Although the 
                        Ohio
                     grants were, in effect, the last under the colonial land–granting system,
                    the choice offered buyers by the Land Ordinance of 1785—if not a square–mile
                    section, then a whole 36–square–mile township–was also far beyond
                    the smallholder's traditional dream. One of George 
                        Washington
                    's correspondents imagined that the en bloc townships would encourage whole
                    "neighborhoods of the same religious sentiments [especially New Englanders] to confederate

                     himself favored such compact settlements, and one of the principal themes of debate
                    over the ordinances of the 1780s was the classical fear that too large and scattered a society would
                    be unhomogeneous and hence unrepublican.37 That argument specifically pertained
                    to the size of future states, but the concern for social homogeneity echoed the practical experience
                    of most localities in both Europe and America as well as political theory. Unfortunately, even the
                    New Englanders who were still thought of as group migrants par excellence had not actually been
                    settling in that fashion for two or three generations, nor would many of them do so northwest of the 
                        Ohio
                    . When groups did acquire western land, they were usually speculative investors, not
                    communitarians. And they would sell to whoever would buy.
            If not homogeneous communities, then did the new system of survey and sale promote settlement by
                    individual families of the traditional sort? Toward that end the minimum purchase was reduced, by
                    1820, to 80 acres from the original 640. On the other hand objections raised by practical
                    agriculturists to the severely "rational" survey that so intrigued Jefferson and
                    other enlightened minds—after all, a less abstract Virginian remarked, nature had created
                    few parts of the country in squares—went almost entirely unheeded, then or later.38 Prior survey was intended to enhance conveyancing, and square boundaries
                    contributed to certainty of title—both of course of real use to buyer as well as
                    seller—but they had little other use to farmers or communities of farmers. If, as the
                    agricultural historian Thomas LeDuc argued, the poor man who hoped to become an independent farmer
                    and respectable citizen needed credit more than anything, the four–year term for payment
                    of the purchase price that was offered between 1800 and 1820 was too short—no credit at
                    all was offered after 1820—and in any case federal loans to settlers, not simply delayed
                    payment, would have served a positive social policy as well as, for that matter, the economic policy
                    of rapid development of the West.39
            
            But this is to get as far ahead of the story as the notion of a federal loan program would have been
                    in nineteenth century America. To return to the ordinances of the 1780s: if they were indeed tilted
                    toward economic rather than social ends, what is the explanation for the two
                    clauses—those against slavery and for equal inheritance—that have cast much of
                    the luster that makes this conference

                     a celebration? Both were radically liberal departures. At the
                    least, fully partible inheritance carried to its ultimate conclusion the direction in which
                    provincial law had been moving; exclusion of slavery before settlement of the new territory would
                    obviate there for all time the need to raise the question of its abolition, that question to which
                    only a few of the old states had yet responded and which would eventually embroil them all in the
                    Civil War.
            Although the symbolic value of these clauses is important, their practical effect has been
                    questioned. The inheritance clause, like most probate law, ruled only where the property owner left
                    no will; and of course the more property a man had, the likelier he was to make a will. Even as
                    moral example to will makers, the principle of equal shares to all would be apt to prevail only as
                    long as there was enough cheap land in a farmer's vicinity to enable him to provide each of
                    his children a competence to support a family—a situation unlikely to outlast the first
                    couple of generations in any one place.40
            
            What the effect of the antislavery clause was expected t o be has always defied explanation. Nathan
                    Dane of 
                        Massachusetts
                    , thinking it had as little chance of passage in 1787 as Jefferson's broader
                    clause had had in 1784, introduced it at the last moment; whereupon, without debate, even the
                    delegations from the southern states voted for it. Staughton Lynd has suggested various economic and
                    political advantages that southerners may have foreseen in it. Onuf speculates that northerners, for
                    their part, anticipated the link that settlement and commerce would in fact develop between a
                    slave–free Northeast and Northwest. Paul Finkelman finds evidence for all such
                    calculations quite ambiguous.41
            
            Dare one suggest, given the later history of racial prejudice in the Old Northwest, even among free
                    soilers, that to exclude slavery–and to send runaway slaves from the South back there, as
                    the Ordinance of 1787 also specified—meant excluding blacks as such?42 Was it an expression not only of genuine commitment to liberty among the proposers but also
                    of the traditional value placed on

                     homogeneity–cultural, ethnic, and certainly racial
                    homogeneity? In 1787 southerners and northerners could still agree that they would have been
                    happier, if perhaps poorer, if slavery—black slavery—had never been introduced
                    into North America. The states-that is, the white citizens—that were quickest to abolish
                    slavery after the Revolution were those with the fewest blacks. To exclude slavery from the new
                    territories perhaps held out the prospect of excluding blacks almost altogether. The congressional
                    delegates were as silent about that as about the other considerations that historians have
                    suggested, but what is certain is that virtually no one in that age is known to have seen any
                    positive social benefit in a biracial, that is, a radically heterogeneous, population. Thus 
                        Ohio
                    , as a state, both endorsed the Ordinance's prohibition of slavery and
                    expressed (as a historian summed it up eighty years ago) the general "contempt"
                    for the "worthless character" of the "shiftless and dependent"
                    blacks by requiring free Negroes to post bond and by excluding them from juries and schools.43

                        Illinois
                     country indicates the limit of Anglo–American tolerance even for white
                    ethnic heterogeneity. Had British rule north of the 
                        Ohio
                     developed as intended by the Quebec Act of 1774—so repugnant to
                    Anglo–American patriots—the French inhabitants might have continued
                    undisturbed in, among other idiosyncrasies, their exceedingly unsystematic custom of local
                    magistrates' granting land in the common fields and in their still more casual,
                    self–shredding recording of land titles. George Rogers Clark's conquest, in
                    1778–1779, left them under the not altogether salutary neglect of 
                        Virginia
                    , which reaffirmed their rights but allowed the members of the local administrative
                    court to grant large tracts of land to each other. 
                        Virginia
                     again stipulated the inhabitants' rights when ceding the territory to the 
                        United States
                     in 1784, but within three years the inhabitants of 
                        Vincennes
                     (casually called "Post Vincents," "St. Vincent,"
                    and the like by Anglo–Americans) were complaining to Congress against the "long
                    tale" of "distresses, oppressions, and calamities" suffered through the
                    "unquenchable rapacity" of an "army of petty tyrants" and asking
                    for secure possession of the thirty miles square that would allow them the "mere
                    competency" that, in the traditional way, was all they claimed.44

                     government investigated land claims in the mid–1790s
                    it revealed what the iconoclastic Francis S. Philbrick has called "illegalities of
                    stupendous extent—fraud, perjury, subornation, and forgery"—mainly by
                    Americans who had been buying up claims on the cheap.45
            
            There would be no French 
                        Illinois
                     or Indiana. Of the eighty–nine persons holding, in 1788, the four hundred
                    headrights granted at Cahokia, only twelve were French.46 At the same time the
                    1,300 inhabitants about 
                        Vincennes
                     were almost one-third Americans—from their surnames a Southern Upland blend
                    of Anglo–Scotch–Irish, Germans, and Dutch—and their land grants
                    were scattered throughout the district, not laid out in adjacent rows back from the river in the
                    French manner.47 Although as late as 1815 the population was described as
                    including "many very respectable, intelligent French families in good
                    circumstances"—on Sundays to be seen "coming in crowds from mass and
                    hastening to the race course," ending the day with "dances and
                    balls"–within another ten years a certain "coldness on the part of the
                    Americans," a reaction to French over–friendliness to the Indians with whom they
                    traded, led a number to move to 
                        St. Louis
                     and other more congenial spots, their once neat, flower–gardened houses
                    "out of repair, or shut up."48 "The story,"
                    Philbrick concludes, "is essentially one of the clash of two noncoalescible
                        cultures."49
            
            The modern rationality of the ordinances of the 1780s would likewise subvert the traditional
                    purposes, both familial and communal, of Anglo–American settlers. In a sense the
                    ordinances enticed a population of would–be smallholders and republican citizens into
                    what turned out to be the modern commercial world. Since they came as individual families, a t the
                    most in small groups of relatives and old neighbors, they would have to organize communities
                        themselves.50 Even the 
                        Connecticut
                     settlers of the Western Reserve enjoyed no initial advantage—the opposite if
                    anything.

                     sold the whole tract (a bit larger than the parent state) to

                    tradition remembered it, "fought its way through the wilderness along the township lines
                    until it came to its assigned spot; and there, in the vast loneliness, perhaps fifteen or twenty
                    miles from the nearest neighbors, it chopped out its own hole in the forest…
                        ."52 South of this New 
                        Connecticut
                     the reputedly more individualistic Scotch–Irish were somewhat better
                    favored, at least after 1800 as federal land offices were set up within the territory.
            As long as historians evaluated community as the sum of individual successes, they seldom asked
                    whether the abstract rationality of the ordinances fostered or impeded community. The Old Northwest
                    seemed the quintessential home of democratic, egalitarian community, almost its birthplace (as it
                    was the birthplace of Frederick Jackson Turner), where settlements were united, not divided, by
                    their common individualism. Until recently only one major contrary tendency was recognized: the
                    scope which the absence of any limit to large–scale land speculation opened to
                    profiteering. "By 1855," Paul W. Gates has pointed out, "all the public
                    land in Indiana had been disposed of and yet [because so much of it was held by speculators] vast
                    stretches of the state were totally unimproved."53 The resulting gaps
                    between and within townships, on the Indiana and 
                        Illinois
                     prairies in particular, somewhat delayed communal development.
            Ordinary farmers were also free to buy land beyond their farming needs; such investment evidently
                    seemed less contradictory to them than to the mid–twentieth century historians who
                    discovered they had done so much of it. Even the clubs that some squatters organized after the 1830s
                    to protect their claim to land they could not afford to buy now seem, in Allan G. Bogue's
                    words, to have been "a means of protecting [their speculative] trade in claims rather than
                    [as they asserted] a device to protect the home from the speculator… ."54 That confusion between home and investment came, however, a t a fairly late
                    date in the settlement of the Old Northwest, when the old values had begun to change.
            Before 1840, among the still mainly Southern Upland population of the region, self–seeking
                    enterprise was tempered, as R. Carlyle

                     Buley presented it in his classic study, by the neighborly
                    cooperation of log–rollings, barn–raisings, and husking bees. (Frank L. Owsley
                    painted much the same picture of the same sort of people in the contemporary Old Southwest.)55 Such impressions seemed confirmed by the first of the quantitative local
                    studies, Merle Curti's analysis of settlement of a 
                        Wisconsin county
                     after 1850. Curti concluded that since the mixed Yankee and foreign settlers were
                    generally successful in attaining farm ownership, they did constitute the democratic
                    community—politically active, economically relatively equal, and socially
                    cooperative–of the frontier tradition. The individualistic urge to acquire land was
                    apparently quite compatible with egalitarian community; if anything, it was its essence.56
            
            Impediments to traditional community in the ordinances of the 1780s keep turning up, however. Some
                    are odd but not entirely incidental. The first roads, which often followed Indian trails along the
                    lie of the land—"angling" across the resolutely square sections of the
                    federal survey—had to be relocated, as the sections were occupied, into the
                    right–angled pattern that the present–day air traveler may still observe;
                    sometimes one of the correction lines of the survey forced the road to follow a still more abrupt
                    "offset." This seemed defensible to an engineer in the 1840s, who said that roads
                    should be laid out "on mathematical… [not] on social principles." (From
                    that point of view the mathematics of 1785 had been deficient only in leaving no space between the
                    sections for roads, so that it had to be taken from the property owners on either side.)57 In time, given the new engineering principles of the automobile age, many of
                    the corners would have to be rounded off and the survey sections angled through again.
            Profounder questions have been troubling historians recently, as they push the new local history from
                    medieval and early–modern 
                        England
                     and colonial America into the nineteenth century. Was acquisitive success really what
                    settlers sought in the Old Northwest? If so, did they attain it, and when? What they sought was one
                    thing, predictable enough, given what is now known of their ancestry. Most of them were, like former
                    migrants, of a traditional mentality, concerned to "support by honest Industery,"
                    as a young New Englander expressed it on his way to 
                        Ohio

                     of Spirit and Circumstances which is requisite to Happinesa.58 Happiness meant, above all, the security of the traditional family, even as
                    it cloned itself among the numerous sons of successive generations–too numerous for
                    longer–settled places to contain.
            By far the best available example of a rural community of families of that sort is the settlement
                    along the 
                        Illinois
                     Sugar Creek, a tributary of the Sangamon River, which John Mack Faragher traces from
                    the dispossession of the Kickapoo in 1815 down to the second, Civil War–era generation.
                    The Sugar Creek settlement became a remarkably organic community, in spite of its mixed Yankee,
                    Southern Upland, and foreign population, bound together by a "web of common
                    obligations" into "multiple structures—of association and collective
                    action, of neighborhood and kinship, of belief and ritual," centering around mill and
                    schoolhouse, working together on the township roads, herding livestock on the unclaimed public
                    prairie, driving hogs or wagons to the Alton or 
                        St. Louis
                     market. It took a mere twenty years, by Faragher's account, to transform
                    "a collection of emigrant families into community, with all its attendant harmony and
                    strife"–a community reminiscent of those of Toby Ditz's 
                        Connecticut
                     and Cicely Howell's Leicestershire.59 To be sure, it was a
                    hard–headed, unsentimental sort of community where each farm or artisan family kept
                    strict account of every pennyworth of goods and labor its neighbors owed it, not exactly the
                    selfless, voluntary cooperators of the romantic tradition which previous historians have echoed. (As
                    Faragher notes, Caroline Kirkland, on the 
                        Michigan
                     frontier of the 1830s, knew well enough about this local system of "
                    'change," of poor people so reluctant to recognize any gratuitous help as never to
                    say "thank you.")60 But then, there is no evidence that
                    traditional English or colonial neighbors had been any less hard–headed and
                    unsentimental.
            The Sugar Creek community was also limited—the same thing has been noted
                    elsewhere—to a core of families within the larger local population at any one time, a
                    minority who managed to take root and eventually to intermarry into a web of kinship, while
                    transient individuals and rootless families came and went around them.61 Even
                    that core community was transitory. Along Sugar Creek by the 1850s railroads and commercial
                    agriculture began to split this regrouped traditional community, this briefly renewed

                     "peasant utopia" of autonomous, neighborly
                    near–equals, into modern economic classes—owner-operators, tenant farmers, and
                    an incipient laboring proletariat. Much the same stages of development have been discovered
                    elsewhere, earlier or later in the nineteenth century, among upland 
                        Georgia
                     farmers and a wide variety of Mis-sourians after the Civil War, republican-minded
                    artisans in 
                        New York
                     City before the war and in 
                        Cincinnati
                     thereafter, as well as in a contemporary town some thirty miles from Sugar Creek,
                    Jack-sonville, 
                        Illinois
                    . That sort of change has become a dominant theme of social history.62 What the tradition-minded farmer or artisan had sought to escape, first in Europe, then in
                    the East, was catching up with him—as it is still doing at every auction of a bankrupt
                    farm today.
            But the farmers and artisans were not simply victims. That the settlers themselves were bending
                    tradition to fit modern circumstances is the burden of the most recent research (again following the
                    English lead) into changing patterns of inheritance. Not only did ordinary western farmers treat
                    land as a speculative commodity—"merely an article of trade," as
                    Caroline Kirkland deplored it in 
                        Michigan
                    .63 Also, as Ditz finds in one of the more commercialized towns of 
                        Connecticut
                     around 1820, farmers abandoned the custom of leaving one or more sons enough land for
                    securely independent farms and only items of personal property to the excess sons and to daughters.
                    "Productive property," she concludes, "was no longer used to set up
                    directly some members of the next generation. It provided instead a head start in life …
                    for all children," whether as farmers (perhaps somewhere else than the home farm),
                    businessmen, or professionals.64 This stage, which had taken eight hundred years
                    to reach in 
                        England
                    , took less than two hundred in 
                        Connecticut
                    . It appeared on the frontier of the Old Northwest within fifty years after (though
                    hardly because) fully partible inheritance was written into the Ordinance of 1787.
            By the 1830s "the function of the family holding," as Susan E. Gray shows in her
                    dissertation on certain pioneer 
                        Michigan

                     commercialization, ceased to be the fundamental social

                        Michigan
                     farmers who boasted of mere accumulation—of having "four times as
                    much land as we ever should have owned in York state."66 Most of them
                    were still farmers and heads of families, but no longer of the traditional family farm; it had been
                    modernized, in Gray's words, into "a mutual self-help association" whose
                    members, in their individual zeal for accumulating capital, forgot the old joint concern for the
                    lineal family persisting on its land from generation to generation, to preserve which they had come
                    to America and now to the territory northwest of the River 
                        Ohio
                    .67 The Old Northwest marks the metamorphosis from traditional to
                    modern. For a time in 
                        Ohio
                    , Indiana, and 
                        Illinois
                    , despite whatever the Northwest ordinances lacked in social policy, the settlers may be
                    said to have realized the age-old traditions of family and community (though urban, commercial
                    places, like 
                  Jacksonville, Illinois
               , were modern almost from the outset). By the latter
                    half of the age of rural northwestern settlement, however, as 
                        Michigan
                     and 
                        Wisconsin
                     were occupied, tradition no longer described reality. Americans have been straining
                    ever since to think of commercial agriculture in terms of the family farm.
            What, then, does this celebration of the ordinances of the 1780s commemorate? Were these documents
                    only a program for opening this vast new land to easy acquisition and capital-accumulation? If so,
                    they subverted the ancient ideal of self-reliant families in homogeneous community, to preserve
                    which so many men and women had come. And if there was some aspect of that social tradition that the
                    ordinances did effectively preserve through the nineteenth century, it was what was coming to stand
                    for social homogeneity—not ethnic homogeneity, since no limit was set on who, native or
                    foreign, might come, and not economic classlessness, since men were free to make what they could of
                    their opportunities—but white racial homogeneity. If the antislavery clause of 1787
                    ensured anything, it was—in spite of Governor Arthur Sinclair's loose
                    interpretation of it in the 1790s and efforts in Indiana after 1800 and 
                        Illinois
                     after 1820 to circumvent it—that there would be few blacks in the Old
                    Northwest until the mass migration out of the South in the twentieth century. From the present-day
                    pluralist point of view, a curious thing to celebrate.
            Or should Americans celebrate, candidly, that this was a forward-looking pair of ordinances,
                    anticipating the modern capitalistic

                    was sure to come in the Old Northwest as it had in

                     and was about to come in the East? There is, from that point of view, a notable
                    contrast between the Northwest Ordinance and the Constitution, insofar as the Constitution was
                    designed on classical republican lines, in the same year of 1787, to maintain antique civic virtue
                    in static equilibrium, and was anachronistically fastened onto what was shortly to become a dynamic
                    modern economy and world power. Perhaps the old Congress of the Confederation, that

            The text for the relationship between the citizens of the Northwest Territory and the public domain
                    was set by Sir William Blackstone. "There is nothing which so generally strikes the
                    imagination and engages the affections of mankind," he wrote in his Commentaries, "as the right of property; or that sole and despotic dominion which
                    one man claims and exercises over the external things of the world, to the total exclusion of the
                    right of any other individual in the universe." Blackstone and later others accepted the
                    idea that a "set of words upon parchment" should "convey dominion on
                        land."1 For the first Americans it did, and it still does.
            From the opening of the seventeenth century to the middle of the nineteenth, land was a central theme
                    in American life. For these two-and-one-half centuries, individuals and families in the colonies and
                    later in the independent American nation sought to acquire it; investors (or speculators if you
                    prefer) capitalized on its scarcity to make fortunes; society's values everywhere reflected
                    its influence. Land was simultaneously a commodity and a value system. As a commodity it was
                    symbolized by the search of generation after generation for a "freehold estate,"
                    the tangible form of permanent wealth that might be willed to subsequent generations, a universally
                    acknowledged symbol in most communities of achievement and permanence. Land as value system meant a
                    rural world in which land and land ownership were the dominant economic, social, and political
                    values to which all aspired and in which ownership of land became a bench mark of status, whether in
                    the colonies or, after 1776, in the new American nation.
            From the beginning of settlement in the New World land was a multifaceted, complex business-as befits
                    its significance. For over

                                Studies in the History of the Public Domain (
                                Madison

                     one hundred fifty years and across half a continent,
                    politicians, military leaders, and bureaucrats in Whitehall established institutional forms to give
                    structure and direction to the search for land and to govern its distribution: Indian treaties to
                    extinguish the title of the original inhabitants; crown grants of land to individual court favorites
                    or stock companies; activities by speculators and people of influence in the several colonies; acts
                    and laws by Parliament to regulate land distribution; and numerous court decisions on the terms and
                    circumstances under which land in the colonies might be acquired and sold.
            In 1776 the new independent American nation took over many of these same forms, initially at least
                    with the substantial confusion attending a revolution and the uncertainty associated with
                    inexperience. Within this new proprietorship and responsibility the Ordinance of 1787, in
                    conjunction with the Ordinance of 1785, represented a significant bench mark in the attempt of those
                    who framed policy for the nation to affirm the importance of land in society and to establish the
                    principles that would govern its acquisition by the government and its distribution to the citizens
                    of the Republic. The Ordinance of 1787 also established a new framework of government for the West
                    that reflected much about the influence of land in the colonial world.2
            
            It is this old colonial world that first captures attention, for it provides a context within which
                    to understand the significance and scope of the provisions of the Northwest Ordinance for government
                    and for land distribution west of the mountains. What the Congress and its leaders did in the West
                    reflected the experiences east of the mountains. The first 
                        Virginia
                     colony brought together many of the features that would become associated with land in
                    its many dimensions: a large stock company created for profit; the transition from corporate to
                    individual land ownership; energetic pursuit of freehold estates. The results of these experiences
                    were a dispersed, rural society. The development of tobacco culture as a commercial crop in 
                        Virginia
                     and its rapid spread created a world with growing class distinctions based on land
                    ownership that within two short generations had intensified the rural nature of this world and
                    agrarian values. And these characteristics intensified with the addition of African slave labor. At
                    the same time, stretching toward the West on every hand lay a forested expanse of unclaimed land to
                    which the landless might have recourse in order to realize their own dreams of a freehold estate.3

            The 
                        Virginia
                     experience provided a basis of comparison for the people who followed. The first
                    settlers of New 
                        England
                    , who arrived soon after the Virginians, came from a cohesive group in English society,
                    one with its own values and directions; but it, too, rapidly became a world associated with the
                    possession of land. A community that spoke of itself as "a city on a hill" soon
                    evolved into a series of villages, moving out in ever widening concentric circles into the
                    wilderness. Land was the triggering impulse to settlement and, soon, to social and economic
                    influence. While some land was held in common, substantial portions were parcelled out to the
                    village families, in free tenure, as personal property, without obligations of continuing payment to
                    a landlord and with no quit rents.
            The distribution of lands in the early New 
                        England
                     colonies was based on a desire for continuing community. The difficulty lay in the
                    mechanisms that awarded some families more land than others and in the finite amount of available
                    land. Eventually it was all given out. The solution was the founding of a new town on
                    unclaimed—Indian claims were not considered real claims—lands, where the
                    process of distribution could be repeated with different beneficiaries. During the last years of the
                    seventeenth century the authority of 
                        Puritan
                     leaders to control the acquisition and distribution of land gradually eroded. Lands in
                    the 
                        Puritan
                     domain became an investment opportunity as they had become in other colonies.4
            
            Other systems of land allocation emerged in other colonies: the distribution of large tracts of land
                    to favorites, a system that prevailed along the Hudson and Mohawk rivers where millions of acres of
                    land were granted to men of influence; grants of princely domains to court favorites in the
                    Carolinas, where speculators and settlers alike tried to emulate the 
                        Virginia
                     model, and in some cases succeeded. 
                        Pennsylvania
                     revealed still another kind of land policy in shaping a society. The proprietor,
                    William Penn, decided to distribute lands widely and cheaply with a small annual quit rent.
                    Thousands, eventually hundreds of thousands, accepted his offer and that of his heirs, although few
                    paid the annual rent. The Penns wanted compact settlements, and they believed that their generous
                    terms for distribution of land would allow them to set the settlement patterns of the colony. As a
                    practical matter, the regulations were impossible to enforce and soon ignored.5
            
            By the mid-eighteenth century, then, land had helped to shape several societies in the British
                    colonies in North America, and, as

                    prominent public figures in 
                        England
                     and in the colonies a t all levels of government. Much economic activity revolved
                    around agriculture, and much large-scale investment was associated with lands. Furthermore, lands
                    had become an important measure of social standing and political influence, for by tradition large
                    land owning families were the most prominent socially and only those with landed estates could vote
                    and hold office in most of the colonies.
            Throughout the colonies—on a lower level, far removed from the schemes of large landed
                    entrepreneurs-there was another group with its ambitions linked to land: much of colonial life
                    continued to revolve around the search for a "freehold estate." This was still the
                    symbol of independence and standing in colonial life, the ultimate reward for those who had left the
                    closed land system of the Old World for the universal opportunities for land ownership in the New.
                    It was a search pursued from the stony hills of the New 
                        England
                     upcountry to the tidal marshes of 
                        South Carolina
                    . Indeed, by the middle of the eighteenth century this unending search was one of the
                    common qualities that bound together colonies otherwise separated by much increasing diversity. The
                    historian Wesley Frank Craven wrote of this world and this theme, "Surely, if there was one
                    thing which bound the colonists together in a common experience, it was the necessity they found,
                    most of them at least, to dig their livelihood out of the soil."6
            
            Mixed in with the continuing search for lands was the astonishing growth of the colonies in the
                    generation from 1730 to 1760. Accompanying this growth was an enlarged perception of the scarcity of
                    land and the parallel rise in price and pressure to open up new land. For the first time some men
                    began to talk and others scheme about opening the lands west of the Appalachians. With the higher
                    prices more families settled illegally on lands—or squatted, as the term came to be used.
                    And with growing illegal settlement came clashes with authorities. The argument appeared that these
                    pioneer families by their presence risked their lives to provide a buffer between the established
                    settlements and the hostile Indian tribes. For the squatters the result was a conflict with
                    authorities and owners mixed with demands for compensation for their labors and special
                    consideration in purchasing their lands at a favorable rate. These were all issues and attitudes
                    that would emerge in vivid form in the Ohio Valley in the 1780s and across most
                    of the trans-Appalachian frontier in the first half of the nineteenth century.7

            The American Revolution did not represent a dramatic shift in the sense of priorities, for the
                    changes that emerged did not lessen the importance of land within the several American societies but
                    simply recast the rules for its acquisition and exploitation. The principles of the Revolution, no
                    easy thing to define, may be summarized with respect to land in a negative way: that it was no
                    crusade against private property. In its outbursts against those who were charged with having
                    unfairly monopolized lands (such as the Penns) or in the urge to confiscate the property of
                    loyalists, the revolutionaries confirmed the importance of land in American life, in this case, the
                    life of the new, independent American nation. Presumably, the close of the Revolution simply set the
                    stage for a resumption of the search for a "freehold estate," whether on a large
                    scale by planters or speculators or on a more modest scale by individual pioneer families across the
                    breadth of the colonies.
            Even before the close of the war, the Congress of the Confederation had begun a long struggle to come
                    to terms with the issues dividing the several states, of which one of the most prominent and bitter
                    was that of the western lands. The legacy of colonial charters threatened to divide the states into
                    two camps: those with great landed estates in the interior of the continent as a legacy of their
                    charters, and those without such landed riches. The latter found themselves imprisoned on one side
                    by the Atlantic Ocean and on the other by inflexible boundaries in such a way as to restrict their
                    expansion and so, in a nation of landowners, their growth. In their own minds this restriction
                    condemned them forever to second class status as partners in a shaky union of supposedly equal
                    states.
            The Congress of the Confederation moved to allay these concerns and give the nation a princely legacy
                    by providing for the cession of these western claims. The resolution of October 10, 1780, laid out
                    three principles: first, that the "unappropriated lands" of the states should be
                    "ceded or relinquished"; second, that such cessions should be used "for
                    the common benefit of the 
                        United States
                    "; third, that the lands so settled shall be "formed into distinct
                    republican states, which shall become members of the federal union, and have the same rights of
                    sovereignty, freedom and independence, as the other states."8
            
            Along with the struggle to establish a public domain, which proceeded by fits and starts until the
                    cession of 
                        Virginia
                    's claims in 1784 provided a crowning success, the Confederation Congress had
                    to consider several other influences in dealing with the West in the 1780s. Some of these were long
                    standing; others more immediate.
            One of the long-standing issues was the attitude of responsible officials toward frontier people. It
                    was assumed by those who made 
                  
                     8
                            Journals of the Continental Congress, XVIII, 1780, p. 915.
               
                     policy that the first inhabitants of the distant empire west of
                    the mountains would be a peculiar breed of semicivilized, barbarous individuals and families who had
                    long pioneered in the remote reaches of the forests. During the War of the Revolution the physical
                    presence and fighting services of these families were welcomed as buffers against the Indian menace
                    and the incursions of the Catholic French; in peace time their reputations were of a much different
                    kind. Then they were known for their irresponsibility in economic matters, especially for fleeing
                    debts and ignoring tax agents, for defying the collector of quit rents, for trespassing on private
                    lands without payment or apology, for collectively defying the law and the courts, for disdaining
                    the church and other "civilizing" influences. In the eyes of responsible,
                    sober-minded observers, these people were barbarous and uncivilized. The most common analogy was to
                    the Indian tribes with whom they shared the forest domain.
            It was these frontier people who formed the cast of characters in Conrad Richter's novel,
                        The Trees. Richter's characters called themselves
                    "woodsies," and their presence and character are important, for the Ordinance of
                    1787 had to come to terms with them. Of course, there would be appointed officials with great
                    authority; but these frontier people would form the basis of the society that would emerge in the
                    Old Northwest, and provision must be made to bring them by stages along the road to civilization and
                    responsibility. And presumably by the time of statehood this first generation of frontier people
                    would have recognized and come to respect the law and order in society, or alternatively, they would
                    have been replaced by subsequent generations who would have these desirable characteristics.
            To the character of the people in the West must be added the need to make provision for the orderly
                    disposal of the new public domain and to do it before the pressure of population across the
                    mountains became so large that it could not be controlled and directed. George 
                        Washington
                     wrote of this rush to the West in 1784: "The spirit for emigration is great,
                    people have got impatient, and tho' you cannot stop the road, it is yet in your power to
                    mark the way; a little while and you will not be able to do either." Clashes had taken
                    place between squatters on the northern side of the Ohio River and a detachment
                    of the 
                        United States
                     Army sent to remove them.9
            
            Clearly the representatives of the Congress had to come to terms with the questions of land and
                    government; the two were

                     inexorably intertwined, for land would lead to immigration and
                    immigration demanded a form of government. Thus, the Congress enacted two ordinances, the Ordinance
                    of 1785 for the disposal of the public domain and the Ordinance of 1787, "An Ordinance for
                    the Government of the Territory of the 
                        United States
                    , Northwest-West of the River 
                        Ohio
                    ." Richard Henry Lee announced the adoption of the Northwest Ordinance to
                    George 
                        Washington
                     with an explicit reference to the connection between the two when he wrote that the
                    Ordinance was enacted "preparatory to the sale of the lands. It seemed necessary, for the
                    security of property among uninformed, and perhaps licentious people as the greater part of those
                    who go to there are, that a strong toned government should exist, and the rights of property be
                    clearly defined."10
            
            There was a third consideration. The economic condition of the new, independent nation was weak. The
                    states were struggling under substantial debts and burdened in many places by the spreading disease
                    of paper money. The national government was without funds and without prospects except for the asset
                    of the new public domain. This weakened financial condition helped to shape the time of the passage
                    of the ordinances. Suffice it to say that the Congress of the Confederation had to keep two separate
                    objects in mind: orderly provisions must be made for the sale of these public lands in order to
                    realize a substantial revenue from them; and the public domain should be used to help shape a
                    responsible and orderly society.11
            
            What the Congress of the Confederation proposed in the Northwest Ordinance was a colonial system that
                    raised awkward questions for a nation emerging from a colonial experience. But the colonial aspects
                    of the system, e.g., the supreme authority of the governor and the weak and long-delayed voice of
                    the elected legislature, were muted by a declaration of rights that preserved fundamental freedoms,
                    including trial by jury, noninterference with religion, the right to bail, habeas corpus, and no
                    cruel or unusual punishment. And finally, there was the ultimate prize: admission to the union of
                    states on the basis of equality.12

            The specific provisions of the Northwest Ordinance relating to land and its distribution influenced
                    the nature of the emerging western society and was in turn influenced by it. The first paragraph of
                    the Ordinance was significant in this regard: 
                        Be it ordained by the authority aforesaid, that the estates both of resident and non resident
                            proprietors in the said territory dying intestate shall descend to and be distributed among
                            their children and the descendants of a deceased child in equal parts; the descendants of a
                            deceased child or grand child to take the share of their deceased parent in equal parts
                            among them; and where there shall be no children or descendants then in equal parts to the
                            next of kin in equal degree—and among collaterals the children of a deceased
                            brother or sister of the intestate shall have in equal parts among them their deceased
                            parents share [& there shall in no case be a distinction between kindred of the
                            whole & half blood] … .13
                  
                    
                
            In this passage for "estate" read "land," for this was the most
                    common article of property that might be willed to heirs. The Ordinance, even before enumerating the
                    provisions of the government to be established (presumably its object), took up the question of the
                    inheritance of estates. And what is the judgment? That the estates should be divided equally among
                    all the children. The doctrine of primogeniture, the inheritance of the estate by the eldest in
                    order to preserve the estate as a single economic unit, this legal and social device (and it was
                    both) was ignored in favor of the doctrine of equality.
            Next, the framers of the Ordinance enumerated the officials who would exercise almost dictatorial
                    powers over the citizens of the new American empire—at least during the first formative
                    years before any kind of popular representation. To the appointed governor went powers worthy of any
                    British colonial administrator (whether in America, 
                        Australia
                    , or 
                        India
                    ): to rule by decree; to serve as commander of the militia and appoint other militia
                    officers up to and including the rank of colonel; to lay off counties and townships and appoint
                    necessary officials; and to play a leading role (with three appointed judges) in selecting and
                    publishing such laws as might fit the needs of the infant territory. And preceding this recitation
                    of authority and responsibility was a statement of the governor's new position as landed
                    aristocrat: "he shall reside in the district and have a free-hold estate therein, in one
                    thousand acres of land while in the exercise of this office." For the secretary and the
                    three territorial judges the freehold estate would be five hundred acres under the same terms and
                        circumstances.14
            
            The provisions for these landed estates were pointed reminders of the connection between a
                    "freehold estate" and political and economic power. Here, as elsewhere in the
                    American nation, land would symbolize the political, economic, and social standing of the

                     estate owner; it would give the holder a vested interest in the
                    life and property of the new western world, a landed estate to dilute the sense of an alien and
                    arbitrary appointee arrived among the local citizens to command them in imperial fashion; it would
                    provide a place where the governor could establish the kind of physical presence that would lend
                    honor and authority to the office. And a thousand acres was a substantial estate in the view of the
                    members of the Congress of the Confederation, albeit scarcely a pin-point in the wilderness of the
                    Territory Northwest of the 
                        Ohio
                    .
            Other congressional actions at about the same time suggest both confusion and ambivalence about the
                    estates of the appointed officials of the Northwest Territory. While on the one hand Congress
                    endowed territorial officials with landed estates of five hundred and one thousand acres, with the
                    other it sold landed estates of one-and-one-half millions of acres to a corporate entity known as
                    the 
                        Ohio
                     Company of Associates, another one-and-one-half million to the Scioto Company, and a
                    third sale of one million acres to a 
                        New Jersey
                     entrepreneur named John Cleves Symmes. In taking such action the Congress intended to
                    fulfill another desirable quality of the Northwest Territory, namely to use its landed resources to
                    relieve the financial embarrassments of the national government. Thus, almost simultaneously, the
                    Northwest Ordinance gave its territorial officials a landed estate, and the officials found their
                    estates dwarfed by estates offered to giant land companies and individual land speculators.
            The sale of large tracts to land companies raised attendant issues that related to land in the
                    Territory Northwest of the 
                        Ohio
                    . The judges who accepted judicial office in the Northwest Territory, Samuel Holden
                    Parsons, James 
                        Mitchell
                     Varnum, and John Cleves Symmes himself, had substantial connection with land companies,
                    so much so that in conjunction with the secretary, Winthrop Sargent, the territory was really ruled
                    by a landed oligarchy. An ironic twist of the relationship between political and judicial authority
                    on the one hand and land on the other was that the governor, Arthur St. Clair, who was to become the
                    symbol of authoritarian (even tyrannical) rule, was probably the only person of rank in the
                    territory who was not interested in estate building. As a military man and public
                    servant—he had served a term as president of the Congress of the
                    Confederation—he thought himself above such pedestrian money-grubbing activities. It is
                    curious that his model as public servant and military leader, General George 
                        Washington
                    , was actively involved in land speculation for many years. 
                        Washington
                     always thought of the West in the most practical terms: as a place to make a fortune in
                    land. St. Clair had a large landed estate in western 
                        Pennsylvania
                     that he maintained during his tenure as governor and to which he retired when removed
                    in 1802.15

            Other political and economic leaders in the Northwest Territory did not share St. Clair's
                    indifference to land and landed estates. Whatever their views on representative government and on
                    executive and judicial authority, the most prominent political figures in the territory were large
                    landholders. Foremost among them was Thomas Worthington, late of 
                        Virginia
                    , who would become the leader of the opposition faction. Even as Worthington and St.
                    Clair clashed over issues of representation, republican values, economic development, and executive
                    authority, Worthington's large landed estate would sharply contrast with the
                    governor's spartan lifestyle.16Another aspect of the Ordinance that
                    relates to the public domain was the issue of property qualifications for officeholders and voters.
                    The Ordinance laid out three stages from territory to statehood. In the first stage the appointed
                    governor ruled by decree. In the second stage, when the district had five thousand free male
                    inhabitants over the age of twenty-one (presumably a category to assess the militia under arms),
                    then "free male inhabitants… [might] elect representatives from their counties
                    or townships to represent them in the general assembly … ."17
            
            The Ordinance next established specific requirements for participation in this political process,
                    either as voter or as officeholder. The document read: 
                        provided that no person be eligible or qualified to act as a representative unless he shall
                            have been a citizen of one of the 
                                United States
                             three years and be a resident in the district or unless he shall have resided
                            in the district three years and in either case shall likewise hold in his own right in fee
                            simple two hundred acres of land within the same; provided also that a freehold in fifty
                            acres of land in the district… shall be necessary to qualify a man as an elector
                            of a representative.18
                  
                     These requirements looked back to a widely held principle of the colonial period, namely,
                    that only property holders should stand for office and exercise the franchise, and the commonly
                    accepted form of property to establish eligibility for political participation in society was landed
                    property.
            The property requirement stamped the Northwest Ordinance as a traditional document, traditional in
                    the sense that it perpetuated landed property requirements of the colonial period. Although the
                    reasoning is not specific here, the drafters of the document might have been swayed by the widely
                    held views of the irresponsible character of the western people, those barbarians and savages (men
                    and women) who lived across the mountains in a state of nature.

                     That people lived in such circumstances, without respect for
                    laws or courts or property, was not a recommendation to exercise the vote.
            The practical results of this property requirement were not clear, but such qualifications surely
                    reduced the numbers eligible to exercise the franchise, perhaps by as many as half. And aside from
                    the issue of whether the requirement was stringently enforced, there was always the question of how
                    the prospective voter came into possession of a freehold estate of fifty acres and could prove
                    possession in such a manner as to satisfy the law. In the Territory Northwest of the 
                        Ohio
                     settlers who proposed to purchase land might do so from one of the three private land
                    companies or from the national government under terms laid down in the Ordinance of 1785. Titles
                    from land companies were uncertain. This was especially so in the case of Symmes, a kind and
                    good-hearted man who nonetheless sold much land to which he did not have clear title. Congress
                    eventually passed a law to redress some of his worst lapses.19
            
            In the case of the federal government the effective operation of the Ordinance of 1785, delayed at
                    best, required much additional tinkering before an orderly system evolved under which settlers might
                    find their way to a convenient land office and make practical arrangements under easily understood
                    rules that would bring them a clear title. And when Governor St. Clair finally permitted the
                    territory to move to the second stage of government, he had to modify the fifty-acre freehold
                    requirement, for many frontiersmen did not hold a clear title to their lands. In the end St. Clair
                    permitted adult males with town lots or houses worth fifty acres of land t o exercise the franchise,
                    but he upheld the principle of the Ordinance that property and the franchise went hand in hand.20
            
            Finally, there was the question of the powers of the district, territory, and state (admitted under
                    the provisions of the Ordinance) over the public lands. The Ordinance was quite precise about this
                    question. After declaring that the legislature of the district might levy and collect taxes, the
                    text continued: 
                        The Legislatures of those districts, or new States, shall never interfere with the primary
                            disposal of the Soil by the 
                                United States
                             in Congress Assembled, nor with any regulations Congress may find necessary for
                            securing the title in such soil to the bong fide purchasers. No tax shall be imposed on
                            lands the property of the 
                                United States
                            ; and in no case shall non Resident proprietors be taxed higher than
                                Residents.21
                  
                    
                
            It was a significant statement that touched several areas. To begin with, new states would enter the

                     lands, which would remain the property of the federal
                    government. Thus, new states had achieved a measure of political equality with the old under the
                    terms of the Ordinance, but even with statehood they were still at the mercy of the national
                    government in the disposal of their lands. In short, the new states lost the right to make vital
                    decisions about what might be a substantial portion of their own landed territory, areas that they
                    might have offered at a reduced price or simply given away in the interest of putting settlers on
                    the lands. This provision was a reaffirmation of the idea accepted as national policy, namely, that
                    the public lands were a great national resource the sale of which would alleviate present debts and
                    future expenditures. It was an attitude that persisted until well after the Civil War. The
                    provisions that prohibited the states and territories from taxing the public domain was a further
                    statement of this policy, one that enriched the nation at the expense of the new territory or state.
                    And, finally, the declaration that non-resident proprietors might be taxed at no higher rate than
                    residents confirmed the public domain as an investment for distant entrepreneurs.
            Taken together, these principles severely handicapped some of the first public land states such as 
                        Michigan
                     and 
                        Arkansas
                     where settlement was exceptionally slow because of their physical isolation off the
                    routes of immigration and the greater attraction of public lands elsewhere. And this issue assumed
                    something of a crisis proportion in the late nineteenth century, when the rise of the conservation
                    movement led to the establishment in several western states of vast public reserves that could not
                    be sold and, by thus restricting settlement and economic development, doomed these states to remain
                    only partially settled. The modern antecedents of the hostility to this provision are alive in the
                    "sage brush rebellion," a movement for the cession of the public land reserves to
                    the states wherein they lie or, at the very least, the opening of these reserves for economic
                        development.22
            
            But these results lay in the future. In expectations and realities the Ordinance of 1787 (taken in
                    conjunction with the Ordinance of 1785) opened opportunities for a "freehold
                    estate" or economic opportunity to both settlers and speculators. Numerous families of this
                    first generation of American independence pursued the "freehold estate" with the
                    same intensity as had their parents and grandparents as the avenue to economic independence and
                    social advantage. Later, their children would search for lands in 
                        Iowa
                     and their grandchildren in 
                        Kansas
                     and great-grandchildren in the lotteries of South Dakota in the twentieth century. The

                        Ohio
                     offered a variety of terms and a wide range of settings. There were three land
                    companies in the land business: the federal government, which merchandised lands in the Seven
                    Ranges; the 
                        Connecticut
                     Western Reserve in the far northeastern part of the territory; and the 
                        Virginia
                     Military Tract in the central part of the territory stretching south to the 
                        Ohio
                    . The Territory Northwest of the 
                        Ohio
                     (later the state of 
                        Ohio
                    ) was a museum of schemes for land distribution. What the Northwest Ordinance gave to
                    those settlers who wished to purchase was the assurance of a stable and orderly government, with
                    townships and counties, set in the context of guarantees of certain fundamental rights such as
                    habeas corpus and trial by jury. Finally, the provision for admission to the Union on the basis of
                    equality meant that settlers would not be part of a permanent colonial system-although those who
                    lived in the territories of 
                        New Mexico
                     and 
                        Utah
                     at the end of the nineteenth century could be pardoned for thinking their territorial
                    status was a well-nigh permanent one.
            To speculators the Ordinance offered assurances through legal institutions for the safety of their
                    investment and the prospect of security and growth to the settlers who purchased from them. For the
                    entrepreneurs the western country in 1787 must have seemed a golden opportunity. When the American
                    government had made good its claims of sovereignty against the English and quieted Indian claims,
                    the opportunities for judicious investment stretched forth on every hand. For this group the
                    "freehold estate" was an opportunity to make a fortune through investment. The
                    Ordinance was a mark of government support in their enterprises. Beyond settlers and speculators a
                    third group demands attention. The American Indian might have found in the Ordinance a firebell in
                    the night (to borrow Thomas Jefferson's phrase), for this document represented a statement
                    of cultural confidence that assumed that the Indians would be brushed aside. In the aftermath of the
                    American Revolution the Native Americans now found themselves enmeshed in the world of American
                    legal doctrines. True, the Ordinance declared in its third article: 
                        the utmost good faith shall always be observed towards the Indians; their land and property
                            shall never be taken from them without their consent; and in their property, rights and
                            liberty, they never shall be invaded or disturbed, unless in just and lawful wars authorised
                            by Congress; but laws founded in justice and humanity shall from time to time be made, for
                            preventing wrongs being done to them, and for preserving peace and friendship with them.23
                  
                     Yet the future outlined for them was a chilling one. The Ordinance was a blueprint for an
                    American empire in the interior of the continent, 
                  
                     23 Carter, Territorial Papers, II, 47.
               
                     a carpet of settlement and territories (later states) that would
                    unroll from east to west. Indeed, the Ordinance was based on the premise of Anglo-American
                    settlement in the interior of the continent. Whatever the pious declarations of the Ordinance, the
                    assumptions were plainly laid out: it was that Americans would take the land and organize it
                    according to the model described therein for the benefit of its citizens.
            In looking forward from 1787 through the nineteenth century and into the twentieth at the
                    relationship of the Northwest Ordinance to the public domain and the expansion of the American
                    continental empire, two separate questions attract attention. The first is the influence of land and
                    land titles in territories with substantial foreign antecedents. It is striking how many of these
                    there are. For the first half of the nineteenth century 
                  Louisiana, Missouri, Michigan
               , and 
                        Florida
                     can be counted, not t o mention the residue of old French claims in 
                        Illinois
                     and Indiana. It required years of work to sort out. the validity of these foreign land
                    grants, to balance justice against the clear examples of human greed, to try to bridge the confusion
                    of different cultural and alien legal systems (in the case of the French and Spanish). In the Far
                    West in the period after the Civil War, the territory of 
                        New Mexico
                     was especially noteworthy for the systematic looting of its lands by public officials.
                    This story is a reminder that the Ordinance became the law of the land for a variety of
                    non-Anglo-American peoples, who had not read or who did not subscribe to the doctrines of Sir
                    William Blackstone.24
            
            In the final analysis the Northwest Ordinance established the ground rules for an American empire in
                    the West. It was an empire based on land: land seized from the Indians, surveyed, and parcelled out
                    to the citizens of the Republic, that they might learn responsibility through land ownership, that
                    they might participate in the political process, that they might continue the search for a
                    "freehold estate" that had occupied so much of their time since the opening of the
                    seventeenth century.

            Public Education in the Old Northwest: "Necessary to Good Government and the Happiness of

            The Northwest ordinances have long been regarded as the founding documents of public education in the
                    Old Northwest. Two clauses account for this reputation, one in the 1785 ordinance and the other in
                    the 1787 ordinance. The fist specified the ways in which the settlers should support education, and
                    the second defined the purposes of education in a republic. The 1785 ordinance declared that one
                    section in each township had to be set aside for the support of public schools. The land was to be
                    rented to a settler, and the proceeds used to pay for schools. (Thus, the school lands were not
                    necessarily the land on which the school was built.) The 1787 ordinance reinforced that commitment
                    to education by including the now-famous clause explaining the purposes of education in the new
                    territory: "Religion, morality and knowledge, being necessary to good government and the
                    happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged."1
            
            These clauses have a time-honored place in books about the history of education. Ellwood P.
                    Cubberley's immensely popular 1919 textbook quotes the 1787 clause and then explains:
                    "This provision, and the ultimate settlement of the territory largely by people of New 
                        England
                     stock, settled the future attitude as to public education" in the region.
                    "These gifts by Congress… of national lands for the endowment of public
                    education, though begun in large part as a land-selling proposition, helped greatly in the early
                    days to create a sentiment for state schools… and did much to enable

                    the parochial or charity schools of the older States to the east."2
            
            When historians got down to the ground level and examined how the settlers managed the school lands,
                    however, they found that the system did not work very well. Consequently, alongside the adoring
                    references to the ordinances as the cornerstone of public education are seemingly contradictory
                    accounts about their failure. There were several problems with the school land system. In an area of
                    abundant cheap land there were few customers for rental property. At the outset the land was
                    unimproved, so it was often rented at no charge simply on the agreement that the occupant would
                    improve the land over the years. For example, a contract for the school land in Ames, 
                        Ohio
                    , in 1801 specified that Hugh Boyle would have the land rent free for seven years on
                    condition that he clear eighteen acres, including some for orchard, some for meadow, and some for
                        pasture.3 Such arrangements were often poorly enforced; much of the land
                    went unrented; and territorial legislatures pressed Congress for permission to sell school lands
                    instead of renting them. Congress granted such permission in 1826, but this procedure did not work
                    much better than the rental system. Often the lands sold very cheaply, and the modest profits
                    languished in state school funds that were prone to collapse in economic crises. These funds were
                    also vulnerable to fraud and diversion, which occurred frequently in a region where people were
                    starved for investment capital and eager to construct expensive canals and railroads.
            As the echoes of the Northwest Ordinance's ringing statement about education became fainter,
                    school advocates realized that the modest funds from the school lands would have little impact on
                    local schools. In 
                        Ohio
                     the legislature sold the school lands to the existing tenants at cheap rates and
                    frequently forgave towns found guilty of misappropriating school funds. The exasperated state
                    auditor said in 1843, "There seems to be no end to the plunder upon this fund."4 A history of the school land grants written in 1885 cites embezzlements, hasty
                    sales, illegal use of the funds to lessen taxation, bad investments, faulty and dishonest
                    management, and public indifference as reasons for the paltry revenues of the school lands.5 Some townships, of course, actually derived proceeds

            Thus the story begins with a seeming paradox: the education provisions of the Northwest ordinances
                    were immensely important but had almost no effect on education in the Old Northwest. Traditional
                    historians of education have argued in considerable detail, on the one hand, that the ideas of the
                    Northwest ordinances provided the impetus for public education in the region and, on the other hand,
                    that the particular system of support through school lands was bedeviled by indifference, fraud, and
                    delay.
            When writing about education and the Northwest ordinances, recent historians have reacted variously
                    to these contrasting themes. Some, like Dennis Denenberg, writing in 1979, ignore the difficulties
                    with the school lands and merely assert that the ordinances were immensely important and effective.
                    Citing a 1916 textbook, Denenberg endorses the view that because of the North-west ordinances
                    "no other newly occupied country in the whole world's history has ever seen
                    schools established so nearly coincident to the first settlements, nor schools of so high an order
                    in so short a time."6
            
            A more accurate and sophisticated view, one that could be called neotraditional, is held by David
                    Tyack, Thomas James, and Aaron Benavot, who emphasize that Congress attempted to use land grants to
                    support common public schools throughout the nineteenth century. Whether the system was effective or
                    not in the early national period, Congress continued to use such leverage to try to persuade new
                    states to provide elementary education. This common tactic reflected a consensus for widespread
                    education that found its way into state constitutions. There were endless disagreements over how public schools should be provided, "but," say Tyack, James,
                    and Benavot, "on the value of diffusing knowledge through public schools there was
                    substantial agreement… ."7 Tyack also emphasizes that after
                    the Civil War the new territories of the Far West implemented the same system with a good deal more
                    effectiveness, receiving as much as 10 percent of their local school monies from land-grant
                        funds.8 And surely a similar land-grant tactic worked even more successfully
                    with the land-grant colleges.

            Another historical point of view is provided by social historians, who try to get beyond the rhetoric
                    of the ordinances to discover what kind of education was actually provided by families, local
                    communities, and churches during the first three generations of settlement, when the land ordinances
                    and other state efforts had very little effect. They turn to local records and memoirs to try to
                    find out what schools were like, how they were supported, what was taught, and what the local
                    participants thought about them.
            There are, then, two histories of education in the Old North-west, one about the gradual development
                    of laws that provided free schools—that is, the political history of
                    education—and the other about the actual education of children during the seventy years
                    or so that passed without free public schools—that is, the social history of education. I
                    would like to illustrate these two histories by looking briefly at six people who were involved in
                    common school education, three advocates of state action and three teachers.
            Manasseh Cutler of 
                        Massachusetts
                     was a founder of the 
                        Ohio
                     Company and its main agent to Congress in 1787. In the 1785 land ordinance proposed by
                    Jefferson, Congress had already established the system of orderly, rectangular townships, with one
                    section reserved for the support of education. This occurred before Cutler got involved, but the New
                    Englander is widely credited with the statement about the purposes of education in the 1787
                    ordinance. Some historians view the education provisions of the Northwest ordinances as mere sales
                    features, thrown in to attract potential buyers by a Congress eager to sell federal lands on the
                    frontier, but Cutler illustrates the way in which those commercial motives were woven together with
                    concerns about how to recreate republican society on the frontier. In addition to his activities on
                    behalf of the 
                        Ohio
                     Company, Cutler was a minister, a schoolteacher, a physician, and an amateur botanist.
                    He was a capitalist and a scholar, a land speculator and a renaissance man, 
                        Massachusetts
                    's answer to Benjamin 
                        Franklin
                    . It is fair to say that the education clause was not mere window dressing to Cutler; he
                    was not just a land speculator but also the keeper of a n academy for boys in Ipswich, 
                        Massachusetts
                    , and a n assiduous member of the town's school inspection committee. As such,
                    he was minutely involved in the evaluation of textbooks and the examination of teachers.9
            
            It is not surprising, then, that Cutler, like Jefferson, saw an important role for education in the
                    orderly settlement of the West and in the transplanting of republican politics across the
                    Appalachians. One could not just send people into the wilderness; one had to send institutions, a
                    government, a plan. As Cutler explained in 
                  
                     9 William P. Cutler and Julia P. Cutler, Life, Journals
                                and Correspondence of Reverend Manasseh Cutler, LL.D. … (2 vols., 
                                Cincinnati
                            , 1888), I, 452-53.
               
                     his first sermon in Marietta, 
                        Ohio
                    , in 1788, "an early attention to the instruction of youth is of the greatest
                    importance to a new settlement. It will lay the foundations for a well regulated society. It is the
                    only way to make subjects conform to its laws and regulations from principles of reason and custom
                    rather than the fear of punishment."10 As a scientist, Cutler also said
                    that he welcomed "the opportunity of opening a new and unexplored region for the range of
                    natural history, botany, and the medical science … ."11
            
            Cutler embodies two tensions. First, the quest for private gain through speculation could conflict
                    with the public interest in an expanding republic. Like many leaders of territorial expansion,
                    however, Cutler saw private gain and the public interest as complementary. The leading landholders
                    would serve the public interest by developing the region and by establishing necessary institutions.
                    Second, Cutler's educational thought contained the contrasting ideals of liberty and order.
                    Nonetheless, like many educational leaders of the Revolutionary generation, Cutler saw discipline
                    and knowledge as prerequisites for virtue, and he believed that republicanism could only work in a
                    nation of virtuous citizens. Although easterners shared a negative image of the brutalizing
                    tendencies of the frontier, they also expressed, in theory at least, the optimistic vision of an
                    unspoiled civilization starting over again in a new environment. Thus, Cutler ventured,
                    "there will be an advantage which no other part of the earth can boast, and which probably
                    will never occur again; that, in order to begin right, there will be no wrong habits to combat, and no inveterate systems to overturn—there is
                    no rubbish to remove before laying the foundation.12 Thus, it was extremely
                    important to leap in and educate youth properly from the start.
            It is interesting that Jefferson shares credit with Cutler for the education policy of the Northwest
                    ordinances—Jefferson for creating the school lands and Cutler for stating the purposes of
                    education—because, of course, although their politics differed in other regards, both men
                    were prominent supporters of state involvement in common school education. Neither in
                    Jefferson's 
                        Virginia
                     nor in Cutler's 
                        Massachusetts
                    , however, did state school systems gain much support in legislatures or among the
                    public in the early national period. Nowhere in the East were common schools entirely free from
                    tuition charges, and nowhere did state governments regulate local public schools. Thus, although the
                    Northwest ordinances' school land scheme was based on the old English idea of devoting land
                    rents to educational purposes, it was quite innovative in the context 
                  
                     10
                            Ibid., 345.

                     of American education because it suggested a strong role for the
                    state. As in the East, however, state-sponsored free schools in the territories did not enjoy a very
                    high priority, nor much success.13
            
            Various leaders in the Northwest echoed the sentiments of Cutler and Jefferson, but their statements
                    on behalf of education were often perfunctory or ignored. Rufus 
                        Putnam
                    , one of the founding pioneers and a proprietor of the 
                        Ohio
                     Company, complained in 1800 that there was "no public spirit to be found
                    … except only in the proprietors of the 
                        Ohio
                     Company"; and Thomas Worthington, author of 
                        Ohio
                    's first constitution, warned that uneducated children would be
                    "unable to manage with propriety, their private concerns, much less to take any part in the
                    management of public affairs," because they would be "unacquainted with those
                    religious and moral precepts and principles, without which they cannot be good
                        citizens."14 For most settlers, however, the impluse to promote
                    common schools through state action did not have much urgency in the early decades. Indeed, it was
                    widely resisted by settlers who had very little hard currency even in good times.15
            
            Cutler's son Ephraim was a stalwart in promoting the cause of education in 
                        Ohio
                    . He illustrates the frustrations as well as the accomplishments of the education
                    crusaders among the first generation of settlers born in the region. His journal reflects firsthand
                    experience at building the kind of communities his father had envisioned. He helped found Ames, 
                        Ohio
                    , and he reported to his father that getting reliable, permanent settlers on plots in
                    orderly towns and renting out the school lands was hard work.16 Nonetheless, he
                    said, "schools of an elevated character were soon established. In 1801, my cousin, Moses
                    Everett, taught a school in a room in my house." Other teachers followed; most taught
                    subscription schools, for which each inhabitant signed up to pay for as much education as they
                    wanted or could afford for their children. A town library was developed, and Cutler declared
                    optimistically that the young men educated under such circumstances "all have been useful
                    and respectable citizens."17 After the death of his first wife in 1807
                    Cutler remarried and settled in 
                  Warren, Ohio
               , where, from 1810 on, there was a
                    subscription school and Sunday school. The schools were "liberally supported,"
                    according to Cutler, and were taught by men of "intelligence" and "good
                    sense" or by women "both refined and

                     cultivated."18 In some communities,
                    then, schools sprang up through local initiative, without dependence on any proceeds from the school
                    lands.
            But not all communities had an Ephraim Cutler, or available schoolteachers, or sufficient population
                    to support a school; and when Cutler joined with others to try to press school development
                    throughout the territory, he ran into an endless string of obstacles. At first he was appointed one
                    of seven commissioners of the school lands in the whole territory. These men started optimistically
                    enough but found that rental arrangements were very irregular from one town to the next, and, in any
                    case, profits were insufficient for any substantial support of common schools. By 1818 Ephraim
                    Cutler was on a committee in the state legislature to devise a general school system, but efforts at
                    reform resulted only in an ineffective, non-mandatory bill for common schools in 1821. Although
                    there was resistance to taxation of individual property, reformers decided they had to move in that
                    direction because, as Rufus 
                        Putnam
                     wrote to Cutler in 1822, it had "been said again and again, that these public
                    [school] lands were of no real value, that the time expended in legislating upon them cost the state
                    more than they were worth."19 Caleb Atwater complained that
                    "scarcely a dollar" had been generated for schools, and an 1824 report to the
                    legislature called the land-renting scheme "wholly unavailing."20 After working to get a general property tax plan through the legislature in 1824, Cutler
                    and Nathan Guilford managed to get a mandatory school law passed in 1825. It was imperfect and weak,
                    but a start. Twenty-three years had elapsed since Ephraim Cutler had inserted his father's
                    words about education into 
                        Ohio
                    's first constitution. Standing next to Guilford in the legislature after the
                    passage of the 1825 law, Cutler said, "Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace,
                    according to thy word, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation."21 But
                    even this law had loopholes and went largely unenforced. It remained for reformers in the 1830s,
                    1840s, and 1850s to construct state laws that actually guaranteed the establishment of public
                    schools in every part of the state.
            The fate of the school land system was similar in other states of the territory, and legislation
                    designed to create state systems of schools followed a similar pattern everywhere. First, there were
                    half-hearted efforts to make the school land system work better, then permissive legislation
                    encouraging towns to divide into districts

                    systems, and then, in the 1840s and 1850s, as in the East, legislation that created somewhat more
                    active state supervision and made free schooling mandatory, ending tuition charges to parents.22
            
            Caleb Mills of Indiana belongs to the generation of school reformers who forged these first state
                    systems by persuading their legislatures to adopt mandatory property taxation for free common
                    schooling and to appoint state school superintendents to recommend legislation and monitor
                    educational developments. Like many of the school reformers of the 1840s, Mills was a minister by
                    training, a New Englander by birth, and a Whig in politics. He was first sent to the West as a
                    missionary for the American Sunday School Union. He moved to Indiana in 1833 and became professor of
                    languages and head of the normal school at 
                        Wabash
                     College in 
                        Crawfordsville
                    . His campaign for an improved common school bill in Indiana began in 1846 when he wrote
                    an open letter to the legislature bemoaning the high rate of illiteracy in the state and urging
                    Indiana to adopt a tax-based free school system like those in 
                  New York, Ohio
               , and 
                        Michigan
                    , which he held up as models. How much had Indiana taxed its people for schools, Mills
                    asked; and he answered his own question, "I will state it in round
                    numbers, $0.000.00." 23 There was resistance elsewhere to
                    taxation for schooling, he argued, but legislatures went ahead anyway. If they waited for a
                    "harmony of views and sentiments" among the voters, he said, they "would
                    never effect anything great and noble." 24 Mills's letter was
                    sent anonymously; he signed it only as "One of the People." Published in the
                    newspapers at the same time that it was delivered to the legislature, the letter received much
                    attention, but it got no immediate concrete results. Consequently, Mills submitted another anonymous
                    letter the next year. In the meantime, activists in the cause of education began to hold annual
                    conventions, which also pressured the legislature. The next General Assembly responded by putting
                    the question to the people of the state in a referendum. About 56 percent of the voters favored a
                    free school system. In 1848, in his third message to the legislature, Mills argued that many of the
                    negative votes came from areas where residents were below the general average in adult literacy and
                    thus probably did not understand the issue very well. This argument was typical of free-school

                     advocates, who often denigrated the opposition as either
                    ignorant or mean-spirited. Textbook writers took up this theme in the early twentieth century,
                    portraying opponents of school reform in the 1840s and 1850s as selfish, bigoted, and undemocratic.
                    Recently, however, a somewhat more sympathetic view of the opponents to free public schools has
                    emerged. Some of the opposition may have resulted from simple unwillingness to pay taxes, but it
                    must be remembered that most people at the time considered education to be the responsibility of
                    parents, churches, and local town meetings. There was some opposition in principle to central
                    authority. State-regulated, free public school systems did cost something in terms of diversity and
                    local control, and some people in the nineteenth century could see it coming. (Personally, I believe
                    that it was worth the price, on balance; but to read present-day policy preferences backward in time
                    and to take sides in policy debates of over a century ago on the basis of today's values is
                    to risk misunderstanding what was going on.)
            The Indiana legislature responded to the narrow referendum victory for common schools with another
                    weak law in 1849. Then, in 1852, after some more prodding by Mills and yet another statewide
                    referendum, as well as a new constitution that mandated attention t o education, legislators
                    expanded and bolstered the education law, finally providing free schools supported by taxes and
                    supervised by a state superintendent of schools. Mills even served as state superintendent of common
                    schools from 1854 to 1857, only to see the state supreme court rule in 1854 that the property tax
                    support for schools was unconstitutional. The taxing power was not restored until 1867. By then
                    Mills had retired from the field, leaving further system-building to younger men, while he built up
                    the library at 
                        Wabash
                     College. One wonders whether he often recalled the remark he made in a letter in 1833,
                    before he even moved to Indiana: "public sentiment must be changed in regard to free
                    schools… . Though it is the work of years, yet it must and can be done."25 Mills's career demonstrates the difficulty in devising a system to
                    pay for public schools to replace the ineffective land grants of the Northwest ordinances. It took
                    generations to overcome the pervasive resistance to state-sponsored schooling, and in this regard
                    the Old Northwest was no different from the Northeast. Anyone who believes that opposition to
                    publicly funded free schooling was found only among southerners and Catholics misunderstands the
                    origins of public education. The controversy also involved fights between localists and centralists,
                    between Democrats and Whigs,

                     between egalitarians and pluralists. Eventually the people who
                    shared Mills's ideas prevailed, but what was actually happening in education during all
                    those decades while reformers were trying to establish state school systems?
            A look at the experiences of three frontier teachers helps to provide an answer.
            Born in 1819 in upstate 
                        New York
                    , Sarah Pratt and her five sisters got enough education in the local schools to become
                    school-teachers themselves. Their parents, though of modest means, valued education. When Pratt was
                    twenty-five, she and her sister Susannah traveled to 
                        Wisconsin
                     to spend some time with an older sister who had married and moved there. As it turned
                    out, Pratt spent a few years in 
                        Wisconsin
                    , teaching in neighborhood schools in order to support herself. She kept a diary, a
                    transcript of which is in the 
                        Wisconsin
                     State Historical Society in 
                        Madison
                    . If one is interested in what went on inside district schoolhouses, one is struck by
                    how little Sarah Pratt said about it in her diary. She wrote matter-of-factly about school from day
                    to day—how many scholars showed up, when the weather interrupted, when inspectors
                    came—but she displayed no anxiety about school and rarely elaborated on the details of
                    her pedagogy or her relationships with students. She apparently took this part of her life for
                    granted and wrote with more fervor about religion, loneliness, and natural beauty. Schooling on the
                    frontier was a mundane activity, subject to cancellation due to the lack of a teacher, the illness
                    of a teacher, bad weather, parents' lack of money, or parents' need for their
                    children's labor—all of which Pratt recorded from time to time. She mentioned
                    with pleasure visits by parents or her sister at her school, said she kept an extra spelling school
                    after school or in the evening occasionally, and occasionally expressed her satisfaction with her
                    students, usually near the beginning or end of a term. "I have an excellent
                    school," she wrote in February, 1845. "They all strive to make me but little
                    trouble and the progress they are making in their studies is a satisfaction to me as well as to
                    their parents." 26 In June of 1847 she admitted that she thought she
                    might be lonely in a new summer school situation with only twelve younger scholars: "I had
                    fancied myself much loneliness in the employment this summer in teaching a school so small and not
                    very far advanced in science. But I … think they progress fast and the anticipations that
                    I have of seeing them finely advanced at the close of the term are quite pleasing to me."
                        27
            
            Pratt boarded around the district with parents who received free schooling for one child in return
                    for her room and board. This

                     made for a very transient existence, and Pratt often treated her
                    school as a sort of home, writing letters there before school would start. Her diary makes it clear
                    that she moved frequently and sometimes did not know on a given day where she would be staying the
                    next night. Nonetheless, except for the long distance she sometimes had to walk to school, she made
                    no complaints about the boarding arrangements.
            Pratt's diary includes names of individual students who were out occasionally for illness or
                    work. At one point no one showed up because of rain and mud; at another she dismissed her school
                    because most of the students were out picking strawberries.28 Still, there were
                    two terms per year of several weeks each, one in summer and one in winter, and the attendance was
                    generally good. Although Pratt wrote casually about teaching, it would seem that her presence on the 
                        Wisconsin
                     frontier exposed her students to a fairly well educated young woman, gentle and
                    concerned, a person who took great pleasure in reading herself and worked hard to be a competent
                    teacher. In 1847 Sarah Pratt died in 
                        Wisconsin
                     during a fever epidemic; thus she never returned to her native 
                        New York
                    .
            Mary Roper, another teacher who emigrated to the West, was part of an organized effort to civilize
                    the frontier through training and exporting young women from New 
                        England
                     to areas that needed district schoolteachers. Some residents of the Northwest welcomed
                    this effort; others resented and resisted it. Roper unfortunately ran into lots of the folks who
                    resisted. She was recruited and trained at 
                  Hartford,
                            Connecticut
               , by the National Popular
                    Education Board, a missionary group founded by Catharine Beecher in the 1840s. In 1852 she was
                    assigned to Mill Point, 
                        Michigan
                    , a community of four hundred composed largely of immigrants who worked at a steam mill.
                    Roper wrote back to 
                        Hartford
                    : "There are only four families in the place of intelligence. A few other
                    families possess influence but are bad men." The town was divided, it seems. Some wanted
                    another pious eastern teacher to replace the one they had had the previous year; but, commented
                    Roper, "the other party said ‘they had had a pious teacher long
                    enough… ." A rival school was begun, and, according to Roper, "a lady,
                    destitute of religious principle was hired to teach the children of the dissatisfied ones."
                    "No effort," she complained, "was left untried to injure my
                    school… . They cautiously circulated suspicions of my good character," then,
                    with more boldness, asserted "the most indecent stories." Furthermore, she stated,
                    "Attempts have been made repeatedly upon members of my school, to induce them to find fault
                    with school, and leave it for the other, but never have they in but one instance succeeded, and that
                    was the case of two Dutch [German] 
                  
                     28
                            Ibid., 62, 63.
               
                     boys of passionate tempers … [and] their absence was
                    an advantage rather than a loss." She wrote of the support of a Mr. Smith, her patron on
                    the school committee, and his efforts to fend off assaults on his own character. Nonetheless, she
                    said, "I am firmly attached to my scholars, and I think I can say that they are to
                        me."29
            
            By June of the following year, however, things had taken a turn for the worse. Roper's
                    enrollment was down to half its original size, though the only fault she then said her opponents
                    attributed to her was that she loved her scholars too much and hit them too little. Still, the
                    opposition had become so "violent" that Mr. Smith decided not to hire her back,
                    and, on top of that, her strength had been sapped by the ague. She wrote to her sponsors in 
                        Hartford
                     for advice. 30 They apparently told her to give up and return to
                    the East, because the next year, in July of 1854, she wrote from her home in Templeton, 
                        Massachusetts
                    , saying "my health is now reestablished and my desire to be active somewhere
                    brings home the question, where I can best labor?" She asked to be assigned again to the
                    West. 31 Plucky and pious, Mary Roper was just what the National Popular
                    Education Board wanted, and perhaps her next assignment was more successful. Unfortunately, she
                    disappears from the record with this request that she be returned t o the frontier.
            Unlike Pratt and Roper, Rebecca Russel was born in the Northwest. A young 
                        Quaker
                     woman whose diary is preserved in the Indiana Historical Society in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , Russel attended common schools in West Newton, Indiana, until she was fourteen. She
                    then enrolled a t higher schools in 
                        Beech Grove
                    , Valley Mills, and the preparatory department of Earlham College. After a
                    year's teaching in Spring Valley, she taught a year in her home town of West Newton, where
                    her father was a school trustee. It was during this year, 1860--1861, that she kept a diary, a diary
                    that reveals much more about classroom practices than does Sarah Pratt's. Russel writes
                    about guest lecturers, about the games the children played, about grammar seminars after regular
                    school hours, about spelling bees, about parents at school exhibitions, and about her attempts to
                    maintain discipline without corporal punishment—one of the reforms women helped bring to
                    the district classrooms of America. Still, not all was harmony. One parent complained that

                     his son was not learning anything. "Such things have
                    always hurt my feelings," said Russel, "but I believe I have done my
                        part."32 Gentle discipline could have its ups and downs too. One
                    boy was "affronted" at something her assistant said, and another girl stalked out
                    of the room when Rebecca criticized her lack of studying.33
            
            By the time Russel taught, in the late 1850s, public schooling was somewhat more organized than in
                    Pratt's day. Russel had to pass an examination to get a license. She recorded in her diary
                    that the night before her examination she studied grammar, geography, arithmetic, and spelling and
                    that her performance the next day was sufficient to qualify her for a two-year certificate. She had
                    state-approved textbooks, such as McGuffey's Reader, Webster's
                        Dictionary, and 
                        Mitchell
                    's Geography. The early trappings of professionalization show
                    up in her diary too. She subscribed to the Indiana School Journal, which in turn
                    recommended such professional books as The Teacher's Friend, which she
                    also read. And she was active in the local teachers' association, which met monthly and
                    discussed such matters as discipline.
            Russel had over sixty students, with an assistant to help while she listened to the recitations of
                    groups in rapid succession: the "abecedarians" (as the beginning readers were
                    called) and three higher reading groups, the four spelling classes, the grammar group, and three
                    arithmetic groups, some of them more than once a day, adding up to twenty-three recitation meetings.
                    Bible reading was also a regular part of her curriculum, although by 1860 many 
                        Quaker
                     schools in Indiana had given up their practice of bringing all the students to a 
                        Quaker
                     morning meeting in the middle of the week. Attendance at midweek religious services had
                    been universal in many local schools organized in predominantly 
                        Quaker
                     communities by the 
                        Quaker
                     quarterly meetings earlier in the century. Even when they received public money, these
                    local, religious, quasi-public schools required all their students to attend midweek 
                        Quaker
                     meeting. The education law of 1834 explicitly recognized the legitimacy of state aid to
                    such schools, endorsing the early nineteenth century approach to common schooling—more
                    local, more diverse, without such a strong dividing line between public and private or between
                    religious and nonreligious schools. By the 1860s most of these schools were controlled by public
                    school trustees, and the practice of midweek services faded. But not the practice of Bible reading.
                    Caleb Mills said that "the Bible is too deeply enthroned in the hearts of the people, to be
                    excluded from our common schools."34 As Rebecca Russel said one Sunday
                    in her diary, "There

                     is no class of persons who have more need to live a religious
                    life than teachers. I thought while in Meeting today that if the teacher was a religious person his
                    students would be so too in a greater or less degree."35
            
            By 1860, then, Rebecca Russel's school was emerging from its distinctive 
                        Quaker
                     past and becoming part of the state network of public schools; it was funded partly by
                    tax money raised by the town and partly by tuition payments subscribed by parents. Attendance was
                    voluntary and control was largely local, but the school was being drawn into a rudimentary set of
                    state regulations with county-level supervision. Thus, by 1860, the two strands of the history of
                    education came together: the social history of local schooling came into real contact with the
                    system that resulted from the political struggle to create and supervise free public schools.
                    Seventy years after the Northwest ordinances the schemes of the educational reformers and the
                    conduct of local schools began to intertwine.
            What does the experience of these six people reveal about education in the Old Northwest? First, if
                    historians of education are interested in how children got educated, they must move behind the
                    political scene to the local level, where much education was going on that was neither inspired nor
                    supported by the state. Second, because schooling was locally initiated and unregulated, it was very
                    uneven. In some communities sparse population, poor resources, lack of leadership, or general
                    indifference led to meager provision for schools. Elsewhere, local school development was quite
                    impressive long before the state got into the act. Third, because the lines between public and
                    private and between church and state were fuzzy, both in funding arrangements and in content, local
                    schooling was quite diverse. All schools taught the three R's, but districts differed
                    drastically, not only in the length of school terms, the qualifications of teachers, the quality of
                    schoolhouses, and the number of students in the district school and in whether men or women were
                    hired, but also in the treatment of religion and even in the use of foreign languages for
                    instruction.
            This diversity, unevenness, and lack of state supervision was not what had been envisioned by the
                    education advocates of the 1790s—Jefferson or Cutler, for example—but it was
                    what a majority of the people wanted. Local citizens fought to retain this unregulated diversity up
                    through the 1840s and 1850s. Only then did the balance tip toward the advocates of regulation, state
                    involvement, and fully tax-supported common schools. Because the Northwest ordinances provided some
                    stirring language and a stab at systematic public support of schools, people often think that they
                    laid down 
                  
                     35 Russel diary, July 28, 1861, vol. I, p. 117.
               
                     the basis for public education in the Northwest—and
                    in a way, they did. The ordinances stated an ideal of education for orderly progress and responsible
                    liberty, an ideal that presumed an activist government promoting popular education; they also
                    provided a modicum of support through land grants, a system that reformers could bemoan, react
                    against, and strive to improve.But the creation of state-regulated, free, public schools awaited
                    more than a half-century of political and cultural developments, not just on the frontier but in the
                    East as well. School supporters had to overcome opponents' indifference, parsimony, and
                    preoccupation with other priorities; they also had to overcome much principled opposition to
                    taxation and state regulation. Consensus about the value of universal elementary education was there
                    from the beginning. Consensus about the state's role had to be built. By 1860 a majority of
                    Americans favored a single, tax-supported, free school system, and this belief is one of the
                    enduring legacies of the nineteenth century. But the sources of dissent continued; thus, the
                    dialogue continues, even in our own day.
         
         
         
            The Significance of Excluding Slavery from the Old Northwest in 1787
            
                    David Brion Davis
                    *
                
            Fifty-two years before Congress enacted the Northwest Ordinance, the British government excluded
                    slaves from the colony of 
                        Georgia
                    .1 Although this precedent has been conspicuously ignored in debates
                    over the meaning of Article VI of the Northwest Ordinance, the parallels are intriguing. In both
                    cases the prohibition of slavery was adopted as part of a separate legislative act and not
                    incorporated in a founding charter or national Constitution. While the intentions of the
                    Confederation Congress are more obscure than those of James Oglethorpe and the trustees of 
                        Georgia
                    , it is clear that neither measure was expected to endanger slavery in adjacent
                    territories or challenge the legitimacy of slaveholding in general. The 1735 prohibition allowed
                    Carolinians to reclaim blacks who escaped into 
                        Georgia
                    , just as Article VI provided for the return of fugitives "to the person
                    claiming his or her labor or service."
            The advocates of a free-soil 
                        Georgia
                     were anything but abolitionists. Oglethorpe was deputy governor of the slave-trading
                    Royal African Company and also owned slaves on a Carolina plantation. The prohibition act provided
                    for the sale of any unclaimed blacks found in the colony. The trustees were to receive the proceeds.
                    In 1787, as far as is known, no southern members of the Congress of the Confederation voiced the
                    slightest disapproval of Article VI, which a committee of five, including a South Carolinian and two
                    Virginians, suddenly added a t the last minute to the finished text of the Northwest Ordinance.
            Staughton Lynd and Paul Finkelman, in their masterly studies of Article VI, have underscored the
                    contrast between the harmonious

                     congressional deliberations and the nearly contemporaneous
                    debates in the Constitutional Convention.2 From July 9 to July 12, 1787,
                    sectional anger erupted a t 
                        Philadelphia
                     as the convention argued about the three-fifths rule for apportioning representatives
                    in the House of Representatives. A few northerners objected that allowing representation for slaves
                    would encourage further slave importation from Africa. Delegates from 
                        South Carolina
                     and 
                        Georgia
                     demanded constitutional protection for slavery as the price for union. Subsequent
                    conflicts in the convention and in the First Congress under the new Constitution showed how
                    explosive the South would become in the face of any perceived threat to its most valuable form of
                    property. Yet on July 13, the day after the Constitutional Convention provisionally accepted the
                    three-fifths compromise, the Continental Congress, chaired by a southerner, adopted the Northwest
                    Ordinance with its newly added Article VI, which had not appeared in the draft of July 11. A
                    northerner cast the single dissenting vote. When the First Congress reenacted the Ordinance in 1789,
                    the southerners who would soon become so outraged by cautiously worded antislavery petitions seem
                    not to have sensed an abolitionist Trojan Horse or entering wedge.
            Parallels between the slavery exclusions of 1735 and 1787 extend beyond slaveholder concurrence. Both
                    the British and American governments hoped to attract enterprising white migrants who would rapidly
                    settle a territory that reached toward a Spanish frontier. Some of the planners, at least, sought
                    white settlers from a social class that could not afford to buy slaves—settlers who, as
                    experience had shown, had been deterred from emigrating to the more prosperous plantation regions.
                    Oglethorpe and his philanthropic supporters were thinking of British debtors and German peasants who
                    could contribute to imperial self-sufficiency by producing such commodities as silk and wine. The
                    later American developers were thinking of a less debased class of yeoman farmers who would clear
                    the land of Indians and trees, cultivate grains, build roads, towns, churches, and schools, and
                    eventually be capable of self-government. Despite this difference, both blueprints envisioned a
                    fusion of individual opportunity and national interest that depended on maintaining the dignity of
                    physical labor. One of

                     the motives for excluding slavery, at least in the initial
                    period of settlement, was the fear that whites would be demoralized and corrupted by the presence of
                    black slave competitors.
            Far more important, in the case of 
                        Georgia
                    , was the need for a secure buffer zone between 
                        South Carolina
                     and Spanish 
                        Florida
                    . The British were alarmed by the Spaniards' success in encouraging black
                    resistance in Carolina and offering a refuge for fugitive slaves. This anxiety deepened when
                    Oglethorpe failed to capture St. Augustine and when the slave unrest exploded in the Stono
                    Rebellion. The Spanish borderlands had a different but no less significant bearing on the Northwest
                    Ordinance. Robert V. Remini, in his inaugural address to this conference, has graphically described
                    the dangers of the mid-l780s, when southwestern settlers were prepared to transfer their allegiance
                    to 
                        Spain
                     if Congress refused to recognize their vital need for water transport to the Gulf of
                    Mexico. Most southern leaders put the highest priority on securing from 
                        Spain
                     the right to free navigation of the Mississippi River. Whatever
                    tradeoffs led to the acceptance of Article VI, it seems likely that southerners expected the bargain
                    to quiet most northern opposition to rapid westward expansion, including the demand for access to
                    the 
                        Mississippi
                     and for the undelayed admission of slave-holding states south of the Ohio
                        River.
            But as the trustees of 
                        Georgia
                     soon discovered, an act prohibiting slavery is not self-enforcing. In 1735 slavery was
                    universally sanctioned by the law of nations, and black slaves were openly sold and traded in 
                        England
                     as well as in every New World colony. Petitions from white settlers in 
                        Georgia
                    , including illiterates who could not sign their names, predicted that the colony would
                    sink into ruin unless quickly supplied with black slaves. A few antislavery petitioners spoke of the
                    Africans' natural right to freedom. They also argued that slaves would deprive white
                    laborers and craftsmen of work and endanger the colony with bloody insurrections. But meanwhile, no
                    institutions were effective in preventing Carolina planters from crossing the Savannah River with
                    their slaves or even slave ships from landing their cargoes in Savannah. In 1749 the trustees
                    finally capitulated and asked Parliament to repeal the prohibition.
            Paul Finkelman has recently analyzed the ambiguities of the Northwest Ordinance with respect to
                    slavery and has emphasized the failure of Congress to enact any enforcement legislation. As early as
                    July, 1788, the Franco-American slaveholders residing in the territory petitioned Congress to secure
                    their slave property from the effects of what they considered an "Ex post facto
                    law" that seemed to violate the terms of the Treaty of 
                        Paris
                     of 1763 and the 
                        Virginia
                     land cession of 1784. Like some of the earlier Georgian petitioners, the French
                    settlers contended that the obnoxious law would depopulate parts of the territory. And, in
                    actuality, some of  the more affluent French slaveholders sought
                    security in the Spanish territory across the 
                        Mississippi
                    . Although Congress never took action to clarify the status of slaves living in the Old
                    Northwest before 1787, Finkelman points out that the report of a three-member congressional
                    committee that included James 
                        Madison
                     "suggests how truly uncommitted the Founders were to ending
                        slavery."3 Governor Arthur St. Clair and other officials conveyed
                    the same reassuring message to the inhabitants of the territory; namely, that Article VI pertained
                    to the future introduction of slaves and was not intended to deprive present inhabitants of property
                    they possessed at the time the Ordinance was passed. As Finkelman and other historians have shown,
                    settlers continued to petition Congress to repeal or modify Article VI, while the territorial
                    governments of Indiana and 
                        Illinois
                     tried to attract slaveholders by giving sanction to various forms of involuntary
                    servitude. Until the well-known electoral struggle of 1823-1824, there was a genuine possibility
                    that 
                        Illinois
                     would become a slave state. As in colonial 
                        Georgia
                    , the issue turned on local conditions and demography. Fortunately, the Northwest was
                    not adjacent to 
                        South Carolina
                     and the Atlantic. From Finkelman's forceful arguments it might well be
                    concluded that the Northwest Ordinance was no more significant as an antislavery measure than the
                    British law of 1735 "for rendering the Colony of 
                        Georgia
                     more Defencible."
            But such a verdict would ignore the extraordinary power of antislavery ideology, which must be
                    distinguished from Garrisonian immediatism. The principle that slavery should be excluded from the
                    virgin West became the core of an antislavery and Republican party ideology that obscured the
                    economic benefits of coerced labor and transformed the moral meaning of national interest. To
                    develop this point I must first review recent reevaluations of slavery as part of a global
                    capitalist economy. I will then turn to the misapprehensions that arise when immediatist standards
                    and expectations are imposed on such measures as the Northwest Ordinance.
            Historians have only begun to free themselves from the antislavery assumptions that permeated
                    political economy from the time of Benjamin 
                        Franklin
                     and Adam Smith. They still find it difficult to believe that an immoral and flagrantly
                    unjust system of labor could be congruent with long-term economic and material progress. They
                    intuitively reject the claims of Robert W. Fogel and other economists that slave labor was
                    efficient, productive, adaptable, and immensely profitable. Whatever the short-term rewards, in the
                    moral economy of history the sin of slaveholding surely led to soil exhaustion, indebtedness,
                    degenerate livestock, obsolete technology,-dilapidated

                     farms, and a society bereft of schools, towns, and enterprise.
                    But this conventional imagery merges many independent variables and confuses the symptoms of an
                    imbalanced economy with economic decline. It also obscures the crucial contributions of black slaves
                    to the growth of a larger, interdependent Atlantic economy. The recent research of David Eltis,
                    Seymour Drescher, Stanley Engerman, Rebecca J. Scott, and other scholars has moved beyond the now
                    conventional view that black slave labor provided the foundation for the wealthiest and most dynamic
                    New World economies before 1800; there is now impressive evidence that the economic importance of
                    slavery increased in the nineteenth century along with the soaring global demand
                    for such consumer goods as sugar, coffee, and cotton textiles. This demand could only be met by
                    plantation production and coerced labor, including the hundreds of thousands of indentured Asian
                    workers who eventually replaced many of the emancipated West Indian blacks.4
            
            Contrary to traditional dogma, under most circumstances free labor was not cheaper or more productive
                    than slave labor. In most of the New World, in any event, a sufficient supply of free labor was
                    never available. And as the British learned to their dismay after emancipating nearly 800,000
                    colonial slaves, free laborers were unwilling to accept the plantation discipline and working
                    conditions that made sugar production a highly profitable investment. The British West Indian
                    colonies did not decline in their value to the British economy until the 1820s, when the effects of
                    slave-trade abolition finally began to counteract rising worker productivity. Britain's
                    suicidal, or as Drescher would have it, "econocidal" destruction of the
                    world's leading producers of sugar and coffee provided an extra stimulus to the plantations
                    of 
                        Cuba
                     and 
                        Brazil
                     and to the illegal slave trade that supplied them with labor.5 And
                    in 
                        Brazil
                     the increasing concentration of slaves on coffee fazendas did not prevent the
                    profitable use of slave labor in such varied enterprises as cattle ranching, food processing,
                    construction, grain and root crop farming, textile manufacturing, jerked beef production, whaling,
                    and even serving as deck hands on South Atlantic slave ships. In mid-nineteenth century 
                        Brazil
                     black slavery proved to be compatible with urban life and virtually every urban

                        Cuba
                     black slaves were profitably employed in the most capital-intensive and highly
                    mechanized sugar production. In both 
                        Cuba
                     and 
                        Brazil
                    , as Herbert Klein notes, slaves were "most heavily concentrated in the most
                    dynamic regions of their respective societies on the eve of emancipation."6
            
            David Eltis, in his monumental Economic Growth and the Ending of the Transatlantic Slave
                        Trade, finds a symbiotic relationship between New World slavery and industrial capitalism.
                    Slave labor produced most of the first luxury goods that reached a mass consumer market,
                    particularly in 
                        England
                    , and that therefore contributed to the labor incentives needed for English industrial
                    work discipline. The dramatic drop in price for British manufactured goods reduced the cost of
                    buying slaves on the African coast. While the price of slaves remained low and relatively stable in
                    Africa during much of the nineteenth century, the price of slaves continued to rise in the New
                    World, with minor fluctuations, as landowners sought to meet the mounting world demand for sugar,
                    coffee, cocoa, tobacco, rice, and cotton. As Eltis convincingly argues, "for the Americas
                    as well as for Britain at the outset of industrialization, there was a profound incompatibility
                    between economic self-interest and antislavery policy."7
            
            Despite Britain's vigorous and expensive efforts to suppress the Atlantic slave trade,
                    approximately two-and-one-quarter million African slaves were imported into the Americas between
                    1811 and 1860. As Eltis has shown, it was not until the 1840s, a decade of massive European
                    migration to the Americas, that the flow of free immigrants exceeded the flow of African slaves,
                    even though the importation of slaves was by then almost entirely confined to 
                        Cuba
                     and 
                        Brazil
                    .8 The symbiosis between slavery and industrial capitalism is
                    perhaps most vividly indicated by the fact that the illicit Atlantic slave trade depended on British
                    capital, credit, insurance, and the manufactured goods, including firearms, that were exchanged in
                    Africa for slaves.9
            
            One concludes from Eltis's iconoclastic study that British capitalism, as a source of human
                    exploitation and suffering in the early industrial era, could have been even worse than it proved to
                    be. Economic growth would probably have increased a t a faster rate if Britain had not outlawed the
                    slave trade and curbed the development of the rich plantation lands in Trinidad and 
                        Guyana
                    . Consumers and cotton manufacturers would probably have benefited if

                     British cruisers had protected slave ships bound for 
                        Texas
                     instead of intercepting slavers in Brazilian waters. There is a subtle irony in the way
                    that Eltis's neoclassical economic analysis exposes the pathological consequences of a
                    world view that subordinates all human relationships to free-market choices and the supreme goal of
                    achieving the largest national product.
            But when the vitality and flexibility of nineteenth century slavery are considered, the exclusion of
                    the institution from any territory seems all the more remarkable. Before 1787 the single attempt to
                    exclude slavery from a New World colony proved to be a hopeless failure. In 1790, when Britain
                    sought to encourage white immigration to 
                        Canada
                     as well as to the 
                        Bahamas
                     and Bermuda, the Imperial Act allowed the introduction of black slaves as a matter of
                        course.10 Britain failed to respect the French Convention's
                    emancipation decree of 1794, which applied to territories that fell under British control. In 1802
                    Napoleon restored slavery in 
                        Guadeloupe
                     and in the following year legalized both slavery and the slave trade. It is true that
                    when the North American colonies had earlier begun to resist British taxation and to assert their
                    own right to self-determination, they suspended or permanently prohibited the further importation of
                    slaves; but unlike the other plantation societies of the New World, the southern colonies could rely
                    on the rapid natural increase of their slave populations. Although the American Revolution
                    encouraged genuine moral misgivings over the justice of human slavery, the state laws suspending or
                    prohibiting the slave trade arose from a variety of motives. These included the desire of some
                    southerners to maintain high slave prices and to dominate labor markets in the West; the fear of
                    many northerners that slave competition would undermine the livelihood of white workers; and the
                    more widely shared conviction that the Republic's security and welfare required greater
                    racial homogeneity.
            Whatever the legacy of the Revolution, in 1787 slavery was supported by the laws of every state
                    except 
                  Vermont, New Hampshire
               , and 
                        Massachusetts
                    . Why would representatives from slave-holding states agree without argument to ban the
                    institution from the vast territory north of the Ohio River? It was improbable
                    that the Northwest could ever benefit from the economies of scale associated with gang labor on
                    sugar and cotton plantations, but in 1787 no one could foresee the cotton gin or the rich Black Belt
                    extending across 
                        Alabama
                     and 
                        Mississippi
                    . As the later history of the Northwest suggests, slaves would have lowered labor costs
                    in various occupations ranging from tobacco and hemp production to mining 
                  
                     10It should be noted that in 1793, under the prodding of
                            Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe, Upper

                            introduction of slaves," which also provided for gradual emancipation. Robin W.

                        Ohio

                        Illinois
                     still extends below northern 
                        Kentucky
                    , and that Cairo, 
                        Illinois
                    , lies farther south than 
                  Richmond,

               .
            When historians ponder the mystery of Article VI, they customarily quote a revealing passage from
                    William Grayson's letter of August 8, 1787, to James 
                        Monroe
                    . Grayson, the Virginian who had presided over Congress when the Ordinance was approved,
                    explained, "The clause respecting slavery was agreed to by the Southern members for the
                    purpose of preventing Tobacco and Indigo from being made on the N.W. side of the 
                        Ohio
                     as well for sev'l other political reasons." While we have no reason
                    to doubt the accuracy of this report, aside from a mistake in copying "indigo"
                    instead of "hemp," it is not immediately clear why southerners feared competition
                    more from the Northwest than from the Southwest.11 In 1787 tobacco exports were
                    rising. If western expansion threatened to lower the price of certain slave-grown staples, it would
                    also raise the price of slaves and offer new opportunities to slaveholders who were willing to
                    migrate. It is true that Grayson and other Virginians had a personal interest in developing the
                    lands of 
                        Kentucky
                     and 
                        Tennessee
                     and that by 1787 many observers assumed the Northwest would be settled by New
                    Englanders. But the exclusion of slavery would still appear to be a costly surrender of principle,
                    especially for the Deep South.
            Representatives from the Deep South, who fought so bitterly to protect their constitutional right to
                    import slaves from Africa, might well have seen Article VI as a restriction that would limit the
                    future demand for slave labor and thus reinforce arguments for a constitutional or congressional
                    prohibition of the slave trade. On July 13 the Constitutional Convention had not yet faced the
                    extremely divisive question of the Atlantic slave trade, and of course no one could predict the
                    outcome of the Constitutional Convention or assume that a new constitution would be adopted.12 However one interprets the evidence, excluding slavery from such a n immense
                    territory appears to be a dangerous precedent and a drastic means either for limiting competition or
                    for the contradictory goal of ensuring that slavery could expand into the southwest. In any event,
                    the latter objective would be virtually guaranteed by the terms of the land cessions of the southern
                    seaboard states.

            It is possible, of course, that the southern congressmen never expected the prohibition to be
                    effective or permanent. Or Staughton Lynd may well be right when he offers the hypothesis of a
                    secret compromise in which southerners accepted Article VI as a low price for the three-fifths
                    clause and the fugitive slave clause in the federal Constitution.13 But
                    regardless of the varying views on this question, the intentions of the framers are of minor
                    significance when compared with the ideological consequences of creating free soil.
            An instructive analogy can be drawn between Article VI and Lord Mansfield's famed 
                        Somerset
                     decision of 1772. Like the Continental congressmen, Lord Mansfield had no intention of
                    endangering the institution of slavery. The question he faced was whether the law of 
                        England
                     allowed Charles Stuart, a resident Virginian, to seize his runaway slave, James 
                        Somerset
                    , and lock him in chains aboard a ship scheduled to sail to 
                        Jamaica
                    . After granting a writ of habeas corpus, ordering the ship's
                    captain to bring 
                        Somerset
                     to court, Mansfield first sought an out-of-court settlement. Fearing the effects of a
                    judicial opinion on the status of ten thousand or more black slaves held in 
                        England
                    , he advised resident planters to appeal to Parliament for appropriate legislation. In
                    an earlier trial Mansfield had announced, "I would have all masters think them free, and
                    all Negroes think they were not, because then they would both behave better." After hearing
                    the opposing arguments of counsel, which would either have legitimated or abolished slavery on
                    English soil, the chief justice searched for the narrowest possible ground on which to base his
                    decision. He affirmed that slavery must be based on positive law and could not be
                    "introduced by courts of justice upon mere reasoning or inferences from any principles,
                    natural or political." In discharging 
                        Somerset
                    , Mansfield went no farther than to say English law did not permit a master to seize his
                    servant and forcibly transport him out of the country.14
            
            The 
                        Somerset
                     decision did not immediately emancipate the slaves living in 
                        England
                     or prevent colonists from bringing slaves into the country. Mansfield continued to rule
                    that slaves were not entitled to sue for back wages. Yet the popular press gave wide publicity to
                    the arguments of 
                        Somerset
                    's counsel and increasingly interpreted Mansfield's decision to mean
                    that the air of 
                        England
                     was too pure for slavery, or in William Blackstone's earlier formulation,

                     that the moment a slave lands in 
                        England
                    , "[he] falls under the protection of the laws, and with regard to all natural
                    rights becomes eo instanti a freeman." Slavery lingered in 
                        England
                     for some two decades and was not officially abolished until 1834, but masters had no
                    legal remedies when slaves in increasing numbers simply walked away into freedom. Advertisements for
                    runaways virtually disappeared by the late 1780s, when abolitionism acquired a mass appea1.15
            
            Like the Northwest Ordinance, the 
                        Somerset
                     decision deterred slaveholders from migrating across a boundary loaded with risk. The
                    analogy should not be pressed, since a densely populated industrializing nation over three thousand
                    miles from the nearest plantation economy can hardly be compared with an American frontier. Yet both
                    the edicts became mythologized as antislavery landmarks. Salmon Chase might well have been referring
                    to 
                        Somerset
                     when he proclaimed that by a "single act" the Founding Fathers had
                    made slavery illegal and had "impressed upon the soil itself an incapacity to bear up other
                    than freemen." And even the 
                        Somerset
                     case was not devoid of racist implications. When 
                        Somerset
                    's chief counsel, Sergeant Davy, exclaimed that the air of 
                        England
                     was too pure for a slave to breathe in, he was not inviting more slaves to come and
                    breathe the freedom-giving air. He made it clear that the air of 
                        England
                     was too pure for a black to breathe in. He wished to prevent an influx of blacks,
                    "for now and then we have some Accidents of Children born of an Odd Colour."
                    Unless a law were passed to prevent such immigration, Sergeant Davy said, "I don't
                    know what our Progeny may be, I mean of what Colour."16 Racial
                    prejudice was of course far more virulent and widespread in the 
                        United States
                    , especially in the Northwest. The determination to avoid the degradation and dishonor
                    of slave labor also involved the exclusion of the race that slavery had degraded.
            Although antislavery ideology was closely related to the need to valorize and legitimate free labor,
                    it cannot be reduced to economic self-interest. The popular hostility to slavery that emerged almost
                    simultaneously in 
                        England
                     and in parts of the 
                        United States
                     drew on traditions of natural law and a revivified sense of the image of God in man.17 From the time of

                     Sharp and Anthony Benezet, Anglo-American abolitionists were moved by a profound

                    Sharp wrote in 1788 to the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     Abolition Society on behalf of the 
                        London
                     abolitionists, he stressed that "in addressing the Representatives of a
                    commercial nation on an affair in which its interests and its justice are inseparable, we cannot for
                    a moment abandon the fundamental principle of our association, that no gains, however great, are to
                    be put in competition with the essential rights of man, and that as a nation is exalted by
                    righteousness, so it is equally debased and debilitated by the revenues of injustice."18
            
            This very letter also illustrates another aspect of pre-immediatist antislavery thought. Along with
                    his emphasis on uncompromising moral principle, Sharp explained why the 
                        London
                     Abolition Society had limited its purpose to eradicting the slave trade. Individual
                    members might look forward to slave emancipation, he said, but this objective could be obtained only
                    by "such gradual and temperate means as the colonial assemblies may adopt." This
                    extreme caution, it appears in retrospect, sprang from the very values that led to the condemnation
                    of slavery. Slavery could not be tolerated as a necessary and permanent evil because it deprived
                    human beings of the responsibilities of free choice and of the recompense for labor, including
                    private property, on which freedom depended. This meant that the ultimate goal of freedom could not
                    be achieved by coercive means that destroyed the very fabric of law, consent, and property.
            Even the Quakers, who established the first model of collective emancipation, proceeded gradually and
                    with great caution as they dealt with the symptoms of "slavery withdrawal."
                    Beginning in the late 1750s they investigated the problem of members who were actively engaged in
                    the slave trade; in 
                        Philadelphia
                     they adopted disciplinary measures that fell short of disownment. It took some twenty
                    years for the Society of Friends to disengage itself from slaveholding even in the northern states;
                    legal complications prolonged the process in 
                        North Carolina
                    .
            Four years after the passage of the ambiguous Northwest Ordinance, the French Amis des
                        noirs issued a seemingly clear and uncompromising dictum on the status of slaves. Since no
                    man could alienate his natural freedom, the French abolitionists said, "the slave is always
                    free," regardless "of contrary laws, customs, and practices …
                    Accordingly, the restoration of a slave's freedom is not a gift or an act of charity. It is
                    rather a compelling duty, an act of 
                  
                     18

                     justice, which simply affirms an existing truth—not
                    an ideal which ought to be." But despite this eloquent rhetoric the reformers concluded
                    "that the immediate emancipation of Negro slaves would be a measure not only fatal for our
                    colonies, but a measure which, since our greed has reduced the blacks to a degraded and impotent
                    state, would be equivalent to abandoning and refusing aid to infants in their cradles or to helpless
                        cripples."19 Such examples add perspective to the emancipation acts
                    of 
                  Pennsylvania, Connecticut
               , and 
                        Rhode Island
                    , which preceded the Northwest Ordinance and which applied only to the future-born
                    children of slaves, not to the slaves then living.
            Paul Finkelman seems surprised and somewhat outraged by his discovery that "whatever it was
                    supposed to accomplish, Article VI had little immediate impact on the legal status of slaves in the
                    area that would become the states of Indiana and 
                        Illinois
                    , where the bulk of the slaves in the territory lived." He suggests that
                    "had there been a full-fledged debate over Article VI a clearer sense of its meaning might
                    have emerged."20 Apart from the fact that a full-fledged debate would
                    have destroyed, in all probability, any chance of agreement on an antislavery provision, what I find
                    surprising is the absence of any formal exemption of the Franco-American slaveholders from the
                    effects of Article VI. In 1798, when Congress debated a motion to extend the exclusion clause of the
                    Northwest Ordinance to 
                        Mississippi
                     Territory, the advocates of slave exclusion acknowledged that the present settlers who
                    had arrived under the laws of 
                  England, Spain
               , or 
                        Georgia
                     could not with justice be deprived of their property.21 The same
                    presumption prevailed in 1804 when Congress considered various proposals for restricting slavery and
                    the slave trade in 
                        Louisiana
                    . Yet despite the contradictions between Article VI and a section of the Northwest
                    Ordinance promising that Franco-Americans could retain the laws and customs then in force among them
                    "relative to the descent and conveyance of property," the new federal Congress did
                    nothing to clarify the issue and refused to comply with petitions requesting sanction for even the
                    kind of age-limited servitude found in the gradual emancipation acts of the northern states.
                    Although Congress also failed to veto territorial laws allowing indentured servitude and barring the
                    residence of free blacks, the principle of prohibiting slavery remained intact.
            Finkelman is surely right when he points to the discrepancy between the later abolitionist image of
                    the Northwest Ordinance and the continuing vitality of slavery in the region. But one need

                     not be as cynical or disillusioned about the Ordinance as he
                    seems to be. For one thing, the unsuccessful struggle to legalize slavery in 
                        Illinois
                     must be balanced against the unsuccessful struggle to abolish slavery in 
                        Kentucky
                    . Initially led by such evangelical ministers as David Rice, David Barrow, and Carter
                    Tarrant, the latter effort was revived in 1833 by James G. Birney's 
                        Kentucky
                     Society for the Gradual Relief of the State from Slavery. Significantly, a large number
                    of antislavery spokesmen from the Upper South eventually found a refuge from mob violence or
                    peer-group hostility in the Northwest. It was not by accident that Edward Coles, the young 
                        Virginia
                     antislavery slaveholder who pressed Thomas Jefferson to match his words with actions,
                    later became the governor of 
                        Illinois
                     who led the antislavery faction to victory. In 1856 Coles sketched the history of the
                    "marvellous" Ordinance which had preserved freedom in all the states north of the
                        Ohio River. According to Coles, the Ordinance had won more popular sanction
                    than the Constitution as its principles were extended to the territory obtained by the 
                        Louisiana
                     Purchase north of the 3630' latitude and even to the 
                        Oregon
                     Territory before being repealed by the 
                        Kansas
                    -
                        Nebraska
                     Act. Needless to say, Coles regarded this repeal as a repudiation of the Founding
                    Fathers' wisest legacy and as a possible prelude to "the awful realities of civil
                        war."22
            
            Finkelman voices skepticism about the claims of the aging Coles, who was born seven months before the
                    Northwest Ordinance was enacted. Finkelman presents a brilliant but bleak account of the persistence
                    of slavery in parts of the Old Northwest during sixty-one years of Coles's life. But these
                    statistics must also be put in perspective. In 1820 there were still over 10,000 slaves in 
                        New York
                     and more than 7,500 in 
                        New Jersey
                    ; in 
                        Illinois
                     there were only 917; in Indiana 190. Although the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     abolition law had been enacted seven years before the Northwest Ordinance, there were
                    more slaves in 
                        Pennsylvania
                     in 1820 than in Indiana. Finkelman seems especially disturbed by the fact that slavery
                    lingered in 
                        Illinois
                     until the constitution of 1848 finally abolished it. He does not mention that the
                    census of 1840 records only 331 slaves or that in 1840 there were still a few slaves left in
                            
                  Pennsylvania, Connecticut
               , and 
                        Rhode Island
                    . In other words, a lag of sixty years was not unusual in cases of gradual emancipation.
                    In 
                        New Jersey
                    , where an emancipation statute won assent only in 1804, slavery survived until 1846,
                    and a few blacks remained in virtual bondage until the Civil War.23

            Finkelman might logically reply that the language of Article VI did not imply gradual emancipation.
                    But as he carefully demonstrates, the Northwest Ordinance said nothing about enforcement and failed
                    to clarify the options open to new states. This very ambiguity was probably essential for the
                    initial congressional consensus; it also converted the Ordinance into a charter document, as Andrew
                    R. L. Cayton and Peter S. Onuf have argued, which was subject to conflicting interpretations.24 The resulting uncertainty had one striking and incontrovertible consequence:
                    it deterred slaveholders from moving across the Ohio River. The Northwest
                    Ordinance, reinforced by flagrantly racist legislation and public opinion, maintained a preserve for
                    whites until there was no possibility that states created from the Northwest Territory would
                    legalize black slavery.
            In 1820, for example, there were almost twice as many blacks in 
                        Missouri
                     as in 
                        Ohio
                    , Indiana, and 
                        Illinois
                     combined. Blacks constituted less than 1 percent of the population in each of the three
                    northwestern states, but 30 percent of the population of neighboring 
                        Kentucky
                    . Had there been no Article VI, this incredibly lopsided distribution would surely not
                    have prevailed. Parts of Indiana and 
                        Illinois
                    , in particular, would have been inundated by the northern edge of the stream of slaves
                    that rolled across 
                        Kentucky
                     and 
                        Tennessee
                     toward 
                        Missouri
                     and 
                        Arkansas
                    .
            The timing of the Northwest Ordinance contributed to a pattern of boundary making that contained
                    ominous implications for the future of slavery. From 
                        England
                     to New 
                  England, Pennsylvania
               , and the Northwest, geographic lines marked off zones
                    where free labor was to be the exclusive norm. If southerners wrongly assumed that even
                    nonslaveholding Westerners would prove to be allies, they rightly assumed that 
                        New York
                     and 
                        New Jersey
                     would soon join the ranks of emancipating states. When they accepted the premise that
                    Congress could define and demarcate free-labor territory, they failed to anticipate the corollary
                    that slavery would increasingly be seen as a n exceptional or artificial institution requiring the
                    sanction of positive law. Eventually, of course, after northern politicians moved to exclude slavery
                    from 
                        Arkansas
                     Territory, 
                        Missouri
                    , and all territories won in the Mexican War, many southern leaders repudiated the
                    principle of free-soil boundaries and demanded what amounted to the nationalization of slavery. The
                    slaveholders won many victories in judicial decisions involving the vexing and complex questions of
                    slave transit, sojourn, and comity, culminating in the Dred Scott decision, but their ideological

                    free-soil world, however accommodating in certain respects, invited increasingly invidious
                    comparisons between antithetical and seemingly irreconcilable social systems.
            Alexis de Tocqueville was only one of the numerous travelers who descended the Ohio
                    River boundary and exclaimed over the contrasting landscapes on the northern and southern
                    shores. After presenting images of industry and sloth, of growth and decay, Tocqueville condensed
                    the message of free-labor ideology in a single memorable sentence: 
                        On the left bank of the 
                                Ohio
                             work is connected with the idea of slavery, but on the right with well-being
                            and progress; on the one side it is degrading, but on the other honorable; on the left bank
                            no white laborers are to be found, for they would be afraid of being like the slaves; for
                            work people must rely on the Negroes; but one will never see a man of leisure on the right
                            bank: the white man's intelligent activity is used for work of every sort.25
                  
                    
                
            This dramatic polarity, however deceptive in terms of wealth and economic growth, was a legacy of the
                    Northwest Ordinance. It provided the core of the Republican party's ideology, an ideology
                    that seemed convincing to millions of northerners who had no sympathy for the abolitionist cause. At
                    the end of the Civil War, Charles Sumner contended that the Confederate states had neither seceded
                    nor become conquered provinces. Having forfeited their rights by an act of rebellion, he claimed,
                    they had in effect reverted to the status of territories temporarily subject to congressional
                    control. Since the Constitution provided no guidelines for Reconstruction, Sumner turned
                    instinctively to the precedent of new beginnings, the precedent that had supposedly made the Old
                    Northwest a model republican society.

            The Northwest Ordinance is celebrated as one of the great documents of American history because it
                    envisaged an empire based upon principles novel at the time. By allowing what started in effect as
                    colonies to achieve full statehood in the Union, the Confederation Congress in one of its last acts
                    provided an innovative solution to the governance of the area north and west of the Ohio
                        River. Through recapitulating the hypothetical history of the original states, new
                    and yet-to-be-created territories were to gain eventually the rights and responsibilities of the
                    original states.1
            
            Through such a novel solution the Confederation Congress brought yet another American institution
                    into the "new order of the ages," so proudly proclaimed on the Great Seal of the 
                        United States
                    . Congressmen thus invented a new kind of colonial system to go with the other
                    innovations in constitutions and law codes, forms of government, church-state relations, and even
                    spelling books and social customs.2 So successful was the change that to

                        United States
                     became known as territories.
            
            The newness of the 
                        United States
                     posed problems concerning national identity, however, as leading Americans consciously
                    created an ideology of Americanism to measure the loyalty of new citizens and t o understand their
                    own place in history. On one hand the new ideals and institutions were presumed universally good for
                    all human beings and therefore the wave of the future. What the 
                        United States
                     was in the last quarter of the eighteenth century, Europe and maybe the world would
                    become in succeeding centuries. On the other hand America's new ideals and
                    institutions—be they political, social, or religious—seemed unique to the new 
                        United States
                     at the time. The fact that America's good fortune appeared an exception to the
                    world's normal condition seemed to demand the special nurture of its ideals and
                    institutions.
            Under such impressions Americans then and subsequently were ambivalent about receiving foreign
                    peoples into their society for fear they might contaminate, if not subvert, American life. Could
                    alien "others" appreciate American ideals or contribute toward social arrangements
                    in the 
                        United States
                     if they had lived under laws and institutions presumed completely opposite? Concern
                    about the effects of foreign peoples and their alien "otherness" on American
                    values and institutions went hand in hand, therefore, with proclaiming the higher ideals of the
                    American way of life as appropriate for the whole world.3
            
            The paradox of Americanism as ideology and in practice lay in this contradiction between proclaiming
                    American arrangements as good for all human beings but restricting their benevolence to a favored
                    few peoples among the world's societies. Dominant Americans' efforts to bound
                    their heterogeneous society excluded certain peoples as others and included themselves as true
                    Americans on grounds composed equally of an ideology of ideal institutions and an ideology of
                    peoplehood based upon ethnicity or race. As a result American leaders, intellectuals, and ordinary
                    citizens defined Americanism by certain ideals or modes of organization deemed

                            , 1963), chapters 1-3, covers the symbolic understanding of Europe by Americans
                            in this period as a contrast to themselves.

                                Immigrants i n Urban America (
                                New York
                            , 1975). Higham's chapter 6, particularly, treats the larger nativist
                            strain in American history. David B. Davis argues for the connection between Americanism and
                            nativism in "Some Themes of Counter-Subversion: An Analysis of Anti-Masonic,
                            Anti-Catholic, and Anti-Mormon Literature," 
                        Mississippi

                            "Some Ideological Functions of Prejudice in Ante-Bellum America," American Quarterly, XV (Summer, 1963), 115-25.
               
                     particularly American, and the cause of that peculiar
                    Americanness was all too often given an ethnic or racial basis.4
            
            If the provision in the Northwest Ordinance for the eventual statehood of territories represented the
                    new and universal side of American ideology, then the ethnic application of that principle in
                    practice proves the other side of the paradox of Americanism.5 And no better
                    example exists of both the strengths and limits of the ideal of territory making in light of its
                    ethnic implications than that of the American Indians. They are one of the two peoples mentioned
                    specifically in the Ordinance, but their inclusion in the document and the history of later efforts
                    to establish an all-Indian territory point to the ethnic premises by which
                    "Americans" understood and bounded themselves in earlier centuries.6
            
            No peoples were considered more alien to American ideals and institutions than those peoples whites
                    collected under the term Indian.
               7 Thus the American Indian as
                    image and supposed reality has always been a challenge to the ideology of Americanism. For
                    generations of 
                        United States

                     7 As the reader will see, I usually use the term Indian to designate the white image of Native Americans as a single collective entity
                            and to that extent alone a stereotype.
               
                     "American" and "Indian"
                    represented opposite ways of living and behaving. For these white Americans the very concept of the
                    Indian denied middle-class proprieties, private property, and proper governance. Whether attempting
                    to understand Indian morals or economy, housing or government, family life or religion, most white
                    Americans measured the First Americans as a general image against those values, customs, and
                    institutions they most cherished in themselves. So alien was the Indian considered to the ideal
                    American way of life that native Americans were long denied citizenship in the nation in which they
                    were born.8
            
            What Indians required in line with this imagery of their deficiency was drastic transformation to
                    approved American ways through the example of the very institutions they presumably lacked: small
                    private farms, formal churches and schools, and republican government. Through peaceful exhortation
                    and model institutions preferably but by annuity and force if necessary, leading Americans tried to
                    change Indian ways to conform to approved American ways of religion, economy, government, education,
                    family, and manners. Indians to become proper Americans were supposed to give up tribal government,
                    communal land ownership, and supposedly loose morals and marriage customs for bourgeois farming,
                    Christian religion, elective government, and the middle-class family. Public policies and private
                    philanthropy aimed to convert Indians into Americans by giving them what other Americans possessed
                    according to the ideology of Americanism. The Indian would thus be eliminated in favor of the
                    American, to paraphrase a slogan popular later among the self-designated (white) Friends of the
                        Indian.9

            At the same time many, maybe most, whites believed that the Indian was congenitally incapable of
                    adopting civilized ways. A Senate Report in 1836 recapitulated briefly the "peculiarities
                    of constitution" attributed by so many whites to the Indian (in order to refute them):
                    "lst, An irresistable thirst for ardent spirits. 2d, An unnatural predilection for war. 3d,
                    An inordinate fondness for the hunter state; and, 4th, An unconquerable aversion to the improvement
                    of condition."10 For those whites who believed these attributes innate
                    to the Indian character, only the transfer of Indian lands to white hands, if not also the
                    elimination of the Indian through death or assimilation, would solve the problem of the Indian and
                    the Americanization of the West.
            American goals of transforming the Indians into good Americans conflicted with the drive to people
                    the 
                        United States
                     with good white Americans. Whether conceived of as noble or savage, the Indian stood in
                    the way of American progress according to the ideology of Americanism. The anomaly of the Indian was
                    resolved all too often in favor of white interests and advance over native residence and
                    civilizational transformation. In the competition for natural resources and lands, native lands were
                    claimed and often expropriated for supposedly higher white uses in the name of private property. The
                    goal of acculturation and assimilation was often superseded in favor of removal to the frontier and
                    continued segregation. Even Christianity and civilization were conceived as leading to reduced
                    Indian lands in native terms as well as a better Indian life in white terms. When the Cherokee,
                    Choctaw, and other southern tribes adopted white ways of farming, government, and religion in the
                    first three decades of the nineteenth century, they still found themselves forced to remove in the
                    name of progress and Americanism during the fourth decade.11
            
            No matter what whites did to the Indian peoples, whether judged today as bad or good, altruistic or
                    crass, all was clone in the name of bettering their existence according to the ideals of
                    Americanism. White ideals therefore marched alongside material interests in the spread of the
                    American empire of liberty. In the end white policy was geared to help the Indian only in terms of
                    white conceptions of what the Indian needed. What the Indian needed was shaped by the long-standing
                    image of the Indian as alien to the American way of life.

                     nothing more!—than what soon became official policy
                    under the new federal government inaugurated by the Constitution: 
                        The utmost good faith shall always be observed towards the Indians; their lands and property
                            shall never be taken from them without their consent; and in their property, rights and
                            liberty, they shall never be invaded or disturbed, unless in just and lawful wars authorized
                            by Congress; but laws founded in justice and humanity shall from time to time be made, for
                            preventing wrongs being done to them; and for preserving peace and friendship with them.
                     Congress did not foreswear a policy of land acquisition or lawful war, only pledged that
                    land transfers would rest upon tribal consent and that military actions would be justified under
                    white rationales. Likewise, Congress promised to restrain those traders and other whites who cheated
                    Indians or intruded upon their lands illegally because such actions led to costly wars between the 
                        United States
                     and the Indian tribes. In the end, whites decided what Indians needed or could use.12
            
            The novelty of this policy lay only in its repudiation of congressional efforts immediately after the
                    Revolution to claim Indian lands first as reparations and then by conquest. Immediately following
                    the Revolution congressional commissioners to the Indian nations demanded land cessions as
                    recompense for the tribes' siding with the British against the new 
                        United States
                    . After the failure of that policy, the Confederation Congress pursued military conquest
                    to gain the same lands and quiet the Indian opposition. Since neither policy worked because of
                    successful native resistance combined with English and Spanish interference, the new federal
                    government under President George 
                        Washington
                     and his secretary of war, Henry 
                        Knox
                    , advocated a policy more in keeping with the notion of national honor, a depleted
                    treasury, and the seemingly inevitable expansion of white settlement. National honor was to be
                    preserved through the purchase of the lands occupied by Indian tribes who presumably would sell
                    willingly, and cheaply, when whites wanted to buy.13
            
            By making the expansion of white America contingent upon Indian assent and white restraint, the
                    Confederation Congress and, later, the federal government predicated a delicate balance of
                    conditions 
                  
                     12The provision that defined Indian relations in the Northwest
                            Ordinance was re-adopted in effect by the new 
                                United States
                             Congress under the Constitution when it adapted the Northwest Ordinance to the

                            Honor" in my White Man's Indian, pp. 145-53. The next

                             policy, consult Francis Paul Prucha, American Indian Policy in the
                                Formative Years: The Indian Trade and Intercourse Acts, 1790-1834 (

                            , Mass., 1962); and Reginald Horsman, Expansionism and American
                                Indian Policy, 1783-1812 (East Lansing, Mich., 1967).
               
                     that rarely obtained upon the frontier. First, the policy
                    assumed at its foundation that Indians possessed more lands than they could or would use by accepted
                    white standards and that therefore they would readily cede those lands to the government for small
                    sums of money and gifts. The policy also presumed that settlers on the frontier could be restrained
                    from occupying tribal lands even though they considered all Indian lands underutilized by white
                    standards of resource usage. If the policy were to succeed as publicly espoused, then the same fate
                    that decreed the increase of the white population on former Indian lands must also doom the Indians
                    to disappearance through death or acculturation.
            The policy rested, therefore, upon certain common white images of the Indians' ultimate fate
                    and their lack of attachment to home turf. To most white Americans the Indian appeared doomed to
                    extinction through disease as had been the case during earlier periods of contact. The Indian had
                    always seemed to vanish before white advance and would presumably continue to disappear as white
                    America expanded.14 Moreover, whites assumed the remainder could and would
                    continue to remove westward according to the standard imagery of native migratory habits. Westward
                    migration like decimation from disease opened tribal lands to white occupation.
            What disease and migration did not achieve, acculturation would finish under this view.
                    Civilizational transformation of the Indian through acculturation would not only convert the
                    "savage" to a bourgeois lifestyle but would also reduce the need for extensive
                    tribal holdings because the land would be farmed American style. This supposedly more intensive use
                    of the soil would release large areas of surplus tribal lands for white acquisition. White policy at
                    its most philanthropic envisaged the exchange of white civilization for native resources and souls
                    to the ultimate benefit of both whites and Indians according to white understanding. Until the
                    Indians wanted to part with their lands, the federal government would prevent, by force if
                    necessary, the illegal intrusion of greedy white settlers into the legally separate Indian country.
            All in all, the basic policy of expansion with honor rested upon the assumption that the Indians need
                    not cede lands faster than their changing status encouraged or required and that whites would not
                    demand more land than the orderly advance of their frontier necessitated or stimulated them to
                    require. The policy always presumed that cessions would be obtained before too much white expansion
                    overwhelmed nearby tribes. Under this policy whatever was good for white Americans was also assumed
                    desirable for Indians, 
                  
                     14 As its title suggests, Dippie's The Vanishing
                                American, takes as its special theme the presumably doomed native.
               
                     even if the tribes had to be manipulated against their own
                    inclinations for the larger good of all as whites judged those higher ends.Since white expansion was
                    presumed not only unpreventable but as desirable as it was ultimately inevitable, policies for
                    western lands and Indians contained a fundamental contradiction. In the end white policymakers like
                    their frontier followers favored white progress through expansion of white settlement in the near
                    future over the preservation of Indians on their native lands for the approbation of an abstract
                    posterity. The Land Ordinance of 1785 and the Northwest Ordinance applied to areas that needed to be
                    vacated of Indian title before the two acts could become effective in practice. The Land Ordinance,
                    for example, presumed cession of tribal lands in the Old Northwest from the very beginning of
                        survey.15 Likewise, the Northwest Ordinance could only operate in areas in
                    which 
                        United States
                     sovereignty had replaced tribal authority in actuality as well as in legal theory. The
                    territorial system, in fact, by creating new states in the West only added in practice to the
                    demands for faster Indian removal and land sales as the new representatives joined Congress. The
                    fight between the East and the West over Indian policy was not over the replacement of Indians by
                    Americans but over how soon and by what methods this was t o be accomplished.
            The anomaly built into the territorial system is conveyed well by the conflicting interests the
                    territorial governor was to serve. As Indian superintendent of his territory he was to protect the
                    Indians of his jurisdiction from white intrusion. As governor of the territory he was to aid whites
                    in their endeavors to bring the area under cultivation and progress. As commander of the
                    white-manned militia he was to order the enforcement of Indian regulations against local white
                    inhabitants as well as the protection of his white constituents against resentful Indians.16
            
            Some politicians, officials, and missionaries thought that the establishment of an exclusively Indian
                    territory would eliminate or at least mitigate the contradictions between white expansion and Indian
                    rights. Not until the 
                        Louisiana
                     Purchase so dramatically increased the area of the 
                        United States
                     did lands seem available for the creation of an all-Indian territory. The lands vacant

                     white settlements in the northern half of the purchase presented
                    an ideal opportunity in Jefferson's mind for exchanging tribal lands in the East for new
                    areas in the West with a guaranteed title. This proposition was written into the act erecting the
                    southern and more populated portion of the 
                        Louisiana
                     Purchase into the Orleans Territory in 1804.17
            
            Jefferson's idea of guaranteeing emigrant tribes title to their western lands was
                    reintroduced by President James 
                        Monroe
                     at the end of his second term as a way of inducing eastern tribes to remove westward.
                    As part of this plan 
                        Monroe
                     urged the establishment of a "system of internal government which shall
                    protect their property from invasion, and, by a regular progress of improvement and civilization,
                    prevent that degeneracy which has generally marked the transition from one to the other
                    state." 
                        The digest of such a government, with the consent of the Indians, which should be endowed
                            with sufficient power to meet all the objects contemplated—to connect the several
                            tribes together in a bond of amity and preserve order in each; to prevent intrusions on
                            their property; to teach them by regular instruction the arts and civilized life and make
                            them a civilized people—is an object of very high importance. It is the powerful
                            consideration which we have to offer to these tribes as an inducement to relinquish the
                            lands on which they now reside and to remove to those which are designated. It is not
                            doubted that this arrangement will present considerations of sufficient force to surmount
                            all their prejudices in favor of the soil of their nativity, no matter how strong they may
                                be.18
                  
                     For Secretary of War John C. Calhoun such a concession only made sense if the proposed
                    system of governance "would gradually unite the several tribes under a simple but
                    enlightened system of government, and laws formed on the priniciples of our own," and would
                    prepare the tribes to join in the larger forms of American government "at no distant
                        day."19
            
            At the end of 1825 the House of Representatives resolved in favor of such an exchange and "a
                    territorial Government over them of the same kind, and regulated by the same rules, that the
                    Territories of the 
                        United States
                     are now governed."20 Following the suggestion of Secretary
                    of War James Barbour,21 the House Committee on Indian Affairs reported a bill
                    "for the preservation and civilization

                     of the Indian Tribes within the 
                        United States
                    " that included a vague provision for the establishment of a territorial
                    government for the legally guaranteed permanent residence of the emigrant Indians. Section six
                    provided for the president to appoint, when he judged circumstances warranted, a governor,
                    secretary, and three judges. The legislative council and other officers were to be selected from the
                    "said Indians, as the President may deem proper." The president was to prescribe
                    the rules and regulations for the administration of such a government and define the duty of the
                        officers.22 The bill failed of passage.
            Forceful removal of the eastern Indians under Andrew Jackson made both the creation of a territorial
                    home for emigrant Indians and the governance of the emigrant tribes more pressing than under the
                    previous scheme of voluntary migration. As part of an overall plan for the governance of the tribal
                    relationships in the area t o which the eastern tribes removed and the accompanying reorganization
                    of the 
                        United States
                     Indian Office, the House's Committee on Indian Affairs reported a bill to
                    establish a "Western Territory" that would be guaranteed forever to the removed
                    tribes. Each of the tribes would continue to manage their own internal affairs through their current
                    form of tribal government, but a presidentially appointed governor, who acted also as superintendent
                    of Indian affairs for the territory, should call together the chiefs to form a confederacy to which
                    the Choctaws, Cherokees, and Creeks must consent. The annual general council should contain no fewer
                    than twenty-four men elected by the tribes or selected from the chiefs. As soon as possible all the
                    council members should be elected in line with the preferred American mode of representation. The
                    governor possessed absolute power to veto legislation and to convene and adjourn the council. The
                    confederated tribes could elect a delegate to Congress by a method prescribed by the council
                    "in order t o encourage the said tribes, and to promote their advancement in the arts of
                    civilized life, and to afford to them a convincing proof of the desire of the 
                        United States
                     that they may eventually be secured in all the blessings of free government, and
                    admitted to a full participation of the privileges now enjoyed by the American people."23 If the council was permitted to make laws for intertribal affairs, its Indian
                    members, as with all arbitrary territorial governments, were strictly under the control of the
                    federal government. What was proposed in other words was a modified second stage government adapted
                    to what was considered the Five Civilized Tribes' stage of acculturated progress.

            Opposition in Congress ranged from the arguments of John 
                        Quincy
                     Adams, serving in the House after his presidency, about the unconstitutionality of
                    stipulating specific forms of Indian governments in violation of treaties or of erecting an
                    all-Indian state to those stressing the despotic power given the president to control the territory
                    through his appointive powers or the specter that the precedent of a territory for Indians might
                    raise demands for one for a "deeper colored race."24 While the
                    bills codifying the trade and intercourse acts and the reorganization of the Indian Department
                    passed both houses of Congress and were signed into law, the Indian territorial bill twice failed of
                    passage in the House of Representatives. Later, in both 1837 and 1839, the Senate passed an Indian
                    territorial bill by a large majority, but each time it died in the House. Modifications demanded in
                    the series of bills suggest some of the specific issues: the territory should be allowed only an
                    agent in the capital, not a delegate to sit in Congress; the title of governor disappears in favor
                    of superintendent of Indian affairs; the method of selection and the number of tribal council
                    members varies; the official journal of proceedings must be kept in English; all laws passed by the
                    council must be accepted by the president. Throughout the decade of the 1830s, however, all versions
                    of the bills looked forward to the creation of a single consolidated political entity premised upon
                    the supercession if not also the destruction of the tribal governments and the continual
                    intervention of a paternalistic federal government.25
            
            As with the establishment of other territories, the creation of an Indian one raised questions over
                    the extension of slavery, sectional balance in Congress, and partisan opposition to executive
                    control over the temporary government. Congressmen, however, wondered in this instance whether the 
                        United States
                     should encourage the consolidation of Indian enemies or foster an Indian state. Still
                    others questioned whether even the Five Civilized Tribes let alone other tribes could ever reach a
                    stage of political progress in their own governments that warranted the equality conferred by
                    full-fledged statehood in the Union. In the end racist fears of fostering continued Indian
                    "otherness" by permitting an ethnically based territory won out over the American
                    ideal of self-government for all peoples in the 
                        United States

                  26 The legislative history of these efforts to erect an Indian Territory
                        before the Civil War may be followed in Abel, "Proposals for an Indian State";
                        Satz, American Indian Policy in the Jacksonian Era, chapters 5, 8; Prucha, Great Father, I, 302-309.
            
            
            Of course, all the plans always aimed a t creating an Indian government on the American model
                    complete with elections and representation proportional to population as opposed to either
                    traditional or acculturated Indian ways. The dilemma for officials, missionaries, and other whites
                    supporting the creation of an Indian territory was always how to permit a tribe's control
                    of its own affairs as so often guaranteed in the treaties of removal and yet direct the various
                    tribes into a new intertribal consolidated confederacy and council. The ultimate goal of all the
                    plans reduced to the idea advanced by the Baptist missionary Isaac McCoy, who so indefatigably
                    throughout the 1830s lobbied for such a territory and who hoped to preside over any Indian territory
                    created. Following McCoy's ideas, Thomas L. McKenney believed that the Indians should
                    "be placed under a Government, of which they shall form part, and in a Colonial relation to
                    the 
                        United States
                    .… In a Colony of course, the existing divisions among the Tribes would be
                    superseded by a General Gov't for the whole… ."27
                    Surely such colonization through confederation sought a cheaper and more efficient mode of
                    controlling the tribes, as the government Indian agents in the field told their charges, but it also
                    hoped to destroy tribal institutions and solidarity in favor of American ways.
            The Cherokee, Choctaw, and Creek of the so-called Civilized Tribes opposed all these efforts to
                    consolidate their governance and to supercede their own acculturated forms of government through
                    some political entity not controlled by themselves as violating the long-term treaty obligations of
                    the 
                        United States
                    . After all, their members had adopted in the 1820s white models of government complete
                    with constitutions and law codes, two-house legislatures, chief executives, courts and judges, and
                    the other trappings of the American way of governance at the behest of the federal government and
                    missionaries, and still the southern states demanded their removal. The 
                        Georgia
                     authorities even used the Cherokees' new republican form of government to
                    justify their removal on the grounds that under the federal Constitution a new state could not be
                    formed within the boundaries of an older one without its consent. Thus a temporary government for an
                    all-Indian territory might once again seem to threaten an imperium in imperio in
                    the opinion of some congressmen.
            The idea of an Indian territory based on customary American principles violated the Indians'
                    right to their own form of acculturated self-government as they had adapted to American
                    institutions.

                     As a result the Five Civilized Tribes long opposed any attempts
                    to erect an Indian territory according to the usual territorial model of arbitrary government as
                    destructive of their own forms of government and the supposed sovereignty they possessed. To them it
                    smacked of the customary paternalism and efforts to erode Indian rights if not to steal their lands
                    as well through allotment in severalty, which was so often part of the package. That other tribes
                    were to gain equal or even proportional representation in the territorial council with the Civilized
                    Tribes only further convinced the latter of the nefarious purposes of the territorial scheme.
            What the federal government was not able to achieve in consolidation of the Five Civilized Tribes on
                    their new lands and the imposition of a unified intertribal government before the Civil War, it
                    tried again after the ostensible defeat of the those tribes as allies of the Confederacy. The peace
                    treaties generally specified participation in an elected general council of the Indian tribes
                    presided over by a governor or superintendent of Indian affairs and the establishment of 
                        United States
                     courts and marshals as well as land cessions for other tribes still to be removed,
                    emancipation of Indian-owned slaves, and railroad rights of way across remaining tribal lands.28 For the following two decades numerous bills were presented for the formation
                    of a government for the tribes in the Indian territory, but none was enacted into law.29 Most of the bills provided for a system of government modified and elaborated from the
                    second stage as defined in the Northwest Ordinance with a two-house legislature with members usually
                    elected proportionally to tribal populations; a presidentially appointed governor (with veto),
                    attorneys and marshals, judges of supreme and district courts; and a delegate to the House of
                    Representatives elected by the council or the voters. Often these officers were required to take an
                    oath of loyalty to the 
                        United States
                     and its laws. Sometimes the bills specified that the legislators and others be of
                    Indian descent, and one bill proposed creating a territorial government staffed and elected by
                    American citizens of African descent. Many of the bills establishing territorial government also
                    provided for allotment in severalty and sales of the residual lands.
            No wonder tribal representatives strenuously opposed efforts at establishing territorial government
                    as unwarranted if not illegal intervention in tribal management of their own affairs, and

                     they linked railroad charters, allotment in severalty, and the
                    proposed territorial goverment with the continued loss of lands. They had agreed in the post-Civil
                    War peace treaties to the annual council, they argued, only in order to forestall further federal
                    intervention in the form of a single and alien form of territorial government. They held
                    specifically that their territory "was exclusively an Indian country, as
                    contradistinguished from a Territory of the 
                        United States
                    …" and guaranteed by treaty never to be subordinated to a territory
                    or state government.30
            
            Congress had always claimed, however, the sole right, even over the president of the 
                        United States
                     let alone the actual inhabitants of a place, to set the conditions for the erection of
                    a territory and the nature of its temporary government. As one Senate Report reminded the tribal
                    opposition in brusque language: 
                        While it is true that Congress should listen with patience and interest to suggestions from
                            this source [Indians], it should be constantly kept in mind that it is Congress who is to
                            prescribe a government for this Territory, and not the Indians who are to prescribe to
                            Congress how it shall be governed. The Congress of the 
                                United States
                             is not accustomed to ask the people who inhabit one of its Territories to
                            determine for it the form of government to be established. If this is not done with
                            intelligent American citizens, we are not disposed to depart from the rule in favor of those
                            whose political experience would necessarily entitle their advice to less consideration.31
                  
                     Blunt as the statement was, it merely applied longtime precedent in general territory
                    making to the Indians.
            Once again it was a clash of sovereignty, and in the long run the Five Civilized Tribes lost in favor
                    of American-defined progress. Congressmen seemed to believe, as one Senate Report of 1870 argued,
                    that the Fifteenth Amendment obligated Indian assimilation: 
                        It is in consonance with the new policy of the government, born of the war and matured by the
                            fifteenth amendment, that no alien race shall exist upon our soil; all shall be citizens
                            irrespective of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. It is part of the
                            inexorable logic of the times that the Indian must adapt himself to the rights and duties of
                            citizenship. He must wield the franchise and fulfill the obligations imposed thereby,
                            otherwise he will gradually disappear as the waste soil becomes more and more absorbed by
                            the increasing necessities of agriculture.32
                  
                     Another Senate committee in the same year, however, denied that the Fourteenth Amendment
                    gave citizenship to Indians still subject

                            Indian tribes in 1871. This report stated that tribes were domestic dependent nations and
                            anomalies in the national system. In the end the report declared Indians wards of the

                             and subject to the will of the federal government.

                     to tribal jurisdictions, and a court subsequently sustained
                    this opinion.33
            
            With the economic development of the states around the Indian Territory, white demands for lands and
                    resources of the native inhabitants of the territory increased in Congress as well as in tribal
                    councils. The policy of allotment in severalty offered in the eyes of the self-denominated Friends
                    of the Indians opportunities for the final Americanization of the Indians through their
                    detribalization. Forced settlement upon small farms patented to their owners eventually would
                    destroy the communal foundations of tribal society in favor of American individualism. Other white
                    but crasser citizens saw only the surplus lands being sold to good capitalists of their own kind.
            The devastating General Allotment Act of 1886, which forced the breakup of tribal lands into
                    individually owned homesteads according to the American way of property holding, excluded the Five
                    Civilized Tribes from its provisions because of their adamant opposition. After 1889, however, the
                    lands of other tribes in the western half of the Indian Territory rapidly opened to white settlement
                    in the famous series of land rushes. Congress established the territory of 
                        Oklahoma
                     with a second-stage government to embrace these areas as they opened to white
                    settlement, once again demonstrating the relationship between ethnicity and territory making.34
            
            Although the Five Civilized Tribes sought to organize the Indian Territory as a separate state with
                    the continuation of their own tribal governments and land tenure customs, Congress had other plans.
                    Those tribes' lands were brought under special allotment in the early years of the
                    twentieth century; thus, the tribes and their land patterns were prepared eventually to enter the
                    union as Americanized people. When the land basis of the tribal societies was dispersed as
                    homesteads, the legal basis for the tribal governments was considered dissolved in the view of
                    official 
                        United States
                     policy. As a consequence of these actions Congress in 1901 declared all the Indians of
                    the Indian Territory American citizens.
            Should 
                        Oklahoma
                     Territory and the Indian Territory be admitted as one or two states? Whites in the two
                    territories favored both sides of the question because of the different government and legal system
                    in the officially organized 
                        Oklahoma
                     Territory as opposed to the unorganized Indian Territory. The Civilized Tribes favored
                    separate admission, once convening a constitutional

                     convention in 1902 and drafting a constitution for a state to
                    be named Sequoyah. After a fact-finding expedition to the Southwest in late 1902, Indiana Senator
                    Albert J. Beveridge, chairman of the Senate Committee on Territories, favored the admission of the
                    two territories as a unified 
                        Oklahoma
                     because of the large "energetic" (white) American population that
                    predominated even in the Indian territory.35 When tribal authority and
                    institutions disappeared in 1906 in the area traditionally governed by the Five Civilized Tribes,
                    Congress was persuaded finally to pass an act enabling a constitutional convention to draw up a
                    constitution for the unified state of 
                        Oklahoma
                    . 
                        Oklahoma
                     was admitted as a single, preponderantly white state in 1907. About a third of its new
                    citizens were Indian, and its new state constitution, by requirement of Congress, forbade the sale
                    of alcohol to them.
            Did Congress ever intend the Indian Territory to become an Indian state equal to other states in the
                    Union? Congress never created a government for the territory when Indians predominated and never
                    permitted a delegate to Congress from those tribes that were allowed one by treaty. Clearly tribal
                    Indian and American citizen were considered opposing roles. Only through allotment and
                    detribalization were Indians made citizens and permitted to become part of an American state. To the
                    extent that Congress considered establishing a n Indian territorial government, it was usually a
                    device for acculturation and assimilation of aboriginal inhabitants according to the ideals of
                    Americanism.
            Congressional efforts to create an ethnically Indian territory revealed the fundamental contradiction
                    between the ideology of Americanism as a set of supposedly universal ideals and their ethnic biases
                    as applied t o the Indian. That Congress considered so many bills establishing an ethnic Indian
                    territory and that the Senate even passed two of them speaks to the ideal of incorporating Indians
                    into 
                        United States
                     society as self-governing peoples on the model of other territories. That no one bill
                    ever passed both houses speaks to the ethnic prejudices of Americanism vis-á-vis the
                    Indian. Partisan opposition and sectional balance played their role in the failure of these bills to
                    become laws, but the debates over the nature of the proposed governments as well as the actual
                    administration employed provide evidence of the usual ambivalence 
                  
                     35 In 1902 the Majority Report of the Senate Committee on Territories
                            outlined the criteria for granting statehood: "The advancement of the people, their
                            state of life, their familiarity and sympathy with our institutions, their educational
                            condition, and all the elements that go to make up good citizenship are to he equally
                            considered." Thus the report devotes much space to languages spoken and read,
                            literacy in English, educational institutions, economic progress, and numbers of population
                            by ethnicity. Senate Committee on Territories, Majority Report, "New Statehood

                     of Americans in incorporating those they considered
                    Un-Americans into their society. The lesson of this Indian territorial history would seem to be that
                    the erection of a new territory, like the admission of a new state, depended upon the prevalence of
                    an ethnically acceptable—that is, "American"—population as
                    well as the predominance of the same kind of Americans in running the government.
            Alaskan history under American jurisdiction offers further proof of this hypothesis for Indian
                    peoples. Article three of the treaty of purchase exempted the "uncivilized native
                    tribes" from its provision for granting the residents of Alaska the rights, advantages, and
                    immunities of 
                        United States
                     citizens.36 Congress at first classified Alaska with its
                    overwhelmingly native population of Indians, Eskimos, and Aleuts as part of Indian country according
                    to the Indian Intercourse Act of June 30, 1834. The 
                        United States
                     Army, Customs, and Navy administered in succession the new land for fourteen years
                    after cession, in so far as it could be said to be governed at all, before Congress designated
                    Alaska in 1884 not even a territory but a "civil and judicial district." This
                    novel government resembled a highly arbitrary first stage of territorial government under the rule
                    of a governor, district judge, clerk of court, marshal and four deputy marshals, and four
                    commissioners who acted like justices of the peace. With the administration of Alaska under far
                    greater federal control than was usual in early territorial government at the time, Congress refused
                    to extend the Constitution to Alaskans and prohibited, as in other areas defined as Indian country,
                    the importation of liquor.37
            
            The influx of American population after the Klondike strike renewed petitions to Congress for
                    self-government through territorial status, but congressmen still thought the white miners too
                    migratory and the natives too unprepared for the responsibilities of American-style government. By
                    the early twentieth century the whole issue of Alaskan governance had become entwined with
                    conservation, partisan politics, and exploitation of the natural resources

                                Statutes at Large, XIV, 539. Article 3 reads in part: "They, with the
                            exception of uncivilized native tribes, shall be admitted to the enjoyment of all rights,
                            advantages, and immunities of citizens of the 
                                United States

                     of America's northern outpost. Some congressmen looked
                    to reducing Alaska to commonwealth or some other status to keep these Un-Americans out of the Union
                    along with the Spanish inhabitants of the new empire acquired a t the end of the Spanish-American
                        War.38 Congress, however, authorized a territorial delegate in 1906 and
                    organized finally a proper territorial government with elective legislature in 1912, when
                    congressmen also admitted into the Union the last two territories in the continental contiguous 
                        United States
                    . Unlike other territories in the past, however, almost all the land of Alaska remained
                    not only under the control of the federal government but under its ownership legally, which was the
                    usual case of lands claimed and occupied by Indians but under 
                        United States
                     sovereignty and trusteeship.
            Although World War II, the Korean conflict, and superpower geopolitical considerations brought
                    military and other white American population to Alaska after 1940, many of the old congressional
                    complaints about the nature of the population, the harsh climate, and the lack of indigenous free
                    enterprise combined with the federal ownership of 99 percent of the land, all abetted by partisan
                    politics, stalled statehood. Only in 1958 did Alaska finally become the forty-ninth state. Sparse as
                    the population appeared to the eyes of many congressmen, "Americans" outnumbered
                    the natives by six to one in accord with the history of previous territories. By that time, however,
                    the native population had elected Indian and Eskimo members of the territorial legislature.
            A drama traditional in nineteenth century history is being replayed in modern Alaska: who will
                    develop and benefit from the natural resources? Will the new drama created by the Alaska Native
                    Claims Settlement Act and its supplements lead t o a different ending than those played in the
                    previous century? Only the future conclusion of this drama will prove whether the relationships
                    traditional between territory making and Indian peoples' lives and resources has a t last
                    found a new ending.39
            
            Expansion with honor as a policy for 
                        United States
                     Indian relations was bound to fail not only because of the impossibility of maintaining
                    the delicate balance between tribal and white interests presumed a t its base but also because
                    American ethnocentrism only permitted solutions to the "Indian problem" on terms
                    limited by white ideals. Such ethnic onesidedness shaped first the seemingly generous policy
                    enunciated in the third article of the Northwest

                     Ordinance and then the efforts at erecting an Indian territory
                    modeled on its provisions. In the end the territorial system presumed governments elected and run by
                    white Americans, for those dominant in the 
                        United States
                     denied as an ideal and refused to recognize in practice the plural society the nation
                    was. As a consequence, Indian peoples were long refused citizenship in the nation of their birth and
                    treated as problems to be solved rather than as cultures to be accepted. The ideological basis of
                    Americanism demanded that all other peoples adopt American ideals in order to be fully accepted in
                    the national society, but the ethnic bias of Americans if not Americanism itself classified certain
                    peoples as "others" too un-American to be assimilated.
            No peoples proved the paradox inherent in Americanism more than those collectively designated Indian by the white populace. That American colonies were known as territories
                    further concealed the nature of the native peoples' plight as the result of an ambivalent,
                    but imperial, Americanism. Americanism in its best interpretation—as a code of high
                    ideals—blinded most politicians, intellectuals, and other citizens to the continued
                    efforts of native peoples to maintain separate societies and cultures. The American territorial
                    system provided and demanded but one kind of governmental model for all peoples. If America was
                    plural in ethnicity and Americanism was ambivalent in ideal, the history of Indian relations in
                    general and the history of Indian territory making in specific shows that the motto of e pluribus unum applied both to ethnicity and government in the American way of doing
                    things for (and to) Indians.
         
         
         
            
               Liberty's Legacy: A Review Essay
            
                    George W. Geib"
                    *
                
            Between July, 1987, and June, 1988, a remarkable exhibit will tour each of the six states of the Old
                    Northwest, offering visitors an opportunity to observe a significant collection of documents and
                    illustrations connected with the bicentennial of two great texts of freedom: the 
                        United States
                     Constitution and the Northwest Ordinance. The exhibit is a collaborative effort
                    sponsored by the alumni associations of the nine Big Ten universities located within the Old
                    Northwest and six libraries and historical societies within those states. Commencing a t the 
                        Ohio
                     Historical Society in 
                        Columbus
                     on July 1, 1987, the exhibit is scheduled to tour in sequence the Lilly Library on the
                    campus of Indiana University in 
                        Bloomington
                    ; the William L. Clements Library of American History on the campus of the University of
                            
                  Michigan, Ann
                            Arbor
               ; the Newberry Library in 
                  Chicago, Illinois
               ; the
                    State Historical Society of 
                        Wisconsin
                     in 
                        Madison
                    ; and the 
                        Minnesota
                     Historical Society in 
                        Minneapolis
                    . Relying upon materials drawn exclusively from the collections of these six host
                    institutions, and particularly from the Clements and the Lilly libraries, the exhibit is, like its
                    subjects, of both regional and national significance.
            The exhibition contains 122 items, 63 of which deal with the Ordinance and 59 with the Constitution,
                    testifying to the richness and variety of source materials available within the Midwest. Materials
                    from the Clements Library dominate the treatment of the Northwest Ordinance, while the Lilly
                    Library's collections are paramount in the treatment of the Constitution. The exhibit,
                    however, approaches the two documents in very different ways. Items dealing with the Constitution
                    focus upon the critical years from the 
                        Annapolis
                     convention in 1786 to the tardy ratification by Rhode 
                  
                     * George W. Geib is professor of history, 
                                Butler
                             University, 
                                Indianapolis

                     Island in 1790 and explore in detail the process of writing and
                    approving the document. Items dealing with the Ordinance on the other hand range over more than a
                    century from the dawning concern for western issues in the 1750s to the admission of the last of the
                    Old Northwest states, 
                        Minnesota
                    , in 1859. The treatment of the Constitution—relying almost exclusively upon
                    contemporary newspapers, pamphlets, and manuscripts—attests to the current significance
                    of the study and the interpretation of basic texts by both academic and public figures. Four-fifths
                    of the Constitutional entries focus upon the process of ratification, stressing the remarkable
                    variety of arguments and viewpoints that emerged in the months immediately following the adjournment
                    of the 
                        Philadelphia
                     convention. Announcements of ratification parades stand next to heated denunciations by
                    critics later termed Anti-Federalist, a vivid preface to the range of celebration and analysis that
                    the planners of the exhibit undoubtedly hoped to encourage. The particular selection of pamphlet and
                    newspaper articles further suggests that the exhibit's organizers were often influenced by
                    the current emphasis upon the ideology of republicanism as a shaping force in explaining and
                    producing the constitutional system.
            The materials dealing with the Northwest Ordinance on the other hand show a special concern for the
                    visual representation of the West by cartographers, engravers, and popular cartoonists, whose varied
                    products represent fully half the items in this portion of the exhibit. Here the emphasis is upon
                    image rather than upon text, with planners of the exhibit striving to trace the progress and
                    accomplishments of the Northwest Ordinance within the larger context of the progress of settlement
                    and comprehension of the trans-Appalachian West. Some viewers may question the comparatively heavy
                    emphasis upon the Indian wars and treaties of the period between 1790 and 1815. All will be
                    impressed, however, by the remarkable contributions of geographers and mapmakers to both official
                    and public understanding of the background and implications of the survey and settlement provisions
                    of the Ordinance. The exhibit is both a tribute and an invitation to interdisciplinary study.
            Considerations of space in six very different host facilities imposed severe limitations upon the
                    designers of the display itself and tended to separate the more visually striking maps and prints
                    from the rows of printed materials. Combined with the subdued lighting necessary to preserve ink and
                    paper, the display cases are sometimes more a feast for mind than for eye. Yet many items retain
                    their inherent fascination: Thomas Jefferson's copy of The Federalist
                    papers with his handwritten attributions of authorship, Rufus 
                        Putnam
                    's detailed map of a model township in the new territory, and George 
                        Washington
                    's letter accepting the presidency in 1789 are among the gems of the
                    collection. The midwestern sense  of place shines through the
                    exhibition, from Lord Shelburne's detailed manuscript map of the deployment of British
                    forces in the 1760s, through Thomas Hutchinson's map of the River 
                        Ohio
                     from Fort Pitt to the 
                        Mississippi
                     (with detailed notation of great elephant bones at Big Bone Lick), to Fielding
                    Lucas's map of the 
                        Michigan
                     Territory in 1824. Gilbert Stuart's portrait of 
                        Washington
                    , pencil sketches of the five American commissioners for the Treaty of Ghent, and James
                    Lewis's color lithograph of the Shawnee Prophet are among the portraits that lend a human
                    and personal dimension t o the study of union, self-government, and expansion.
            Those unable to visit the exhibition may still capture an excellent sense of both its content and its
                    design through the attractive catalog prepared to accompany the tour.1
                    Liberty's Legacycontains specific citations to each of the exhibit
                    entries together with explanatory notes that are in most cases more detailed than the descriptive
                    cards in the display itself. Accompanying the text are illustrations of sixty-two of the exhibit
                    entries, fourteen of which are presented in full color. Browsers will enjoy many of the colorful and
                    insightful details of the individual entries, although at times the link between particular items
                    and the overall theme of the exhibit is not clearly developed. The entries properly focus upon the
                    historical background and significance of the material in the exhibition. Quite apparent, however,
                    is the obvious care and consideration that the donors and curators of the host institutions have
                    shown in assembling and preserving these significant and sometimes unique materials.
            
               Liberty's Legacy also contains two informed popular introductions to the
                    ideas and themes raised by the documents in the exhibit. Pauline Maier's essay on the 
                        United States
                     Constitution focuses upon the traditional theme of the critical period in American
                    history and upon the attempts of young men of the American Revolution t o find a system of
                    government that could indeed balance order with liberty. Unlike the ratification-focused materials
                    of the exhibition, she concentrates upon the central issues that were raised in the 
                        Philadelphia
                     convention itself, striving to lay a foundation within which the later debates in the
                    state conventions can be placed and understood. Maier is particularly concerned with the definition
                    of federalism and with the complicated theoretical plans and practical compromises that resulted in,
                    as she styles it, "a new form of government."2 Her attached

                     itself, is a tribute to the enduring influence of Max Farrand
                    and the contemporary importance of Gordon S. Wood.
            In "The Importance of the Northwest Ordinance," Peter S. Onuf summarizes many of
                    the themes and insights that he has ably developed in his recent writings. The essay will be of
                    particular interest to midwestern readers. Here the focus is upon union, upon the desire of eastern
                    political leaders to incorporate the West within the American system of government, but to
                    incorporate it under terms and conditions that would support, rather than threaten, the established
                    political order. Onuf concentrates upon the theme of responsibility within the Ordinance, noting
                    that its provisions for education, secure land title, and gradual development of self-government
                    were consistent with a desire to attract settlers of substance and judgment to the Old Northwest. He
                    is careful to point out a close link between the Ordinance adopted in 
                        New York
                     in July of 1787 and the Constitution being framed a t the same time in 
                        Philadelphia
                    . At the same time he recognizes the fact that while the authors of the Ordinance
                    envisioned the expansion of the American system, they also envisioned the document's own
                    extinction as it was gradually replaced by the constitutions of the new states of the Northwest
                    Territory. Onuf effectively suggests that the Ordinance has played both real and symbolic functions
                    within the American Midwest and that it is best understood through appreciation of "the
                    challenges facing earlier generations" in the process of settlement.3
                    He is deeply impressed by the irony inherent in a document designed to promote union and yet, in its
                    antislavery provisions, ultimately capable of contributing to a sense of sectionalism.
            
               Liberty's Legacy is, in short, public programming of a high order. In its
                    blend of analytic interest, archival attention, and celebratory display, it suggests the rich range
                    of approaches available to students of both national and regional culture in 1988. Just as the
                    Revolutionary bicentennial of 1976 provided springboards to subsequent study and programming, so the
                    Big Ten traveling exhibit invites Americans to explore and probe the role played by the great texts
                    of 1787 in understanding both past and present in Indiana and the nation.
