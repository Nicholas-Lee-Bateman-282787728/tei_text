            The Newspaper Press of the Calumet Region, 1836–1933

            Solon Robinson published the first newspaper in the Calumet Region at Lake Court
                    House, later 
                        Crown Point
                    , in 1836 or 1837.1 Robinson owned a small press
                    on which he printed handbills, legal notices, songs, and poems expressing his
                    political and temperance views. Occasionally he published a newspaper variously
                    known as the Great Western or Western
                    Ranger. Robinson was particularly active in behalf of William Henry
                    Harrison, the Whig candidate for the presidency in 1840, and his songs and poems
                    were distributed to many newspapers in the state. During the campaign he took
                    his printing equipment to the Log Cabin Convention in honor of Harrison at the 
                        Tippecanoe
                     Battleground, where he turned out songs and other literature for
                    distribution to the crowd.2
            
            Robinson sold the press and type in 1842 to James S. Castle of 
                        Valparaiso
                    . Castle had published the 
                  
                            Michigan
                         City Gazette, said to have been the first newspaper in 
                        Laporte County
                    , from 1835 to 1841. In 1842 Castle started the 
                  
                            Porter County
                         Republican, the earliest paper in that county, at 
                        Valparaiso
                     with Robinson's press. This newspaper, a weekly, was
                    independent in politics while under Castle's direction.3 William M. Harrison purchased the 
                  
                            Porter County
                         Republican in 1844, changed its name to the Western Ranger, and made it a Democratic sheet. In 1847 William C.
                    Talcott, a Free Soil Democrat, bought a half interest in the paper.

                     1 The Calumet Region includes the northern
                            portions of Porter and Lake counties. The region is drained by the
                            Little Calumet and Grand Calumet rivers. Robinson founded 
                                Crown Point
                             and was instrumental in its becoming the county seat of 
                                Lake County
                            . He achieved national prominence as agricultural editor of
                            the

                     abolitionist articles by Talcott and
                    Democratic editorials by Harrison appeared on the same page.4 Talcott bought Harrison's interest in 1849, and the paper
                    became the Practical Observer. It continued as an abolitionist
                    paper until 1854, when Talcott joined the newly organized Republican party.
                    Weekly and semiweekly editions of the Practical Observer were
                    issued until September, 1853, when a daily was published, the first in the
                        region.5 R. A. Cameron purchased the Practical Observer in 1857 and changed its name to the 
                  
                            Valparaiso
                         Republican. As such it was the official spokesman of the
                    Republican party in 
                        Porter County
                    .6 The Republican passed into
                    the hands of Thomas McConnell, William C. Talcott, and Henry W. Talcott in 1858.
                    Cameron recovered control of the paper the next year, and the daily edition was
                        discontinued.7 In September, 1860, Cameron dropped the
                    last two letters from the paper's name, and it became the 
                  
                            Valparaiso
                         Republic.
            
            Democratic papers had a difficult time in 
                        Porter County
                     for some years after the formation of the Republican party. L. H.
                    Miller started the 
                  
                            Porter County
                         Democrat at 
                        Valparaiso
                     in 1856. The paper, which was later sold to A. Lytle Jones and J.
                    L. Rock, expired shortly after the elections of 1860.8 C. C.
                    Morricle established the 
                  
                            Valparaiso
                         Democrat in 1864, only to see it go the way of many
                    Democratic organs in that part of Indiana during the Civil War. The paper died
                    after a few weeks for lack of patronage.9
            
            Cameron, the owner of the 
                  
                            Valparaiso
                         Republic, joined the Union army in 1861, and E. A. Beebe
                    obtained control of the paper. The former served as corresponding editor and
                    sent home long, spicy letters about his experiences. Beebe was unable to finance
                    the paper, and in 1863 it reverted to Cameron and his wife, Jane E. Cameron.
                    Aaron Gurney became the editor, but its publication was discontinued in
                    December, 1863, when he resigned. 
                        Valparaiso
                     had no newspaper until January, 1866, when Cameron returned from
                    the army and revived the 
                  
                            Valparaiso
                         Republic. G. A. Pierce bought the paper in November, 1866,
                    and immediately sold it

            An important development in the history of 
                        Porter County
                     journalism occurred in 1871 when German-born Englebert Zimmerman
                    founded the 
                  
                            Valparaiso
                         Messenger. The Messenger was the first
                    successful Democratic newspaper in the Calumet Region. Zimmerman had published
                    the 
                  
                            Columbia
                         City News from 1860 to 1864, then founded the 
                  
                            Columbia
                         City Post in 1864, and later worked for the 
                        
                            Fort Wayne
                        Democrat. When Democratic leaders in 
                        Valparaiso
                     persuaded him to move his equipment there, he was the publisher of
                    the Wyandot Democratic-Union at Upper Sandusky, 
                        Ohio
                    . Zimmerman was an unusually able journalist and under his guidance
                    the 
                  
                            Valparaiso
                         Messenger became vigorous and prosperous. He supplemented
                    his income by doing printing for the Northern Indiana Normal School, later 
                        Valparaiso
                     University. In 1881 Henry Baker Brown, owner of the school, bought
                    a half interest in the 
                  
                            Valparaiso
                         Messenger but held it for only a short time.12 Englebert Zimmerman died in 1906, and his son, Arthur E. Zimmerman,
                    was city editor and managing editor of the Messenger until his
                    death in 1914. The following year Hinman F. Strother of Pitts-field, 
                        Illinois
                    , purchased the Messenger from the Zimmerman
                    estate. In 1924 he sold a half interest to Lynn M. Whipple of Niles, 
                        Michigan
                    , who gained complete control of the paper the next year.13
            
            The 
                  
                            Valparaiso
                         Herald was started by P. O. Sullivan in 1881. The Herald was well edited and popular because of its full
                    coverage of local news but, unable to survive on subscriptions alone, stopped
                    publication in two or three years.14 James A. McConahy

                    1929 Whipple bought the interests of the Mavitys, who retired from the local

                        Porter County
                     section of the region.
            Chesterton, located in Westchester Township between 
                        Valparaiso
                     and Lake 
                        Michigan
                    , was the only other town in the 
                        Porter County
                     part of the region to have a successful newspaper. The Chesterton Tribune, published by W. W. Mikels, was started on October
                    28, 1882.16 During the latter part of 1883 it passed into
                    the hands of a group of Chesterton businessmen headed by John T. Taylor. In
                    June, 1884, Arthur J. Bowser and Samuel D. Watson purchased the paper. Bowser
                    gained complete control of the Chesterton Tribune in
                    September, 1884, following which he published and edited it for almost forty
                    years. A native of 
                        Valparaiso
                    , Bowser had attended the Northern Indiana Normal School and was one
                    of the editors of the 
                  
                            Porter County
                         Vidette before coming to Chesterton.17
                    He was an able newspaperman who made the Chesterton Tribune
                    one of the most widely read weeklies in the region. Bowser kept a sharp eye on
                    local and regional events and developments which were faithfully reported to the
                        Tribune's readers. The local news was fully
                    covered in the columns, "Chesterton Chips" and
                    "Porter Pointers," the latter containing news of Porter,
                    Chesterton's sister community.
            Although Chesterton and Porter were less than a mile apart, Bowser in July, 1894,
                    demonstrated his faith in the latter's industrial potential by
                    establishing the Porter Tribune, which he also edited. But
                    Porter's subsequent development did not justify his hopes, and in
                    April, 1896, Bowser combined his two papers into the Westchester
                        Tribune,

                            Chesterton Tribune, October 28, 1882. There was a
                            statement in the Chesterton Tribune, April 8, 1904,
                            that the paper was started in 1881 as an organ of the Greenback party.
                            No evidence has been found that such was the case. The issue of the Chesterton Tribune, October 28, 1882, was listed as
                            Volume I, Number 1. The complete files of the Chesterton
                                Tribune are located at its office in Chesterton.

                     published at Chesterton. Through this step
                    he hoped to provide better services for Chesterton, Porter, Baileytown, and
                    Waverly, all in Westchester Township.18 The name of the
                    paper again became the Chesterton Tribune in November, 1897.
                    In April, 1923, Bowser sold the paper to John G. Graessle, who had been his
                    foreman for almost thirty years. Bowser had too much printer's ink in
                    his veins to remain out of the newspaper field. Early in 1934 he began to edit a
                    column knowns as "Siftings—Gleaned from Hither and Yon and
                    Now and Then—and Way Back When" for the 
                        Valparaiso
                    
                    Vidette-Messenger. This interesting column, which he continued
                    until shortly before his death in July, 1935, was devoted largely to local
                    history as recalled by Bowser and by contributors from 
                        Porter County
                    .19 After Graessle's death in 1928 his
                    widow sold the Chesterton Tribune to 
                        Warren
                     G. Canright, a graduate of Lawrence College at Appleton, 
                        Wisconsin
                    , who had operated a printing company in North 
                        Chicago
                    , 
                        Illinois
                    , for three years after World War I. He was with the 
                  
                            Chicago
                         Tribune for five years before coming to Chesterton.20
            
            The 
                        Lake County
                     portion of the region was without a newspaper for fifteen years
                    after Solon Robinson discontinued his little sheet in 1842. Its population
                    obviously did not justify a journalistic endeavor in those years, for there were
                    only 3,991 persons in the entire county in 1850.21
                    
                        Crown Point
                    , a village of thirty-five dwellings and three stores in 1849,22 was not incorporated as a town until 1868. The Western Ranger, later the Practical
                    Observer, of 
                        Valparaiso
                     devoted space to news of 
                        Crown Point
                     and had a large circulation in that vicinity for several years. The
                    success of the Observer in 
                        Lake County
                     convinced Janna S. Holton, John Wheeler, and Zerah H. Summers, all
                    related by marriage, that a local Republican newspaper was needed at 
                        Crown Point
                    . They invested $300.00 in the purchase of a press and
                    type and established the 
                  
                            Lake County
                         Herald at the county seat in 1856. Rodney Dunning, a 
                        Valparaiso
                     newspaperman, was persuaded by a guarantee of subscriptions
                    equivalent to $300.00 a year to edit the paper." Dunning
                    proved to be a poor choice to guide the paper; at least its

                     failure after a few months was blamed on
                    what was regarded as his "shiftless unconcern."24 Wheeler and Summers purchased Helton's interest in the Herald's equipment and founded the 
                  
                            Crown Point
                         Register in August, 1857.25
            
            The publishers of the 
                  
                            Crown Point
                         Register may well be regarded as the fathers of 
                        Lake County
                     journalism. Wheeler was born in 
                        Connecticut
                     and came to 
                        Crown Point
                     in 1847. The next few years he worked as a farmer in the summers
                    and as a teacher during the winters. Wheeler learned surveying from his father
                    in the Kankakee swamps and was elected surveyor of 
                        Lake County
                     in 1853. Summers, also a surveyor, had worked on the 
                        Cleveland
                     and 
                        Toledo
                     Railroad and came to 
                        Crown Point
                     in 1854. He was Wheeler's assistant as county surveyor.26
            
            The 
                  
                            Crown Point
                         Register was the spokesman of the Republican party in 
                        Lake County
                     and enjoyed a large circulation from the very beginning. Wheeler
                    and Summers soon discovered, as did many publishers in the early period, that a
                    successful journal needed subscribers who would pay cash in advance for the
                    paper. At the end of the first year of the Register's
                    existence they announced that $800.00 had been "trusted
                    out" and that henceforth the credit system was to be abandoned.27 John Wheeler's newspaper career ended in April,
                    1861, when he joined the Union army. Summers, who was elected clerk of 
                        Lake County
                     in 1859, evidently found the task of publishing a newspaper too

                     in January, 1860. The paper was owned by J. A. Berry and its first
                    editor was B. D. Harper. The latter was soon succeeded by Joseph P. Smith.
                    Smith's connection with the paper immediately brought favors from the
                    Buchanan administration, and he became the local postmaster and was also made

                     strength demonstrated by the Republicans in
                    the elections of 1860 was proof that a Democratic paper could not be published
                    successfully at 
                        Crown Point
                    , at least at that time. In April, 1861, the Jeffersonian's plant was sold to two tramp printers, Charles
                    Alvord and one Desmond, who immediately sold it to a third party whose identity
                    was never discovered. Alvord and Desmond hurriedly left 
                        Crown Point
                     owing the original proprietors of the paper $600.00 of
                    the purchase price. The presses and type mysteriously disappeared one night from
                    the old Chapman Hotel on the west side of the public square, where the paper had
                    been printed; "not a track was left for a trail to show which way it
                    had gone."30
            
            The arrival of the first railroad in 1865 immediately increased the population of 
                        Crown Point
                     and that part of the county through which it passed. The boom that
                    followed was characterized by increased activity in the local newspaper field.
                    Harper and Beattie published the 
                  
                            Crown Point
                         Register from 1862 to 1866, when Samuel E. Ball purchased
                    Harper's interest. The following year Ball sold out to Frank S. Bedell,
                    a veteran newspaperman formerly with the 
                        
                            Dubuque

               31 Bedell became the Register's sole owner when Beattie died in 1869 but
                    sold an interest in the paper to C. W. Ainsworth in 1875. H. M. Ingrim started
                    the 
                  
                            Crown Point
                         Herald in 1872 to support Horace Greeley for president in
                    that year's election. Timothy 
                        Cleveland
                     purchased the Herald in October, 1872, but sold
                    it to James J. Miller and John F. Rowins in November, 1873. Although the plant
                    was immediately destroyed by fire, new equipment was installed and the 
                  
                            Crown Point
                         Herald was continued. Miller bought Rowins'
                    interest in January, 1875, and in December of that year sold the paper to Bedell
                    and Ainsworth, who merged it with the 
                  
                            Crown Point
                         Register. The following year John J. Wheeler purchased
                    Ainsworth's interest in the paper. Wheeler disposed of his share in the
                        Register to John Millikan in 1880.32
            
            Millikan was one of the most experienced as well as one of the ablest of the many
                    editors at 
                        Crown Point
                     in this period. He had been connected with the 
                  
                            South Bend
                         Free Press from 1837 to 1845, when he moved to 
                        La Porte
                     and purchased the 
                  
                            La Porte
                         Whig, which became the 
                  
                            La Porte
                         Union in 1852. Millikan went to

                        Crown Point
                     in 1877 and established the 
                  
                            Crown Point
                         Cosmos, an unusually interesting paper. Much of the
                    material in the Cosmos reportedly came from 
                        La Porte
                    . Millikan discontinued the paper after three years to do active
                    work on the 
                  
                            Crown Point
                         Register.
               33 In 1882 Millikan bought
                    Bedell's interest in the Register and became its sole
                    owner. The paper prospered under his guidance and was a strong influence in
                    behalf of the Republican party in 
                        Lake County
                    . Millikan sola the

                         Register to Allison A. Bibler in 1891 and retired from
                    newspaper work.34 Bibler, who had worked on the Chesterton Tribune before coming to 
                        Crown Point
                    , published the paper for seven years and then sold it to Charles J.
                    Davidson. He recovered control of the 
                  
                            Crown Point
                         Register in 1914 and ran the paper until his death in
                        1941.35
            
            The position of the Wheeler family as the first family of 
                        Crown Point
                     journalism was largely due to John J. Wheeler, the able son of John
                    Wheeler, one of the founders of the 
                  
                            Crown Point
                         Register. John J. Wheeler married Belle Holton, a
                    granddaughter of Solon Robinson. His first journalistic effort was the
                    publication of the Young Hoosier for about five months in 1875
                    at 
                        Crown Point
                    .36 In October, 1880, Wheeler bought the 
                  
                            Crown Point
                         Herald, a Democratic paper founded in 1878, from John
                    Griswold and began the publication of the 
                  
                            Lake County
                         Star, a Republican organ.37 From its
                    very beginning, the Star was probably the strongest weekly in 
                        Lake County
                    . In 1904 it was said that the paper had the best equipment and the
                    largest circulation in northwestern Indiana. John J. Wheeler died in 1917. The
                        
                  
                            Lake County
                         Star came under the control of his son, Fred Young
                    Wheeler, who had been schooled in the newspaper business by his father since he
                    was seventeen years old.38
            
            The 
                        Crown Point
                    
                    Freie Presse was one of the best edited and most influential
                    of the German-language newspapers in the Calumet Region. It began in 1874 and
                    was originally owned by John Lehmann, John H. Meyers, and John J. Wheeler.
                    Lehmann, who was born in 
                        Switzerland
                     , became sole owner of the paper after a short time and converted
                    it into a Democratic organ. The Freie Presse had a large

                    whom could not read English. In 1900 Henry Barck was the editor of the paper.39 No evidence was found to indicate when the Freie Presse was discontinued, but there was little need for
                    German-language newspapers among the second generation of Germans.
            Hobart, one of the small communities in the region, was more than adequately
                    served by newspapers in the early years. The Hobart Journal,
                    founded by Paul J. Kelley in 1877, was the town's earliest newspaper.
                    The Journal was absorbed by the Hammond Western
                        Indiana Tribune, later the Hammond Tribune, when that
                    paper was established in 1880. As the Hobart Tribune, a
                    Republican paper, it was printed in Hammond and issued as late as 1889.40 Porter B. Towle of Hammond, a brother of Marcus M. Towle,
                    the founder of that city, started the Hobart Transcript in
                    1882. Towle published the Transcript, which was also printed
                    in Hammond, for only a short time.41 The Hobart
                        Gazette was founded in 1889 by George Narpass and George Bender. Andrew
                    J. Smith purchased the paper in 1890 and two years later sold a half interest to
                    Nevin B. White. Smith being a Democrat and White a Republican, the Hobart Gazette was published as an independent paper.42 The Hobart News, a Republican paper, was started in
                    1907 by A. A. Keelor. It came into the possession of A. L. Pattee in 1912.43
            
            Newspapers started slowly in Hammond. Most of the original settlers in that area
                    were Germans. Their numbers increased when the George H. Hammond Packing
                    Company, established in 1869, showed a preference for German butchers and
                    sausage-makers. As a large number came directly from the old country and could
                    not read English, German-language newspapers from 
                        Chicago
                     and Milwaukee had a large circulation in the community.
                    English-language papers did not do well there until the second generation of
                    Germans matured and until native-born workers from nearby states found
                    employment in other industries. 
                        Crown Point
                     and Hobart papers circulated in Hammond among people who had
                    originated in those communities.44 Hammond remained an
                    unincorporated town until 1883, and the lack of political

                     activity there until that time made the
                    community a less attractive place for newspapers.
            Porter B. Towle founded the Western Indiana Tribune, a
                    Republican paper, at Hammond in December, 1880. The paper was sold to Alfred A.
                    Winslow in July, 1881, under whom it became the Hammond
                    Tribune. The Tribune ran as a weekly until 1883 when
                    Winslow commenced the first daily in 
                        Lake County
                    .45 Winslow may rightfully be called the father
                    of the English-language press in Hammond. The success of the Hammond Tribune was due largely to its support of Marcus M. Towle,
                    mayor of Hammond from 1884 to 1888. The paper's mission was largely
                    political and it was said that it "went strong during campaign years
                    and slumped terribly between fights."46 Winslow
                    sold the Tribune in 1893 to W. J. Maxwell when he entered the
                    consular service of the 
                        United States
                    .47
            
            The Hammond Tribune changed hands frequently after Winslow left
                    the city. Thomas J. Hyman of 
                        Chicago
                     bought the paper in 1894 and sold it to James G. and Henry Davidson
                    of Whiting, who in turn disposed of it to Allison A. Bibler, the publisher of
                    the 
                  
                            Crown Point
                         Register.
               48 Winslow returned to
                    Hammond newspaper circles for a short time when he purchased the Tribune from Bibler in July, 1904. But in September, 1905, Winslow
                    sold the paper back to Bibler, who immediately disposed of it to a syndicate of
                    local men headed by Ralph B. Bradford.49
            
            James B. Woods, postmaster and also city clerk, founded the Hammond
                        Independent in 1888 to support Thomas Hammond for mayor against the
                    incumbent, Marcus M. Towle, in the elections of that year. Hammond's
                    victory apparently convinced Woods that the Hammond
                    Independent had achieved its objective and the paper was discontinued.50 In 1890 Mr. and Mrs. Silas E. Swaim started the 
                  
                            Lake County
                         News, a Democratic paper, in Hammond. Swaim ranks with
                    Winslow as one of the brightest figures in Hammond's journalistic
                    history. The Democratic party's ability to compete on fairly equal
                    terms with the Republicans in the city was due largely to Swaim's
                    paper. In 1891 Swaim bought the

                    enhanced when Percy A. Parry became its editor, but the paper suffered an almost
                    crippling blow when Parry went to the 
                  
                            Lake County
                         Times in 1906.52 The News was unable to compete successfully with the more wealthy

            Armanis F. Knotts founded the Calumet Journal, a Populist
                    newspaper, at Hammond in 1891.53 This paper, edited by his
                    brother, Thomas E. Knotts, was particularly active in the support of labor
                    during the Pullman and railroad strikes in 1894. Thomas E. Knotts encouraged the
                    strikers and their sympathizers to defy a federal injunction which ordered them
                    to refrain from interfering with trains as they passed through Hammond to and
                    from 
                        Chicago
                    . He was arrested for contempt of court and taken to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , where he was released on his own recognition. Knotts was never
                    brought to trial.54 The Calumet Journal
                    was discontinued shortly after the strike when Thomas E. Knotts joined the
                    Hammond police force and because business and legal affairs occupied the time of
                    Armanis F. Knotts.
            Porter B. Towle, who had founded the Western Indiana Tribune in
                    1880, continued active in Hammond newspaper circles. In 1891 he founded the Hammond Leader, a daily, and published it until 1899. In 1900
                    Towle was listed as the publisher of the Hammond Daily
                    Republican, which was apparently the Hammond Leader under
                    a new name.55 This paper was in existence early in 1903 but
                    the date of its death is uncertain.56 The Deutsche Volks-Zeitung, a German-language newspaper, was started in
                    Hammond in 1891.57

                     grain and stockbroker, marked the beginning of a new era in the
                    newspaper history of the region. Until that time most of the publishers in the
                    area had been men of limited means and their papers, on the whole, led a
                    hand-to-mouth existence. McHie possessed the business genius, energy, and
                    capital to publish a newspaper on a scale never before attempted in the Calumet
                    Region. He had already demonstrated his confidence that Hammond was destined to
                    be an important industrial city by building both the Hammond Building, at Hohman
                    and 
                        Fayette
                     streets, and the Hammond grain elevator, and by making heavy
                    investments in local real estate. The capitalist reasoned that a good newspaper
                    was needed to advertise the city and that in time such a project would also be
                        profitable.61
            
            McHie changed the name of the Hammond Tribune to the 
                  
                            Lake County
                         Times, a step which indicated that he did not intend to
                    limit its circulation to Hammond alone. The first issue of the Times, a Republican paper, was published June 18, 1906. The proprietor
                    brought his brothers into the publishing organization, William A. McHie as
                    president and Richard A. McHie as secretary.62 Matthew P.
                    Ludwig and Ralph B. Bradford, who had been connected with the old Hammond Tribune, were retained. Sidmon McHie persuaded Hugh E. Keough,
                    a 
                        Chicago
                     newspaperman, to edit the paper for a time.63
                    Percy A. Parry, as has already been noted, succeeded Keough as editor and guided
                    the paper for about thirty years. The Hammond Tribune had a
                    daily circulation of only 137 when McHie bought it, while that of the 
                  
                            Lake County
                         Times immediately jumped to five thousand and within a
                    short time a high pressure campaign increased it to ten thousand, though most of
                    its circulation was free.64

            The McHies invaded Gary in June, 1906, a few weeks before that community was
                    incorporated. An edition of the 
                  
                            Lake County
                         Times, called the Gary Evening Times,
                    was compiled and edited in a tar paper shack among Gary's sand hills by
                    C. Oliver Holmes. Holmes, the first town clerk of Gary and a member of its first
                    school board, had formerly lived in Hammond. The Gary Evening
                    Times was printed in the 
                  
                            Lake County
                         Times' plant in Hammond.65
                    This was Gary's first daily newspaper. The publishers of the locally
                    owned papers, particularly the Gary Evening Post, a Democratic
                    paper, resented this invasion of what they considered to be their private
                    domain. The feud between the McHies and the Evening Post
                    lasted while Thomas E. Knotts was president of the town board and mayor of Gary
                    from 1906 to 1913. On more than one occasion the Evening Post,
                    in which Knotts had an interest, accused the McHies of being hostile to Knotts
                    and to Gary in general.66 Such able newspapermen as Roy G.
                    Parry, Alfred Jones, Elmer Ragon, and Leslie J. Parry edited the Gary Evening Times. This Gary edition of the 
                  
                            Lake County
                         Times was discontinued in August, 1933.67
            
            The territory of the 
                  
                            Lake County
                         Times also included East 
                        Chicago
                    , Whiting, and Calumet City, the latter just across the 
                        Illinois
                     state line from Hammond. For many years it published the Calumet City Times and the Whiting Times;
                    the edition devoted to the "Twin City," East 
                        Chicago
                     and Indiana Harbor, bore the name East 
                            Chicago
                        —The Times—Indiana Harbor on the
                    front page. Each of these seemed to the uninitiated to be locally owned
                    newspapers, but actually there was little difference in the various editions
                    except for the name of the paper and some variation in local news. This
                    arrangement apparently proved too expensive during the depression, and on August
                    28, 1933, the 
                  
                            Lake County
                         Times became the Hammond Times. As such,
                    special editions were issued to the neighboring cities although there was little
                    difference in any of them.
            The competition provided by the 
                  
                            Lake County
                         Times discouraged the publication of daily papers in the
                    neighboring cities with the exception of Gary. Hammond's population was
                    64,560 and that of East 
                        Chicago
                     was 54,784 in 1930.68 It is doubtful whether
                    any other city in the nation of East

                     size was without a locally published daily
                    paper at that time. The situation in regard to the newspaper, along with the
                    fact that Hammond, East 
                        Chicago
                    , Whiting, and Calumet City were all served by the same traction
                    system, favored the retail merchants of Hammond and harmed those in the other
                    cities. It cost a resident of East 
                        Chicago
                     no more to go to Hammond than to the local business section;
                    consequently, people were drawn to Hammond to shop by its merchants'
                    advertisements in the 
                  
                            Lake County
                         Times. As a result, Hammond became a city of large
                    department stores while small retail outlets predominated in East 
                        Chicago
                    .
            Whiting was a fertile field for weekly newspapers from its early years. The city
                    dates from 1889 when the Standard Oil Company started the construction of its
                    refinery there. Its population was 3,983 in 1900 and 10,880 in 1930.69 Although Whiting's population was small compared
                    with neighboring cities, the community was from its inception the most
                    prosperous and stable in the region. The refinery, around which the city was
                    built, provided steady employment for its workers in periods of depression as
                    well as in boom times. The reading public of Whiting was unusually numerous for
                    a city of its size because the refinery employed a larger number of skilled
                    workers than did most industries.
            Whiting's earliest newspaper was founded about a year after the
                    construction of the refinery began. In November, 1890, David A. Holman, pastor
                    of the 
                        Plymouth
                     Congregational Church, started the Congregationalist for circulation among the members of his flock. The
                    publication was so well received that Holman expanded its scope and in January,
                    1891, changed its name to the Whiting News. As such, it was
                    the purveyor of local news and gossip. When ministerial duties called him
                    elsewhere, Holman sold the paper to James G. Davidson, a young real estate
                    dealer who intended to use it to advertise his business. The new publisher made
                    a big splurge and printed ten thousand copies each week to circulate in a
                    Whiting that then boasted less than three thousand people. The magnitude of
                    these operations was such a drain on the young realtor's pocketbook
                    that he sold the News to his brother, Henry S. Davidson, in
                    June, 1891.70
            
            The Whiting Standard was started in 1892 with Edwin S. Gilbert
                    as publisher and Edward A. Gowe as editor, but

                            Whiting Call, souvenir edition, October, 1910. Most of
                            the Whiting newspapers since 1892 are on file at the Whiting Public
                            Library.
               
                     after a short time it was sold to Henry S.
                    Davidson, who merged it with the Whiting News, a Republican
                        paper.71 Whiting was isolated for a time in 1894 by the
                    Pullman strike. The trains stopped running and with them the flow of food and
                    other necessities into the community. Publisher Davidson's ingenuity
                    was put to a test during this crisis. His supply of newsprint being exhausted,
                    one issue of the Whiting News was printed on the back of
                    ordinary wall paper.72 Henry S. Davidson's interest
                    in the News waned, and in 1895 he resold it to his brother,
                    James G. From 1895 to 1900 the paper led an erratic existence, and it was said
                    that if the editor had any other duty to perform on print day the paper simply
                    did not appear.73 James G. Davidson had a talent for
                    writing, and his pungent articles published under the name of
                    "Pocahontas" were a popular feature of the News. In 1900 he sold the paper to Edwin S. Gilbert, a former East 
                        Chicago
                     newspaperman. Then in 1904 Edwin H. Farr leased the paper, but a
                    disagreement between him and Gilbert over its political policies led Farr to
                    establish the Whiting Call, beginning June, 1906. Gilbert soon
                    discontinued the Whiting News.
               74
            
            In 1892 U. G. Swartz, an employe of the Standard Oil Company, founded the Whiting Democrat and installed modern equipment. Swartz, an
                    able man, was prominent in Whiting's affairs for many years. His
                    appointment as postmaster of Whiting and a subsequent promotion at the refinery
                    made it necessary for him to dispose of the paper. On January 1, 1897, it was
                    sold to William E. Ingham, publisher of the East 
                            Chicago
                         Gazette. Ingham named the paper the Whiting
                        Sun and made it Republican in politics.75 Cecil
                    Ingham became editor for the paper when his brother died in June, 1898. Four
                    years later Brooks B. Bowman bought the Sun and published it
                    until 1904, when he sold it to Frank S. Vance, whose wife was an excellent
                    printer; he published the paper with success and profit. Under his direction the
                        Sun was known as the "Official Paper of the
                        City."76 The Sun passed into
                    the hands of William A. Hickey, a "Jeffersonian Democrat," in
                    September, 1908, and he published it until the presidential election of that
                        year.77 Toward the end of 1908 Edwin

                     S. Farr bought the Sun
                    and merged it with the Whiting Call. Farr published the paper
                    as the Whiting Call-Sun for a few months in 1909 and then
                    renamed it the Whiting Call.
               78
            
            Farr had edited the Farmer's Advocate in Moline, 
                        New York
                    , and had had many years of newspaper experience in 
                        Chicago
                     before coming to Whiting. He was among the ablest of
                    Whiting's editors and under his direction the Call
                    was a very interesting and widely read weekly. The paper was strictly Republican
                    except in 1912, when the editor supported the Progressive or "Bull
                    Moose" ticket. In 1917 James J. Griffith, who had been foreman of the
                        Twin City Sentinel in East 
                        Chicago
                     from 1912 to 1915, became part owner of the Whiting
                        Call. Griffith's journalistic career was interrupted by
                    service in the army during World War I. In 1920 the owners of the Ben 
                        Franklin
                     Press, a successful job printing firm, took over the Whiting Call. The paper was converted into a daily in 1926 with James
                    G. Griffith as editor, and its name was changed to the Whiting
                        Daily Times. It took only a year to convince the publishers that
                    Whiting was not the place for a daily paper and the Times
                    reverted to its weekly status. Late in 1926 Griffith became the sole owner of
                    the Ben 
                        Franklin
                     Press. The newspaper was published for a time as the Ben 
                            Franklin
                         News and then under its former name of the Whiting Times.

            There were fewer newspapers in East 
                        Chicago
                     than in any other of the larger cities of the region. Its first,
                    the East 
                            Chicago
                         Journal, owned and published by Joseph Hirsch, appeared on
                    March 30, 1889, about a month before the young community was incorporated as a
                    town. The paper was apparently printed in Hammond. Hirsch published the Journal until October, 1889, when he sold it to the Calumet
                    Printing and Publishing Company of Hammond, the reputed owner of the Hammond Tribune and the Hobart Tribune.
               80 No record was found that the Journal
                    was published after Hirsch disposed of it.
            In 1891 Edwin S. Gilbert founded the East 
                            Chicago
                         Globe, the first newspaper to be printed in the town
                    itself. Gilbert published the paper, a Republican weekly, until August, 1899,
                    when it was purchased by Allison P. Brown.81

                    As was noted earlier, Gilbert purchased the Whiting News in
                    1900. From that year until about 1904, he published at his Whiting plant an
                    edition known as the Indiana Harbor News. Gilbert's
                    newspaper work brought about his appointment as first postmaster of Indiana
                    Harbor in 1902.82
            
            The development of the Indiana Harbor section of East 
                        Chicago
                     dates from 1901, when the Inland Steel Company began to build its
                    plant along the shore of Lake 
                        Michigan

                            Lake County
                         Directory, 1909, reported the existence of the Harbor Sentinel, established in 1902 and edited by William W.
                        Moberly.83 This was probably the first paper published
                    and printed in that part of East 
                        Chicago
                    . Evidence is lacking to indicate how long Moberly conducted the Harbor Sentinel. By 1913 the Twin City
                    Sentinel, published by Harry M. Dill, was being circulated in East 
                        Chicago
                    , probably as the successor of Moberly's paper. Dill also
                    had the agency for the circulation locally of 
                        Chicago
                     newspapers.84 Subsequently Dill sold the
                    newspaper agency and also the Twin City Sentinel to Joseph J.
                    Freeman and his wife, Marion Heath Freeman.85
            
            Mrs. Freeman had the most distinguished career of any of the newspaperwomen in
                    the region. Joseph Freeman, said to have been an excellent reporter, was more
                    interested in the advertising and business sides of newspaper work.86 Mrs. Freeman's association with the Calumet
                    Region began in 1906 when she joined the staff of the newly established 
                  
                            Lake County
                         Times, now the Hammond Times, as an
                    associate editor in the editorial department. In 1907 her husband took charge of
                    the East 
                        Chicago
                     and Indiana Harbor edition of the

                        Chicago
                     to East

                    years, they purchased the most modern linotype machines, presses, and eventually
                    a stereotyping outfit. Their plant came to be one of the best printing
                    establishments in 
                        Lake County
                    .
            Because East 
                        Chicago
                     lacked a locally published daily paper, prominent citizens began to
                    urge the Freemans to issue a daily edition of the Sentinel.
                    The Freemans opposed such a step, pointing out that a large segment of the
                    city's population was foreign-born who could not or would not read an
                    English-language newspaper.88 As the municipal elections of
                    1921 approached, increased pressure was brought to bear on the Freemans to make
                    the Sentinel a daily. Since the 
                  
                            Lake County
                         Times in Hammond had indicated at an early date its
                    intention to support the Independent party, Republican leaders felt desperately
                    the need of a daily paper. They adopted the slogan, "We want a
                    daily," and turned to the Freemans for such a paper. The Freemans were
                    repeatedly promised unlimited moral and financial support if they would convert
                    their paper to a daily. Sincere in their belief that the Republicans had the
                    best candidate for mayor and encouraged by such offers of support, the Freemans
                    began to issue the Sentinel as a daily a few months before the
                        election.89
            
            The ensuing campaign was probably the most bitter in the city's history.
                    Friendships were broken because of the invectives and insults hurled at each
                    other by the candidates for mayor. The 
                  
                            Lake County
                         Times and the Twin City Sentinel
                    "pulled all the stops" in their support of their respective
                    candidates. On election day Governor Warren T. McCray had the Gary unit of the
                    state militia ready to move into the city in case local authorities were unable
                    to maintain law and order.90 The Independent party was
                    victorious in the election. In the course of the excitement that occurred when
                    the results were known, a number of the more exuberant supporters of the winning

            "On election night, fearing that the rowdy element roistering about
                    might throw a rock through one of our front windows or otherwise damage our
                    property in our absence if the shop was closed down at the usual hour, my

                     to remain within until things quieted down,
                    regardless of which side won, never dreaming however of what was really in
                    store. Before midnight it was evident that Callahan was the victor but the
                    shouting was in full swing until long past that hour and we stayed on until 3
                    a.m. A taxi stopped across the street and believing it to be the one we had
                    ordered, Joe locked the door and we started across. But just as we reached it,
                    it pulled out, the driver muttering: 'No more fares tonight.'
                    We stood there expecting our own taxi momentarily. While we waited, another car,
                    not however a taxi, drove up and stopped in front of the shop. A number of men
                    piled out of it at once, but immediately piled in again, one of them remarking
                    loudly as he glanced our way: 'This isn't the place, its a
                    block down'. Joe thought he recognized the car but in the dim light
                    that filtered through the window it was impossible to recognize the faces of the
                    passengers. As it drove off our taxi appeared from the opposite direction,
                    stopped to pick us up, and we were driven to our home.
            "In view of what happened shortly afterwards we later became convinced
                    that the car we had been watching contained the men responsible for the wrecking
                    of our plant. Our belief was confirmed later. We learned that the same car
                    returned very shortly after we took our departure, and its occupants went into
                    action. Albert, the porter, an old derelict who slept on the premises had been a
                    witness to everything. He related that shortly after 3 o'clock hearing
                    a racket he rose from his bed which was at the back of the shop and ran out to
                    see what was doing. He encountered six or eight well-dressed men wearing masks
                    who after threatening him with revolvers into silence went to work on the
                    machinery. They smashed and hacked at everything in sight, not only the presses
                    and linotype machines but the furniture, telegraph instruments, typewriters and
                    even an umbrella had been attacked with sledge hammers and other damage-dealing
                    implements. … It was not long before Joe learned the identity of
                    those who participated in the raid; and I knew from him at the time who they
                    were. But at this late date I have forgotten most of them and of those I do
                    recall hazily I have forgotten the first names, or their initials."91
            
            The damage done to the plant was estimated at $25,000.92

                            , July 15, 1955. The Gary Evening Post
                                & Daily Tribune, November 9, 1921, reported that the
                            presses were started and pieces of scrap iron were tossed into the
                            machinery. This was taken as evidence that at least one of the vandals
                            knew how to start the presses. Also see

                     Editorially, the leading newspapers
                    denounced those involved in the vandalism. The Gary Evening Post
                        & Daily Tribune called it "as dastardly a deed as has
                    been committed in 
                        Lake County
                     in many years."93 Hammond's
                        
                  
                            Lake County
                         Times, which had supported the victors in the recent
                    campaign, demanded that "the guilty be brought to bay so that the
                    courts may have an opportunity to deal with those responsible for such a
                    shameful deed." The paper also indicated that the guilty were prominent
                    citizens by demanding that "the perpetrators be punished no matter who
                    they are."94 According to Mrs. Freeman, the
                    wreckers were not ordinary goons or hoodlums, but well-to-do men of reasonably
                    good standing in the community.95
            
            Such was the end of the Twin City Sentinel and of the efforts
                    of the Freemans to publish a newspaper in East 
                        Chicago
                    . Not one of the Republican leaders who had joined in the hue and
                    cry for a daily newspaper and who had lavishly pledged both capital and
                    influence to make it a success came forward to redeem his promises.96 After a brief and futile effort to revive the paper, the
                    Freemans saw it pass into bankruptcy. Mrs. Freeman was employed about a year by
                    the Gary Post-Tribune during the course of an effort by that
                    paper to publish an East 
                        Chicago
                     edition. The project was curtailed because of the lack of local
                    advertising. Later she worked on the staff of the 
                  
                            Chicago
                         Daily Journal from 1925 to 1931 and conducted a column on
                    the woman's page of the 
                  
                            Chicago
                         Daily News from 1931 to 1934.97
            
            George Huish, who had been associated with the Twin City
                    Sentinel, purchased the remains of the Freeman's plant from the
                    receiver and founded the Calumet News in 1923.98 A capable and aggressive newspaperman, Huish soon had the new paper
                    on a paying basis. In November, 1923, the News was converted
                    from a weekly to a biweekly, issued on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Alfred G. Perry,
                    one of the ablest journalists in the region, was installed as editor. John De
                    Jong became city editor in 1926. Although Huish was a

                     Republican, the News was
                    more often independent than partisan in local political affairs. The paper
                    weathered the depression years, although it was forced to revert to a weekly in
                    January, 1933. The Calumet News and the East 
                            Chicago
                         Globe were the only newspapers in East 
                        Chicago
                     at that time.
            The Calumet Advance, founded by Louis A. Bryan in 1896, was the
                    first newspaper published on the site of the present city of Gary.99 The so-called stock yards boom in 1890 had been started by rumors
                    that several of the large meatpackers intended to locate in this area. Fred D.
                    Bradford and Henry A. Bradford, 
                        Chicago
                     realtors, organized the 
                        Chicago
                    , Tolleston Land and Improvement Company and laid out a town that
                    was successively known as Bradford, East Tolleston, and Jerusalem.100 The boom collapsed when the packers decided to remain in 
                        Chicago
                    , and Jerusalem became a ghost town. In 1896 Bryan, a 
                        Chicago
                     lawyer and real estate dealer, acquired a huge acreage between the 
                        Wabash
                     railroad tracks and the Little Calumet River, including Jerusalem,
                    and laid out the town of Calumet. Bryan started the weekly Calumet
                        Advance to publicize the community and to promote the sale of lots; he
                    issued it until 1907.101
            
            The region where Gary now stands was virtually a wilderness of sand ridges,
                    sloughs, and scrub oak until 1906, when the 
                        United States
                     Steel Corporation began the construction of its great mills along
                    the shore of Lake 
                        Michigan
                     there. The town of Gary was incorporated in July, 1906. On May 10
                    the Chesterton Tribune announced the publication of the Northern Indianian, a Democratic weekly, in the embryo steel
                    city. The paper was published by J. O. Benthal and edited by Thomas F. Costello, 
                        Chicago
                     newspapermen. Its early issues were printed in Indiana Harbor.102 A few months after the Indianian was
                    started its own offices and presses were located in the Knotts Building at
                    Seventh and 
                        Broadway
                    . The paper was a staunch supporter of Armanis F. Knotts, the first
                    manager of the Gary Land Company, a subsidiary of the steel corporation, which
                    laid out the city of Gary, and also of his brother, Thomas E. Knotts, who was
                    president of the town board and later the first mayor of the city,

                    Indianian, frequently challenged the power of the steel
                    company in the management of Gary's affairs. While Armanis F. Knotts
                    denied that he had any connection with the paper, he and his brother apparently
                    encouraged and favored it in various ways.103
            
            The Northern Indianian's failure within three years of
                    its establishment was apparently caused by a combination of circumstances. The
                    steel company, which supplied the young community with electricity, gas, and
                    water, also sought the franchise to build and operate the street railway system,
                    but the town board, largely through the influence of Thomas E. Knotts, granted
                    the concession to the privately owned Gary and Interurban Traction Company. When
                    the Northern Indianian went out of business, the claim was
                    made that its demise was due to the failure of the Gary and Interurban Traction
                    Company to keep its promise to pay for the presses and other equipment of the
                    paper, but no proof was ever offered that such was the case.104 Other factors apparently affected the fortunes of the Indianian. For instance, Costello's aggressive and vitriolic
                    editorials were resented by the steel company's officials and also by
                    the conservative segment of Gary's citizens. The editor's
                    favorite target was Horace S. Norton, the steel company's most
                    prominent official at that time, whom he persistently called "Turkey
                        Neck."105 Norton was the founder and president
                    of the Gary Commercial Club, an association of merchants and professional men,
                    which functioned as a sort of chamber of commerce. A study showed that the
                    leading merchants favored the Gary Daily Tribune for
                    advertising while the Northern Indianian depended upon the
                    uncertain support of small scale realtors. This situation may have been due to
                    Norton's influence. Costello's associate Benthal was thought
                    to be a Socialist and such a rumor may have been a liability to the paper.106 The Northern Indianian closed its
                    doors in March, 1909. Costello left a bewildered foreman in charge of the
                    offices and equipment and returned to 
                        Chicago
                    . The paper's creditors petitioned the circuit court to
                    determine its ownership. There were rumors that Thomas E. Knotts would assume
                    control of the establishment when the matter was settled in the courts.107 When that time came, as shall be seen, Knotts and his
                    brother, Armanis F., did buy the equipment and began the publication of the Gary Evening Post.

            The founding of the Gary Weekly Tribune in June, 1907, by Homer
                    J. Carr and George R. Scott was an important event in Gary's
                    journalistic history. Carr was editor and Scott was in charge of its business
                    office. Both were veteran newspapermen who had worked together in 
                        Chicago
                     for some years. In 1891 Carr had been hired by the 
                  
                            Chicago
                         Tribune to organize a telegraphic marine news service for
                    some forty newspapers in the lower Great Lakes region. Scott became assistant
                    manager of this news bureau. Carr was marine correspondent for the 
                  
                            Chicago
                         Tribune when he came to Gary. Because Carr had long been
                    connected with the 
                  
                            Chicago
                         Tribune, he and Scott chose the name of Gary
                        Weekly Tribune for the new journal.108 The office
                    of the paper was first located in a rude shack on what was then Euclid Avenue,
                    just west of 
                        Broadway
                    . Later it was moved across 
                        Broadway
                     to where the Union Railway Station now stands. For some months the
                    local news and advertisements were collected by Mark Goodnow and Fred Carr and
                    mailed to 
                        Chicago
                    , where the editor and business manager had the type set and the
                    papers printed. They were then sent back to Gary for distribution on Saturday
                    mornings. This procedure was followed until the spring of 1908, when Carr and
                    Scott built a plant at 670 
                        Broadway
                     and installed modern equipment. By 1912 the paper had outgrown its
                    quarters and moved to its second home at Fifth and 
                        Washington
                    .109 On Labor Day, September 7, 1908, the Tribune became a daily, the first to be printed in Gary,
                    though the weekly edition was continued for several years. Carl O. Dennewitz,
                    another prominent figure in the city's newspaper circles, joined the
                    staff of the Weekly Tribune as a cub reporter. He later became
                    managing editor of the Gary Daily Tribune and remained in that
                    position until he joined the army in 1917.110
            
            Carr and Scott were Republicans and, except for the elections of 1912 when they
                    supported the Bull Moose ticket, their papers were the partisan spokesmen of the
                    Republican party in local politics. The Tribune papers were
                    also the spokesmen of the 
                        United States
                     Steel Corporation in civic affairs, and Carr was an intimate friend
                    of William P. Gleason, superintendent of the steel works. Nevertheless, a few
                    Democrats were connected with the Tribune papers. Arthur P.

                     110 Dennewitz was a foreign correspondent after
                            World War I for the

                                 Times. He was an editorial and advertising
                            executive with the Crowell Publishing Company at the time of his death
                            in 1934. See Gary Post-Tribune, November 3,
                        1934.
               
                     Melton, city engineer in the Democratic
                    administration of Mayor Thomas E. Knotts, was reported in 1909 to be one of
                    their stockholders, and Dennewitz was Democratic candidate for city clerk in the
                    election of 1913.111
            
            The great real estate boom, which provided profitable advertising, coupled with
                    the unsettled state of political affairs during Gary's early years,
                    attracted other newspapers to the city. The Gary Daily News,
                    edited by Carl J. Cooper and Alfred Jones, was started in November, 1907. This
                    paper, printed in 
                        Chicago
                    , was reportedly owned by the Daily News
                    Publishing Company of that city.112 The News ended its short career on a sour note. A subscription drive was
                    launched in December, 1908, with a piano as the grand prize. Several of the
                    city's most prominent young ladies entered the contest, and numerous
                    people were persuaded to pay for subscriptions six years in advance, but the
                    paper failed in March, 1909. The subscribers lost their money and the winner of
                    the contest never saw the piano.113 Next came the 
                  
                            Lake County
                         Democrat in August, 1909, to oppose Thomas E. Knotts for
                    mayor in the city elections of that year. Alfred Jones was one of its editors,
                    and John F. Dorman was one of its founders.114 The success
                    of Knotts in the election caused the demise of the paper early in 1910.
            Gary became a fifth class city in October, 1909. Thomas E. Knotts, president of
                    the town board since 1906, was eager to be the city's first mayor. A
                    strong and controversial figure, he was opposed not only by the Republicans but
                    also by an insurgent faction in the Democratic party. Since the Northern Indianian had closed its doors in March, 1909, none of the
                    newspapers in Gary was friendly to him. Both the Gary Daily
                    Tribune and the Gary Evening Times, the latter an edition
                    of the 
                  
                            Lake County
                         Times of Hammond, supported John A. Brennan, the
                    Republican candidate. The 
                  
                            Lake County
                         Democrat, as has been noted, was founded to prevent Knotts
                    from getting the Democratic nomination. Therefore in August, 1909, Knotts and
                    his brother, Armanis F., bought the equipment of the defunct Northern Indianian at a mortgage sale and established the Gary Evening Post.
               115 The new paper, a daily,
                    occupied the old quarters of the Northern Indianian in the
                    basement and a portion of the second floor of the Knotts Building at Seventh and 
                        Broadway

            Thomas H. Cannon and Frank Patrick, veteran 
                        Chicago
                     newspapermen, were engaged to run the Post.
                    Patrick was the publisher and business manager while Cannon wrote the editorials
                    and worked as a reporter. A. Howard Bell, later auditor of the Gary public
                    schools, was installed as circulation manager. Thomas E. Knotts'
                    instructions to the staff of the Post in regard to the
                    forthcoming campaign were brief and to the point: "Make it hot. Give
                    'em hell."116 The first issue of the Post appeared on October 2, 1909, about a month before the
                    election. After Knotts had been elected mayor, his interest in the Post waned immediately, and Cannon and Patrick were left with a white
                    elephant. They organized a stock company with a proposed capital of
                    $15,000 but could find few purchasers in the lull that followed the
                    election. In later years Cannon recalled their troubles: "We were
                    living at the Victoria Hotel. The proprietor could have testified to the
                    insolvency of the paper. Nevertheless, we kept the Post alive
                    until, January, 1910, when two young men from 
                        Ohio
                     dropped into town. They were J. Ralph Snyder and his brother H. B.
                    [Henry Burgess] Snyder."117
            
            The brothers were the sons of Henry Richard Snyder, a prominent 
                        Ohio
                     newspaperman. Their father had published at various times the
                    following newspapers in 
                        Ohio
                    : the Logan Republican; the 
                  
                            Pike
                         County Republican at Waverly; the 
                  
                            Urbana
                         Citizen; the 
                  
                            Marion
                         Mirror; and the Piqua Call. For a time
                    he was associated with Senator Joseph B. Foraker in the publication of the 
                  
                            Dayton
                         Journal. Later his journalistic activities took him to 
                        Springfield
                    , 
                        Missouri
                    , where he owned the 
                  
                            Springfield
                         Republican for about six years. His wife, Minerva Burgess
                    Snyder, worked on that paper as its society editor and as a reporter. Their sons
                    began newspaper careers at an early age as carriers. Henry Burgess Snyder
                    graduated from Yale University and J. Ralph Snyder attended Drury College for a
                    time. When they came to look over the situation in Gary, Henry Burgess was the
                    publisher of the 
                  
                            Urbana
                         Citizen and J. Ralph was the manager of the

            There was good reason for the Snyders to be impressed with the opportunities in
                    the young steel city. Its population had risen to almost 17,000 in 1910.119 Already there were 4,204 employees in the works of the
                    steel corporation and

                     the construction of that large plant
                        continued.120 The erection of the American Bridge
                    Company's plant had been started in 1909 and that of the American Sheet
                    and Tube Company began in 1910. Both were important subsidiaries of the 
                        United States
                     Steel Corporation. The Gary Screw and Bolt Company's
                    plant, an independent, was also begun in 1910. These industries rapidly
                    increased Gary's population in the next few years, and there were
                    indications that other companies intended to seek sites in the city.121
            
            In March, 1910, the Snyder brothers purchased controlling interest in the Post with capital obtained from the sale of the 
                  
                            Urbana
                         Citizen. Thomas E. Knotts retained a small interest in the
                    paper until about 1916, when the Snyders bought his share. The brothers gained
                    full ownership by buying the few shares of stock held by others, mainly
                        saloon-keepers.122 The new officers of the Post were
                    Thomas E. Knotts, president, Henry Burgess Snyder, editor, and J. Ralph Snyder,
                    business manager. The Snyders announced that the Post would be
                    a Democratic paper and its editorial policy would be along the lines of true
                        democracy.123 Thomas H. Cannon remained on the staff as
                    an editor and reporter. Henry Richard Snyder joined his sons in 1912 and was
                    associate editor of the Gary Evening Post and later of the Gary Post-Tribune until his death in 1925. A third son,
                    Herbert R. Snyder, came to Gary in 1913 to become advertising manager of the
                    paper. The equipment of the Post was antiquated and in poor
                    condition when the Snyders purchased it, but they moved to a new site on west
                    Fifth Avenue between 
                        Washington
                     and Adams and installed modern equipment. For the first time since
                    its birth the Evening Post began to look like a real
                        newspaper.124 In 1913 it moved to a new home on the
                    north side of Fifth Avenue between 
                        Broadway
                     and 
                        Washington
                    , where it remained until its merger with the Gary
                        Daily Tribune in 1921.
            From 1910 to 1921 the Gary Evening Post and the Gary Daily Tribune were the city's leading newspapers and
                    also bitter antagonists in the political arena. The Snyders backed Thomas E.
                    Knotts in his futile bid for another term as mayor

                     of Gary in 1913. The day following the
                    election the Post announced that henceforth it would be a free
                    lance in public matters, 125 yet for some years the Snyders
                    showed a tendency to support the Democratic party. In 1915 Henry Burgess Snyder
                    was appointed postmaster of Gary by President Wilson and held that position
                    until late in 1920. The Post urged the 
                        United States
                     to join the League of Nations after World War I and was a
                    consistent advocate of closer co-operation between the 
                        United States
                     and other nations of the world. It also agreed with the Democrats
                    that the tariff should be kept at a low level, while it went down the line in
                    support of the Democratic tickets, both national and local, in the elections of
                        1920.126
            
            The Snyders again announced in January, 1921, that in the future their paper
                    would be independent in politics. They denied that the decision to retire as
                    spokesman for a particular party was due to any political disappointments. The
                        Gary Evening Post, they said, had been Democratic because
                    it believed in the principles of Woodrow Wilson. It would support the Democratic
                    party in the future whenever that party stood by the interests of men, women,
                    and children everywhere. But the political situation was different in the state,
                    county, and city, particularly in the last two. These, the announcement
                    continued, were business institutions that should be conducted on business
                    principles, and that in the city and county there was no inherent reason why
                    anyone should vote either the Republican or Democratic ticket. In conclusion the
                    opinion was expressed that "without a party we believe we can stand for
                    the best interests of the community in a way that the public will understand and
                    appreciate." The Snyders went on to praise the administration of Mayor
                    William F. Hodges of Gary, a Republican, but declared that 
                        Lake County
                    , also with a Republican administration, was not so fortunate.127 The Snyders probably realized the futility of supporting
                    the Democratic party in the city and county, which were consistently Republican
                    before the depression which began in 1929. Thomas E. Knotts, whose victory in
                    1909 was largely a personal one, was the only Democratic mayor of Gary until
                        1935.128 In view of this political situation, one can
                    understand the reasoning on the part of the Snyders that they could be a greater
                    influence for good in local affairs if they were independent rather than on the
                    "outside" as Democrats. Whether their course

                     strengthened the Republicans and weakened
                    the Democrats in Gary and in the county is an open question.
            The depression that followed World War I, combined with an increase in the cost
                    of newspaper publication, brought financial difficulties to the Gary Daily Tribune and to the Gary Evening Post.
                    Their incomes were further diminished because merchants could not afford to
                    advertise in both papers. As a result, the two papers were hardly more than
                    breaking even.129 Under existing conditions it was doubtful
                    that Gary was large enough to support two daily newspapers. Of the two, the Gary Evening Post presented the more sprightly appearance and
                    was also in a better financial condition.
            Early in May, 1921, Carr sold the controlling interest in the Gary
                        Daily Tribune to Dennewitz and Charles Emley. A short time later, on
                    May 21, they sold it to Edward C. Toner, publisher of the Anderson
                        Herald at Anderson, Indiana.130 Robert B. Phillips,
                    also of the Anderson Herald, who had had five years of
                    newspaper experience in Gary, became editor while Emley remained on its staff as
                    business manager. The paper was to be independent in politics. Toner was soon
                    beset with the same financial problems that had troubled the previous owners of
                    the Tribune. On July 9, 1921, he sold the paper to the Snyders
                    and returned to Anderson.131
            
            The Snyders combined the Post and the Tribune
                    into the Gary Evening Post and Daily Tribune. The new paper,
                    which was housed in the old Gary Daily Tribune Building at
                    Fifth and 
                        Washington
                    , was put into circulation on Monday, July 11, 1921. Its officials
                    were Henry Burgess Snyder, editor; Henry Richard Snyder, associate editor; J.
                    Ralph Snyder, business manager; and Herbert R. Snyder, in charge of commercial
                    printing. George R. Scott, one of the founders of the Gary Daily
                        Tribune who had retained a financial interest in the paper, was
                    secretary of the new organization. The Snyders began the publication of the Gary Sunday Post in the same month only to discover within a
                    short time that Gary was not yet ready for a local Sunday paper.132 In August, 1922, the name of the Snyder's paper was
                    simplified to the Gary Post-Tribune. Although officially
                    labeled as independent in politics, the paper consistently supported Republican

                     130 Dennewitz and Emley's reasons for
                            disposing of the Tribune so quickly are not entirely
                            clear. Henry Burgess Snyder in an interview with the author at Gary,
                            February 16, 1956, said that it was possible that Dennewitz and Emley
                            miscalculated their financial strength or that they had acted as the
                            intermediaries for Toner in the purchase of the paper.

                     132 The Gary Post-Tribune began
                            the publication of a Sunday edition in the fall of 1955.

                    offices in the 1920's.
            The Gary Post-Tribune prospered as business conditions improved
                    and as merchants saw the advantage of advertising in only one paper. The
                    circulation of the Gary Evening Post had averaged 6,241 copies
                    in 1920, while that of the Gary Post-Tribune was 20,026 in
                        1930.133 A new building erected at Fourth Place and 
                        Broadway
                     for a reported $500,000 was dedicated and put into use
                    in 1927. The position of the Snyders as the "first family" of
                    Gary's journalism was further strengthened in 1930 when Henry Burgess
                    Snyder married Mary Rennels, literary editor of the 
                  
                            New York
                         Telegram, who had served in a similar capacity on the 
                  
                            Cleveland
                         Times and also the 
                  
                            Cleveland
                         Press. Mrs. Snyder wrote articles occasionally for the Post-Tribune and was on the staff of the 
                  
                            Chicago

            Any history of the region's newspapers would be incomplete without the
                    story of Thomas H. Cannon, one of its very able working newspapermen. Cannon
                    started his newspaper career in 1874 and for more than fifteen years worked as a
                    reporter and editor in 
                        Colorado
                     , 
                        Kansas
                    , and 
                        Missouri
                    . In 1890 he became political editor of the 
                  
                            Chicago
                         Times and was later employed by the 
                  
                            Chicago
                         American and by the 
                  
                            Chicago
                         Daily Tribune. Cannon covered numerous assignments for 
                        Chicago
                     papers in the Calumet Region of Indiana and was thoroughly familiar
                    with the area before coming to Gary. At the time Thomas E. Knotts engaged him
                    and Frank Patrick to run the newly established Gary Evening
                    Post in 1909, Cannon was chief editorial writer for the 
                  
                            Chicago

                    staff of that paper when they purchased it the following year. Cannon worked on
                    the Gary Evening Post and on the Gary
                        Post-Tribune until shortly before his death in 1936. The great steel
                    strike of 1919 was his last bit of heavy newspaper reporting. Feeling the weight
                    of the years, Cannon devoted most of his time after that to editorial duties and
                    to his daily columns. To quote his own words: "The end of the trail had
                    been reached. The swivel chair was calling."135
            
            Cannon's fame and wide acquaintance among the readers of the Gary Evening Post and of the Gary
                    Post-Tribune were due largely to his columns, "Flue Dust"
                    and "Lud

                     Wrangler," which were daily
                    features of those papers for many years. The title "Flue Dust"
                    was no doubt inspired by the smoke and dust which poured constantly from the
                    flues and stacks of the great steel mills and which, when the atmosphere was
                    heavy and the wind came from off the lake, moved like a fog over the city.
                    Cannon started the "Flue Dust" column in 1913 and conducted it
                    until shortly before his death. The column consisted at first of verse and prose
                    written by Cannon in which he interspersed satirical and humorous comments about
                    current events, both local and national. In 1915 contributions were received
                    from his readers and from members of the newspaper staff. The first contributor
                    was Margaret K. Hanlan, society editor of the paper, who as
                    "Pandora" sent in exceptionally fine poems and sprightly
                    skits. As time went on, poems, jokes, and timely bits of wisdom came from the
                    pens of contributors with such names as "The Grey Courier,"
                    "Merely Gene," "Uncle Spud,"
                    "Shoe-Shine Socrates," "Rhoda Dendron,"
                    "Oh Hek," and numerous others. Contributions came not only
                    from Gary's citizens but from people in nearby states. For some years
                    Cannon published the best of the "Flue Dust" material annually
                    in a booklet called "The Log Book." Cannon also created
                    "Lud Wrangler," whose letters and musings were daily features
                    of the newspaper's editorial page.136 He also
                    ventured into the historical field, serving as editor-in-chief for the History of the Lake and Calumet Region of Indiana, a
                    two-volume combination of history and biography, published in 1927.137
            
            By 1933 the region's newspaper pattern was well established. Because of
                    its nearness to 
                        Chicago
                     there had never been a morning daily in the area nor were there
                    prospects of one. Instead, the citizens read the metropolitan papers in the
                    mornings for items of national and international interest and in the evenings
                    turned to the locally published dailies for local and regional news. The Vidette-Messenger dominated the 
                        Valparaiso
                     scene, the Gary Post-Tribune held sway in the
                    steel city, and the Hammond Times circulated heavily in
                    Hammond, Whiting, and East 
                        Chicago
                    . The weeklies, East

                         Star, Hobart's Gazette, and
                    Chesterton's Tribune brought news and notices of a
                    more intimate nature to their readers. The fact that all these newspapers
                    survived the depression indicated that they were permanent fixtures in their
                    respective communities.

            Although newcomers to 
                        Princeton
                     were not very well informed about the weather they would find, they
                    do seem to have been forewarned of the sicknesses to be endured while they
                    became acclimated: it was as much a part of the undertaking as the fatigues and
                    dangers of the journey. Like explorers of every period, most of them brought
                    their own medicaments with them, such as laudanum or quinine, called
                    "barks"; but many considered dogwood bark, plentiful in the
                    vicinity, as efficacious as Peruvian. Sometimes they collected and brewed their
                    own herb remedies. On the flyleaf of Jones and Stockwell's ledger for
                    1822, the "year of the terrible sickness," when Governor
                    Jonathan Jennings ordered a day set aside for special prayer and fasting because
                    of the statewide illness, was written "A recpt for curing the Ague and
                    fever. Take one third Reubarb and two thirds best Barks, mix them with Brandy or
                    old whisky until they are about as thin as rich cream.—take a
                    wineglass full 4 or 5 times a day. If it gripes too severely, dilute it with
                        water."1 Of these ingredients perhaps the
                    brandy was considered the most important and the most potent; it was readily
                    obtainable, since it was manufactured locally by the barrelful.
            Although they had no clear theory of the causes of the inevitable sickness that
                    all newcomers had to undergo, the early settlers were positive that it was
                    related to the air and that the air was different in different localities. They
                    thought that hills on a dry soil were healthful, provided they were not near the
                    woods; on the other hand, the neighborhood of overflowing streams and all wet,
                    marshy soils were supposed to produce fevers and agues in the autumn. But the
                    weather was also to blame, for even if all the conditions of the locality were
                    propitious, heat and rain could bring the sickness. Timothy Flint, for instance,
                    commented, "In point of salubrity, we can do no more than repeat the
                    remarks, which

                     have so often been found applicable to the
                    western country in general, and which from the nature of things must apply to
                    all countries. The high and rolling regions of this state are as healthy as the
                    same kinds of land in the other parts of the 
                        United States
                    . The wet prairies, swampy lands, and tracts contiguous to small
                    lakes and ponds, and inundated bottoms, intersected by bayous, generate fever
                    and ague, and autumnal fevers, and impart a bilious tendency to all the
                    disorders of the country. The beautiful prairies above 
                        Vincennes
                    , on the 
                        Wabash
                    , … are found to have some balance against their
                    fertility, beauty of appearance, and the ease with which they are cultivated, in
                    their insalubrity. That the settlers in general, have found this state
                    … favorable to health, the astonishing increase of the population
                    bears ample testimony."2
            
            "I have scarcely been to a single spot on the western side of the 
                        Ohio
                    , where, during the autumn of 1822, the people had not suffered from
                    sickness," said William N. Blane. "The low grounds of the 
                        Wabash
                     would be thickly settled, and soon covered with a swarming
                    population; but during a month or two in the Autumn, Fevers and Agues seem to
                    stalk about here, seeking whom they may destroy. Indeed the countenances of the
                    few settlers bespeak how often they have been attacked by these diseases. Where
                    the ground has been cleared for any considerable space, the sickness does not
                    prevail to such an extent."3
            
            William Faux also added his testimony: "When its [the 
                        Wabash
                    's] waters are low, weeds rise from the bottom, and grow,
                    and rot, and impregnate the air with pestilence." He also commented,
                    "River banks are here always unhealthy. A family from Lincolnshire,
                    attracted by the fine land, on one of the prairie creeks, where no American
                    would live on any terms, all fell sick, one died, and the farmer and his wife
                    both lay unable to help themselves, or get help, except from one of their little
                    boys, who escaped the contagion. Birkbeck strongly remonstrated with them
                    against settling there."4
            
            George Flower's writings provide further corroboration. "The
                    summer had been very hot and latterly wet. Thunder showers of daily occurrence
                    sent mosquitoes in swarms. My cabin, recently built, of course, of green logs,

                    and up to its very sides, was in its situation and in itself a sufficient cause
                    of disease. My shepherd and his family came, bringing a few choice sheep and an
                    English highbred cow. His whole family, in a few days, all fell sick, lying in a
                    small cabin just built about a hundred yards from my own. Mr. White, carpenter,
                    from 
                        London
                    , wife, and two children, occupied a two-horse wagon and a
                    soldier's tent. There was no house for him; they all fell sick. My two
                    sons were speedily taken with fever and ague, to us then a new disease. Miss
                    [Maria] Fordham, who shared our cabin, was attacked with the same disease. My
                    constitution, strong and good, yielding from exposure to heat and rain, took
                    another form of disease. Boils and irritable sores broke out on both my legs,
                    from knee to ankle, incapacitating me, for a time, from walking."
                    Flower's new baby died and his young brother William, the favorite of
                    his parents, was so much weakened by the experience that he succumbed not long
                        afterwards.5
            
            Faux also mentioned that "new settlers … seem all exposed to
                    an eruption, ten times worse than the itch, inasmuch as it itches more, runs all
                    over the body, crusting and festering the hands and other parts, and is not to
                    be cured by the common treatment for the itch, which has been tried without
                    effect, and one instance has been known, where the sulphur and grease killed the
                    patient by obstructing perspiration, and driving in the eruption. …
                    The bite of every insect and reptile, however insignificant, is highly
                        poisonous."6
            
            Elias P. Fordham seems to have escaped the seasoning illness the first year. It
                    was later, after his sister's arrival with Flower's second
                    party, that he had a serious attack of it; "indeed throughout the
                    Settlement there were more sick than well. G[eorge Flower] had brought no
                    medicines with him and mine were all used or given away,7

                            frontier settlements. The letters of the Prichard family who emigrated
                            from 
                                England
                             in 1818 and settled in Wanborough, 
                                Illinois
                            , contain many references to sickness, including boils. In
                            writing of Samuel Prichard's death in 1819, his son ascribes
                            his illness to the fact that he "ate too much meat, took but
                            little exercise, and suffered as we all did from boils." See

                     7 It was during his trip up the Chesapeake, in
                            charge of the Birkbeck party's baggage soon after their arrival
                            in this country, that Fordham had disposed of his medicines. "I
                            landed very often; and, sometimes rambled for miles through the Pine
                            woods with my gun. At every opening where I saw a house I used to make
                            up to it, and 
               
                     Physician was thirty miles off. My fever
                    reduced me to a state of extreme weakness, but my nurse [his sister, Maria], by
                    constantly supplying me with corn meal gruel and chicken broth prevented me from
                    sinking under the violence of my disorder. The fever soon became a regular
                    intermittent, of which I was soon cured by bark and laudanum.
            "These intermittent fevers are the Scourges of new Settlements in the
                    Western Country. They are seldom dangerous and are much under the power of
                    medicine, but ought to be considered by Emigrants as unavoidable. When provided
                    for, they are slight and of little consequence. The first year may be passed by
                    a careful or robust person without receiving any injury from the climate, but in
                    the second the system becomes relaxed by heat. I cannot explain how, but I can
                    state the fact as related to me, and confirmed by my own experience, that those
                    who come from Northern and healthy climates will in these Southern latitudes
                    suffer a change of constitution, and that this change will be produced or
                    accomplished by a fit of sickness."8
            
            Sometimes there was no illness that could be traced, but there was a period of
                    weakness, of listlessness, of an indisposition to all action that without pain
                    accomplished "the change as completely as a violent fever or a painful
                    eruption. The Americans have a most expressive word for this indescribable
                    feeling—it is the 'tires.' 'How is such a
                    one?' 'Oh! he has got the tires.' After these
                    inflictions are over, with moderate and regular living, the human constitution
                    and the climate act harmoniously together."9 Many
                    observers agreed that Americans were listless, some said lazy. Morris Birkbeck,
                    after praising 
                        Princeton
                    's tavern and inhabitants, remarked, "In a log
                    tavern, where neatness is as well observed as at many taverns in the city of 
                        Bath
                    , or any city. … the people … would not
                    disgrace old 
                        England
                     in the general decorum of their deportment. But I lament here
                    … the small account that is had of time. Subsistence is secured so
                        
                  always received an invitation to enter, and sometimes to share a meal.
                            The Ague and Fever are very common here. I gave away in these visits all
                            my bark and laudanum. They would send a negro five miles through the
                            woods, and as far with a canoe on the water, for one or two doses. In
                            return they always sent milk or anything I wanted. The medical men in
                            these districts have not much reputation. I have no doubt that, with an
                            Edinburgh Dispensary, I could gain a good income in any of these
                            unhealthy districts, if my conscience would allow me." Elias P.

                     easily … [that] life is whiled
                    away in a painful state of yawning lassitude." After describing
                    "the tall and long-limbed" native Americans "in
                    pantaloons and Wellington boots. … who seem to be as perfectly at
                    leisure as the loungers of ancient Europe," he says,
                    "Indolence is the epidemic evil of the Americans." For
                    example, "if a hundred Americans of any class were to seat themselves,
                    ninety-nine would shuffle their chairs to the true distance, and then throw
                    themselves back against the nearest prop."10
            
            William Cobbett also inveighed against this deplorable characteristic.
                    "Arrived at 
                        Princeton
                    , Indiana, about 20 miles from the river. I was sorry to see very
                    little doing in this town. They cannot all keep stores and
                    taverns! One of the store-keepers told me he does not sell more than ten
                    thousand dollars value per annum: he ought, then, to manufacture something and
                    not spend nine tenths of his time in lolling with a segar in his
                    mouth." After a visit with the Rappites, Cobbett returned to 
                        Princeton
                     and remarked, "Find the same store-keepers and
                    tavern-keepers in the same attitudes that we left them in the other day. Their
                    legs only a little higher than their heads, and segars in
                    their mouths; a fine position for business! It puts my friend in mind of the
                    Roman posture in dining. … At 
                        Princeton
                     all day. This is a pretty considerable place; very good as to
                    buildings; but, is too much inland to be a town of any consequence until the
                    inhabitants do that at home which they employ merchants and foreign manufactures
                    to do for them."11
            
            Nobody explained to these critics that they were observing the poisonous
                    aftereffects of malarial infection. Though most of them complained of the
                    fearful swellings caused by bites of all kinds, mosquitoes among them, nobody of
                    course understood the real nature of malaria or the method of its transmission.
                    Faux described the annoyance caused by mosquitoes but had no idea of their real
                    significance: "Through the summer, both night and day, but mostly in
                    the night, the mosquitoes, both in Indiana and 
                        Illinois
                    , but chiefly in the latter, were, in their attacks, almost
                    sufficient to drive English settlers out. If a man had been lashed naked to a
                    post, he must have been stung to death, or unto madness. At Sandersville, says
                    J[ohn] Ingle, they blinded several persons."12

                        Kentucky
                     where he was a guest but thought no more of it than of their use of
                    ice for the butter;13 the real villain of the tragedy was
                    not yet unmasked.
            There were few doctors in the Pocket14 at that time and most
                    of them had had very little medical education, but the very best of that day, at
                    any place in the world, could hardly have coped with the plagues of malaria and
                    typhoid. Camp sanitation was something to which no one paid much attention; the
                    Crimean War and its lessons were far in the future. In 1822 many desperate
                    victims went as far as 
                        Evansville
                     to consult a physician, but Faux said the doctor had little or no
                    skill and lost most of his patients. Faux may have unwittingly come to the core
                    of the problem when he said, "Water is bad, white, or milky, at 
                        Princeton
                    ; but beds are good, with the bed-room doors next the street,
                    unlocked all night, in order that ingress and egress may be free, which is the
                    more necessary, as there are, as is very generally the case here, none of those
                    accommodations, either within or without doors, which an Englishman looks upon
                    as quite indispensable."15
            
            Since the Pocket had such a bad reputation for unhealthful conditions, it is not
                    surprising to find that doctors were among its first inhabitants16 and that patent medicines occupied a prominent place on the shelves
                    of the general stores. The records of daily transactions at one of these, Jones
                    and Stockwell, which opened for business on November 28, 1815,17 do not show sales of any medicine until December 29, but from then on
                    drugs figured largely on the books: a bottle of bitters, $1.00;
                    rheumatic drops, $2.00; worm lozenges, $.50; Elixir of
                    Health, $2.50; Nature's Grand Restorative, $1.50;
                    "patent medicine," $1.50; a box of pills; a box of
                    "itch ointment"; a bottle of "Nervous
                    Cordial"; one-half pound of barks; an ounce of camphor;
                    "Stomachic Elixir"; a box of antimonial pills;
                    Dyott's Pills; "box dentifrice and Brush for cleansing the

                    Judge Willis Os-borne; Samuel Hogue, carpenter and contractor, and James W.
                    Hogue, wheelright, brothers and leaders in the Reformed Presbyterian Church,
                    both as elders and the second as organizer of the first Sunday School in the
                    community; Calvin Merry, Calvin Minnis, Robert Milburn, hatter, all of the same
                    church; John Arbuthnot, saddler and postmaster for many years; Joseph 
                        Montgomery
                    , of the large clan of Montgomerys who ruled 
                        Montgomery
                     Township; and Major David Robb, who held many offices of trust in
                    the county and who was the father of Achilles (pronounced Ach-illus), the first
                    white child born in the county.18
            
            The sale of medicine proceeded at an even rate during the ensuing years. To the
                    nostrums given above were added as time went on various others such as Blue Mass
                    Pills, Bateman's drops, castor oil, paregoric, laudanum, oil of
                    worm-seed, spirits of turpentine, hartshorn, calomel, Harlem oil, calomel and
                    jalop, opodeldoc, extract of peppermint, mercurial ointment, red
                    "percepitate," Epsom salts, "strengthening
                    plarsters," and endless amounts of wine, brandy, and cordials, reputed
                    the very best medicine of all. The quantities sold varied with the season but
                    reached a peak in fall and winter. In 1822, "the year of the terrible
                    sickness," and in 1823, almost as bad locally, every customer who came
                    into the store bought at least one kind of medicine and sometimes several. Even
                    if nothing were known from other sources, these records alone would make plain
                    the fact that something catastrophic was happening.
            The number of deaths is also indicated: "five yards Cambrick for
                    shroud," or "six yards Cambk. for winding sheet," or
                    "mourning robe 4.25 for Margaret" (evidently a cerecloth or
                    burial garment, not a mourning garment for the living). These items were almost
                    always charged to an individual's account by someone with an entirely
                    different name, as if a friend or neighbor had performed the sad errand for the
                    bereaved. At the same time white kid shoes were often purchased, or gloves or
                    stockings, and almost always "1 Ball Boss"19 (to fasten the coffin?) and a bed-cord

                     19 The article "ball of boss"
                            occurs more often than any other in all of the 1,346 large pages of
                            Stockwell's ledgers. It must be bass (it is plain from other
                            spellings that Princetonians of that day used the broad
                            "a"), which comes from the inner fiber or bast of
                            various plants, especially from the basswood or linn tree, plentiful in
                            the locality. Bast was used to make cordage.
               
                     (to lower it?). Coffin screws were always
                    bought a half dozen at a time by one of the cabinet-makers, David Ritchie or
                    Samuel Boicourt; and within the next week or two, black silk hatbands,
                    block-bordered handkerchiefs, and a few yards of bombazine, much used for
                    mourning dress, were bought by the next of kin. Many of the dead were buried in
                    private burying grounds on the home acres; some in the Archer Cemetery, deeded
                    by Robert Archer in 1811 out of his homestead to the Reformed Presbyterian
                    Church and still governed by their successors; some in the graveyard just north
                    of town, set aside when the town was platted in 1814 from land then belonging to
                    the Dimicks and now known as the Warnock Cemetery.
            Of many physicians of the earliest days in 
                        Gibson County
                     little is known except their names and locations. Dr. Cook lived in
                    Owensville; Dr. Day, in Fort Branch; and Dr. Jones, in 
                        Montgomery
                     Township. Jones spent three days at 
                        Brown
                    's Tavern20 in 1819, while he was
                    attending court, a favorite pastime in those days; he is credited with a small
                    sum brought forward from the previous ledger. Dr. Willis Smith also came from
                    near Owensville; he had a bill for $5.371/2 at 
                        Brown
                    's Tavern in 1821 and a bill at Stockwell's for
                    $5.75 in 1822. There is also Dr. John Kell, who is said to have lived
                    in 
                        Princeton
                     about 1816.21 Mention should be made too of Dr.
                    Maddock or Maddox, who came from 
                        Kentucky
                     at an early date and married the widow of Captain Jacob Warrick,
                    killed at 
                        Tippecanoe
                    ; she was Jane Montgomery of 
                        Montgomery
                     Township. He traded with Jones and Stockwell at frequent intervals,
                    and he attended the dinner for General William H. Harrison in 1821.22
            
            Much more information is available about Dr. Thomas Polke, who came in 1814. He
                    lived at 
                        Princeton
                     for several years, owned property there, and had a considerable
                    practice. Apparently he never stayed at the Tavern nor did he go to balls. He
                    voted at the town meeting in the spring of 1818 when the question of
                    incorporation was under discussion, and he was a regular and valuable customer
                    of Jones and 
                  
                     20 Ledger C of Basil Brown's Tavern in 
                                Princeton
                             is in the possession of Mrs. Miller; its 360 pages cover
                            the period from January 1, 1819, to March 16, 1822. It should be noted
                            that the word "doctor" is never written
                            "Dr." in these early books; it is either written out
                            in full or, if abbreviated, "Doctr" with the
                            "r" above the line.
                  
                     21 Perhaps his wife was the Mrs. Kell who served
                            the community as midwife after 1816; she is not so well remembered as
                            the intrepid Mrs. John Severns, who thought nothing of swimming her
                            horse across the flooded Patoka at the call of duty. Tartt, History of 
                                    Gibson County

                     22 This was probably Joseph Maddock, ibid., 53.
               
                     Stockwell. He bought wearing apparel from
                    them in 1816: cloth ($17.50), vest "patern"
                    ($4.00), "pading," silk and twist, buttons,
                    shirting, cambric, leather gloves, a castor hat ($8.00), a watch
                    chain (50¢), a pair of pumps ($2.50), a fancy cotton
                    handkerchief, and a silk handkerchief. Purchases for his household included: a
                    bucket, a pitcher, a tin pan, letter paper, five pounds of sugar, a padlock, a
                    looking glass, a pair of brass candlesticks ($3.50), a hoe, a
                    stocklock, and a cake of soap; and for himself he bought many, many twists of
                    tobacco. He also drew large sums of cash: $50.00, $7.50,
                    $80.00, $13.00; and paid various bills through Jones and
                    Stockwell: to Decker, $2.50 and $3.00; to Hopkins,
                    $40.00; to Latham, $6.50; and to Samuel Hogue, Sr., the
                    builder, many sums large and small. Polke, who is reputed to have built an
                    unusually fine house in the country southwest of town, must have been a very
                    substantial citizen. The last entry in his name is dated April, 1818. Later he
                    moved to Greenwood, near 
                        Indianapolis
                    , where he and his son started a canning factory.23
            
            Further details about Polke are to be found in Fordham's Narrative. "If particular circumstances [probably the
                    unforeseen arrival in this country of his sister Maria] had not happened I
                    should probably have gone up the Natchitoches or Red River on a trading
                    expedition to the Osage Nation. An honest little doctor of 
                        Princeton
                     was out last winter 600 miles up the Red River, and made a
                    profitable trip of it. He likes the Country so well that he is going to take his
                    young wife and infant, his father in law, and his wife's brothers and
                    sister, with him, to settle on that remote frontier, 300 miles above the town of
                    Natchitoches. I had almost engaged to go with an expert hunter and Indian
                    trader, a second Drewyer or Clarke, when Dr. P—told me of his plan.
                    This seemed to add safety to enterprise; and we reckoned on engaging a large
                    boat's crew to carry with us arms, beaver traps and Indian goods, and
                    to make it a trading expedition on my part, a hunting one on
                    J—'s and to facilitate Dr. P—to settle with his
                    family. If I liked the adventure, I should return in the ensuing fall of the
                    year, and buy the furs which J—and P—would by hunting and
                    by barter be able to procure. Our market would have been 
                        New Orleans
                     or 
                        New York
                    , according to circumstances."24

                        other doctor in 
                            Princeton
                         whose name began with "P."
                        "J" was probably Jacob Johnson, a famous hunter and
                        surveyor. Tartt, History of 
                                Gibson County

            Dr. Dyott's name first appears on Stockwell's books early in
                    1816, when Dyott's Elixir was sold at the store. He seems not to have
                    practised medicine but to have sold drugs in wholesale quantities. In March,
                    1816, he received a credit of $272.00 by his bill of medicine, less
                    $2.78 for transportation of 139 pounds from 
                        Pittsburgh
                     at 2¢ a pound. Two broken bottles of Balm of Iberia cost
                    him $4.00; two bottles of toothache drops and one bottle of eyewater,
                    also broken, cost him $1.50. In 1822 he owed $7.49 for
                    carriage on 127 pounds of medicine from 
                        Philadelphia
                     ; for the medicine itself he received a credit of
                    $131.25. In 1823 his credit on invoice of medicines was
                    $241.75 and he owed for carriage from 
                        Philadelphia
                     202 pounds at 6 1/2¢, $12.62 1/2. In 1824 he
                    paid for carriage of 76 pounds at 7¢, $5.32.25 From the foregoing it would seem that Dyott not only dealt largely
                    in the sale of medicine he bought from the East but also in some he himself made
                    up. Jones and Stockwell's surviving books do not go beyond 1824, and
                    there is no later news of Dyott.
            Dr. Thompson lived in 
                        Princeton
                     in 1823. On the flyleaf of Stockwell's ledger is a note:
                    "Doctr. Thompson's rent of the stable and crib commenced in
                    March the 27th, 1823 at a reasonable rate." At intervals during the
                    next few years, he bought from the store various medicines for his patients,
                    among whom were Colonel John I. Neely, General Robert M. Evans, and Charles
                    Phillips. There is no record of him elsewhere.
            Dr. John D. Wolverton was followed by Dr. Charles Fullerton (sometimes spelled
                    Foolerton) in 
                        Princeton
                    , even in the house in which they lived. According to the flyleaf,
                    Wolverton's rent commenced on July 18, 1822, at $5.50 a
                    month and ended on February 18, 1823. On February 22 Fullerton took over. In
                    August, 1823, Fullerton bought from Stockwell four dozen vials and a bottle of
                    castor oil, sending a boy on this errand; presumably he retailed the oil in the
                    small vials. This pattern was repeated at intervals during several years. In
                    1824 his bill for medicine was $114.13, which with cost of
                    transportation amounted to $122.28. He was married: his account shows
                    purchases "per lady" of 6 yards of Irish linen,
                    $4.50, and a pair of silk gloves, $1.00. In 1823 Fullerton
                    bought a hat from Jones and Stockwell for $6.00, charged to Charles
                    La Serre, who had married Maria Fordham. Fullerton's name appears for a
                    long period; the latest is on George N. Jerauld's book of 1835,26 but he lived in 
                        Princeton
                     much 
                  
                     25 The prices of local products are given in
                            dollars and cents, instead of the pounds, shillings, and pence quoted
                            for eastern prices.
                  
                     26 George N. Jerauld operated a store on the

                     later than that. He is sometimes listed as
                    a physician of 
                        Montgomery
                     Township, but perhaps this means that he made visits there from 
                        Princeton
                    .
            Dr. Walter and Dr. Foster were business partners for a long time, beginning in
                    1819. Since they dealt in general merchandise as well as drugs, it is natural
                    that their names do not appear among the customers of Jones and Stockwell, but
                    both are on the tavern accounts. Walter's (sometimes spelled Waters)
                    bill there started in January, 1819, with the sum of $10.54 1/2
                    brought down from 1818. He continued to buy breakfasts and horse feed, wine,
                    dinner, his man's dinner, sangaree, and board for twenty days. He went
                    to every ball: December, 1818, "to ball club, 3.00"; January
                    1, 1819, "To Ball club for self and brother, 2.00"; February
                    26, "To ball bill, 1.00"; March 10, "To ball club for
                    S. Browning, 1.00"; March 12, "To club at ball per ditto
                    1.00." His total bill at this time came to $46.29 1/2,
                    against which he received a credit by bill rendered of $34.29 1/2. On
                    June 9, 1821, he was one of the fifty-five who dined at the tavern with General
                    Harrison at $1.25 a plate. Walter's bill at the end of the
                    summer came to $81.64, carried to Ledger D. Fordham paid
                    "Dr. Waters" $23.75 and Birkbeck paid him
                    $8.00, this being the third doctor Birkbeck called in.
            Foster began boarding at the tavern on March 20, 1820. He went to several balls,
                    had various drinks, sangaree, punch, a glass of "todda," owed
                    for horsekeep, and on July 8 owed the tavern $58.41. He continued
                    along the same lines until in October the amount was $119.50. Against
                    this sum are credits by cash paid, $50.00, and by account rendered to
                    Basil 
                        Brown
                    , the owner, $58.41. A total credit of $108.41
                    was transferred to Ledger D.
            Dr. Joel F. Casey was a conspicuous figure in the community after his arrival in
                    1816 until his untimely death in 1828. One of the group of young professional
                    men who boarded at the tavern, he went to all the balls and stopped in nearly
                    every day for a drink.27 His purchases at
                    Stockwell's show that he dressed well and that he wore out many fiddle
                    strings. He was a Mason, one of the first three "initiates under
                    dispensation" in 1820, and served as steward. In 1818 he acted as clerk
                    of the town meeting; two years later he was 
                  1832 until his death in 1894. Some of the records are in the Indiana
                            University Library; the remainder are the property of Mrs. Miller. In
                            early days the name Jerauld was always accented on the last syllable as
                            an indication of its French origin.
                  
                     27 The tavern seems to have been the most popular
                            cocktail bar of its day. Jones and Stockwell was directly across the
                            street from the tavern, and no doubt both were popular lounging
                        places.
               
                     appointed county agent but resigned in
                    1821, perhaps because of the demands of his large practise. His wife was a
                    daughter of Judge William Harrington and some of their descendants are still
                    living in 
                        Princeton
                    . "He was a good doctor and a gentleman greatly esteemed by
                    the community."28
            
            An itemized list of entries relating to him at Stockwell's and the
                    tavern would be long, for he was a frequent and rather extravagant purchaser,
                    many of his things being labeled "fancy" or
                    "fine" and above average in cost. On at least one occasion his
                    friends Basil 
                        Brown
                     and Colonel Neely went shopping with him, when they all three
                    bought expensive vest patterns, one after the other, down the page. Casey had
                    big bills at the balls too, and his liquor bills often specified "bowl
                    of punch," "part in egg-nog," "two glasses
                    wine," "club at egg-nog," "domestic wine
                    with Devin,"29 along with other indications that he
                    liked to entertain his friends. He paid $8.00 for two
                    "scholers" at whatever lessons it was that Mrs. Lora Chandler
                    gave in the ballroom at the tavern, and he bought two small books for Christmas
                    gifts—the only time the word "Christmas" is used in
                    these pages.
            As was customary at this time when hard money was scarce, many patients paid
                    their doctor's bills by placing credits to his accounts at the store or
                    tavern—a very convenient way for the historian to find out what they
                    were: Andrew Ralston, $5.50; Henry Hopkins, $13.00; James
                    McGarrah, $2.00; James McClure, $3.00; Alexander Nicoll,
                    $15.00; Jacob Braselton, $8.00; James Evans,
                    $10.75; 
                        Brown
                    's medical bill, $75.00; D. Johnson,
                    $1.25; Joseph Whitesides, $2.50; Oliver Mattieson,
                    $3.00; Ashley Stanforth, $5.00; James Finney,
                    $12.00; B. Armistead, $4.00. Some of these were paid by
                    note, some in cash; and Casey made a good many cash deposits himself without
                    specifying the source. His total for the year was $995.003/4 which is
                    marked "settled Jan. 22, 1820."
            Casey sold a horse for $40.00 and a note is made that on February 15,
                    1820, his "horse was taken to Goodlet's to keep."30 He was also one of the fifty-five who attended the dinner
                    for General Harrison June 9, 1821. The picture to be drawn from these details is
                    that of a charming personality,

                     29 The Rev. Alexander Devin was a much respected
                            Baptist minister.
                  
                     30 James Goodlet was a lawyer, judge of the

                            church at its organization in 1828. Woods, "Presbyterianism in

            Doctors who were contemporary with Fullerton's later years were Vincent
                    T. West, Dr. Wilkes, I. I. Pennington,31 and Robert and J.
                    M. Stockwell. The first three are mentioned in George N. Jerauld's
                    ledger for 1835, and West and Pennington lived at 
                        Princeton
                     until late in the century; Pennington died in 1897 at the age of
                    92.
            J. M. Stock well's account books have been preserved and are available
                    for examination.32 On the fly-leaf is written, "Dr.
                    J. M. Stockwell came to 
                        Princeton
                     from Flemingsburg in October, 1835, and left for 
                        Evansville
                     the following February, 1836." A few of his entries may be
                    quoted as instances of the charges in practise: for visit, 50¢; Blue
                    Mass pills, 25¢; visit and bleeding wife, 50¢; visit and
                    dressing wound and reducing fractured arm, $5.00; visit at night and
                    medicine, $2.00; visit and cupping child, $1.00;
                    extracting tooth, 25¢; "cath. and linament," 62
                    1/2¢; "laud, et vial.," 25¢; visit in
                    part at night, $1.87 1/2; for "consultation with Dr.
                    Penn," $5.00. Entries close half way down the page on
                    February 16 and there is a gap until March, when Dr. Robert, Jr., took over.
            Tooth extractions went up to 50¢, but there were many of them.
                    Seidlitz, wine and antimonial wine, tincture of digitalis and lobelia, cough
                    drops and balsam, bone "linament," blister, and strengthening
                    "plarsters," "qui. and cath." figure largely
                    in the medicines prescribed. His range of visits extended from 
                        Columbia
                     (now Patoka), William Johnson, "for visit son part night
                    and medicine," $5.00; then follows "for visit son
                    and med," $3.99; to Pigeon Creek, William Davis, visit and
                    medicine, $4.00. His prescriptions and fees include syrup squills;
                    "Re. prescription for gonorrh. 1.25"; for opening an abscess
                    $1.50; for opening a felon, $.50; for a night visit and
                    operating as accoucheur, $10.00; visit in consultation with Dr.
                    Pennington, $5.00; visit at night and attention in parturition,
                    $13.00; visit and attention, $8.00. Evidently his price
                    varied, but these two night cases on the same date, recorded in a shaky hand,
                    bear witness to the fact that obstetrical cases never come singly and are always
                    rigorous, especially so when the doctor himself kept the long, exhausting vigil
                    in a crowded, stuffy room.
            Robert Stockwell left 
                        Princeton
                     in 1840. The last entry in his book is a charge to Alfred

                    company with Dr. P. 12.00." West and Pennington bought some of his
                    medicines: one ounce quinine, $5.00; one gross vials,
                    $3.00; one-half pound tartaric acid, 50¢; six ounces
                    calomel, $1.43; one bottle castor oil, 75¢. He sold his
                    gig-lamps to Henry Williams for $7.50, paid for in part by mending
                    the gig for $2.00 and by painting chairs, $1.50. It is
                    pleasant to realize that he had been promoted from saddle and saddle bags, but a
                    gig is still a far cry from the modern doctor's Cadillac or other
                    golden coach.

                            an epidemic appears in the Southall letters. In 1845, Sydney Spring, who
                            had married Hannah Prichard, wrote to Samuel Southall telling of her
                            death from "an epidemic of Putrid sore throat, which also
                            carried off four of her children." See Southall, Records of the Southall Family, passim.

            The name of Dr. Gorton Jerauld should not be omitted from the list of medical men
                    in the pioneer days of 
                        Princeton
                    , though it is not likely that he practised medicine there. His stay
                    was short, from 1819 when he came out from 
                        Rhode Island
                     with his wife and younger children to join his oldest son, William,
                    until 1822, the "year of the terrible sickness," when he died
                    at the age of seventy. He had had a distinguished career in his native state,
                    where he had served as surgeon with the First Battalion of 
                        Rhode Island
                     militia in the Revolution and had continued his service to
                    suffering humanity in his hospital in East Greenwich. Jerauld had also operated
                    a hospital for inoculation and treatment of smallpox in Warwick. He was the son
                    of Dr. Dutee Jerauld, who was in turn the son of Dr. James and Martha Dupree
                    Jerauld, of a family of French Huguenots who had fled from 
                        France
                     at the time of the St. 
                        Bartholomew
                     massacre in 1572 and had lived for a generation or two in 
                        England
                     before coming to America. Dr. Gorton Jerauld was named for his
                    mother, Freelove Gorton, grand-granddaughter of the famous Samuel Gorton of
                    Shawomet, friend of Roger Williams and founder with him of some of our most
                    precious civil and religious liberties. The Jerauld name was kept alive in 
                        Princeton
                     for many years and his grave, marked with a flag as that of a
                    soldier of the Revolution, is officially decorated every year.35
            
            
               
                        
                     35 Samuel Gorton (1592–1677) came to 
                                Boston
                             from 
                                England
                             in 1637 in the belief that he would find religious
                            toleration in the New World. Disillusioned by the intolerance he
                            experienced, he left the colony in 1638 and eventually settled at
                            Shawomet, which was renamed Warwick in 1648 in honor of
                            Gorton's friend, the Earl of Warwick. He spent the remainder of
                            his life there in peace and honor, serving as Warwick's
                            representative in the 
                                Rhode Island
                             colonial assembly, as judge of the high court, and in
                            writing several religious treatises, some of them surprisingly modern in
                            concept. He has been styled the premature John the Baptist of New

                            county offices and his elder son, William, who had preceded his father,
                            was the first secretary of the 
                                Princeton

                            square, which his nephew George N. Jerauld bought in 1832 and operated

            Except for Dr. William Curl, the first graduate physician to practise in the
                    Pocket but not a pioneer,36 it has not been possible to find
                    out where the 
                        Princeton
                     doctors received their medical education. The three Jeraulds had
                    probably passed their store of information down from father to son. Others may
                    have studied in the East or at Transylvania in 
                        Kentucky

                        Princeton
                     physicians. They probably read medical treatises in the offices of
                    older practitioners as aspiring lawyers did, or were apprenticed to practising
                    doctors, as was the custom of the day in 
                        England

                        something of a landmark known all over the county. William also built and
                        ran a cotton mill very successfully until it burned. Perhaps he brought the
                        idea of a textile mill from his home town of Pawtucket, 
                            Rhode Island
                        , where Moses

                            Princeton
                         was not in operation during the visits of the English travelers
                        who were very pessimistic about the town's business prospects!

                        Well my little boy Elliott.
                        Pappy thought that he would write his little boy a little letter.
                                    I am in a little house made of little logs, this little house
                                    has a little fire place in it, and this cold day pappy keeps a
                                    big fire. I just got done browning some rye for to make coffee,
                                    the men does not give us quite coffee enough to do us here.
                                    Pappy gets his own dinner, and supper and breakfast. I cook meat
                                    make coffee and good gravy and sometimes bake corn cakes, we
                                    pound our coffee in a tin instead of grinding it on a coffee
                                    mill.
                        never mind wait till pappy gets home and we will show mother how
                                    to cook and make gravy.
                        Elliott dont you think the men wanted me to go away off with my
                                    mule team through the mud and rain and cold, and there was
                                    another man went in my place and let me stay in my little house
                                    by the fire, dont you think that he was a good man for going in
                                    my place.
                        there is a great big river here lots wider than clear across
                                    grandmothers orchard
                        pappy washed his shirt and drawers today.
                        Elliott you must be a good boy. pappy will come home after a
                                    while.

                                    it is appreciated as sabbath here. Indeed few know that it is

                                    go up to the sanctuary of the Lord today, to make prayer before
                                    the throne. No church bell ringing to invite us thither. The old
                                    clock does not stand on the mantle to tell us that the hour has

                                    in order to show their little feet the way to the Lords house.
                                    None of Zions familiar songs are sung to put our minds in frame
                                    for the day, but filthy wicked songs are heard throughout the
                                    camp, profanity floats from nearly every breath. Nearly every
                                    one is doing something diverse from the honor of the Lord, or
                                    keeping his day holy. Alas! for the people of these united
                                    states! this war is raging with telling effect on their morals.
                                    I will now change the subject a little I am ceartain if I had to
                                    live here in the south, even if there was no war, and had my
                                    family with in the bargain, that I should pine away and die for
                                    want of a contented mind. The people here do not seam like
                                    people, they are shamefully ignorant, their children grow up a
                                    great deal like their horses, they are learned to help raise a
                                    little something to eat and to go to mill, and that is about
                                    all. One of their justices of the peace decided that it took 20
                                    rods and three grains, (barly corn grains he called it) to make
                                    an acre of ground when it takes 160 rod to make an acre.
                        I have a very nice little shanty to stay in here, and am very
                                    comfortable now but it may not last long.
                        For three days we have had settled cold weather., much like
                                    winter in Indiana. Oh how I would like to know where my little
                                    family is today and what they are doing, but I expect they are
                                    in the old cabin around a warm stove. My health is good except I
                                    do not feel so stout on account of having the diarrhoea by
                                    spells.
                        I do not expect to get entirely shut of it while I am in the
                                    service. I have to be exposed too much, and eat too much fat
                                    bacon.
                        Well I had but little to write when I commenced and I guess I had
                                    better quit.

                         Dear Amanda.
                        I have just come back from 
                                        Chattanooga
                                    . I was there with the team for rations. I thought
                                    that I would write some more in this letter before I sent it, as
                                    I forgot to send it befor I left, which was four days ago.
                                    Daniel Walter was to 
                                        Chattanooga
                                     with me. we had a very cold trip of it. but got
                                    back all safe.
                        My health is still good.
                        Driving team is very hard work a little harder than I like  to do for 13 dollars per.
                                    month. I received a letter from you yesterday and am sorry that
                                    you are sad on account of not getting any letters from me for so
                                    long a time I could not write while we were coming from 
                                        Nashville
                                     was the trouble. Be assured that you have my
                                    prayres and warmest love.

                              Harrisson's Landing. Tenn
                              
                           
                                     Feb. 3'd. '64
                                
                        Dear Wife—.
                        The talk is that we will leave here soon the company is to go on
                                    courier duty I think a few miles up the river.
                        It might not be out of place to tell you what a courier line is.
                                    Well ther is a courier line from Bridgeport, to 
                                        Knoxville
                                     (and further for any thing that I know.) That is,
                                    there are cavalry or mounted infantry stationed at posts within,
                                    from four to six miles of eachother, and about six men at each
                                    post, for the purpose of carrying dispatches or letters from one
                                    place to another. For instance, suppose that a dispach is to go
                                    from Bridgport to 
                                        Knoxville
                                    . the first courier post sends it to the next post,
                                    that post sends it to the next and so on untill it gets to 
                                        Knoxville
                                    . You will excuse me for writing nothing very
                                    important, as there is nothing of that kind to write.
                        Let me know whether you find any thing in this letter. 
                        
                                    Yours forever.

                                    March 9th. '64.
                                
                        Dearest one—.
                        Yours of the 28th. ult. came yesterday, a most
                                    welcome visitor indeed, and, as does all of your letters, it
                                    rendered me no small amount of satisfaction.
                        You spoke of time passing unenjoyed. Now I cannot say that I
                                    enjoy the time as it passes, yet I am not down hearted, time
                                    passes swiftly here, a day seemingly, but appears untill it is
                                    gone. If no misfortune befalls us, and I get out of the service
                                    next fall, it will not be long until that time comes. Whether I
                                    will have to stay three years or not I can not tell. If I do
                                    have to stay we will have to take it as easy as possible, for it
                                    will be only a little over a year after the  ballance are out. my time counts
                                    from the 12th. of last Oct. one yeare ago. but
                                    I think that I will not have to stay three years. You speak of
                                    some getting scart about the draft. Well they need not be scart,
                                    for they are no better than the ballance of us. and are just as
                                    much bound to serve Uncle Sam. a while as we are.
                        You wished to know whether I get any papers. We can get the 
                                        Cincinnati
                                     Commercial or 
                                        Louisville
                                     Journal, or 
                                        Nashville
                                     times or press, or 
                                        Chattanooga
                                     Gazette, every day if we want them, but they cost
                                    from 5 to 10 cents a peice. besides there are a number of other
                                    papers come around, but not so regular. The boys that were out
                                    on the scout have had some pretty tight skirmishing a few have
                                    been taken prisoners. We have commenced moving camp to Ringold,
                                    a distance of about ten miles, only part of our wagons were here
                                    and they could not take all of the camp equipage, so some of us
                                    are here yet waiting for the waggons to come back to haul the
                                    ballance of the things.
                        The weather here is nice except it look some like rain just now.
                                    I am having a nice time now probably the main reason is that I
                                    am enjoying better health now than I have for more than six
                                    month past. I have just cooked a pot of beans for supper, which
                                    would not eat so bad even at home. This war is makeing a great
                                    many good cooks, quite a number of the boys can bake just as
                                    good biscuit as any one would wish to eat.

                        My own kind Wife—.
                        I have just received two letters from you. The first dated March
                                    2 which contained a needle and one of Elliott's teeth.
                                    Oh it done me good, simple as it was.
                        We are now at camp at Ringgold 
                                        Georgia
                                    , which is situated in rather a nice valley on
                                    Chickamauga Creek. The veterans are to start home next Sunday,
                                    and it is said that then the ballance of us will move to some
                                    other place. The veterans 
                                    so that it will not run. If you wish, and have money enough you
                                    may send it off and get it fixed, it will cost about
                                    $2.50. It has been quite cold here for a couple days.
                        We were on vidette when I received your letters.
                        I think of nothing more just now.
                        
                           I remain your Husband evermore.

                        Dear Wife.
                        Having just arrived here, that warm and unwavering love for you,
                                    which has been strengthened by being with you, prompts me first
                                    of all to write a few lines I have nothing of Interest to write
                                    you except concerning my trip down here.
                        I got to Winchester on monday by half after two o'clock,
                                    without being very much tired I stopped at Forces and got dinner
                                    and made arrangements for N Ross to take my over coat out to
                                    Jacksons the next day.
                        We could not get to Start from Winchester that evening at 5.
                                    O'clock, so A. Mason, and me went to Union that night
                                    on the cars and walked out to hill grove to W. Kramers and had
                                    supper about one o'clock at night, had a fine talk with
                                    Wesly and Hannah Started then about daylight for 
                                        Indianapolis
                                    , and arrived here about 1. o'clock today.
                                    We was to leave here this evening for 
                                        Chattanooga
                                     but we will not get away before tomorrow.

                        Dear Wife—.
                        I thought it best to write you a few lines again today. The
                                    Captain says that we will leave here this evening. We are not
                                    drawing any thing here but canteens, havre sacks, and shelter
                                    tents. I do not know where we will draw our horses. We have the
                                    same guns that we had.
                        P. S. we will get no pay here.
                        
                        You will hear frome again the first chance I have to write.

                        Dear Amanda—.
                        This is Sabbath, and is very pleasant excepting there are some
                                    appearances of rain. We are not yet paid, but will be today or
                                    tomorrow I will tell you in this letter what I did not like to
                                    in my other ones When I got to 
                                        Indianapolis
                                     I found that some one had taken all my blankets I
                                    had one gum, and two woolen blankets. So I had to sleep without
                                    any blankets untill last night. We drew new ones yesterday. I
                                    would have told you this in my first letter but I did not want
                                    you to know it untill I was better off. I am well and cheerful
                                    so far as the surrounding circumstances can make me But it would
                                    be the most extreeme vainty for me to try to fill up that empty
                                    void in my heart, caused by the absence of my family, with
                                    earth's brightest pleasures, or her most lovely
                                    objects.
                        All those things which engage the attention of the mirthful
                                    around me, are to me but vain and empty things.
                        My comfort is derived from the religion which I enjoy, and the
                                    comfortable hope which I entertain of shortly realizing my
                                    hearts best wishes,—the enjoyments of my family and
                                    friends.
                        I must say for the credit of the reg't that it is much
                                    better behaved here and at 
                                        Indianapolis
                                     where whiskey is to be had, than I had expected.
                        War news is still very good. Grant is workind Lee up at a
                                    desperate rate. Thomas the commanding General at 
                                        Chattanooga
                                     has taken 5000 prisoners, and is hotly pursuing the
                                    rebels.
                        We expect to leave here soon and at the next convenient
                                    opportunity you will hear from your unworthy

                        Well Amanda We are in camp abut two and a half miles south of 
                                        Nashville
                                    , in a very nice open piece of woods. The weather is
                                    quite warm through the day, but cool at night, peaches are as
                                    large as a full grown plumb, every green and nice. I have washed
                                    up nice and blackened my boots, and now my heart's best
                                    joys would be complete, if I could by your side, and in company
                                    with our little girl and boy walk to the house of the Lord and
                                    spend a season in praising his great name. I expect we will stay
                                    here untill we get horses, but how that will be I cannot tell.
                        My health and the health of the reg't is very good. I am
                                    buncking with S. Hilton, D. Towle, and Henry Barbar.
                        I have not received a letter from you since I came back, but I am
                                    looking for one every day. for I know that you will not forget
                                    me … I will close expecting soon to hear from you
                        
                                    The blessing of God be upon Your Husband

                        Kind Companion—.
                        I have just been relieved from picket guard, after having been on
                                    for two nights and nearly two days.
                        The weather is very pleasant here now, it having rained a few
                                    small Showers and thereby made the weather a little cooler
                                    through the day
                        I forgot to say in the connection that our reg't has to
                                    furnish guards for picket all around the city of 
                                        Nashville
                                    , besides two out of each company for to guard the
                                    trains of cars going to different points from here, neither one
                                    is very hard, at least on picket there is no danger of rebels
                                    and each one only has to stand two hours in twelve. The prospect
                                    seams good to stay here a while, but orders may come to leave
                                    any day.

                        Dear Companion—
                        I am seated this morning to write you a few lines. We are all
                                    tore up All the reg't has gone but the sick and the two
                                    new companies (L. & M.) Our Co is all gone but a few. I
                                    was on guard in town and they went off and left me. I am glad to
                                    tell you that I am well again.
                        It is very warm here yet.
                        It is supposed that the reg't has gone to Decature 
                                        Alabama
                                    . They went on the cars without horses, no one knows
                                    what the object is. It seams awful lonesome since the boys are
                                    gone Serg't Bosworth is with us. D Towle is still
                                    getting better but he is not able to be out of the Hospittle
                                    yet.
                        … I have to start to go where the reg't has
                                    gone in a few minutes. …

                        Dear Amanda—.
                        I am seated this morning again to give you a little different
                                    information from what I gave you yesterday. I started yesterday
                                    morning as I told you I would after some bundleing and fixing up
                                    I had a pretty good load to carry I assure you. I got pretty
                                    neart to the depot when I met H. Blowers, and he told me that
                                    they were all gone, and that I need go no further so I came back
                                    to camp, but the joke is as I came back I got into an orchard
                                    and got three apples, in which I thought there was no harm, and
                                    which I had done more than once before. There was a camp of
                                    hundred days men about 200 yards from there and as I started on
                                    to camp here came one of them with his gun and bayonet hollowing
                                    halt to me I was surprised, I halted and went to him he said he
                                    had orders to take me to his Colonel. Well I went with him to
                                    the Colonel and the Colonel set me at liberty, and I came on to
                                    camp.
                        This is a beautiful morning but it is lonesome here. My health is
                                    very good now. Papere is scarce and I have to write half sheets.

                        Dear Wife—.
                        I think it would be much better for you if you would get the Idea
                                    of hospitle nurse out of your head While that preacher and his
                                    wife was here that I have allready told you about, she was
                                    around the chaplains tent a goodeal and, and the boys would talk
                                    about her and the chaplain wheather there was any cause or not,
                                    but the way the chaplain has conducted himself heretofore, one
                                    can not tell what may have been done.
                        It seams to be my luck to wait on the sick. I have been waiting
                                    on J. Miller for a week now, he bunks with me, and is a great
                                    deal better now.
                        Dear Amanda. I expect we will not be paid off now for two months
                                    more but when we do get pay it will be a little more than common
                                    we will get 16 dollars per month instead of 13. If I am
                                    discharged with the reg't I do not expect any more pay
                                    until I am discharged. I have just picked a fine lot of
                                    blackberries. My health is excellent and I hope this will find
                                    you all well. I am as ever your true Husband.

                        Kind Companion—.
                        I scarcely know what to write, things are so nearly as they were
                                    when I last wrote you.
                        The last two nights have been very cold here, I fear that you
                                    have had frost. We are still in the same old camp, have heard
                                    but little of the reg't since it left.
                        Our mail has changed, instead of coming in the morning it comes
                                    in. in the evening. I am expecting a letter from you today, and
                                    would wait to finish this letter till the mail comes in, but
                                    then it would not start out till tomorrow. My health was hardly
                                    ever better than it is now. My appetite is too craving. I can
                                    eat untill I am in misery, and then my  appetite craves for more. This is
                                    the first morning for a week that I have not went to hunt
                                    blackberries. I am out of sugar, is the reason, but we will draw
                                    again tomorrow. It just take a whole cabbage head to make me a
                                    mess now let me know how your wheat is holding out, if it is
                                    likely to fail soon I must write to pap to let you have some
                                    wheat.
                        
                                    Your Husband.

                        Dear Wife—.
                        Things have not changed in camp since I last wrote to you; The
                                    last we heard of the reg't it was at Marietta 
                                        Georgia
                                    , with Sherman. It is very dry here. Rosting ears
                                    are plenty but they do us but little good, for we have no money
                                    to buy, and we dare not take them without buying, some are got
                                    however by the process of stealing. The same may be said of
                                    apples and potatoes.
                        I think of nothing more to write.
                        
                                     I remain as ever Your, Afectionate Husband.

                        Dearest One—.
                        I am in receipt, of a most welcome and interesting letter, from
                                    you. dated just one week ago. Such a letter amounts to an
                                    extreem satisfaction for me. I am sorry to hear of your garden
                                    being so missused, and torn up. I can call the leaving of the
                                    fence down, nothing but extreem carelessness. I wish I had got
                                    that middle fence built before I came away. Next are the letters
                                    from the hands of my little dear ones, though they do not speak
                                    a do other letters, yet they are more significant than words,
                                         Tell my little ones
                                    that papy often thinks of them, and often dreams of them in his
                                    sleep. Tell them that I have a nice bed, it is boards with hay
                                    on them, instead of a straw-tic.
                        Amanda I am sorry that I cannot get you to understand by hints
                                    that the Hospital is no place for you, but I shall be still more
                                    sorry if I shall have to use harsh word to get you out of the
                                    notion of nursing in the hospital. I speak this way because I
                                    know of them, and you dont. If you knew as much of hospitals as
                                    I do, you would never once think of being a nurse. I hope you
                                    will be satisfied on that point when you read this.
                        You say the home guards are going to have a dinner in
                                    Westchester. What have they ever done that they deserve a public
                                    dinner. The home guards and their exploits are one of the
                                    things, that the soldiers in the field, make sport over, and
                                    laugh about. What! make dinners for home guards, when a soldier
                                    who has spent his time in front fighting the enemy face to face,
                                    comes home on furlough, has to trudge back and forth through the
                                    mud on foot, and no one offers him assistance, but it may be
                                    that folks at home, have fell in love with the home guards,
                                    being continually with! the PRECIOUS FELLOWS!
                        My health is excelent, no news of importance. All are well that
                                    you you are acquainted with. I have got my Jacob Miller about
                                    well. He says that he went to school to liber the same time you
                                    did.
                        Potatoes, Aples, Cabbage, corn, and Water melons are brought into
                                    use by the boys here, by the strategic move move of stealing. I
                                    close most earnestly praying for your good, and assureing you of

                        Dear Wife—.
                        I am seated to reply to yours of the 27 ult. While you are glad
                                    of my good health, it is also a matter of no little satisfaction
                                    to me. You ceartainly have a very correct idea of the hapy
                                    meeting of 
                                        Montgomery
                                     and his wife after an absence of three days. Poor
                                    folks I expect that their hearts were allmost broken over the
                                    fearful length of their separation. Dear Amanda, it does hurt me
                                    to know that you have  to
                                    work so hard. It seams like an abuse of your good nature, and if
                                    I had any grounds to go on, I would scould you a little. You say
                                    that your health is tollerable. but I fear that your courage is
                                    all that keeps you going. Oh how much better I would feel if
                                    your circumstances were so that you need not work out of the
                                    house. …
                        We are in the same camp, without any changes particularly, the
                                    health of the boys that are here is pretty good. We have been
                                    having very heavy rains here, well the corporal says that it is
                                    time for me to go on guard, it is only to guard the well here in
                                    camp to keep the boys from making the water dirty
                        I am off guard again, and am seated to finish my letter.
                        Amanda it is hardly any use to send me thes little envelopes; it
                                    is very unhandy doing up a sheet of paper to go in them. I can
                                    get plenty of envelopes while I am here.
                        While I am writing, there is a young man scarcely 21, at the
                                    sutler shop so drunk as hardly to be able to stand on his feet:
                                    but this is only one instance of the many, which is almost a
                                    daily occurance here.
                        This leaves me in excelent health, I hope it may find you the
                                    same.
                        
                                    Your Husband 
                                    J. W. Bartmess,
                                
                        to his Dear Amanda.
                     
                  
               
                
            
                    
                  
                     
                        
                                    
                              Camp Graham Tenn
                              
                           
                                    August, 11th, '64.
                                
                        Dear Companion—.
                        The time has again come, to write you a letter. I aim to write
                                    every sunday, and once through the week. This is thursday. I
                                    spoke in my last of the reported capture of the reg't.
                                    It turnes out however not a capture but a severe raid, had it
                                    not been for the 
                                        Spencer
                                     rifles I suppose they would have been captured.
                                    They were entirely surrounded by a heavy force, and had to cut
                                    their way out. There were some other regiments that threw away
                                    their guns, and were so confused that they scarcely knew what
                                    they were doing, and when they found that our reg't
                                    were going out, they fell in behind, and come out with them.
                                    There were about 1500 came out at that time, none had guns but
                                    our reg't. and there were only about
                                    four or five hundred of them.
                        
                           Col. Harrison, was captured, but he is reported
                                    upon good authority in our lines again we have have not learnt
                                    how he got back.
                        
                        An order has come to the reg't settling the matter that
                                    the recruits will have to stay three years, It is possible that
                                    Congress will do something for us hereafter, but not probable. Well if the Lord spares me to get
                                    out of the service which will only be a little over a year more
                                    any how. they will never get me into it again. Gov Morton is
                                    trying to get as many of the soldiers home to vote as he can,
                                    but if he should get me home I would not vote for him, for he is
                                    the man that got me into this, and now him and the men that are
                                    running the government are practicing this fraud on us, It is
                                    nothing less than defrauding the recruits out of, some one, and
                                    some two years time. It would be no worse to defraud a man out
                                    of so much money, which would be a crime in civil law, yet the
                                    government calling itself the best the sun ever shone on is
                                    practicing just such a crime on thousands of Soldiers, and they
                                    cannot help them selves. It is enough to tempt one to be a
                                    butternut, but Dear wife we will have to bear it, but I will
                                    never go in the service again if I have to leave home till the
                                    war is over to keep rid of the draft.
                        And I am going to play out of duty whenever I can if I have to go
                                    in the guard house for it.
                        It makes me mad to think of it. I was drafted only for nine
                                    months, but thought that I would do even more for the government
                                    than it asked of me, and therefore enlisted for nearly two
                                    years, and they fraudulently put it down on the muster rolls 3
                                    years, as they did all other recruits, and now they say they
                                    cannot discharge us because the muster rolls are for three
                                    years. We have to grin and bear it just because the fraud was
                                    practiced by the leading men of the nation and we underlings are
                                    to be the tools with which they are to work out for them selves
                                    a great name in the world, do you not think I am out of humor?
                                    Amanda do not read what I said about it to any one.
                        I forgot to say that my health is very good.

                                    Saturday—. Augst. 20th. '64.
                                
                        Dear Companion—.
                        I thought I would commence a letter today and finish it tomorrow.
                                    You will notice by the heading of this letter that we have moved
                                    since I last wrote. The above named camp which we are now in is
                                    situated on the Cumberland river, two  or three miles from 
                                        Nashville
                                    . It is on a hill, and a nice place to camp, only it
                                    is a little hard carrying water up the hill.
                        It is now Sunday morning, but what is best yesterday's
                                    mail brought me a letter from you, dated the 15th inst. You
                                    speak of its being very dry there we have had rain nearly every
                                    day this month here. There are some things about Harrisons
                                    enlisting that look queare. He will enlist for one year if they
                                    can raise a company, that is if he can be captain of that
                                    company, I suppose. You say that none of his company enlisted,
                                    that seams to speak against him. Him being a soldier once for a
                                    year, and half of that time at home, has sort of played out. It
                                    is generally thought here that he played off to get a discharge,
                                    and you know whether he did or not, and so do I.
                        You next speak of the nights of the golden circle resisting the
                                    draft, so far as contentions are concerned, I expect one is
                                    better off down here than at home, for here every thing goes one
                                    way, but dont understand that I had rather be here than at home
                                    with you.
                        Sunday as it is, we are ordered to cut down the weeds and sprouts
                                    and to make a general cleaning up about our quarters. Well this
                                    is only a little thing and only one of the many little things
                                    done in the army, which ceartainly is wicked, now is it any
                                    wonder that this dreadful war is allowed to be prolonged as it
                                    is. Amanda I always was in favor of the administration and the
                                    war, and am yet, but there is a great evil right at the heart of
                                    the whole thing, that evil is, the war is carried on and led,
                                    principally by wicked and God dareing men. Indeed when we
                                    consider that war within itself is wicked, and the awful henious
                                    wickedness, of the army, we must conclude that it is only the
                                    amazeing and unlimited mercy of God, in favor of right, that
                                    will give us victory over our enemies.
                        Towle and Barber is still puny. Barber has gone to the hospitle
                                    at town, The boys say when Jackson took barber as a recruit that
                                    he robbed the grave yeard. sometimes they call him a living
                                    grave yard. Towl looks like a walking skeleton. They eat a great
                                    deal of green corn and apples and any thing else they can get.
                        My own health is good.

                        Dear Wife—.
                        I was down to the city today to negro Sunday school. There were
                                    nearly 400 darkies there. All seeme to be interested in the
                                    school. I next went to one of the fashionable churches of the
                                    city, and heard portion of a lifeless sermon, it was a
                                    magnifficent house, with a grand pulpit, splendid walls and
                                    cushioned seats.
                        This is the 29th. I felt so little like writing yesterday that I
                                    put off writing till today. I am on guard at the head quarters
                                    of this camp, with 17 others of our reg't. We are
                                    likely to stay here on guard as long as the reg't stays
                                    about 
                                        Nashville
                                    . We are quartered in the guard house, and have a
                                    very nice place to stay, much better than in a tent. We are on
                                    guard every-other day, and do not have to stand at night at all.
                                    some of our squad goes out into the country every day to pick up
                                    soldiers who are in mischief, and while we are out, we get all
                                    the apples and peaches that we can eat.
                        I was out this forenoon and brought in a few very nice apples and
                                    cooked them for dinner.
                        This is the 30th and it is a shame that I should be so long
                                    writing this letter, so I will try to close it now.
                        This is a beautiful morning. I have just had my breakfast, and am
                                    well and hearty. If I just knew that your health was good I
                                    would be much happier.
                        It may be that we will remain a permanent detail here, if the
                                    ballance of the reg't does leave. I will stay if I can.
                                    But this is only a supposition of my own.
                        
                                    I remain as ever your Husband
                                     Affectionately, 
                                    J. W. Bartmess

                        Dear companion—
                        I am sorry that your condition is such, that you have to be both
                                    man and wife, to dig and toil, untill I fear you will be broke
                                    down, and bear marks of age, though young. Dear Amanda I wish it
                                    could be otherwise, but the dark threatening future seems to
                                    forbid a hope for better things, for a  time. Who can know what those dark
                                    freaks, in the political heavens in the north, portend.
                        Your request to send you some old cloths, is beyond my power at
                                    present to perform. You ought to make up my infantry overcoat,
                                    into cloths for Elliott. The rebel Gen.
                                    Wheeler is making some show between here and Murfreesboro, with
                                    a few thousand cavalry. They have been fighting with him last
                                    night and this morning, no telling what it will amount to yet.
                        I told you in my last that I was on guard at the headquarters of
                                    this camp. How long I will stay here I cannot tell but I will
                                    stay here just as long as they will let me.
                        We have our victuals cooked for us now, we have a very good cook.
                                    We have a very nice thing of it here.
                        I think of nothing more now I still remain, as ever your Husband, 
                        
                                    Affectionatly, 
                                    J. W. Bartmess.
                                
                         to his dear Wife

                        Dear Companion—.
                        I received yours of the 27th ult. yesterday. It
                                    is truly a great satisfaction to learn that you are well again.
                                    And now if I only had it in my power to send you what money you
                                    need how much happier I would be. I do not know when we will
                                    draw any money, for most of our boys that were here, have gone
                                    out after Wheeler, and the main part of them is in the front. I
                                    expect you had better get some money of 
                                        Montgomery
                                     to do you till I can send you some.
                        I need not write you war news for you get that in a faster way. I
                                    will say however that Sherman has taken 
                                        Atlanta
                                    .
                        We have had desperate hot weather for the last few days. I am
                                    well and as hearty as I can well be.
                        Dear Amanda be reassured of the unyealding love of your Husband,

                        Dear Wife—.
                        You speak of the reg't coming to 
                                        Indianapolis
                                     to muster out the non-veterans. Now let me tell you
                                    that any persons, who may be feeding themselves on that notion,
                                    is sucking at a dry tit. Such a thing as the
                                    reg't coming home to vote may be, and only may be.
                                    Sirus Hanley need not hitch up to go yet for a few days.
                        Well J. Miller and I are now in the cook tent, that is we are
                                    cooking for our squad, 19 in number, that are doing provost duty
                                    here at head quarters, We have just had breakfast, and washed
                                    the dishes, and feel as comfortable as we can under the
                                    circumstances. We have good news again, John Morgan is killed
                                    his staff captured, with a number of his men.
                        The war seems to be progressing finely, and if it does not run in
                                    the ground too soon, it will find its point of destination in
                                    the gulf of Mexico, or the Atlantic Ocean,
                        If I can get to stay here I shall be pretty well satisfied,
                                    especially if I can heare once in a while that you are well at
                                    home, and have plenty to eat. Well dear Wife it does appear that
                                    the Lord intends to favor us I know that he has favored me since
                                    I have been in the service. When the reg't went to the
                                    front some time ago it hapened that I was at town on duty, is
                                    all that saved me from going with them, and it was the first
                                    that I had been from camp, for two weeks before that. It is very
                                    likely that I would have had to go with the boys after Wheeler
                                    if I had not have been here at head quarters.
                        I firmly believe that the Lord is laying out a work for me to do,
                                    and that it was necessary to give me a lesson of three years
                                    from my family, in the army, first probably to learn me to love
                                    my family, and second to learn me human nature, for no better
                                    chance is afforded one, than in the army to learn human nature
                                    It seams that I never felt such a fullness of soul to be about
                                    my masters business as I now do.
                        I have the best of health, and pray that the blessing may be
                                    yours also.

                        Dear Wife—.
                        I received a letter from Abe a few days ago. he wants to come
                                    home to vote for Lincoln and Morton. He says that pap wrote to
                                    him that he hoped that the people of the north would not resist
                                    the draft. Abe thinks that is a sign that pap is getting over
                                    his copperhead democracy

                        Dear Wife—.
                        You must not think that we have changed camps, somebody has only
                                    changed the name of our camp.
                        I will write on the opposite page concerning Heviland renting the
                                    shop, so that you can let him read it him self if you wish. This
                                    leaves me well, may it find you well also.

                                    have it one year by paying one dollar and fifty cents per month
                                    to be paid every two or three months as you think best, and

                                    he will pay you for the past use of the shop or whether he will
                                    credit it on what is comeing on the lot yet. only charge him a
                                    dollar a month for the past use.

                        Dear Wife—
                        We have been relieved from provost duty to be sent to the front,
                                    I do not know just when we will start. The order is to take 800
                                    horses to our reg't. The old non veterans will be at
                                    home before long, I told E. Fetters to stop to see you, he  is the one that took dinner
                                    with us the sunday before I left home the last time. I wish I
                                    had something to send you.
                        My health is very good, and I do hope and pray that you may all
                                    be well again, for I am so much better satisfied when you are
                                    well. The health of the boys here are good; Barber is as
                                    sprightly as a cricket and about as useless, Towle's
                                    face is swelled up prety smartly, he moves around as if he was
                                    slipping on to something. I will close by begging you to
                                    remember that you have the best wishes and earnest prayers of
                                    Your Affectionate. Husband

                        Dear Wife—.
                        I have just returned from the raid, have only been here long
                                    enough to unsaddle my horse and wash myself. I find three
                                    letters here from you and cannot wait longer to answer them. We
                                    have been on the raid just 20 days, and in all that time had not
                                    a chance to write to you. I know that you will be very anxious
                                    about me until you get this letter. I stood the raid very well,
                                    was not sick at all. but several of the boys took sick and had
                                    to be sent back. We fought the reb's nearly one whole
                                    day. had several horses killed and about 30 men killed and
                                    wounded.
                        I heard the song of several bulletts, and the ugly buzing of of a
                                    few shells while I was on the raid.
                        Sunday morning 16th. I thought I would write a few more words
                                    this morning. I have just got done washing my cloths, you may
                                    think it strange that I should wash on Sunday. My cloth was so
                                    dirty and lousy that I could not wait till another day. I had to
                                    borrow cloths to put on, till mine gets dry. This is a beautiful
                                    Sabbath I am well and hearty, and would be tollerably contented,
                                    if I could only know that my little family was well and doing
                                    well I must close and mail my letter
                        
                                     As ever yours

                        Dearest one.
                        
                        I received yours of the 11th. inst. yesterday. I am sad, and how
                                    can I help it. To know your condition makes me sad.  While I write I can allmost see you
                                    and the children suffering with acheing heads and fevered forms,
                                    with scarcely any one to ask you how you feel. This is hard,
                                    these are some of lifes heaviest sorrows, and darkest billows.
                                    Oh the wreched cruelties of this war! Who can estimate them.
                                    Look at the tears of the orphan! hear the deep lamentation and
                                    groans of the innumerable sufferers, Mark the depressed
                                    countenance of the widow, which speaks in sorrows language the
                                    deep, keen anguish of a broken heart; and then tell how cruil
                                    war is.
                        Was there any just cause for war, there might be an excuse for
                                    its cruelties, But when we remember that it is all to satisfy
                                    the wicked and fiendish ambition of man, it then assumes the
                                    horrible nature, next to the dredful realities of eternal
                                    despair. Great God when will this dredful calamity end. When
                                    will the sacrifice of blood and tears, and groans, atone for the
                                    sin of the nation, and restore thy smiles. … I would
                                    liked very much to have went home to vote, but that has played
                                    out. so that we may rest easy on that score. The order is now
                                    that we start to the reg't tomorrow morning, I will
                                    write again the next opporunity. I am well and hearty. I am as

                        Dear Companion.
                        After 11 days unavoidable delay I seat myself to write you a few
                                    lines. We left 
                                        Nashville
                                     the 20 inst, and arrived here yesterday Although we
                                    traveled ten days we only made 150 miles.
                        We are now awaiting orders, we may leave tomorrow morning, and we
                                    may not leave for a week. We have just drawn five days rations,
                                    my breakfast consisted, this morning of coffee sugar and parched
                                    corn.
                        I expect that we will go to the reg't. from here. We do
                                    not know just where the regt. is now.
                        There are a great many rumors about the rebel army. It is said
                                    that the rebel army is divided, and one part is coming in
                                    northwest of here on the Tenn. river, again report says that our
                                    forces down there have whipped him, or the rebs and are driveing
                                    them a northwest direction. I suppose that there is something of
                                    it, for the fourth army corpse that just  passed through here on their way
                                    down that direction. The weather is very nice here now, it is
                                    warm today and has the appearance of rain. My health is
                                    excellent at this time, and has been all summer and fall, and
                                    what is some comfort, is that every day that passes now is
                                    wearing away the last year in the service for me, and the next
                                    time they get me to enlist in an old reg't for the
                                    unexpired time, will be the second time, which will never be
                                    untill this government comes up to its promises. Whether that
                                    time will ever come or not is only known by the All
                                        Wise.
                        
                        I tell you Amanda whenever I get to thinking how they lied to me
                                    to get me in the service for three years, I feel vexed, yes I
                                    get mad. I love the government but such a gulling operation

                        Dear Wife—.
                        We are now in 
                                        Bryant county
                                    
                                    Geo. about ten miles from the Atlantic Ocean,
                                    and ten or fifteen miles from Savannah. Savannah is on the
                                    savannah river, 10 or 12 miles from the Ocean; the river being
                                    the line between 
                                        Georgia
                                     and 
                                        South Carolina
                                    . The rebels still hold Savannah but we have them
                                    surrounded so they cannot get out, nor get supplies.
                        We have communications with our fleet and get provision in that
                                    way.
                        We had a long trip down here, and a very pleasant one except that
                                    we had to shoot a few times at the rebs. We always had plenty of
                                    fresh meet and ham, and honey and butter when we could get it,
                                    and sweet potatoes without end. and chickens much the same. It
                                    have been the richest time in the service for me. We burned
                                    cotton enough, to nearly buy the state of Indiana.
                        It was rich to se the negros flock to the road to see us pass.
                                    and still richer to see the boys make them pull off their hats
                                    and coats and dance while we were passing.
                        If you want an Idea of the face of this country just think of the
                                    swampiest country you ever seen, and then imagine one a hundred
                                    times swampier, and you have it. the timber is  Ciprus and pine, and the ground a
                                    litteral bed of sand and in many places miery. The weather has
                                    been dry so far, and as warm as June weather in Indiana, except
                                    a few days that it froze some It is quite pleasant to go in our
                                    shirt sleeves and bare foot if we wish.
                        I never had better health than I have now.
                        It will take letters a little longer now to go and come than it
                                    did while I was at 
                                        Nashville
                                    , for they will have to go around by new york now I
                                    suppose, for there is no communication back by land now.
                        Sherman has about 90,000 men here altogether besides several
                                    thousand that are on their way here.

                        Dear Wife—.
                        Well we have moved camp again about ten miles nearer Savannah. I
                                    was in Savannah yesterday. It is quite a large place but
                                    awkwardly built. I took a look over into 
                                        South Carolina
                                     but have not been there yet. Savannah is a strongly
                                    fortified place, but a few nights ago the rebels left about
                                    ninety siege guns and a great many small canon in their works,
                                    and crossed the river into 
                                        South Carolina
                                    , bound, it is supposed, for 
                                        Charleston
                                     in all possible haste: but Sherman was awake and at
                                    their heels, and has taken a number of prisoners.
                        We have had a few days of right cool weather, cold enough to
                                    freeze ice, but it is now right pleasant again.
                        My health is good, it certainly never was better.
                        You have the best wishes and ardent love of your unworthy
                                    Husband.

                        Dear Wife—.
                        The weather here as a general is very nice, it is by spells, a
                                    few days very warm, and then a few days tollerable cool.  Cold enough to freeze the
                                    top of the ground a little. A rebel boat from 
                                        England
                                     came into savannah, not knowing but that the rebs
                                    were still there It was loaded with tea sugar coffee and peper
                                    for General Hardee. but the Captain of the boat soon found out
                                    his mistake, and could do no better than to turn over his load
                                    to the Yankeys.
                        
                        My health is still of the best quality.
                        Hoping that you may be well. I close.

                         to his Wife 
                        P.S. If you need any money, borrow some of 
                                        Montgomery
                                     for I am so far away that It will be unsafe to send
                                    money. I suppose we will have the chance to be paid of before
                                    long, but I think I shall not draw mine this pay day, there is
                                    too much danger of loosing it here, and it is safe in uncle
                                    Sam's hands.

                         Dear Companion—
                        It has been over one week since I wrote you last. I generally
                                    made it a rule to write to you twice a week, but there is
                                    nothing here now to write about, and paper costs three cents a
                                    sheet and envelopes about the same; and scarce at that,
                                    therefore I do not write so often.
                        We get but very little mail here the last letter I got from you
                                    was written on the 20th day of last November. It is a sad thing
                                    to be so long without hearing from you. but I am in hopes that
                                    all things are going well with you. …
                        Would you think that a soldier in the army loved his wife at
                                    home, if he had undue communication with negro wenches down
                                    here? Such is positively the case in this Company. …
                        I was at Savannah yesterday yesterday on General review; The
                                    military meaning of review is for the commanding General to see
                                    wheather his troups are in good fighting trim. It may be useful
                                    to an army but I can't see it.
                        
                        We are having very pleasant weather down here
                        I think of nothing more at present
                        
                                    Affectionately your Husband

                                     Jan. 22 1865.
                                
                        Dear Wife—
                        Amanda my heart aches when I look over the dreadful picture which
                                    the army presents. I am most heartily sick of this kind of life.
                                    Oh what a pleasant retreete from the repulsive, scenes of this
                                    man slaughtering life, would be the society of my family in some
                                    secluded spot, shut out from the calamities of war.
                        It seems to me that I am in the midst of a great Ocean, whose mad
                                    billows roll around and beneath, while the heavens are hid by
                                    dark and frightful clouds, which hurl their black massive forms
                                    in confusion through the air; and forked lightenings flash,
                                    streaming through and lighting up the convulsed mass of nature,
                                    only to make it look more horifying. In this state of terific
                                    horror I look out byond the fierce commotion of the elements,
                                    and my eye catches a sight, that for the time being, causes me
                                    to forget all that is around me. It is three bright loving forms
                                    in their little quiet home, longing for the storm to subside and
                                    the return of a husband and father. Will they hear me if I
                                    hollow to them that I am coming. Dear wife I am coming, nine
                                    months from today will release me from the army, and then I am
                                    coming to stay with you.
                        The weather has turned out very wet for two or three days past,
                                    and it is quite mudy and nasty getting about.
                        We are to leave here in a short time but I know not just how
                                    soon, and I do not know where we are going some think that we
                                    are going further north.
                        It is strange that I get not letters from you; I cannot make
                                    myself believe that you have not written, and if you have why do
                                    they not come. Is my wife lying sick unable to write or is she
                                    gone to the better land, or has she forgotten me. such
                                    reflections harrass my mind. I will wait patiently to know the
                                    truth of it all. let you be where you may, my heart still
                                    lingers there. I cannot forget you. Oh may God pitty and
                                    preserve us and grant us, a happy meeting soon, is the prayre of
                                    your Husband.

                         to his kind Wife.
                        P. S. I wold send you a couple dollars that I made washing
                                    if it was not several vessels have been wrecked on the account
                                    of storms lately makeing it unsafe sending letters from here
                                    with money in them.

                        Kind Wife—
                        Two days ago I wrote you a hasty letter, today I have the
                                    privilege of writing another. We have been marching since the
                                    25th. of Jan. and are not through yet. I do not know where we
                                    will go to from here. We have had but little fighting on this
                                    trip. The rebel cavalry have been watching us very close, we
                                    have marched side by side with them nearly all the time, but
                                    they have not seamed anxious to fight, neither have we. We have
                                    nice weather now, but we have had very disagreeable weather. Our
                                    march over the country has been like the blighting pestilence,
                                    for we have taken or turned upsidedown every thing before us. I
                                    have a great many things in store to tell you. …

                        to his dear Wife

                                    Apr. 2nd. 1865.
                                
                         Dear Wife—
                        Another Sabbath has come. … I look just without the
                                    tent and see a half dozen or more, running, bending, and
                                    jabbering over a game of marble. And just a little further over
                                    four more are in a sitting posture, breathing out threats, and
                                    heinous oaths over a game of cards. While in different parts of
                                    camp may be found those, who after a night of drunken revelry,
                                    at houses of ill fame, feel much like the domestic curr which has been whiped and beaten home and is
                                    lying in some corner, to allow nature to repare the bruises
                                    received in some infamous haunt. …
                        This is a beautiful day. we are having very nice weather for corn
                                    planting. The wounded of our company are doing very well. I saw
                                    Basset [?] yesterday his arm will get well as soon as such a
                                    wound can.
                        Andrew Jackson is commanding our company, he is a splendid
                                    officer Such men as him will be loved when we all get home, he
                                    is going to see Harrison some of these days and he says that I
                                    may go with him.
                        We have plenty to eat here. We have considerable duty to do but
                                    not hard duty. We have nice plank houses and nice weather, so
                                    that if soldiering is pleasant at all, it is pleasant here. But
                                    then I never saw any thing nice about soldiering.

                        to his Wife
                     
                  
               
                
            
                    
                  
                     
                        
                                    
                              
                                 
                                    Greensboro
                                . N. C.
                           
                                    May 16th. 1865 
                                
                        Dearest One—.
                        We are at present at 
                                        Greensboro
                                     N. C. how long we will stay here is unknown. Our
                                    company is on detail as scouts, and one squad of it is in 
                                        Virginia
                                     by this time I expect, after some horse thieves.
                                    Another squad is on a scout after five bushwhackers, and will
                                    not be in for two or three days, another squad is gone out 6 or
                                    8 miles, but I cannot tell what for. F. Stanley, Wm. Clauson and
                                    myself are on detail at the telegraph office in town, as
                                    orderlies.
                        Stanley is corporal now.
                        I expect that you are looking for me home soon, Well I do not
                                    know when we will come, there seems to be good prospect for
                                    staying untill my time is out.
                        Somebody has to stay untill the people get law and order
                                    restored. But there is not as much danger as if we were fighting
                                    every day, so that you will not be so uneasy about me as you
                                    was.
                        Well I must close and go to the telegraph office.
                        With the deepest love, and earnest prayers, I am
                        
                                    Affectionately Your Husband

                                     May 30 1865.
                                
                        Dear One—
                        I am seated with yours of the 16th. ult. [?] before me,
                                    attempting to answer it.
                        You state that your health is not so good I am thankful however
                                    that it is nothing worse than a cold. I deeply regret that you
                                    have to expose yourself as you do. but it seams that there is no
                                    help at present. I expect to return this fall, and I hope to be
                                    able to help you soon, save your self all you can. As you say,
                                    the death of Mr. Lincoln is a sad affair to the nation, but it
                                    is still worse for the rebels and the infamous wretches who
                                    plotted his death; for it leaves in his stead a man who will
                                    deal out to them the stern realities of the law.
                        
                        A man who will punish treason, and not pardon it, who will hang
                                    traitors by the neck, and not nurse them in his lap, Andy Johnson.
                        
                        You say you were weaving. Now I do not want you to do much of
                                    that for it is a woman killing business.
                        You speak of Heviland wanting to take things out of the shop. I
                                    will mash his head for him when I come home if he goes to
                                    figuring so fresh [?] around there while I am gone. Tell him or
                                    read this to him, that if he takes a single brick out of that
                                    chimney, that it will be a dear brick to him.
                        I wonder if he thinks that I am going to serve in the army for
                                    three years, as much for his good as mine, while he is at home
                                    to make a living for his family, while mine has to rake and
                                    scrape for themselves, and then allow him to take my wifes
                                    property, and run over her because she is a woman, and cant help
                                    it, never! while I have the muscular strength
                                    that I have now, let him or any other man try it, and I will
                                    prepare him for a place where they wont need blacksmiths, or
                                    brick either. I want it understood that the man is not well off,
                                    who insults you while I am gone.
                        If he wants the work bench or tool rack and will make a fuss if
                                    he does not get them, let him take them, but them brick in that
                                    chimney must be left there, why he had as well want the shingles
                                    off the roof, or the weatherboarding, as the chimney. You bought
                                    every thing but his tools, and his tools is all that he has a
                                    right to. I wish I was there I would settle it with him.
                        We have just got the order to move again, it is said to 
                                        Knoxville

                        Dear Wife,
                        I am seated to reply to yours of the 1st and 21st, which arrived
                                    yesterday. The first was written while you was at Hank
                                    Finkbones. I am glad that you enjoyed yourself so well at
                                    meeting. I am rejoiced at the glowing account you give of the
                                    neighborhood. It does me good to hear that the people are
                                    becoming religious. I suppose that Hank is sailing high, but I
                                    cannot suppress my doubts, for no one can trust a horse that has
                                    been in the habit of running away, But I am  surprised when you tell me that
                                    Jessee McCollum has come back to Jay. That beautiful 
                                        Iowa
                                     is played out.
                        You state that Elista weighs 44 pounds. I guess that is heavy
                                    enough for a girl four years old. but her pappy weighs some
                                    more. I weigh 182. pounds, and certainly am as healthy as I ever
                                    was.
                        H. Finkbone says if I will write to him he will answer me. Well
                                    he will not have to write any answers. If I had no one to write
                                    to but him, I would not write any. You may think this is pretty
                                    rough to write about my cousin, but how did he talk to me when I
                                    was at home. I will not forget that soon. If he ever talks to me
                                    that way again I would rather mash his pretty face, than to
                                    write to him. A man cannot be a butternut and a Christian too.
                                    The war is over now. and the rebels badly whipped, something
                                    that the butternuts said could not be done, and now I expect
                                    that the lying scoundrells will say that they were allways good
                                    union men. I know of several here who were hard rebels, who are
                                    now fixing to go north to live, and I will venture that they
                                    will deny ever being southern men at all.
                        
                        Why one of these fellows have been to 
                                        Richmond
                                    
                                    Va. and seen the stores that some northeren
                                    merchants have brought there since, its fall, and he was
                                    perfectly astonished! he had never seen such sights, he declared
                                    that there were so many nice things that he did not know what to
                                    buy first.
                        Amanda no mans heart ever loved a woman more than my heart loves
                                    now. but when I turn my thought to the Fink-bones and some who
                                    call me cousin, I look on them as mean
                                    sneaking rebels, for while I have been in the army trying to
                                    build up the government, they have stayed at home, trying to
                                    tear it down. It makes me mad I do not want anything to do with
                                    them. I expect some of them are now secretly rejoicing that
                                    President Lincoln was killed. I thought that I would never fight
                                    a man under any circumstances, but I never want to be tempted by
                                    any one speaking disrespectful of Lincoln. A better man never
                                    lived on earth than Abraham Lincoln, and I will never hear him
                                    abused. And such is the resolution of the soldiers allmost to a
                                    man.
                        Money would be a poor remuneration for what I have endured here
                                    in the army, but having restored peace and set liberty for my
                                    children, liberty for all, on a firm foundation! the society of
                                    my Wife and children with their ardent love, will be full
                                    satisfaction. You say that the woods are so nice, well we will
                                    take many a ramble in the woods yet: be patient I am coming
                                    after a while.
                        
                        You speak of the one years men Yes the ornery set never done the
                                    government any good but they are going to be mustered out right
                                    away. But we who have marched all over the southern confederacy,
                                    and have really ended the war, we must stay to the last.
                                    Shermans old army all went home but our division of cavalry. It
                                    makes me mad, but I had as well be pleased for it will do no
                                    good to get mad.
                        I am still in the Telegraph office. Frank and me often goes into
                                    the country to get good things to eat. we have a pass at will to
                                    go where we please when we are not on duty.
                        Yesterday was a day appointed by the President to hold meetings
                                    of condolence for President Lincoln I heard two very good
                                    sermons on that subject here in town yesterday We are having
                                    very nice weather except a little too warm.

                        Dear Wife—.
                        I was awakened this morning by the unwelcome peals of belching
                                    cannon, as they were devoting their coarse melody to the honor
                                    of the independace of this great nation. This day very naturally
                                    directs our minds back to the day when, the representatives in
                                    congress assembled, called into being that most noble document;
                                        The declaration of Independance Doubtless
                                    our revolutionary Fathers little thought that, that very same
                                    document would be to maintain by a most fearful and gigantic
                                    war, at no later day than this. Many hearts, this day, in the
                                    citties and towns of the north, will beat with heroic pride,
                                    while many more will swell with patriotic joy. But alas for poor
                                    me, the day has a vastly different meaning; and produces a
                                    vastly different effect upon my heart. While to some it will be
                                    all joy, and in recounting the blessings which attach to it,
                                    they will be jubilant and hapy; to me it is a sad memorial of
                                    wrongs, of privations, of afflictions of mind allmost
                                    unedurable.
                        Those who have stayed at home with their wives, and children and,
                                    friends, may well rejoice on independence day, because they have
                                    suffered no loss. But the very same service which I performed
                                    for their good, to secure their liberties, has resulted in my
                                    inestimable loss, the loss of my wifes health, if not her dear
                                    life. My very time and service for the last three years enabled
                                    those men to stay at home and take care  of their wives and children, and to
                                    make money while not only I myself have been endureing
                                    heardships, and exposing myself to dangers; and death: but my
                                    wife, the companion of my bosom, the one nearest of all to my
                                    heart; has had to battle alone with grim toil
                                    and waisting care. And now my return will be,
                                    not to a companion flushing in health and vigor, but to a
                                    faithful and true wife, who to show that faithfulness in my
                                    absence, has well nigh worn out her life. Dear Amanda, these
                                    reflections are as unendurable as theyare true. My heart
                                    reccedes from the scene, overwhelmed, and subdued with sorrow. I
                                    would yield to despair, if God had not said, that all things
                                    shall work togather for good to them that love God. If a glory
                                    as bright, as overwhelming, shall be given us at the close of
                                    our disasters, as our disasters have been sad and fearful, to
                                    what a world of glory and grandure we must be tending. I say if,
                                    when this storm is over, our joys shall be as complete, as our
                                    sorrows have been depressive, what unfathomable delights, and
                                    immeasureable bliss must await us. Well God has said that eye
                                    hath not seen neither hath it entered into the heart of man to
                                    conceive, what is in reserve for the faithful.
                        This is the morning of the fifth.
                        The negros for miles around were all in town yesterday. enjoying
                                    their jubilee of freedom.
                        This is Sunday the 9th. and I would have sent my letter sooner
                                    but I had no stamps, till today and the reg't went to 
                                        Lexington
                                     about 30 miles from here, so that I could not send
                                    letters without paying postage.
                        Well I have good news for you this time, but I am allmost affraid
                                    to tell you what it is, lest it might not be true; It is that
                                    the reg't has orders to be mustered out of the service,
                                    but do not look for us too soon, for it will be some time before
                                    we can get there. Captain Schmucks regt expects to start for
                                    home in two or three days.
                        Now do not stop writing on account of what I send you this time,
                                    for I am very anxious to hear from, especially because your
                                    health is so poor.
                        I will let you know when we go to start home. I have nothing more
                                    to write this time.
                        My health is exceedingly good
                        May God bless you and the Children, is the earnest prayer of your

                     County, Ind., Marriages, 1823–1826
            In the March, 1956, issue of the Indiana Magazine of History, 
                        Fayette
                     County, Indiana, marriages in the first book (1819–1822)
                    were printed. The second book is called Book A. Also unpaged, this book lists
                    the earliest marriage return as October 3, 1822, and the latest October 12,
                    1826. The searcher should watch for overlapping dates in 1822–1823
                    between the first book and Book A and again in 1825–1826 between Book
                    A and Book B, 1825–1833. For instance, a license might be issued in
                    one book and the marriage return recorded in the following book.

            An impressive demonstration of the objective approach in biography has been made
                    during the past decade by the late James Garfield Randall and Ruth Painter
                    Randall. The concluding number of Randall's four-volume set, Lincoln the President, is recently from the press and Mrs.
                    Randall's Lincoln's Sons is now in print.
                    This last work and its companion volume, Mary Lincoln. Biography of
                        a Marriage, published in 1953, cover the domestic life of the Lincolns.
            It seems incredible that within a period of ten years, by the use of authentic
                    sources, these two writers have been able to completely nullify the generally
                    accepted stories of the Lincoln home life. For sixty years or more William
                    Herndon was considered the outstanding authority in this phase of Lincolniana.
                    However, the place of distinction which Professor Randall occupied among trained
                    historians allowed him to successfully challenge, where others had failed, the
                    validity of Herndon's widely used compilation of folklore and
                    traditions relating to the Lincoln family.
            Mrs. Randall's first book brought to the attention of the reading public
                    the great injustice done to the widow of Abraham Lincoln by the one-time law
                    partner of her husband. Now in the author's second volume she comes to
                    the defense of another member of the Lincoln household, Robert Todd Lincoln, who
                    was also greatly misrepresented by Herndon. While the casual reader will be
                    entertained by the escapades of Willie and Tad, serious students of the
                    Emancipator will be especially interested in the first objective biographical
                    study of Robert, the only one of the four Lincoln boys to reach maturity.
            The introductory paragraphs to the book, however, make it clear that the author
                    is to confine herself to Robert's personality and to purposely avoid
                    his public and business career. His relation to his parents, especially his
                    mother, is of great interest. His attempt to protect her from Herndon's
                    vicious attacks is praiseworthy. Those who have charged Robert with mercenary
                    incentives in relation to his mother's confinement in a sanatorium for
                    a season will do well to observe new evidence on the question introduced by the
                    author. Some students will have difficulty in following  Mrs. Randall's argument that a barrier was
                    built up between father and son. However, the author's explanation of
                    Robert's attitude towards the memory of his father in later years seems
                    to be well presented.
            The fact that Robert Lincoln on his first attempt failed to pass the 
                        Harvard
                     entrance examinations placed somewhat of a stigma on his early
                    efforts in the field of learning. Undoubtedly it was the inadequate system of
                    education in the schools of 
                        Springfield
                    , 
                        Illinois
                    , rather than the deficiency of the student, that was responsible
                    for the necessity of a preparatory course at Exeter Academy. Mrs. Randall
                    exhibits an excerpt from a letter that Amos Tuck of Exeter, 
                        New Hampshire
                    , sent on August 24, 1860, to the President's 
                        Illinois
                     friend, Judge David Davis, that should remove any suspicion of
                    Robert's mental ability as a youth. Tuck wrote, Robert "
                    'stands at the top of the ladder as a scholar, and is a singularly
                    discreet, well behaved, brilliant and promising young man' "
                    (p. 70).
            Why Robert Lincoln failed to enter the army while at 
                        Harvard
                     University has always been a pointed question. His desire to enlist
                    when the war first broke is accepted generally. One would infer that parental
                    objection was responsible for the lateness of his entry into the service. Mrs.
                    Randall seems to be in agreement with those who feel Mrs. Lincoln's
                    neurotic condition and fear for a complete mental collapse in case of
                    Robert's enlistment were the primary factors which retarded him.
                    However, a letter which Robert wrote to Winfield M. Thompson throws new light on
                    the situation. Referring to his father, Robert observed:
            "After my graduation from 
                        Harvard
                    , I said to him that as he did not wish me to go into the army (his
                    reason having been that something might happen to me that would cause him more
                    official embarrassment than could be offset by any possible value of my military
                    service) I was going back to 
                        Cambridge
                     and enlist in Law School. … His letter afterward to
                    General Grant was the result of my renewed appeal to him." (Robert T.
                    Lincoln to Winfield M. Thompson, March 2, 1915, copy in Lincoln National Life
                    Foundation files.)
            While the reviewer was living at Hodgenville, 
                        Kentucky
                    , the birthplace of Lincoln, he often heard the story repeated that
                    claimed Robert Lincoln was intoxicated upon the occasion of his visit there on
                    May 31 in 1909. The occasion of his presence was the dedication of a bronze
                    statue of his father located on the courthouse square. Mrs. Randall makes it  quite clear that Robert had been in very
                    poor health at the time, and his collapse during the dedicatory service was due
                    to "the combination of emotion and heat exhaustion. … it was
                    thought he narrowly escaped a paralytic stroke" (p. 335).
            One would expect to find some reference by the author to the widely publicized
                    Lincoln manuscripts that Robert is said to have destroyed at his home in 
                        Manchester
                    , 
                        Vermont
                    . It is likely that many of Robert's own personal papers
                    and probably some of the personal letters which his father wrote to his mother
                    may have been burned. Mrs. Randall is in agreement with others who can speak
                    with some authority that the famous presidential papers are now intact at the
                    Library of Congress and were carefully preserved by Robert.
            The new picture of Robert drawn by Mrs. Randall makes one feel that he
                    "has behaved himself as the son of Abraham Lincoln might be expected to
                    do," as one of the President's friends expressed himself (Amos
                    Tuck to David Davis, copy in Lincoln National Life Foundation files). Any
                    student of Abraham Lincoln who contemplates a monograph of the President
                    touching upon his home life will find Lincoln's Sons
                    a worthy supplement to Mrs. Randall's former work on Mary
                        Lincoln. Biography of a Marriage.

               A History of the Freedmen's Bureau. By George R.
                    Bentley. (

            The basic problem that permeated the Reconstruction Era—how to absorb
                    the Negro into the American body politic—is today more pertinent than
                    at any time since 1877 when a North, weary of radicalism and sympathetic to the
                    plight of the white southerner, agreed to drop the whole unpleasant mess in
                    exchange for acquiescence in the election of Hayes. Since then, the Negro has
                    made monumental gains in all parts of the nation, many of them through his own
                    efforts, and many through federal government intervention on his behalf. But the
                    Supreme Court rulings on school segregation rekindled deep prejudices and
                    created situations that are alarming thinking people everywhere.
            George R. Bentley's calm, straightforward account of the
                    Freedman's Bureau is especially welcome, therefore, as it illuminates
                    the working of an organization that was of central importance in the initial
                    period of adjustment after  emancipation.
                    This is by no means a simple task, for the bureau became immeshed in much of the
                    sordid politics of the day and served as a tool of the radical carpetbag
                    interests who hoped thereby to insure Republican political supremacy, and even
                    to revolutionize the social and economic bases of society in the South. It was
                    idealistic, humanitarian, eminently practical, and also partisan, irresponsible,
                    and corrupt at the same time.
            The author begins with the issue of "contraband" as it arose in
                    the early part of the war and traces the increasing need for centralized
                    government control as abolitionist sentiment and military necessity combined to
                    destroy the South's peculiar institution. Organized under General
                    Oliver O. Howard in 1865, the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands
                    had an almost impossible task from the start: limited funds, local officials too
                    few in number and often inexperienced and unsympathetic, a hostile white
                    population, a hostile President, to say nothing of serious doubts as to the
                    constitutionality of the entire undertaking. Yet it was supposed to protect
                    Negro rights, cultivate friendly relations between the races, encourage good
                    work habits, assist in organizing schools, give rations and medicines, operate a
                    bank, and supervise settlement of its wards on confiscated lands.
            
               A History of the Freedmen's Bureau is a valuable
                    addition to the literature of the Civil War period and the only thorough study
                    of this aspect since Paul S. Peirce in 1904. It is regrettable that Bentley did
                    not provide a clear picture of General Howard himself, who remains a shadowy
                    figure throughout. The same could be said for other members of the bureau, no
                    one of whom is given anything beyond the briefest possible appraisal. Otherwise,
                    the documentation is excellent, and the delineation of the narrative flows
                    smoothly despite the intricate nature of the various issues involved. Even those
                    most familiar with the main problem will find new insights; and for the general
                    reader, this will prove a book both timely and rewarding.

               William Lloyd Garrison and the Humanitarian Reformers. By

            The editor of The Library of American Biography has made a wise
                    choice in singling out William Lloyd Garrison as the leader whose life and
                    activities were to represent the reform movement of the mid-nineteenth century.
                    This relationship has been portrayed by Professor Nye in a vivid narrative of
                    Garrison's active life and in a careful analysis of his position in
                    American history. With this work the excellent standard of this series of
                    biographical studies is maintained, and the author's reputation as a
                    Pulitzer-prize winning biographer is enhanced.
            The heritage of the rationalism of Thomas Jefferson and the active influence of a
                    religious revival and frontier democracy had merged to give the generation
                    before the Civil War confidence in the perfectability of mankind and in
                    man's capacity to remake society in terms of his own blueprints. Of the
                    many reform efforts of the era, Garrison's name is normally associated
                    with the dominant cause, abolitionism, but the fiery editor also took up his pen
                    in behalf of women's rights, pacifism, temperance, Utopian communism,
                    and anti-Sabbatarianism. Thus the complexity of this period of ferment, with its
                    sound as well as fanatic facets, is clearly represented in the life of this
                    zealous reformer, who, interestingly, could preach temperance but yet in his
                    obsession over his health, could imbibe generously of nostrums high in alcoholic
                    content, and who, despite his militant approach to the slavery issue, could
                    support non-resistance.
            Among Garrison's contemporaries, opinions as to his role in the
                    abolition movement varied between the conclusion of admirers such as Wendell
                    Phillips that Garrison created and largely controlled the movement and the
                    evaluation of a critic such as Henry Ward Beecher, who stated that the New 
                        England
                     reformer was "no more than a blister on the anti-slavery
                    movement." Professor Nye cuts through this conflict of opinion and
                    carefully supports the conclusion that Garrison neither began the movement nor
                    contributed to its organization and extension as decisively as such men as
                    Theodore Dwight Weld and Arthur and Lewis Tappan. Even though abolitionism
                    "passed through him, not from him," the author notes that the
                    editor of the Liberator drove the slavery evil deep into the
                    country's conscience. In the South he became the symbol of all that was
                    dangerous to its society, and in the North he broke the "conspiracy of
                    silence" and  revealed slavery as
                    the moral problem that it was. Because of his relentless condemnation of the
                    evil, the vehemence of the language he employed, and his criticism of the
                    Constitution for the protection it afforded slavery, he was hated and abused.
                    But public reaction was to turn into respect when the cause he symbolized was
                    eventually vindicated.
            In the epilogue of the volume, Professor Nye reveals the mind of the reformer as
                    one that was consistent in its judgment of all things on standards of moral
                    right. The standards he employed were those of natural law as expressed in the
                    Declaration of Independence and of Christian ethics as revealed in the Bible.
                    Following a conscience to which God spoke directly, he opposed all man-made
                    authority, in church as well as in state, and devoted his life to the freedom of
                    the individual. With the integrity of his soul maintained before God, he could
                    enjoy the jeers of the crowd. This self-righteous independence, a characteristic
                    of the seventeenth century 
                        Puritan
                    , alienated many but also inspired confidence in others.
            The author has not neglected calling attention to Garrison's failings,
                    but, generally, his portrayal is a sympathetic one. In a vivid manner he has
                    also related the bitter factional controversies that took place within the
                    abolition crusade. And for the student of the period he has contributed a
                    clearer understanding of the major role played by the moral controversy
                    surrounding slavery in the coming of the Civil War.

               The Life of Matthew Simpson. By Robert D. Clark. (

            It is perhaps a coincidence that a life of Matthew Simpson should appear at a
                    time when great sectional issues are again stirring. For Bishop Simpson became
                    an ardent crusader for emancipation; he was a friend of President Lincoln during
                    the clash between North and South; and he was a staunch Republican even to the
                    extent of becoming one of the closest adherents of the Radicals in their war
                    against President Johnson. Robert D. Clark, who is chairman of the Speech
                    Department and acting Dean of the College of Liberal Arts in the University of 
                        Oregon
                    , has undertaken to play the role of biographer of one of the
                    preeminent leaders of the Methodist church. His book follows  Simpson's early life, education, and
                    ministry, his presidency of Indiana Asbury University (now DePauw University)
                    when he warred with Presbyterians over educational issues, his brief career as
                    an editor, and the manifold services he performed as a bishop of the Methodist
                    Episcopal church.
            Clark has prepared himself for this task by visiting and absorbing atmosphere in
                    the various localities in which Simpson lived as educator and clergyman. In the
                    main he has drawn on contemporary sources, of which the most extensively used
                    are the Simpson Papers in the Library of Congress. References are also made to
                    George R. Crooks' The Life of Bishop Matthew Simpson
                    (1890), published six years after the bishop's death and containing
                    Simpson's Diary and his Autobiography. More use might have been made of
                    William W. Sweet's The Methodist Episcopal Church and the
                        Civil War (1912) and Indiana Asbury-DePauw University,
                        1837–1987 (1937). A very wide use of newspapers and
                    periodicals is to the author's credit.
            Not only has Clark succeeded in portraying the personality and character of
                    Bishop Simpson, but he has brought out with proper sympathy and a sense of
                    objectivity his accomplishments. For Simpson was a man of great stature. Clark
                    has done an excellent thing in showing the breadth of his interests and
                    activities—his attempt to co-ordinate science and religion in the
                    belief that evolution meant progress; and his sincere belief in education, a
                    role in which he did much to raise the intellectual level of the Methodist
                    church in its rivalry with the Presbyterians. Clearly delineated are his efforts
                    to have more bishops to carry the increasing burden of the expanding church, to
                    secure lay representation in its conferences, to improve its ecclesiastical
                    architecture, and to broaden its social tolerance. Incidentally, he was a warm
                    advocate of woman suffrage.
            On the other hand, Clark frankly describes the man who put pressure on Lincoln
                    for more jobs for Methodists, worked closely with Stanton, and aggressively set
                    out to get property of the southern Methodists into the hands of the northern
                    church. Embittered by President Johnson's attitude toward this church
                    property question, he joined ranks with the Radical Republicans and used his
                    persuasive powers as an orator to get through the General Conference of the
                    Methodist Episcopal church a resolution endorsing the attempted conviction of
                    that much abused president. His intolerant attitude toward Johnson is in
                    contrast to his stirring funeral oration over Lincoln's grave.
            
            In estimating this biography there are some adverse comments. The style is broken
                    by too frequent quotations, sometimes of one or two words, which make reading a
                    bit difficult. And, scholarly as Clark has been in the use of sources, one or
                    two glaring errors indicate a lack of historical knowledge which the friendly
                    critics of his manuscript failed to correct. In the index on p. 338 there is an
                    item on the "impeachment attempt" on President Johnson; as a
                    matter of fact the president was impeached, though not convicted. On p. 259 is
                    the statement that the Radical Republicans not only carried the congressional
                    election of 1866 but "seized control of the Electoral
                    College," a misleading statement in view of the fact that the Electoral
                    College exists only in presidential election years. The author seems able only
                    in his treatment of war and reconstruction problems to see much beyond his
                    immediate subject. Indiana Asbury University, in fact higher education
                    generally, is picked up suddenly and dropped with equal abruptness. Visits to 
                        England
                    , the homeland of the Methodist movement, are treated almost solely
                    from an antiquarian point of view; perhaps this is how the bishop himself
                    regarded his tours. In some instances the titles of chapters express a strained
                    effort at literary novelty.
            In conclusion it is accurate to state that the work is fundamentally biography,
                    not history. Yet it makes some contribution of an objective nature to our
                    knowledge of one of the most powerful ecclesiastical organizations in the 
                        United States
                    ; this perhaps makes up for some of its deficiencies in composition,
                    accuracy, and historical synthesis.

               Brooks Adams: A Biography. By Arthur F. Beringause. (
                        New York
                    : Alfred A. Knopf, 1955, pp. xiii, 404, x. Frontispiece,
                    bibliography, and index. $6.00.)
            In his life of Brooks Adams (1848–1927), Beringause has undertaken the
                    study of an unusual man, son of Charles Francis Adams, and brother of Henry
                    Adams, the historian. The career of Brooks Adams was confined to that of the
                    publicist and prophet of doom, although he longed for a powerful, active role in
                    public life which he never achieved. Even so, his influence touched some
                    important people: perhaps Henry Adams felt it most; Theodore Roosevelt finally
                    accepted Brooks Adams as an unofficial advisor; Henry Cabot Lodge found many of
                    his own views confirmed by  Brooks Adams,
                    his brother-in-law; and on the subject of legal education Dean Melville M.
                    Bigelow echoed the opinions of his colleague in the Law School at 
                        Boston
                     University.
            Brooks Adams set for himself a lofty objective: to discover the laws governing
                    human society. Strictly speaking he was not a historian. His method was to
                    arrive at some generalization or "scientific law" by a mystic
                    process. Then he sought to prove his intuitions by the evidence of the past.
                    Also he seriously posed as prophet of the future. Beringause is occasionally
                    impressed by the accuracy of the forecasts (p. 111 and p. 358).
            Adams demands a biographer who can trace his subject's thought through
                    book after book, article after article. Beringause shoulders this task, but
                    Adams frequently repeated himself, creating an almost insurmountable problem for
                    his biographer. He confronts it manfully by repeating where Adams repeated. The
                    result is an honest portrayal which gives the reader the impression of seeing
                    the same image in a dozen mirrors; and at places the repetition in full
                    quotations seems unnecessary. For example, on pp. 244–245 and p. 274
                    the same letter is quoted at length, albeit for different reasons. And the
                    quotations on p. 255 and p. 347 are confusing; the date for one of these is
                    wrong or else Adams repeated verbatim his letter of 1903.
            Beringause gives the reader a brief pen portrait of Brooks Adams about 1905. He
                    "was an imposing figure. … Although comparatively short of
                    stature, he had broad shoulders. His nose was Roman, and the stiffness with
                    which he held his patrician head gave him the tight stare and stark majesty of
                    the bald eagle" (p. 259).
            Beringause suggests that Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., may have started Adams on
                    his search for a philosophic system. Holmes lectured on the common law at the 
                        Lowell
                     Institute (1880) and traced its growth in line with a series of
                    master ideas and evolutionary principles. Adams later tried to do the same for
                    all human society.
            Beginning with an analysis of The Emancipation of 
                            Massachusetts
                        
                (1887), the author moves on to The Law of
                        Civilization and Decay (1895), a basic work from which Adams dredged
                    material for years. One by one Beringause discusses the ideas of Adams on
                    bimetallism, the cyclical theory of civilizations, international Jewish bankers,
                    the Yellow Peril, the master race, military preparedness, imperialism, the need
                    for an isthmian canal, the need for strong national administration, and
                    dictatorship, unhampered by  the courts.
                    Adams, the conservative, went so far as to advocate state socialism to prevent
                    the collapse of civilization.
            Beringause gives the reader a clear view of Adams' method of
                    investigation. In 1894 he wrote to Henry that he was studying the thirteenth
                    century, but complained that in Venice "you can get nothing
                    … except archives. … By a process peculiar to myself, I
                    have by dint of watching here, arrived at my conclusions and I am about ready to
                    go" (p. 112). He informed Theodore Roosevelt in 1896 that The Law of Civilization and Decay was a piece of automatic writing,
                    "the work of some second self—a self who must be very
                    active, but who does not come to the surface" (pp. 131–132).
            Brooks and Henry Adams delighted in pseudo-scientific terminology. When writing
                    about society the brothers used such words as: "velocity,"
                    "energy," "mass,"
                    "momentum," "center of force," and
                    "equilibrium." But this practice could result in
                    Brooks' writing, in The New Empire (1902), that
                    " 'the core of Russia, revolving on Novgorod as on a pivot,
                    passed the segment of a circle' " (p. 240). Beringause wisely
                    does not try to explain that one.
            Adams always depended on correspondence or conversation with a few close friends
                    to bring into order his intuitions, opinions, and facts. Henry was his best
                    critic and coach, but Brooks repaid his debt by showering Henry with stimulating
                    letters and suggestive interpretations of history and current events. The
                    interaction between these two men forms a constant theme. Correspondence went
                    more smoothly than conversation in which the two brothers often
                    "excited, then irritated, and finally enraged each other" (p.
                    111).
            Beringause avoids the biographer's peril of hero-worship. In fact, one
                    could wish that his clear analyses of Adams' writings were matched by a
                    little more understanding of Adams as a man. Perhaps Beringause prefers to let
                    the reader draw his own conclusions, but obviously Brooks Adams was a tragic
                    figure; a man of great gifts of mind, possessing energy, wealth, leisure, social
                    position, a small but interesting circle of friends, and the desire to be
                    "useful." Nevertheless he failed to join these potentialities
                    to any responsible position save for a few happy years after 1903 when he
                    lectured at the Law School of 
                        Boston
                     University. Throughout his life he was vain, pompous, and
                    hypersensitive, but as he grew older he became more darkly pessimistic, more
                    savage and violent in expression, more 
                    eccentric, and "unusable" in diplomacy or politics.
                    "Kill Wilson!" he yelled to Lodge. Herbert Hoover he attacked
                    as a "chief Bolshevik."
            Perhaps Beringause takes too literally the thunderings of Adams, but what else
                    could Beringause do? Adams was apparently a lonely, desperate man, homesick for
                    the world of his father, Charles Francis, and grandfather, John Quincy Adams.
                    Perhaps much that Adams said and wrote was uttered irresponsibly—when
                    he was seriously challenged, for example, while advocating state socialism in
                    the 
                        Massachusetts
                     Constitutional Convention (1917) he backed down and spoke for
                    retaining capitalism. And many of his savage writings are not the words of a
                    truly revolutionary character prepared to act on them. They seem, rather, a
                    strange lament for a lost imagined world—Arnold's "
                        Dover
                     Beach" reworked into fantastic "laws of
                    society." The man sensing Adams' predicament most clearly was
                    probably the Benedictine monk who wrote that Adams was "
                    'groping blindly and longing pathetically for a patria' " (p. 386).
            The chapter titles and sub-heads of this book may have a literary charm for some
                    readers. They are a comment on Adams' life in themselves. But as guides
                    to the materials of the book, the chapter titles are only confusing. The text is
                    smoothly written with few mistakes. But surely Brooks Adams did not write:
                        "panim et circensis" (p. 189) or
                    attribute to Christ the words of the importunate father in Mark 9:24 (p. 360).
                    And surely Henry Adams had taught Brooks enough medieval history to keep him
                    from thinking that the medieval state "forced conformity on all ranks
                    of society" (p. 374). But these are obvious mechanical flaws. The book
                    has the merit of resting solidly on the previously inaccessible Adams Papers so
                    that it now stands as the best available treatment of Brooks Adams.

            In 1918, an article concerning the Nonpartisan League entitled "A 
                        Prairie
                     Fire" appeared in the Country Gentleman.
                    It seems reasonable to surmise that this phrase suggested the title for the book
                    under review. The bright orange and black binding seems designed to re-enforce
                    the holocaustic  impression created by the
                    title. The chapter headings, almost sensational in some instances, contribute to
                    the central motif. The author's lively style which carries the
                    fast-moving action through sixteen fact-laden chapters adds the final
                    pyrotechnic touch. After seeming to equate an objective account of a
                    controversial issue with one that would give universal satisfaction, Professor
                    Morlan states his purpose in the following sentence: "This study is
                    … an effort to chronicle with fairness and accuracy the dramatic and
                    swift-moving story of this unique political movement" (p. viii).
            According to a sentence in the preface, "representative
                    newspapers" were the principal source of data. Although no newspapers
                    are listed in the bibliography, the abundant citations to newspapers in the
                    footnotes, especially to the Non-partisan Leader, confirm this
                    statement. Of the rather small number of collections of papers and manuscripts
                    that were used the collection of National Nonpartisan League Papers is the most
                    important. A large group of pamphlets issued by the Nonpartisan League
                    constitutes the other major portion of the bibliography. It is difficult to
                    escape the conclusion that the author has relied to a disproportionate degree
                    upon official league publications and materials which must come logically under
                    his own judgment that, "Virtually all writing pertaining to the League
                    published during its ascendancy reflects extremely biased points of
                    view" (p. viii). The reviewer finds it difficult to understand how a
                    fair and accurate "chronicle" can be the product of excessive
                    reliance upon data derived from writers on one side of a controversial issue.
                    This is all the more difficult when much of the anti-league material was used by
                    way of quotations from the opposition press that appeared in the columns of the
                        Non-partisan Leader. There are at least two illustrations
                    of the basic principle that the student of history should go to the sources
                    rather than rely upon secondary accounts. The reviewer cannot reconcile the data
                    derived from the Leader's summary of an address made
                    by John S. Williams, 
                        United States
                     Comptroller of the Currency, before the 
                        Kentucky
                     Banker's Association in 1915, with the statistical
                    material contained in the annual report of the comptroller of the currency which
                    was used as the basis of the address. At the least, the comptroller's
                    figures do not clearly support the conclusion that "no less than two
                    thirds (96) of the national banks in 
                        North Dakota
                     were charging usurious rates" (p. 17). A careful reading
                    of the speech of Congressman Patrick  D.
                    Norton as it appears in the Congressional Record does not lead
                    to the same conclusions that the author reached on the basis of the report
                    contained in the Leader. The speech was prompted by an
                    editorial contained in the Des Moines Capital, not by items
                    contained in the 
                  
                            Indianapolis
                         Star, 
                            New York
                         Mail, and Buffalo Express, and there is
                    no explicit reference to the League, much less a vigorous defense of it.
            The general attitude of the author of Political 
                            Prairie
                         Fire toward the Nonpartisan League may be described as
                    sympathetic. This is apparent not only in the selection of materials, but also
                    in the explanations that are given for the failure of some of the business
                    projects of the league, such as the Consumers' United Stores Company
                    and the Home Building Association, and the different treatment accorded to
                    similar acts depending upon whether they were performed by the friends or the
                    foes of the league. Thus the opposition "screamed" its
                    sentiments, whereas the Leader "expressed its
                    hopes," "carefully and repeatedly warned," or
                    "set the matter straight" as the occasion required. There are
                    several examples of the author's resort to heavy irony in describing
                    the arguments of the opposition. The "tirade" of an
                    over-zealous local official is referred to as "the reasoned view of a
                    dispassionate and unprejudiced law enforcement official" (p. 168) and
                    the Wall Street Journal, 
                            Manchester
                         Guardian, and National Geographic are
                    included in a list of "flaming radical publications."
            The book presents in considerable detail the political history of the Nonpartisan
                    League with the emphasis quite naturally upon the states of 
                        North Dakota
                     and 
                        Minnesota
                     . It is entirely reasonable that Arthur C. Townley should be the
                    central figure, but some will question the degree to which attention is focused
                    upon him to the almost complete exclusion of other prominent leaders of the
                    movement. The principal result of this emphasis is to leave the reader with
                    quite a clear impression of Townley, but only a slight acquaintanceship with the
                    other men. The description of the techniques' employed by Townley
                    should be of special value to those who have a particular interest in group
                    dynamics, especially the, organizations and direction of grass-roots political
                    movements of the protesting variety. The rather detailed description of the 
                        Minnesota
                     phases of the "red-baiting" and
                    "witch-hunting" activities that characterized the closing
                    years of the second Wilson administration has value quite apart from its
                    relation to the central theme of the book. The same may be said for the
                    delineation of the origins of political co-operation  between farming and laboring groups. The inadequate
                    attention given by American historians to the role of the urban community is
                    illustrated in this volume by the superficial analysis of the dominance by the
                    business interests of the Twin Cities of the economic life of 
                        North Dakota
                    . At the least Mildred Hartsough's The
                        Development of the Turin Cities (
                            Minneapolis
                         and 
                            St. Paul
                        ) as a Metropolitan Market (1925) is worthy of mention in
                    the bibliography.
            Beginning with brief discussions of several factors which produced in 
                        North Dakota
                     fertile soil for an agrarian protest movement, the author describes
                    the political successes of the league in 
                        North Dakota
                    , the implementation of its program, the attempt to become a
                    national party, the development of factions within the league, and, finally, the
                    factors which led to its decline. Abuses in the grain-marketing process, high
                    freight rates, and usurious interest rates are listed among the developments
                    which led to the formation of the league. The involvement of the 
                        United States
                     in World War I, the inability to shake off the Socialist label, the
                    eclipse of Townley as the leader, the enactment of a portion of its program, and
                    the growing tendency to look to the federal government for help instead of to
                    the state capital are proposed as some of the causes which led to the decline of
                    the movement. The greatest value of the book lies in its detailed treatment of a
                    significant political movement. Both value and attractiveness are enhanced by
                    several illustrations which are the product of the distaff side of the
                    author's household.

            Melville Otter Briney is an experienced writer. She was born in 
                        Louisville
                     and educated at Vassar and 
                        Columbia
                     University School of Journalism. As Melville Otter she joined the
                    staff of the Courier-Journal in 1925. The following year she
                    married Russell Briney and for the next two decades confined her activities to
                    family, social, and civic affairs. In 1948 she re-entered the field of
                    journalism, contributing a weekly article on "Old 
                        Louisville
                    " to the editorial page of the 
                  
                            Louisville
                         Times. These informal sketches proved of such interest to
                    the public and contained matter of such value to succeeding generations that
                    Barry Bingham, owner of the 
                    Courier-Journal and the 
                  
                            Louisville
                         Times, decided to incorporate forty-eight of them in a
                    book. Selection must have been difficult from a seven years' supply of
                    worthwhile articles.
            
               Fond Recollection is not a historical treatise but a series of
                    portraits of 
                        Louisville
                     life in the eighteen-eighties and early nineties. There are
                    occasional throwbacks to earlier years, and glimpses ahead of World War I. Its
                    greatest appeal is to old residents and their children, many of them now living
                    afar. However, students everywhere will find it of value because statements are
                    founded on fact, many of the persons and events described are of national
                    importance, and the period surveyed is one of extraordinary local and national
                    expansion, both economic and cultural.
            The book is divided into four parts: "Places,"
                    "People," "Events," and "I
                    Remember." Of the first three parts, Mrs. Briney writes in the
                    Foreword, "More than to any other person, I am indebted to my father,
                    John D. Otter, who before his death in 1950 told me many entrancing stories of
                    the people, places and events depicted in this book. If I have been able to
                    recapture to any degree the flavor and charm of the city of his youth, it is
                    because of him." She has succeeded in this endeavor as she presents
                    with vividness, accuracy, and humor, vanishing or changed buildings, streets and
                    neighborhoods; prominent characters, including world-famous authors, actors, and
                    eccentrics; and significant and unusual happenings of a former generation.
            In the fourth part Mrs. Briney portrays her own childhood and youth, and again
                    "recaptures the flavor and charm of the city." Her account of
                    home life in St. James Court, a beautiful residential section, is delightful.
                    Young and old will appreciate the descriptions of clubs and parties, of dancing
                    school with closing exhibition at the famous old Macauley's Theatre and
                    of a notable Christmas when Santa brought the little girl an ermine muff. The
                    final chapter is a poignant account of activities connected with World War I and
                    the departure of one's boy friends for "over there."

            Fort Owen was established in 1850 as a trading post by "Major"
                    John Owen, a frontier sutler. It was located in the Bitter Root Valley in what
                    is now western 
                        Montana
                    . The post was well situated on land bought from Jesuit
                    missionaries, among peaceful Flathead Indians, and in an area undergoing a shift
                    from fur-trading to agricultural operations. The post was commodious, fortified,
                    and well stocked with trading goods. Owen's annual business
                    transactions varied considerably and ranged in amount from less than
                    $1,000 to nearly $10,000. One surprising and decidedly
                    esoteric feature of Fort Owen was its library. Owen not only liked to read books
                    but he was discriminating in his library selections, which included Charles
                    Darwin's Journal of Researches into the Natural History,
                        The Writings of Thomas Jefferson, John Milton's Poetical Works, and John Locke's Essay
                        Concerning Human Understanding. Lieutenant John Mullan, who examined
                    this library, declared it was " 'the finest library I have
                    seen on the north Pacific coast'" (p. 247). Due to
                    Owen's mental failure, the post was sold in 1872, and changing
                    conditions thereafter caused Fort Owen to join the list of frontier
                    institutional relics.
            As indicated in the title, the core of this volume is the Fort Owen Ledger.
                    Entries into this ledger were made by Owen from the time of the beginning of the
                    post in 1850 and for a decade thereafter. In presenting the material of this
                    book, the editor has, in addition to his introduction and notes, reproduced
                    major portions of the ledger and provided brief biographical sketches of those
                    carried on account. The book as presented has the obvious value of providing the
                    specialist with information on persons or customers in the area, variety of
                    livestock, merchandise bought and sold, and at what prices. And out of this
                    ledger one may likewise glean interesting tidbits of social history, such as
                    amounts paid "woman" for making shoes, amounts paid to find
                    lost or stolen livestock, kinds of cloth available for sale, amounts carried on
                    credit (whites, as compared with Indians), who bought liquor and who did not.
            Much effort has been expended by the editor to make this volume useful in the
                    ways indicated. There are minor 
                    inconsistencies in the spelling of place names, especially between those
                    appearing in the introduction and in the main fold-in map, as for example
                    Bannack and Bannock, Bitter Root and Bitterroot.

            Many of the studies of the Iroquois nation stress the role of these Indians in
                    the Anglo-French struggle for supremacy in America. The questions of the
                    allegiance of the Iroquois to the English or of their relations with the French
                    have received much attention. As a result the relationship of the Iroquois to
                    the various English colonies has often been slighted. It is the contention of
                    the editor of The Livingston Indian Records that these
                    documents will help to restore "some balance to Iroquois
                    history" and that they will throw additional light upon their relations
                    with the English colonies. In the opinion of the reviewer the documents by
                    themselves are often disappointing in this respect.
            Robert Livingston who served as secretary of Rensselaerswyck, town clerk of 
                        Albany
                    , and secretary for Indian affairs had the task of transcribing the
                    conference minutes and documents concerning the Indian relations into the
                    permanent record book. The Livingston Indian Records consist
                    of the drafts and copies of these conference minutes and documents which
                    Livingston retained for his personal file. He also retained material inherited
                    from his predecessor as secretary of Rensselaerswyck. Since the first two
                    volumes of the permanent record books have disappeared, the Livingston documents
                    now on deposit in the 
                        Franklin
                     D. Roosevelt Library assume an additional importance.
            One series of documents deals with the concern of 
                        Virginia
                     and 
                        Maryland
                     over the Iroquois raids against friendly Indians and whites on the 
                        Maryland
                    -
                        Virginia
                     frontier. Others indicate the interest of New Englanders toward the
                    tie of the Iroquois with the New 
                        England
                     tribes which were friendly to the French. The bulk of the documents
                    contain information about 
                        New York
                    -Iroquois problems over land, trade, and the French question. So the
                    question of the French-English struggle and of the position of the Iroquois
                    appears again and again. Scattered throughout the records  one may find additional information concerning
                    trade, land control, and intertribal relations and movements on the 
                        New York
                    -
                        Pennsylvania
                     frontier.
            Two introductory articles precede the records. Leder has written a brief sketch
                    of the career of Robert Livingston and an explanation of the disposition of the
                    Livingston records. Paul A. W. Wallace in a second article gives a brief outline
                    of the history of the Iroquois. Both articles, while brief, are adequate for
                    introductory purposes.
            The documents themselves are arranged in chronological order with italicized
                    introductions giving the name of the speaker and date. This arrangement is
                    sometimes confusing to the general reader who may be following a particular
                    topic. There is no index, and while there are occasional explanatory footnotes,
                    additional explanatory material in the footnotes would be beneficial.
                    Pictographs explaining the legend of the founding of the Five Nations are
                    scattered throughout the text. These are of dubious value and add little to the
                    book. A glossary of Indian tribal names used within the documents is also
                    provided.

               The Horse in Blackfoot Indian Culture, With Comparative Material
                        From Other Western Tribes. By John C. Ewers. Smithsonian Institution,
                    Bureau of American Ethnology, Bulletin 159. (

                    figures, appendix, bibliography, and index. $2.75.)
            Historians and ethnologists have long been intrigued with the significant
                    influence of the European-introduced horse on the culture of the North American
                    Plains Indians. Attention has heretofore been focused, however, on the diffusion
                    of the horse among the Plains tribes. No detailed analysis of the horse complex
                    as it existed in the nineteenth-century culture of a specific Plains Indian
                    group has been attempted prior to Ewers' present excellent monograph.
            
               The Horse in Blackfoot Indian Culture divides naturally into
                    three parts: (1) An introductory ethnohistorical discussion, carefully
                    documented, of the dates and manner of the acquisition of the horse by Plains
                    and Plateau peoples from, ultimately, two southern sources of diffusion (Santa
                    Fe and San Antonio); (2) a large body of descriptive field data on Blackfoot
                    wealth in horses; care, breeding, and training of horses; gear; the use of the
                    horse in camp movements,  hunting, and war;
                    the part played by the horse in trade and recreation and as a factor in
                    Blackfoot social relations and religion; (3) two general chapters on the
                    influence of the horse on a specific Plains Indian culture, and on the Plains
                    Indian horse complex as a whole. A short appendix describes the use of mules
                    among the Blackfoot.
            Comparative material on the horse complex in Plains and Plateau cultures other
                    than Blackfoot is presented in footnotes and brief comparative sections within
                    the main part of the study. Much of Ewers' comparative material is
                    drawn from documentary sources rather than from ethnographic
                    reports—which in itself indicates what Ewers explicitly points out,
                    that "For the entire Plains area there has been an appalling lack of
                    detailed analysis of the horse complex" (p. xi).
            The generally interested reader will find parts (1) and (3) of Ewers'
                    study especially rewarding, and it is difficult to envisage any American-trained
                    ethnologist or student of American history ignoring these sections. Once having
                    read them, it is safe to predict that many scholars, even though hard pressed
                    for reading time, will sample a goodly number, at least, of the descriptive
                    sections of (2). The chapter on wealth in horses among the Blackfoot and other
                    tribes (pp. 20–32), read in conjunction with a short section on the
                    horse as a factor of social status (pp. 240–244) serves to underscore
                    what many ethnologists have found among various present-day Plains
                    groups—namely, that possession of horses on a noneconomic level is
                    still a prestige factor among Plains Indian groups.
            In making his study of the horse complex Ewers utilized three avenues of
                    approach—ethnographical field work among the Blackfoot over an
                    extended period of time, extensive ethnohistorical research in published
                    documentary materials, and examination of museum materials. The successful
                    combination of these three methods makes his monograph a definitive work. Its
                    originality is attested by the fact that, now the study is published, one
                    wonders why such an obviously significant subject was suffered to remain so long
                    neglected by American ethnologists, particularly by those concerned with the
                    cultures of the Plains Indians and historical questions relating to these
                    cultures.
            A study of the European-introduced horse among the North American Indians in
                    general remains to be written. Although the horse may have had most spectacular
                    influence on native cultures in the Northern Plains region, it is safe to  assume that in the Southeast, in the
                    Eastern Woodlands, and in the Great Basin—to name only a few other
                    areas—the introduction of the horse also affected native cultures to
                    a greater or lesser degree. For the wider study of the horse in native North
                    America, Ewers' work could well serve as a model of method and
                    presentation.

               American Indians Dispossessed: Fraud in Land Cessions Forced upon
                        the Tribes. By Walter H. Blumenthal. ( 
                        Philadelphia
                     : George S. MacManus Company, 1955, pp. 200. Appendix and
                    bibliography. $3.75.)
            "It makes little difference … where one opens the record of
                    the history of the Indians; every page and every year has its dark stain. The
                    story of one tribe is the story of all, varied only by differences of time and
                    place; but neither time nor place makes any difference in the main
                    facts."
            Although this quotation is not from Blumenthal's American
                        Indians Dispossessed, it might well be. And it could appropriately be
                    written as a dust jacket blurb for the volume. The present work is in many
                    respects an appendage to the source of the quotation, Helen Hunt
                    Jackson's A Century of Dishonor, written some three
                    quarters of a century ago. Mrs. Jackson's purpose was to provoke
                    solicitude for the Indian; and her book was largely responsible for organization
                    of the Indian Rights Association and indirectly responsible for the Dawes Act.
            It seems as though Blumenthal has a purpose in mind. On each successive page he
                    builds his case and piles up evidence to support it. Had the book been published
                    a decade earlier one might readily have surmised the author was lobbying for
                    federal legislation to compensate the Indians for all they had suffered and lost
                    over the years, possibly to establish an agency such as the Indian Claims
                    Commission, which was created in 1946. After some one hundred and sixty pages,
                    however, this commission is mentioned briefly and summarily dismissed:
                    "the result [of the Commission] has been a clutter and legal tangle,
                    baffling to the layman, and dilatory if not obstructive so far as justice to
                    tribal claims is concerned" (p. 164).
            
               American Indians Dispossessed is apparently not intended to be
                    other than a damning indictment of a not-too-pleasant aspect of the frontier
                    advance in American history.  The author
                    asserts: "This has been a factual recital. … No flourishes
                    of style or memorable passages adorn the presentation. The record of
                    double-dealing is eloquent without purple prose" (p. 185). This is
                    hardly an accurate statement, however, because the volume is liberally sprinkled
                    with such "flourishes of style" as: "this deception
                    was perpetrated"; "that [the treaty] … was
                    fraudulent in intent is indubitable"; "no scruples restrained
                    his [William Henry Harrison's] remorseless pressure, prevarication, and
                    deceit in victimizing the tribes over whom he had browbeating sway";
                    "no iota of moral compunction entered into the dispossession of the
                    Indians"; "sordid motives … permeated with
                    fraud"; "relentless white intrusion";
                    "fraught with … sordid manoeuvres";
                    "sordid blackguardism"; "orgy of fraud"; and
                    "orgy of exploitation" (pp. 14, 17, 35–36, 58, 37,
                    48, 53, 97, 99, 111).
            According to the author, his findings are from "documentary sources,
                    augmented by findings of reliable authorities" (p. 185), which he
                    variously describes, for example, as "without a peer in the legal angle
                    of Indian Affairs" (p. 176), "a foremost authority"
                    (p. 166), "a prime authority on the frontier history" (p.
                    116), "a careful and qualified regional historian" (p. 112).
                    As accurately as these labels may describe the historians and writers concerned,
                    however, quoting them out of context sometimes conveys the wrong impressions.
            
               American Indians Dispossessed presents a picture that is
                    completely negative. It does not present the whole story. It rejects as
                    inadequate and unsatisfactory every effort that has and is being made to right
                    the wrongs herein depicted. It offers no constructive suggestions to improve the
                    situation. The reader is inclined to gain a feeling of hopelessness and futility
                    for the Indian and a sense of purposelessness for the volume.

               The Meaning of America; Essays Toward an Understanding of the
                        American Spirit. By Leland D. Baldwin. (
                        Pittsburgh
                    : University of 
                        Pittsburgh
                     Press, 1955, pp. 319. Maps and bibliography. $4.00.)
            The title of the volume would seem to imply an essay of something like two
                    hundred pages, more or less, but the subtitle, "Essays Toward an
                    Understanding of the American Spirit," suggests something different.
                    The headings selected  for the sixteen
                    chapters that make up the volume reveal a rather unusual treatment of such a
                    subject as "The Meaning of America." The reviewer cannot avoid
                    wondering why the author did not write a single essay on his chosen subject and
                    avoid reproducing so much of what had appeared in previous writings.
            Under any plan, such a subject as "The Meaning of America"
                    would be difficult to handle, but to accomplish something definite by writing
                    sixteen chapters with a variety of titles seems to have been a daring venture.
                    At best, the resulting volume seems to call for a further effort based on its
                    contents, perhaps, but nevertheless a single essay with the title, "The
                    Meaning of America."
            The sixteen chapters that make up the book under review are not historical
                    narratives, but each is in the nature of a discussion, and, in these chapters,
                    the author expresses a multitude of opinions. Among the chapter headings are
                    included the following: "Hamilton and Jefferson";
                    "The Rampageous West"; "The Southern Search for a
                    Veto"; "The Gospel of Wealth"; "The
                    Pragmatic Challenge"; "The New Deal and the Welfare
                    State"; and "How Fares the American Mission." These
                    are seven of the sixteen chapter titles, the last being the heading of the
                    final, or sixteenth, chapter of the volume.
            Presumably the final chapter should reveal the author's conception of
                    "The Meaning of America," but it seems to leave the reader
                    guessing. Perhaps the author is wise in not trying to state too definitely the
                        meaning of America, since such a statement is indeed
                    difficult to fashion. One does not need to fear to hazard an opinion that
                    Baldwin and many other thinkers will have the opportunity to give thought to the
                    question that he has raised for some years to come.

                     Historical Society has issued a second printing of the book.
            The voyageur as a class has long since vanished from the world.
                    Yet for more than a century he played an indispensable role in the operations of
                    the fur trade. Gayhearted  and docile,
                    inured to a life of exposure and hardship, he endured without complaint labors
                    to which men of the Anglo-Saxon race would not submit. A good illustration of
                    this fact is afforded by the experience of the 
                        St. Louis
                        Missouri
                     Fur Company which in 1809 led an expedition of several hundred men,
                    half of them French voyageurs and the remainder 
                        Kentucky
                     and 
                        Missouri
                     frontiersmen, to the upper 
                        Missouri
                    . En route, the American contingent staged a wholesale revolt
                    against their employers, although their treatment seems to have differed in no
                    way from that accorded the submissive voyageurs.
            
            In the nine chapters which comprise Miss Nute's book she has assembled
                    about all most readers need care to know about the class of men to which the
                    book is devoted. There are chapters on the fur trade, on the voyageur himself and on his canoe, on voyaging, on fort life, and on
                        voyageur songs. Three concluding chapters deal with the
                    role of the voyageur as soldier, as settler, and as explorer.
            It is well that Miss Nute's book has been made available to the current
                    generation of readers. A thorough scholar, she knows how to write entertainingly
                    and well. The men she celebrates followed a perilous calling. In 
                        Detroit
                    , within recent years the reviewer has listened to the legend of Le Canot du Nord (The North Canoe) recited by a member of one
                    of the city's old French families as he had learned it from his
                    ancestors. In the days of the Old Regime in 
                        Canada
                     the young men left their homes in large numbers to enter as voyageurs or coureurs de bois upon the life
                    of the northwestern wilderness. They seldom returned in the flesh, but on every
                    New Year's eve the ghostly spirits of those who had lost their lives
                    among the wild beasts and still wilder men of the north country flew back over
                    the tree-tops in a great canoe to rejoin for a brief spell the old folks at home
                    and to kiss the girls on the annual feast of New Year's Day. Such was
                    the legend of Le Canot du Nord which is still repeated in some
                    of 
                        Detroit
                    's French families.

               Diary of a Dying Empire. By Hans Peter Hanssen. Translated
                    by Oscar O. Winther. Edited by Ralph H. Lutz, Mary Schofield, and O. O. Winther.

                    : Indiana University Press, 1955, pp. liii, 409. Maps,
                    bibliographical notes, and index. $6.75.)
            
            Hans Peter Hanssen published his memoirs in Danish, Fra
                    Krigstiden, in Copenhagen in 1924. Oscar O. Winther has now translated
                    those parts of Hanssen's book which best supplement already available
                    material on 
                        Germany
                     and especially on the problems of the Danish minority in Schleswig
                    during World War I. The editing is done with unusual care and fullness. Ralph H.
                    Lutz contributes a 42-page introduction, which includes a sketch of
                    Hanssen's life and an appreciation of his work. Biographical notes at
                    the end of the volume include thumb-nail sketches of 265—nearly
                    all—of the individuals mentioned in the text. There is a good index.
                    Although without illustrations and with only an endpaper map, the book is neatly
                    printed and almost letter-perfect. The only typographical error noted makes the
                    life span of Frau Minna Cauer extend from 1482 to 1922 (p. 377). The plan of
                    omitting materials easily available from other sources is doubtless justified,
                    although it sometimes leaves gaps probably disconcerting to readers not familiar
                    with the period.
            Born on a farm in Danish Schleswig in 1862, two years before the area was taken
                    from 
                        Denmark
                     by Prussia, Hanssen thoroughly absorbed the Danish point of view
                    and continually championed it in his newspaper and in lectures. He served in the
                    Prussian Landtag from 1896 to 1908, and from 1906 on in the German Reichstag,
                    where he was the recognized leader of the movement for the return of northern
                    Schleswig to 
                        Denmark
                    . He faithfully kept a diary, which fully reflects his primary
                    interests in the Schleswig problem. However, his membership in the Reichstag and
                    his sitting with its important Finance Committee gave him first hand knowledge
                    of much that transpired in 
                        Germany
                     during World War I, and this aspect of his diary has wider interest
                    than the important, but more limited, Schleswig question.
            To Hanssen there was nothing glorious in the war. With the German mobilization on
                    August 1 in his home town, he saw "pale, serious men, duly resigned:
                    women dissolved in tears; young couples who, without thought of those about
                    them, tightly embraced each other; sobbing children—all feeling
                    themselves caught by the inflexible and inevitable grip of fate" (p.
                    10). Arrested and imprisoned, along with other Danes, he was soon released to
                    attend a special meeting of the Reichstag. Arriving in Berlin he found a
                    "heavy, sad, and depressed atmosphere" (p. 14). By September
                    11 he found the public demanding "at least one victory a day
                    … When that fails, general apathy is evident" (p. 64).
            
            From mid-1916 on Hanssen mentions with increasing frequency and concern the food
                    shortage felt by all classes. Fuel shortages also became acute. Black market
                    activities flourished. Conditions in the prisoner of war camps became worst of
                    all, with hunger, sickness, overwork, and barbarous punishments.
            Hansen was highly critical of the press censorship. His own and all other
                    Danish-language papers were suppressed for the first few weeks of the war and
                    had to operate under many restrictions from then on. He was particularly
                    concerned that members of the Reichstag knew less of what was happening than did
                    the public in enemy and neutral countries, and therefore translated material
                    from Copenhagen papers for their benefit. He was equally critical of the efforts
                    of the Press Bureau of the Foreign Office to bribe the press in other countries,
                    especially 
                        France
                    , 
                        Italy
                    , and Rumania. "In such a way," he remarked,
                    "is this vulgar war managed. As the Chancellor has said, no means are
                    beneath the Government if it is thought that they can further the interests of 
                        Germany
                    " (p. 112).
            The decision to resort to unlimited submarine warfare on February 1, 1917, came
                    after long discussion, and after it appeared that there was no other way to
                    defeat 
                        England
                    . The Admiralty presented statistics to show that submarines would
                    sink enough British shipping that "by fall the Island Kingdom will
                    sprawl like a fish in the reeds and beg for peace" (p. 165). The chance
                    that unlimited submarine warfare would bring the 
                        United States
                     into the war was answered in three ways: that the 
                        United States
                     would not be able to contribute anything in a military way; that
                    the war in any case would be ended before the 
                        United States
                     could make any contribution; and—a point of interest for
                    Indiana readers—that isolationism in the Middle and Far West might
                    keep the 
                        United States
                     from entering at all.
            Throughout the war period Hanssen worked in close touch with representatives of
                    the other minority groups within 
                        Germany
                    —the Poles and the Alsatians—and was able to
                    gather support from various political leaders, especially Social Democrats and
                    Progressives. The diary reaches its climax, so far as he was concerned, with the
                    assurance he received after the Armistice from the new provisional government,
                    that "the North Schleswig question should, in view of President
                    Wilson's peace program, be solved on the basis of the right of the
                    people to self-determination" (p. 367). Rejoicing with Hanssen in
                    prospects for their own minorities  to be
                    freed from 
                        Germany
                     were the Polish leader Wojciech Korfanty, who exclaimed,
                    "Now life is worth living," and the Alsatian priest who added
                        "Donnerwetter, ja!" (p. 323). A
                    Schleswig plebiscite in 1920 resulted in turning over to 
                        Denmark
                     substantially the area that Hanssen had advocated.
            Professor Winther, the Indiana University Press, and all concerned are to be
                    thanked for bringing Hanssen's valuable and dramatic diary to
                    English-speaking people.
