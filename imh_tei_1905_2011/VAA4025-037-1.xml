            <p>Every age has its special interests, in history and literature as in other matters. Probably there is
                    no form of history and literature combined which to-day is more popular than biography. The great
                    figures of the past are being scrutinized anew from every angle, and with the aid of every bit of
                    available source material. Part of this interest in individuals is scientific in its origin; but
                    part, too, is based on hero-worship, on the admiration and affection which normal men bestow upon
                    the lives and the personalities of the great. Among those figures in the history of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> who have been honored in this way in recent years, none is more outstanding or more
                    widely-revered, than that of the Great Emancipator, Abraham Lincoln. An age which is vividly
                    conscious of the priceless value of democracy, and of the liberty upon which democracy is based, has
                    not been careless of Lincoln's memory, but has labored painstakingly to recover and
                    preserve all the facts and all the objects which throw light upon his career. In view of these
                    circumstances, it is not difficult to understand that the material is exhausted more easily than the
                    zeal of the searchers; and that, as the field of inquiry is picked clean, any last straw of evidence
                    is pounced upon with a new eagerness. Under these conditions, facts and objects which might easily
                    have escaped attention at a time when interest was less keen, or source-material less exhausted,
                    take on a new and greater attractiveness. It is this state of affairs in the field of Lincolniana
                    which makes it possible that the Lincoln-loving public might welcome an account of a painting
                    hitherto practically unknown—the Elizabeth Croasdale painting of Abraham Lincoln.</p>
            <p>Until recently,<hi rend="sup">1</hi> the Croasdale painting hung in the ancestral <list type="footnotes">

               </placeName>.
                    Outside that home, neither the painting nor the artist seems to have been well known in recent
                    years. Members of the Croasdale family of today maintain that the picture which bears their name was
                    painted in the year 1861, from life, by Elizabeth Croasdale. The work is an oil painting on canvas,
                    twenty-five inches wide and thirty inches in length. At the time of writing, it is in an excellent
                    state of preservation. Apparently, the background in the picture has been restored, but the face and
                    the body do not appear to have been altered. The present owner is Dr. Arthur Edwin Bye, artist, of
                    Byecroft, Holicong, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>. Dr. Bye purchased the painting in the Fall of 1936 from Mrs. Robert Croasdale Wood,
                    the widow of a nephew of Elizabeth Croasdale, and an occupant of the Croasdale home in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Britain</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Mrs. Wood affirms the family tradition that the painting was never exhibited,
                    published, or sold. There is no signature or other mark on either the face or the back of the work
                    by which its origin might be evidenced.</p>
            <p>Of the artist herself, little enough is known. There is a brief note on "E.
                    Croasdale" in the <hi rend="i">Dictionary of American Painters, Sculptors and
                    Engravers,</hi> by Mantle Fielding; but so little was the author of the note acquainted with his
                    subject, that he assumed "E. Croasdale" to be a man. The Fielding-note on E.
                    Croasdale reads: "Portrait painter. He [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] painted a portrait of
                    Abraham Lincoln and on the back of the canvas is inscribed ‘Painted by E. Croasdale, and
                    retouched by S. J. Ferris, 1863.’ " Clearly there is nothing here that could not
                    have been learned by examining the picture referred to. Apparently the author of the note had
                    nothing to guide him except a portrait, or a description of a portrait. From other sources it
                    appears that Elizabeth Croasdale was a daughter of an old <placeName>

                    </placeName> family of <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>; that she was a graduate of the Government Art Training School, South Kensington, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>; and that from the year 1873 until 1885 she was Principal of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> School of Design. Among the five <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> artists who are known to have made paintings of Abraham Lincoln from life, Elizabeth
                    Croasdale is not listed.</p>
            <p>These are the facts in brief about the painting and the artist. They are very scanty and, in regard
                    to the painting, leave unanswered many questions which might be raised. <pb n="5" id="VAA4025-037-1-011"/> What was the exact date of the work? Was it from life? Was it from a
                    photograph? Was it partly from life and partly from a photograph? Was it from several photographs?
                    Was it from another portrait? From several other portraits? Did Elizabeth Croasdale paint two
                    portraits of Lincoln? Was one a copy of the other, and, if so, which is the painting owned by Dr.
                    Bye? These problems cannot be resolved from the external evidence available. Perhaps some light may
                    be thrown upon them by an examination of the internal evidence.</p>
            <p>First, the question of the date. The most definite source concerning the time when the painting was
                    done is the family tradition, which puts it in the year 1861. This tradition, however, is perhaps
                    not very strong, because it has been transmitted through a relative, by marriage, of the Croasdale
                    family. Since there is no apparent reason for an error in the family tradition relative to the date,
                    unless forgetfulness, the year 1861 would be accepted without question were it not for internal
                    evidence. It is true that the painting could have been done as early as 1861, because, while Lincoln
                    wore no beard before his election in 1860, he began to grow a beard soon afterwards and had already
                    developed a considerable growth as early as January, 1861, as may be seen in the German photograph
                    of that month. The length of the beard, and especially the expression of the face, suggest strongly
                    that the painting was done later, probably in 1863 or 1864. The eyes and the beard, for example,
                    conform rather closely to those displayed in the Brady photograph of February 9, 1864, the
                    photograph declared by Robert Lincoln "to be the most satisfactory likeness" of
                    his father.</p>
            <p>A statement that the painting was done in 1863 or 1864, however, would have to be qualified by the
                    condition, "if it were done from life." Because the same tradition which
                    represents the painting as a portrait from life, declares it to have been done in 1861; and while it
                    may be more difficult for tradition to preserve a date correctly, than to carry such a fact as a
                    painting having been done from life, nevertheless the rejection of the date 1861 seriously
                    undermines the validity of the rest of the tradition. To the extent that we may doubt that the
                    painting was done from life, to that extent must we believe, in the absence of other evidence, that
                    it may have been done even later than 1863 <pb n="6" id="VAA4025-037-1-012"/> or 1864, even,
                    perhaps, after Lincoln's death. We know that Elizabeth Croasdale was living as late as the
                    year 1885. In that year, she gave up her position as Principal of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>School of Design on account of poor health. It is reasonable to suppose that Elizabeth
                    Croasdale would not be likely to paint pictures then or later. So the year 1885 may be taken as the
                    latest probable limit for the time in which the painting may have been done. This is not to suggest
                    that it <hi rend="i">was</hi> done later than the 'sixties. It is merely to point out a
                    possibility opened up by a questioning of the tradition that the painting was done in the year 1861,
                    and from life. The fact that there is evidence of the existence of an Elizabeth Croasdale painting
                    of Lincoln inscribed with the date "1863," tends to confirm the suggestion that
                    the painting which is known was also done in the early 'sixties. It indicates that
                    Elizabeth Croasdale was interested in, and working upon the Lincoln figure at that time; and it
                    strengthens the probability established by the family tradition, that the painting at issue was
                    produced in the year 1861 or not many years later.</p>
            <p>The fixing of the date of the painting, then, depends to a considerable extent upon the answer to the
                    question: "Was the painting done from life?" Here, again, the strongest argument
                    derives from the family tradition. In was observed above that a rejection of the year 1861 as the
                    date of the painting would weaken the validity of the rest of the tradition, but it does not destroy
                    it. In the absence of opposing evidence, the contention that the painting was done from life would
                    have to be accepted. There is no external evidence to show that the work was not done from life.
                    There is, first of all, no evidence from the life of Lincoln. As was noted above, at least five <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>artists are known to have made portraits of him. May there not have been a sixth? There
                    is nothing positive to oppose the suggestion. An argument drawn from lack of evidence would have
                    little force in view of the facts that Lincoln often sat for a portrait and that the matter was not
                    always one of sufficient importance to be made note of by contemporaries. Nor is there any other
                    external evidence which makes it probable or improbable that the painting was from life. What
                    evidence there is makes it possible, but only possible, that Lincoln sat for the painting. In this
                    connection it may be worth <pb n="7" id="VAA4025-037-1-013"/> noting that the fact that Elizabeth
                    Croasdale was Principal of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>School of Design from 1873 to 1885, in a city where five other artists made portraits of
                    Lincoln, is favorable to the contention that her painting was from life. It should also be observed
                    that Stephen J. Ferris who, according to Mantle Fielding, retouched a painting of Lincoln by
                    Elizabeth Croasdale in the year 1863, was scarcely the type of artist who would spend his time,
                    while Lincoln was alive and being painted and photographed with comparative frequency, retouching a
                    picture which was not from life. On the other hand, Ferris was a young man, only twent-yeight years
                    of age, at the time, who did not gain his greatest prominence until some years afterwards. There is
                    the possibility, of course, that the painting retouched by Ferris was from life and that the one
                    which is known today is a copy of the other. It is clear from the meager sources available that
                    there is nothing in the external evidence which militates against the known Croasdale painting being
                    from life.</p>
            <p>As to the conclusion which should be drawn from internal evidence, there is a division of opinion
                    among the authorities who have examined the picture or photographs of it. First, what are the
                    arguments of the proponents? The chief and, indeed, the only weighty argument from internal evidence
                    advanced by those who contend that the painting was done from life, is that there exists no known
                    photographs or portraits from which it was evidently copied. It may be stated, too, that the
                    opposing authorities, those who think the painting a copy, practically admit the truth of the last
                    statement. A list of those who make up what may be called "the affirmative" will
                    show how thoroughly the field has been searched for a possible original photograph or portrait.
                    First, there is Dr. Bye, the present owner. Dr. Bye is not officially an authority on Lincolniana,
                    but as owner of the picture, as an artist, and as one professionally concerned with the restoration
                    of old masters, he is fitted both by interest and training to give an authoritative opinion on the
                    subject. Dr. Bye is convinced that the painting is from life. Secondly, there is Dr. Louis A.
                    Warren, director of the Lincoln National Life Foundation at Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>. He has assured Dr. Bye that he knows of no picture closely resembling the Croasdale
                    painting, and that he, therefore, believes the latter to have <pb n="8" id="VAA4025-037-1-014"/>
                    been done from life. Dr. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName>'s opinion is all the more valuable because he has made a 'special
                    study of Lincoln portraits and photographs. Thirdly, there is Mr. Benjamin P. Thomas, executive
                    secretary of the Abraham Lincoln Association. Mr. Thomas, having compared the Croasdale painting
                    with photographs, is "inclined to think that the opinion of the Croasdale family that it
                    was painted from life may be correct. " Finally, the Custodian of the Lincoln Collection at <placeName>

                    </placeName> University, Miss Esther C. Cushman, while not committing herself as to whether the
                    painting was done from life, after making a careful study of the photographs of Lincoln in her care,
                    has agreed that there is none from which the picture seems to have been copied. It may be observed,
                    in connection with all these opinions, that attention has been concentrated entirely on the
                    resemblance of the Croasdale painting to photographs and portraits. No other approach to the
                    internal evidence is suggested.</p>
            <p>Practically the same is true of those opinions which have been given against the family claim that
                    the painting was done from life. The most important of these pronouncements are those made by
                    Frederick H. Meserve, Harry McGill Bland and Rufus Rockwell Wilson. All these men are outstanding
                    authorities on pictures of Lincoln. Mr. Meserve has made a vast collection of photographs concerning
                    the whole Lincoln period. Mr. Wilson has published a volume on <hi rend="i">Lincoln in
                    Portraiture.</hi> Mr. Bland is reputed to be the greatest living authority on the paintings of
                    Lincoln. They unite in the belief that the Croasdale painting was not done from life. True they give
                    no particular reasons in support of this opinion; but their opinion, as such, is probably the most
                    weighty that could be secured on a basis of an examaniation of the internal evidence. On the other
                    hand, they fail to point to any photograph from which the Croasdale likeness might have been copied.
                    Mr. Meserve's verdict on this latter point is especially important, owing to his exhaustive
                    study and collection of Lincoln and other photographs.</p>
            <p>One more opinion, quite neutral as to other matters, may be given on the subject of a photographic
                    origin of the Croasdale painting. Harry E. Pratt, executive secretary of the Abraham Lincoln
                    Association, when asked by Dr. Bye for information which might help solve the question of the origin
                    of the Croasdale painting in 1836, replied: "I have <pb n="9" id="VAA4025-037-1-015"/>
                    looked through all our data here in the office and that of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> State Hist. Soc. and do not find anything that would aid you in identifying the picture
                    you mention." It may be said then, that everyone who has given an opinion on the subject
                    has agreed that there is no evidence which goes to show that the Croasdale painting was copied from
                    a photgraph.</p>
            <p>In connection with the question of resemblances between the painting and any particular photograph,
                    an interesting view was expressed by Dr. Louis A. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName>: "The finding of it [a photograph of Lincoln from which the painting may seem
                    to have been copied] would not necessarily imply that the painting is not from life as nearly all of
                    the painters did have photographs made of their subjects in order to assist them in the making of
                    their canvas." This is a strong argument in support of the validity of the Croasdale
                    tradition that the picture was done from life, because it destroys any finality that might otherwise
                    be possessed by a judgment based on the finding of a photograph even closely resembling the
                    painting. The finding of such a photograph might suggest strongly that the painting was only a copy,
                    but without the support of other evidence, it could never be taken as definitive proof.</p>
            <p>The same observation applies in the case of a suggested multiple photographic origin of the Croasdale
                    painting. If Elizabeth Croasdale used one photograph to assist her in painting Lincoln from life,
                    she might just as easily have used several. That there are similarities existing between the
                    painting and several known photographs, is quite true. For instance, the outline of hair and beard
                    is similar to that in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> photograph of November 15, 1863. The collar and shirt resemble those in the Brady
                    ambrotype of February 27, 1860. It was observed above that parts of the figure in the
                    painting—the expression of the eyes and beard—are like the corresponding parts
                    in Brady's photograph of February, 1864, but it is easy to push such comparisons too far.
                    It would be strange if one portrait of a man should not bear many resemblances to various
                    photographs, especially in the case of a man like Abraham Lincoln, whose careless strength and
                    rugged individuality thrust themselves into every outline and every attitude. Certainly one must
                    guard against over-emphasis on these resemblances.</p>
            <pb n="10" id="VAA4025-037-1-016"/>
            <p>What is true of comparisons between the Croasdale painting and one photograph or several photographs,
                    is equally true of those made between the painting and any Lincoln portraits. Rufus Rockwell Wilson,
                    for instance, believes that it looks "very much like a copy of the portrait painted by
                    Atwood." Miss Esther C. Cushman, on the other hand, while noting that there is a
                    resemblance between the Atwood portrait and the Croasdale, regards the latter as more like several
                    other portraits, such as that by Lambdin (when reversed), and those by Cogswell and Mathews. Here,
                    again, the conclusion cannot be final. One portrait may resemble another portrait not because it was
                    the sole source of the second, but because it was used as a supplementary aid, or merely because a
                    picture of the same subject, just as may be true of two photographs taken at different times. Here,
                    too, what applies to one portrait, applies equally to a group. As with photographs, so with
                    portraits, no definite conclusions can be drawn from mere resemblances.</p>
            <p>There remains to be discussed the question of whether Elizabeth Croasdale painted two portraits of
                    Lincoln rather than just one. Further, if she painted two, is the known painting the first or second
                    work. The answer to the first of these questions, of course, depends largely on the validity of the
                    note in Mantle Fielding's <hi rend="i">Dictionary</hi> which contains the statement that
                    Elizabeth Croasdale "painted a portrait of Abraham Lincoln and on the back of the canvas is
                    inscribed Tainted by E. Croasdale, and retouched by S. J. Ferris, 1863.’" The
                    details of this inscription are such that they could scarcely have been invented, but must have
                    come, directly or indirectly, from a picture to the author. The use of the word
                    "portrait" in the note, however, has no great significance in respect to whether
                    the painting was from life. It would be natural enough for anyone who knew so little of "E.
                    Croasdale" as to assume that the artist was a man, to take for granted that the painting
                    was from life and use the word "portrait" in describing it. There is room,
                    however, for little or no doubt that a picture bearing the above inscription exists or once existed.
                    It is possible, but not at all probable, that the inscription was mistakingly put on a painting
                    which was not done by E. Croasdale. It is equally improbable that the inscription quoted by Mantle
                    Fielding was once present on the known painting and later erased.</p>
            <pb n="11" id="VAA4025-037-1-017"/>
            <p>Aside from these rather far-fetched possibilities and the equally untenable one that the known
                    painting was not done by Elizabeth Croasdale, the evidence all points to the strong possibility that
                    Elizabeth Croasdale painted two pictures of Abraham Lincoln. This conclusion is supported, in the
                    first place, by the facts that the inscription in the Fielding note describes the changes made in
                    the painting after it had left the artist's hands as a "retouching,"
                    whereas in the known painting, as Dr. Bye says, the background has been damaged and restored, but
                    the face and body have not been altered. A "retouching" implies additions, more
                    probably to the figure, and could scarcely be construed as meaning a restoration after damage.
                    Stronger evidence that there were two Croasdale paintings of Lincoln is the existence of a half-tone
                        print,<hi rend="sup">2</hi> which apparently has been cut from a sale catalogue, because it is
                    listed as "lot No. 10." There is nothing to show from whose catalogue the print
                    was taken, but it resembles the known painting closely. It shows, however, certain differences from
                    the painting which could scarcely be accounted for in the making of a half-tone. When these facts
                    are considered in conjunction with others which are known, the existence of a second Croasdale
                    painting becomes almost certain. In the first place there is the note in Mantle Fielding's
                        <hi rend="i">Dictionary,</hi> with the inscription which is not found on the known painting.
                    Next, there is the family conviction that the painting which they possessed had never been removed
                    from the house, published or sold before the year 1936. Finally, there is Mr.
                    Meserve's-"recollection of having been told that a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>dealer was trying to sell a portrait of Abraham Lincoln alleged to be from life by
                    Elizabeth Croasdale." All these facts would be accounted for if there were two Croasdale
                    paintings, one inscribed, one not inscribed; one put up for sale, one not put up; one published in
                    the form of a half-tone print in a sale catalog as early as the year 1926; the other not published
                    or offered for sale for another ten years or thereabouts. Against the conclusion that two Croasdale
                    paintings were made, there are only two weak arguments: one the improbability that, because having
                    painted one portrait of Lincoln, she would not paint a second; and the <list type="footnotes">

                    be well-known and available.</p>
            <p>If, as thus seems likely, Elizabeth Croasdale made two paintings of Lincoln, which was done first,
                    and which is more likely to have been done from life? Here answers must be in the realm of almost
                    pure surmise. It may be assumed, however, with a certain degree of probability, that if either
                    painting was from life, it was more likely the first one done; because this conclusion involves a
                    simpler assumption than the other. In other words, it is a more complicated and therefore less
                    plausible assumption that Elizabeth Croasdale first painted Lincoln from photographs or portraits,
                    and afterwards from life, than that she painted him from life and then simply made a copy or another
                    version of her own work. It would seem, then, though the matter is close to pure conjecture, that,
                    if two paintings were done and one was from life, it was the first and not the second, which was
                    done from life. As to which of these two possible pictures the known painting is, it can only be
                    said that the evidence points almost equally both ways, perhaps a little more strongly to its being
                    the one first painted. The family tradition puts the known painting in 1861. The date on the
                    inscribed portrait was 1863. But the Lincoln in the known painting looks more like the real Lincoln
                    of later years; and because the inscribed portrait was marked 1863 is not evidence that it was
                    painted in 1863, but only evidence that S. J. Ferris retouched it at that time. It would not help
                    matters to know who wrote the inscription. It may be said here that, after all the evidence has been
                    sifted, there is really nothing of great weight opposed to the tradition of the Croasdale family
                    that the painting which they preserved was done in the year 1861 by Elizabeth Croasdale and from
                    life. Until further opposing evidence appears, that tradition will not, apparently be seriously
                    undermined.</p>
            <p>There remain a few more questions connected with the Croasdale painting which it might be appropriate
                    to discuss here. These questions are concerned with the artistic and the historical values of the
                    picture, and with the quality of Elizabeth Croasdale's work. As to the value of the
                    painting as a work of art, curiously enough, most of those who have passed judgment have contented
                    themselves with saying that they thought it a good or a poor picture, or a good or a poor <pb n="13" id="VAA4025-037-1-019"/> likeness, without discussing in any way the qualities of the work. A.
                    M. Kennedy, Sunday Editor of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Tribune,</hi> writes that when the painting was in his hands in 1937 in connection with
                    possible publication on the occasion of Lincoln's birthday, "several critics
                    … consulted considered that the likeness of Lincoln was not good." Mr. Meserve
                    thought that Harry Bland "does not regard the portrait highly." Miss Cushman, on
                    the contrary, thought that "the Croasdale portrait is a very good one." Dr. Bye is
                    more specific, while remaining moderate in his praises. "I do not," says Dr. Bye,
                    "regard the painting as a great work of art. It is sincere, conscientious painting, able
                    and technically well executed. But it makes no claim to penetrating portraiture, or virtuosity. Its
                    chief value is historical or antiquarian. It has been considerably praised by lovers of
                    Lincoln—Collectors of Lincolniana." Dr. Bye says again: "My opinion of
                    the portrait is that it is as good as any I ever saw of Lincoln, better than most. There were so few
                    good portraitists living in Lincoln's time." There is little else to be said here
                    about the artistic qualities of the painting, that being a matter for experts to decide, but it
                    should perhaps be recalled, in connection with the question of the picture's likeness to
                    Lincoln, that it closely resembles in certain respects the Gettysburg photograph of November, 1863,
                    the Brady photograph which Lincoln's son thought "to be the most satisfactory
                    likeness" of his father.</p>
            <p>What of Elizabeth Croasdale's ability as an artist? Was it such as to enable her to paint a
                    good picture, or a picture as good as the one which bears her name? Unfortunately, at this time,
                    there is available none of her other work on which a judgment might be based. In the absence of such
                    material, we may again quote from Dr. Bye. "In any event," he writes, "E.
                    Croasdale was not an eminent artist. Just a good example of her time, good enough to be a teacher
                    way back in the days when artists were few." More significant on this point is her later
                    career. Her appointment to the position of Principal of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>School of Design points, in the absence of other evidence, to the probability that she
                    was a reasonably good artist. There is nothing in her career, either as a student or a teacher,
                    which is out of keeping with the quality of work which appears in the Croasdale painting.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>Passing from the artist to the picture, it may be said that the chief value of the painting to-day,
                    as Dr. Bye agrees, is historical or antiquarian. "Historical" is probably the
                    better word. If the Croasdale painting is from life, it is, indeed, very valuable. By this is not
                    meant a money value, though Lincoln portraits have brought large sums. It is rather that a painting
                    from life is different from any other sort of reproduction. It gives not only a view, but an
                    impression and an interpretation. If the artist succeeds in producing a work of art, the result is a
                    composition of many things that a photograph cannot catch and that no historian can ever adequately
                    describe. A good portrait is a good likeness, but means more than a mere likeness. It brings out of
                    the subject what may often or usually remain hidden, and it pictures for us as nothing else can, the
                    human soul clothed in flesh and blood. Of this quality, there seems to be not a little in the
                    Croasdale painting. It shows us Lincoln, not amused or genial, as he frequently was, but looking
                    rather stern and somewhat sad, perhaps tired from over-strain, but ercet, and not bending under the
                    strain. It seems to convey the impression of a man with the strength of granite, but not hard or
                    unfeeling, rather the reverse; a man imbued with large and lofty aims, but constant, and full of
                    practical purpose; idealistic, but not excitedly enthusiastic; one who has experienced the tragedy,
                    as well as the greatness, of human life, and has still kept faith with his ideals. This is Lincoln,
                    not at his most amusing, but at his best. It is a rare and a great view of him, and we seem to owe
                    it to Elizabeth Croasdale. That alone should be enough to make the Croasdale painting and its
                    creator of the greatest significance alike to lovers of Lincoln, and to lovers of historical truth.</p>
            <p>If, on the other hand, the painting is not from life, it fails to possess much of the value it would
                    otherwise have. This is not to argue that a great painting cannot be made by <list type="footnotes">

                            Bye's estimate of the quality of the work displayed in the Croasdale painting:
                            "The untiring work of Miss Croasdale, who had been trained at the South Kensington
                            Museum in <placeName>

                            in design had placed undue emphasis on and given excessive time to the mechanics and
                            mathematics connected with perspective and geometry."</item>

                    a painting from life is far more closely related historically to its subject than is one not so
                    painted, and, other things being equal, is quite likely to be in many respects more historically
                    true and artistically great. Nevertheless, even if the Croasdale painting is not from life, it is
                    not without great historical significance. It was painted by an artist who was of good ability when
                    capable artists were few, a woman who was living at the same time and in the same country as her
                    subject touched by the same questions and breathing the same atmosphere. No doubt Elizabeth
                    Croasdale had at least seen Lincoln on public occasions, if not privately, and the impressions
                    received on those occasions would, to a trained artist, be of great value in giving life and
                    personality and historical accuracy to a work otherwise copied from pictures. Thus it seems safe to
                    affirm, and the affirmation is borne out by many who have seen the painting and compared its
                    qualities with the established portraits, that the Croasdale likeness, even if it is not from life,
                    compares favorably with those which are known to be from life, and hence, especially until the
                    tradition that it was done from life has been disproved, it ought to be regarded as deserving an
                    honorable position in the company of Lincolniana.</p>

            <p>The religious environment to which Abraham Lincoln was subject as a youth has never been adequately
                    explored. The minute book of the Little Pigeon Baptist Church, although repeatedly examined by
                    biographers, has yielded very little. It is concerned for the most part with purely routine matters
                    such as inquiries into the peace of the church, acceptance and dismission of members, and the
                    recording of contributions of various sorts. Now and then a vote on policy is mentioned, or a matter
                    of discipline raised. Except for the appearance of the Lincoln name at a half dozen or so places, it
                    differs in no important particular from scores of similar records of kindred churches of the period
                    that are available. It is, in fact; less significant than many that the writer has examined. The
                    document acquires meaning only in proportion to one's understanding of the general
                    situation prevailing among the Regular Baptist churches of <placeName>

                    Pigeon Association of United Baptists, however, affords a valuable key for relating the Lincoln

            <p>The fact that the local church was of the Regular Baptist variety while the Association of which it
                    was a member carried the name United Baptist requires a word of explanation. Almost all of the early

                    They were generally known as Regular Baptist churches, which often meant little more than that they
                    were of the usual sort. Another tradition was also present, however, stemming from the so-called
                    Separate Baptists of <placeName>

                    wages, although congregations were willing to contribute to the needs of their ministers. All of
                    their elders were untutored. Formal education was considered both dangerous to piety and superfluous
                    as far as preaching was concerned. They reasoned that if God called a man to preach, He would also
                    fill his mouth. It was therefore presumptuous in the extreme to insist that one called to preach
                    must be educated with the wisdom of men.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Spontaneous utterances were to them
                    more suggestive of the working of the Spirit than were prepared sermons. Under this arrangement

                    the men who sat in the pews.</p>
            <p>For several years after its organization the Little Pigeon Church was in a struggling stage without a
                    meeting house or a regular pastor. When Nancy Hanks Lincoln died in 1818, for example, there was no
                    preacher available at the place to conduct the funeral. A meeting house was finally built in 1822.
                    When Thomas Lincoln united with the Little Pigeon Church in June, 1823, it had only, forty-seven
                    members. The roll was not above sixty persons in 1830.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The regular monthly business meetings of the church were not without general interest. The practice
                    in all Baptist churches followed the same pattern. All business was transacted on Saturday. The
                    primary routine consideration was the inquiry into the peace of the church. At about half of the
                    meetings, complaints would be raised. The jurisdiction of the church over public offenses involving
                    the violation of the mores of the community and over private differences between members as well had
                    to be acknowledged on pain of exclusion. It was especially commendable, of course, for offenders to
                    bring accusation against themselves for disorderly conduct and to beg forgiveness of the church.
                    Otherwise the church functioned as a court according to well established rules of procedure.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> This frontier Consistory was <list type="footnotes">

                    usually commanded respect. Cases arising were, of course, always interesting to the curious. Thomas
                    Lincoln himself was involved in at least two such episodes. The community was coarse and crude, but
                    the fundamental demands of honesty, sobriety, and sexual morality were sturdily insisted upon here
                    as in other congregations.</p>
            <p>After the business was attended to, the pastor and other elders who might chance to be present took
                    turns in addressing the congregation either by exposition of Scripture or by moral exhortation. The
                    meeting lasted throughout the greater part of the day. Those who came from a distance were
                    "put up" for the night at some near-by cabin. Sunday was devoted exclusively to
                    devotional services, the meeting closing early enough to allow everyone to reach home before dark.
                    On rare occasions when an exceptional interest seemed to be aroused and conditions seemed to warrant
                    it, the meeting might be "protracted" into the following week. Such occasions for
                    Little Pigeon Church were apparently not frequent. The monthly church gathering was an important
                    social affair, affording abundant opportunity for casual talk of crops and politics, for gossip
                    among the women, and for courting among the young folks. Quantities of raw turnips and apples were
                    consumed in season. That young Abe Lincoln attended many such meetings is highly probable.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

            <p>In comparison with the Lincolns the Grigsby family was more prominently active. Reuben Grigsby, with
                    whom Abe in particular was in a state of near feud after the death of his sister Sarah Lincoln
                    Grigsby in 1827, was twice selected as the official messenger of the church to the annual
                    Association in the late twenties. It would be difficult to imagine, in this connection, how the
                    unrepentant author of the "Chronicles of Reuben" could have been an acceptable
                    candidate for membership in a church where the Grigsbys had any influence.</p>
            <p>The last experience which Tom Lincoln had with the Little Pigeon Church was a hang-over from the
                    Grigsby feud. The church letters which were granted Tom and Sarah Lincoln, in November, 1829, were
                    temporarily recalled in the following January, when Nancy Grigsby complained that she was not
                    satisfied with brother and sister Lincoln. The charges were examined by a private council and the
                    letters were promptly restored. Perhaps as an expression of confidence and as a sort of compensation
                    for thus having been spitefully embarrassed, Thomas Lincoln was then given the satisfaction of
                    acting as chairman of a board of five referees who reported adversely on a charge raised by the same
                    troublesome Nancy against another member of the church.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What were Abe's relations with the church can only be surmised. That he was directly subject
                    to the religious influences of his Indiana environment may be safely assumed. The style of both his
                    public utterances and his prose diction attest his close familiarity with the Scriptures. There is
                    every reason, furthermore, to believe that Abe attended with some degree of regularity the services
                    held in the family church located less than a mile from the Lincoln cabin. The usual sermon which he
                    could have heard there probably did not compete seriously in interest with the books and papers
                    which were his constant companions during his free time. The topics of interest in the Little Pigeon
                    church must have been to him somewhat stuffy and confining as compared with the affairs of the world
                    outside.</p>

            <p>The supposed widening estrangement which developed between Abe and his stolid unimaginative father
                    during the late twenties, may well be taken as a measure of the youth's lack of sympathy
                    for current religious views. Such a conclusion is supported by facts given below concerning the
                    inter-relation of religion and politics in the community.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> Abe was too
                    easy-going to quarrel openly with his father over religion, but he could not repress his droll sense
                    of humor. Reliable tradition says that at the age of fifteen he was especially fond of repeating the
                    sermons that the preachers gave and mimicking their peculiar intonations and gestures.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When attention is turned from the church records to that of the Little Pigeon Association, new
                    perspectives appear in the situation. The annual Associational meetings were affairs of some
                    importance. The sessions were invariably held in the late summer or early fall, when roads were more
                    generally passable and work slack. They usually extended through two or three days, and might be
                    "protracted" further. Here assembled the messengers that were sent by the dozen or
                    so member Baptist churches located within a radius of fifteen or twenty miles. Fraternal delegates
                    from other Associations came longer distances. Associations had no power to coerce individual
                    churches. The primary purpose was that of mutual encouragement and fellowship, but not infrequently
                    they pondered serious questions of general policy. The prominence of the church attended by the
                    Lincolns in the Association is reflected in the similarity of name, and in the fact that it was
                    organized at the home of Elder Young Lamar of that church in 1821. A number of the sessions of the
                    Association during the eighteen-twenties were held at the Lincoln church, and Charles Harper,
                    another pastor of that church, was repeatedly chosen moderator. That Abe attended some of the
                    sessions of the body is entirely possible, but whether he did or not, the affairs of concern in the
                    Association throw much light on the character of his family church.</p>
            <p> One of the questions that agitated the Association in the late 'twenties was referred to as

                    immersionist bodies in the vicinity.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> The contention was made that baptism by
                    immersion was not valid if performed by an administrator who entertained heterodox opinions, or who
                    himself had not been properly baptized. The principle would seem to suggest the necessity of an
                    unbroken succession of properly qualified administrators of the ordinance back to John the Baptist
                    himself. The exclusive character of such a position is obvious. Repeated warnings appear in the
                    minutes of the Association concerning the danger of laxity in this matter. The body explicitly ruled
                    on one occasion that immersion at the hands of a Dunkard (Dunker), or any other unorthodox Baptist
                    preacher was unacceptable. Pastor Charles Harper of the Little Pigeon Church was the leader of the
                    conservative party that passed this ruling<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By far the most serious problem which agitated the Association, however, was whether or not to
                    countenance the new system of missionary benevolences which the New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> Baptists were sponsoring. It became a subject of controversy in 1823, and continued as
                    a perennial problem. The missionary organization had been started in the previous decade in response
                    to the appeal of Adoniram Judson from <placeName>
                        <country reg="br">Burma</country>
                    </placeName>. It was broadly progressive in character, including such innovations as temperance
                    propaganda, education for ministers, Sunday schools, Indian missions, Bible and tract distribution.
                    Administering the program was a central executive board resident in New <placeName>

                    be found, local "mite societies" were organized to solicit funds. Salaried agents

                    regard for the prejudices and susceptibilities of the people. The vast majority of the churches
                    would have none of the missionary system. In the first place, there was, of course, no Scriptural
                    authorization for such conventions and societies. Many became convinced, furthermore, that it was a
                    nefarious scheme to usurp the liberties of Baptist churches by setting up an ecclesiastical
                    hierarchy based upon a money-contributing representation.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Current economic and political factors also played into the hands of the opposition to missions. The
                    panic of 1819 left the prices of western staples at a very low level, and the distress was generally
                    attributed to the influence on the federal government of the aristocratic money-power centering in
                    the East. Andrew Jackson became the champion of western discontent on this issue during the late
                    twenties. After Jackson's defeat at the hands of J. Q. Adams in the balloting for the
                    Presidency in 1825 by the House of Representatives, the attack of the western leader was directed
                    particularly against New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. This happened to be the principal place of origin and support of Baptist Missionary
                    Societies. Jackson's personality was compelling and dynamic. To his followers, he became
                    the champion of the people who toiled as over against that privileged group, including scholars and
                    professional clergymen as well as capitalists, who did not have to work with their hands.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> The new champion found an enthusiastic following within the Baptist sect of

            <p>It is possible to discern a close inter-relationship between Jacksonianism as a political movement
                    and the anti-mission agitation. The political issues allegedly facing the country were measurably

                    occasion, he attributed the scanty progress which that movement had made in its early phases to the
                    fact that the first champions of the cause had been preachers and hired agents whom the people
                    suspected of desiring to accomplish the union of church and state.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

            <p>From 1823 to 1828, the problem of the policy to be pursued with regard to missionary benevolences
                    dwarfed all other considerations in the sessions of the Little Pigeon Association. Almost no one
                    proposed that they should cooperate actively with the missionary enterprise. The question was rather
                    whether they should dare countenance the program indirectly by corresponding with the missionary
                    agencies as requested or even with neighboring Baptist bodies who did do so. At the session held at
                    the Little Pigeon Church in 1823 the matter was referred back to the eleven member churches for
                    their consideration. Led by pastor Charles Harper, the Little Pigeon Creek Church emphatically
                    condemned the proposal to correspond with the Mission Board. When a vote was taken by the
                    Association in the following year, the Lincoln church was in a majority of seven to four against the
                    proposition. Harper himself was elected as the next moderator of the Association.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The controversy was raised to fever pitch in 1825. On this occasion the Associational gathering,
                    meeting at Bethel church, was visited by one Daniel Parker of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, who was perhaps the most extreme opponent of the missionary program in the western
                    country. Parker was making a tour of the Indiana Associations at the time in a deliberate effort to
                    arouse hostility against the missionary movement.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Parker's immediate purpose had a history behind it. He came as a fraternal delegate from the

                    </placeName>, which was one of the very few avowedly missionary Associations to be found in all of
                    Indiana. This Union Association was a particular object of Parker's attack.</p>
            <p>Parker was an interesting character. Although diminutive in person and uncouth in appearance, he was
                    nevertheless a clever partisan leader who knew how to appeal directly to the prejudices of his
                    hearers. He combined a degree of natural brilliance with a flair for oratorical utterance. Back in
                    1820, he had published an abusive pamphlet setting forth his objections to the missionary program.
                    The principal argument was based on his peculiar Manichean doctrine of the two seeds. Two seeds, he
                    said, the one Divine and the other Satanic, had been implanted in the human spirit at the time of
                    the fall of man. The eternal fate of any particular person depended upon which of these two seeds
                    germinated within his soul. God's children would be saved and those of the Devil
                    irrevocably lost, and no amount of missionary activity could alter their fate one way or the other.
                    Any officious attempt on the part of missionaries to interfere with God's plan of election
                    he shamelessly likened to the action of a lustful person seeking to aid a neighbor's wife
                    to acquire a much-desired heir. Parker was a rabid Jacksonian Democrat and, at the time of his first
                    visit to Little Pigeon Association, was occupying a seat in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Legislature.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> That the curiosity of the younger Lincoln would have
                    been attracted toward such a figure is only a little less probable than that they would have
                    disagreed violently in point of view.</p>
            <p>With the cooperation of Moderator Harper, Parker seems to have carried all before him on his first
                    visit to the Little Pigeon community. The Association not only reaffirmed its previous decision in
                    regard to the general Mission Board, but also refused to enter into fraternal relations with the
                    Union Association. But the trouble had just begun. The extreme predestinarian doctrines of Parker
                    offended many of the more liberal traditions of the United Baptists and the next four or five
                    sessions were stormy ones for the Association. In the annual meeting of 1826, for example, with
                    Parker again present, the body reversed its action of the previous year by opening correspondence
                    with the Union Association. <list type="footnotes">

                    adjournment time. In 1827, the conservative party within the Association, led again by Charles
                    Harper as moderator, recovered control. This time they voted to sever relations with Union
                    Association "in Consequence of their Connection with the domestic Mission Society of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>." The pendulum swung the other way at the meeting in 1828, though Parker
                    appeared for a third time before the Association. So great had grown the opposition to him
                    personally by this time that the Little Pigeon body severed their connections with the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> District Association as well, an action which automatically abolished Parker's
                    right to visit them as a fraternal delegate and to speak at their sessions. Only thus was his
                    officious meddling in their affairs finally eliminated. The anti-mission policy of the Association
                    nevertheless remained in force for more than a decade after that date.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Meanwhile a new issue of controversy appeared. The old Separate Baptist tradition re-asserted itself
                    in the proposal that formulated creeds should be set aside and the Bible as a whole be taken as a
                    guide of faith. Alexander Campbell and his <hi rend="i">Christian Baptist</hi> led the agitation on
                    this point. Although almost as hostile as was Parker to the missionary program, Campbell opposed it
                    on institutional grounds alone. He definitely rejected the predestinarian arguments of the
                    Parkerites and the Regular Baptists. Thus it developed that those who refused to affirm the doctrine
                    in question were accused by the Regulars of being Campbellites.</p>
            <p>This new problem came before the Little Pigeon Association in 1829, with the sessions held at the
                    Little Pigeon Church. Some neighboring churches, still under Parker's influence, demanded
                    that the body discipline a particular individual for declaring publicly that the doctrine of
                    predestination came from hell and would go back to hell along with those who preached it. The
                    Association avoided controversy by claiming lack of jurisdiction on the ground that the statement
                    had not been made in its own sessions. One of the <list type="footnotes">

                            in the Association by a close vote in 1840. Thereupon, about half of the churches broke
                            away, including Little Pigeon Church, forming the Little Zion Association of Primitive
                            Baptists. Four or five of these churches still survive in a dying condition, Little Pigeon

                    take action. In the following year it was voted to investigate the charge that the Union Association
                    had turned Campbellite. So disturbing had these various outside influences become by 1831 that the
                    Association finally severed all correspondence whatsoever with neighboring Baptist bodies, even
                    including the parent <placeName>

            <p>In reference to the question of the likelihood of Abe Lincoln's contacts with the affairs of
                    the Association, a few facts may be gleaned from the records. In the first place, two of the most
                    crucial sessions of the Association were held at Little Pigeon Church near his home, those of 1823
                    and 1829. In the second place, Pastor Charles Harper of his family church was very active throughout
                    the controversy. Finally, it is very probable that Tom Lincoln agreed fully with his pastor in
                    opposing the missionary system. At any-rate, Abe's complete lack of enthusiasm for such
                    religious bickering is not difficult to understand. He declared on a later occasion that he had been
                    frequently angered as a boy when his elders failed to discuss their religious questions in terms
                    simple enough for a boy to grasp.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The growing youth was making contacts during this same period with a steadily widening circle of
                    interests. Before he left Indiana, he had broken away from the political tenets of his father and
                    had become an ardent admirer of Henry <placeName>

                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> Abe's most intimate friends during this period, such as
                    Colonel Jones, David Turnham and William Wood, likewise became Whigs. During the summers of 1826 and
                    1827, Abe worked along the <placeName>

                    There is every reason to assume that his shift of political allegiance during these years was

                    of time, of course, he became less sophomoric in the airing of his views, but he never consented to
                    give his assent to the doctrine of eternal punishment. Abandoning the conventional modes of
                    religious thinking, Lincoln learned to express his faith in terms of general laws made operative by
                    a Creator.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> His assumption was that "Divine and Human justice have a
                    common measure," and he proposed to devote himself to law and politics in an effort to
                    arrive at a defensible concept of right and truth,"<hi rend="sup">30</hi> Whatever
                    conclusions he reached on such matters as temperance and slavery, thereafter, were based not on
                    deliberate deductions from religious premises, but on the results of personal observation and
                    reflection on what he read in law and elsewhere.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The facts seem to indicate, in spite of what is set forth above, that Lincoln never entirely outgrew
                    the religious influences of his boyhood. Much that he had seen in the faith of his parents and
                    friends was undeniably genuine. Although lacking in capacity for conventional piety, Lincoln himself
                    was not an irreligious man. His mind retained certain elements of harmless superstition, accompanied
                    by faith in a kind of fatalism or supernatural guidance not wholly unlike the predestinarian tenets
                    of Elder Harper of the Little Pigeon Church. Herndon says that Lincoln was fond of quoting the
                    words: "There's a divinity that shapes our ends, roughhew <list type="footnotes">

                    take immediate action to effect emancipation of the slaves, Lincoln is reported to have replied as
                    follows:</p>
            <p>I hope that it will not be irreverent for me to say that if it is probable that God would reveal his
                    will to others on a point so connected with my duty, it might be supposed that he would reveal it
                    directly to me…. Whatever shall appear to be God's will, I shall do.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lincoln retained certain negative carry-overs from his boyhood experience as well. The church of his
                    youth had been too void of perspective, too much concerned with futile theological bickerings to be
                    able to contain the inquiring spirit of the young man. Religious considerations seemed to lead into
                    narrower and ever more exclusive channels. On the other hand, public affairs afforded a road to
                    horizons which extended far beyond the fringe of low-lying clay hills of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spencer</settlement>
                    </placeName> county. To those who are seriously interested in Lincoln's attitude toward the
                    churches of his day, the following statement from him will probably be the most satisfying:</p>
            <p>I have never united myself to any church, because I have found difficulty in giving my assent,
                    without mental reservation, to the long complicated statements of Christian doctrines which
                    characterize their Articles of Belief and Confessions of Faith. When any church will inscribe over
                    its altar, as its sole qualification for membership, … the saviour's condensed
                    statement of both Law and Gospel, ‘Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,
                    and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbor as thyself,’ that church
                    will I join with all my heart and with all my soul.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>

            </byline>
            <p>An observant traveler in Europe, especially in its rural districts, may occasionally have paused in a
                    stroll to decipher a quaint and pleasing inscription in the gable or over the door of a dwelling
                    house; or, it may have been on a shield or a tablet underneath a little niche or canopy sheltering a
                    statue of the Madonna or of a Saint.</p>
            <p>As to contents, these inscriptions, at times, are indicative of the hospitable spirit, but more
                    frequently of the deep religious faith of those who had them placed. As to form, they are in popular
                    verse, at times taking liberty with prosody as well as with grammar and with spelling.</p>
            <p>Aside from the cases here to be reported, the writer has not met with such inscriptions in our
                    country. He does not have in mind the inscriptions on public buildings, nor commemorative tablets on
                    historic buildings, nor the "Dine-Wine-Dance" variety of places of amusement; nor
                    is he thinking of the slogans of commercial establishments, such as the possibly misleading
                    advertising boast of a hardware store—"If you're looking for a nut, we
                    have it." Still less is the writer here concerned with the abuse of a Scripture text that
                    he saw somewhere painted in large letters on a barn or stable of a large sheep farm. The owner had
                    used for himself the words with which Jesus, speaking figuratively, made St. Peter the Shepherd of
                    His Church, "Feed my sheep." The stock-raiser responsible for putting these sacred
                    words on his stable may not have intended any irreverence, but someone, pointing to this inscription
                    when driving past on the highway, remarked to the writer, "It is almost
                    blasphemous." The only inscriptions here to be dealt with are those on dwelling houses.</p>
            <p>The writer has found two such inscriptions in southern Indiana. Of these, the second only is to be
                    dealt with in detail both by reason of its unique character and because of its value for local
                    history.</p>
            <p>In the northeastern corner of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, a farmer has painted on the outside of the door the Latin words, <hi rend="i">Ora et Labora</hi> (Pray and Work). These words, the motto of the monks of St. Benedict, which
                    are expressive of a well balanced Christian life, are very appropriately placed <pb n="32" id="VAA4025-037-1-038"/> on or in any home or workshop. This farmer became acquainted with that
                    motto probably through his contact with the nearby Benedictine Abbey at St. Meinrad.</p>
            <p>In the southeastern corner of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dubois County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in section thirty-five of township three south, range four west, about two
                    miles east of the interesting town of Ferdinand, which in the spring of 1940 celebrated the
                    hundredth anniversary of its foundation, there is a farm now owned by Raymond Werne. On this farm
                    there stands an old stone house in which Mr. Werne and his family live. This house, about forty by
                    twenty-six feet, has two stories and a two-story porch along its whole front; the frame lean-to
                    along its whole rear is a later addition. The walls of the house are of sandstone, partly picked up
                    in the fields and small creeks, partly quarried from the outcrop of layers of excellent building and
                    ornamental sandstone found all through that country. Over the window on the west side is a lintel
                    with a smoothed face four feet long and eleven inches high. On the full length and height of this
                    lintel, there is chiseled a German inscription of four lines, though the letters are of the English
                    cursive type.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The capital letters are three inches high; the small letters are
                    one inch and three quarters. Linguistically and orthographically, the inscription is deficient in
                    several ways, as is apparent from the following faithful reproduction, but it breathes an edifying
                    religious spirit and a socially noble relationship between employers and employees: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Also three children born to them are recorded. "Gehrt" is the popular "for
                    short" in these parts for Gerhard. The same census records a Henry Heembrok. It is to be
                    noted expressly that the letter "M" which in the inscription precedes his family
                    name is not the initial of his Christian name but of his trade. A very old man at Ferdinand, of whom
                    the writer inquired about Henry Heembrok's trade, answered at once that Henry was
                        "<hi rend="i">ein Maurer</hi>" (a Mason). Similarly the "S"
                    before Kwante (<hi rend="i">Quante</hi>) is the initial letter of "<hi rend="i">Schreiner</hi>" (carpenter). Franz Quante is still remembered as a good carpenter. Thus
                    were perpetuated not only the names of those who with their money had. the house erected, but also
                    of those who contributed the skilled work of their honorable trades. Employers and employees may
                    well meet fraternally on the common grounds of the noble sentiments expressed in the verses joining
                    the two, proprietors and handicraftsmen, in this inscription.</p>
            <p>An uncritical glance at the number "5" in "1858" has resulted
                    repeatedly in the reading of this figure as "3", but a careful examination reveals
                    beyond doubt that it is a "5" and that the dating on this inscription is August 7,
                    1858. The reading "1838" is excluded also upon historical data. No German-American
                    settled in or around the location of the Eversmann place prior to 1840.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            <p>Thomas Riley Marshall was a native of <placeName>

                    </placeName> on March 14, 1854, the son of a country doctor. His education was obtained in the North <placeName>

                    </placeName> College from which he was graduated in 1873. He studied law in the office of Walter
                    Olds, afterwards a justice of the Indiana supreme court. A year later he was admitted to the <placeName>

                    to be recognized as one of the best lawyers of northern Indiana. His services were in great demand
                    and he was employed in many of the most important cases that came before the courts of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Whitley</region>
                    </placeName>, Allen and Koscuisko counties. It was when he was engaged in a trial at <placeName>

                            March issue of last year. In a letter to the <hi rend="i">Editor,</hi> Mr. Bartholomew, who
                            was personally acquainted with Mr. Marshall, included a passage which is worth quoting here:
                            "One thing in particular [about Marshall] always impressed me and that is that he
                            did not consider himself great. When he was holding the second highest office in the nation
                            he did not hold himself any higher than when he was a country lawyer. In 1914, when he was
                            Vice-President, he came to <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
                            </placeName> to make a speech. Several of us called on him at the old Hotel Hascall. We sat
                            down and chatted with him a while and I would have defied any one who was a stranger to all
                            of us to pick out the vice-president."</item>

                    <pb n="36" id="VAA4025-037-1-042"/> to the national House of Representatives in 1892, serving a
                    single term. Later, P. H. Clugston joined them and the firm of Marshall, McNagny and Clugston became
                    one of the most widely known in Northern Indiana. The firm name was painted on the office window and
                    remained there long after Mr. Marshall had left <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> City. It became one of the landmarks of the place and the people then looked upon it
                    with a feeling akin to reverence.</p>
            <p>From the day of his admission to the bar until his nomination for governor in the summer of 1908,
                    Marshall applied himself exclusively to his profession. He never dabbled in outside matters as so
                    many attorneys do. He believed that lawyers who engaged in selling stocks and bonds, or in
                    organizing corporations, or in any other outside activities dishonored their profession.</p>
            <p>The life of a lawyer who confines himself to his profession is comparatively uneventful. A good share
                    of such an attorney's time is spent in his office in the preparation of his cases. No
                    matter how thorough a knowledge he may have of the law, he is not satisfied until he has mastered
                    every detail which has to do with the particular case in which he is engaged. Often it becomes
                    necessary for him to spend many hours and even days looking up authorities, or studying decisions of
                    both the lower and higher courts. He is not satisfied until he has exhausted every resource that
                    might help him to give the best possible service to his client. When it comes to the actual trial he
                    must exercise the utmost vigilance in order that opposing counsel may not gain an unfair advantage.
                    Much of this work is extremely prosaic, but that does not abate in the least the devotion of a good
                    lawyer to his cause. For more than twenty years, Marshall was thus employed with no promise of
                    anything different for the rest of his life. Not until his party began casting about for somebody to
                    lead it in the campaign of 1908 were there any indications that his activities would be any
                    different in the future.</p>
            <p>For twelve years, the Republicans had held undisputed control of the state. They had elected three
                    governors in succession, something that had not been done by any party for a half century, that is,
                    since Democrats had elected Whitcomb, Wright and Williard. There seemed to be a growing
                    dissatisfaction on the part of the people and an apparent <pb n="37" id="VAA4025-037-1-043"/> desire
                    for a change in the state administration. Besides, the Republican governor, J. Frank Hanly, had
                    pursued a course which was anything but favorable to the welfare of his party. The situation at the
                    end of the twelve years of Republican rule and the prospects for Democratic success have never been
                    more felicitously stated than in the following excerpt from John B. Stoll: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Political favors at times are extended under peculiar circumstances. Occasionally they come
                            from sources least expected or suspected. Such an experience was had by the Democracy in the
                            year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and eight. And the favor came from a man who has
                            yet to utter a single sentence favorable to or kindly of the Democratic party. For years and
                            years, he took infinite delight in hurling fiery anathemas at the party in which he
                            absolutely could see no good and which he affected to regard as wholly and hopelessly bad.
                            By forcing his party to take a step it did not want to take at that unpropitious time, and
                            by making most vicious attacks upon public officials chosen by the same ballots that made
                            him Governor of this commonwealth, he [J. Frank Hanly] so completely disorganized and
                            disrupted the Republican party of Indiana that the most important part of its State ticket
                            was defeated outright and the remainder thereof saved by a scratch.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>As early as 1907, believing that the signs of the times were more favorable for the Democracy than
                    they had been for more than a decade, party leaders began to cast about to discover the best man to
                    head the state ticket in 1908. While Mr. and Mrs. Marshall were spending their summer vacation in
                    the pine forests of northern <placeName>

                    correspondents of Indiana and now a member of the lower House of Congress from the <placeName>

                    his hands and had dared to assert that I would make a good Democratic candidate for
                    governor." Andy Monyihan, at that time editor of the Fort <placeName>

                            had searched in vain for anything in my life that distinguished me from the common run of
                            men, so they had ventured into the field of fiction, had written and had printed an
                            eight-page pamphlet reviewing the history of the Marshal family from the time of the flood
                            down to the year 1907. If there was a distinguished soul in all the long line who had borne
                            that name that had not contributed more or less blood to my veins, they had never heard of
                            him. I read the pamphlet and asked them what they were going to do with it. They told me I
                            was now a full-fledged candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor, and that they
                            were going to send it out to all the counties in the state. I told them very frankly that I
                            could not let my wife read it and ever again look her in the face; while, like the ordinary
                            married man, I had frequently done a good job of lying to her I could not see those lies in
                            print, bound in a pamphlet, and let her have a copy to pull on me when 1 did not measure up
                            to the standard of that most delightful fiction. I ascertained the price they had paid for
                            this little Indiana romance, charged myself with it on the books (for I did not have money
                            enough to pay the bill) and turned it over to the janitor to use in firing the furnace.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>Marshall's law partner, William F. McNagny, remonstrated with Marshall, saying that he was
                    unknown outside of two or three northern counties and that he could not possibly be nominated unless
                    he was given some publicity, adding that the chances against him were a hundred to one. However,
                    Marshall refused to follow Mr. McNagny's advice and went contrary to all the rules that
                    usually govern candidates for public office. He accepted invitations to several Bryan
                    dollar-banquets along with other candidates, but, further than that, he did nothing in the interest
                    of his candidacy. His friends in his own congressional district, the old twelfth district, rallied
                    around him and their delegation was solid for him, except that one delegate, who had not spoken to
                    him for over ten years because of some difficulty over a lawsuit in the settlement of an estate,
                    opposed him. Some of Mr. Marshall's friends proposed to go to that man and try to persuade
                    him to stay at home and send his alternate. They said Marshall's chances were anything but
                    promising and if a delegate from his own county were to oppose him the outlook would be a great deal
                    worse. To this proposition, Marshall gave an emphatic "No." He declared that he
                    believed in representative government; that the man had been regularly chosen as a delegate and that
                    he had a perfect right to vote <list type="footnotes">

                    Mr. Marshall's modest headquarters at the Grand hotel, extended his hand, said he would
                    like to return to the friendly relations of years past and offered to do all that he could in the
                    interest of Mr. Marshall's candidacy. He also asserted that if anybody had tried to induce
                    him to stay at home he would have spent a thousand dollars to get every enemy that Mr. Marshall had
                    to attend the convention and make every effort to defeat him. This was one instance which showed
                    that it pays to be absolutely square even in politics, although there are a great many people who do
                    not appear to think so.</p>
            <p>Six names were presented to the convention: L. Ert Slack, Rev. Thomas H. Kuhn, Carleton B. McCulloch,
                    Charles G. Conn, Samuel M. Ralston and Thomas R. Marshall. It soon became apparent that it would be
                    a three cornered contest, the real contestants being Slack, Ralston and Marshall. On the fourth
                    ballot, Slack was in the lead with 580 votes. He had been gaining steadily from the first when he
                    had only 278. Ralston had gone from 344 on the first, when he led the other candidates, to 453 on
                    the fourth, 127 less than Slack. Marshall was still third in the race, having 312 votes, only 102
                    more than on the first ballot. Kuhn and McCulloch had dropped out, and <placeName>

                        <p>The Slack delegation went wild, and then something happened to jar them. Ralston was on his
                            feet, gesturing for silence. The applause stopped suddenly. Ralston was as white as a sheet
                            of paper, and his hands trembled visibly as he said: "There seems to be
                            considerable doubt as to the desirability of my nomination. In that case I have something to
                            say to you. I do not wish the nomination if all do not think it would help the party, and
                            therefore I ask that I be allowed to withdraw." Marshall was nominated on the fifth

                        <p>The choice of the democracy of the state for its standard bearer fell upon the man who of all
                            the list of candidates would best serve the people and the state. He is the best expression
                            of the intelligence, the honor, the rectitude of life, the practical wisdom needed in an
                            executive and which the public has a right to expect of its governor. Mr. Marshall is a
                            lawyer of distinction, acquainted by profession with the requirements for making legislation
                            effective. It is a mistaken notion that a governor should not be a lawyer. Of all men
                            executive officers of the state should be fully versed in law that they may avoid blunders
                            in suggestion and errors in efforts to enforce. Mr. Marshall is a man of clean record, a
                            conservative but progressive citizen, a man of high personal character, an orator of ability
                            and convincing power. The democracy did well in its ultimate selection of a candidate for
                            governor.</p>

                    </placeName> in 1914, Marshall referred to the convention of 1908 in his own quaint style, saying
                    that while Sam Ralston and Ert Slack were fighting over the nomination, he "grabbed it and
                    ran out of Tomlinson hall with it." He confessed that he had always felt a little ashamed
                    of it and was glad that Ralston was nominated and elected as his successor and would like to see
                    Slack become Ralston's successor.</p>
            <p>A hotly contested campaign followed the state convention of 1908. For the first time in sixteen
                    years, Democrats were thoroughly united. This was largely due to Mr. Marshall's
                    conciliatory attitude toward all factions. He made a vigorous campaign. His speeches were unique. In
                    fact, they were so different from ordinary campaign speeches that the managers called him into
                    headquarters and told him that his was no way to campaign. He continued in his own way. He began his
                    speeches by saying that he was the Democratic candidate for governor of Indiana—candidate
                    of no faction <list type="footnotes">

                    promises out and owed nobody anything except good will. He told his hearers that he had a good law
                    practice and so far as he was individually concerned he did not care whether he was elected or not,
                    but, if citizens were interested in Democratic principles, he was soliciting their votes for the
                    party and not for himself.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>He said other things that startled the old time leaders, even causing them to think that the battle
                    was lost, but they were mistaken. One example is enough to show that he was not afraid to speak his
                    mind freely when he believed that the occasion required it. He learned that a certain religious
                    organization was being asked to have all of its preachers fight him, which many of them did. Instead
                    of trying to curry their favor he simply told them that they were called to preach the gospel and
                    not to beat a bass drum in a Republican procession.</p>
            <p>The outcome of the campaign, as everybody knows, was that Tom Marshall was elected governor of
                    Indiana. He set about to give the people a business administration. He was determined that the
                    affairs of the state should be managed efficiently and with due regard to economy. One of the
                    measures which he proposed was the creation of a state board of accounts whose duty it should be to
                    examine the financial records of all public officers, from those of the state down to the townships.
                    This put an end to much of the graft which had been going on for years in many local units
                    throughout the state. Steps were also taken immediately to reduce the huge debt which his
                    administration had inherited. So great was the success of this policy that when his successor went
                    out of office the debt had been wiped out altogether.</p>
            <p>The matter of pardoning and paroling prisoners in the state penal institutions is one that gives a
                    governor a great deal of trouble and anxiety and Mr. Marshall was no exception. A great many cases
                    were brought before him and he endeavored to judge each on its merits. A careful examination of each
                    one was made so that, if possible, there should be no mistake—that no deserving one
                    should be refused a pardon and no undeserving convict granted one. In each instance, when favorable
                    action was taken, a parole was first <list type="footnotes">

                    Occasionally, one who was paroled had to be sent back to prison but there were only a few who were
                    not eventually pardoned and given a chance to become useful citizens. Several times Mr. Marshall had
                    to deal with strikes. In each instance, he was able to bring about a settlement without calling out
                    the militia, but he did order out the militia to stop race track gambling in <placeName>

            <p>The story of Marshall's election as vice-president in 1912 and of his eight years of service
                    in that office is a part of the country's history. That term of service included one of the
                    most trying periods that this nation has ever known, the period of the World War. He was the first
                    vice-president in almost a hundred years to serve two full terms with the same president. He was one
                    of the most popular vice-presidents the country has ever had. One of the traits which contributed
                    toward his popularity was his sense of humor. He carried with him to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> the ability to see the ludicrous side of serious questions, particularly those of a
                    controversial nature which are always liable to stir up lasting antagonisms. With a humorous remark,
                    or a story, he often brought about good feeling where enmity might have resulted. Few national
                    characters since Abraham Lincoln have equaled him as a story teller or in the faculty of relieving a
                    strain with a humorous remark. However, he was not all humor. He could be serious on serious
                    occasions. Quite a number of times it became necessary for him to represent the President at notable
                    public meetings, when the President's duties called him elsewhere. At no time did he ever
                    disappoint those who listened to him.</p>
            <p>Tom Marshall was preëminently a religious man. He was a faithful member of the
                    Presbyterian church and accepted its doctrines without any reservations whatever. He never was
                    afraid to stand up for religion or to defend it when it was assailed. During all of the years that
                    he lived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> City, he was one of the pillars of the Presbyterian church there and a regular
                    attendant at its services. When he went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> as governor of Indiana, he identified himself with the First Presbyterian Church of the
                    capital city and during his four years there he taught the men's class in the Sunday
                    School. While he was vice president, he attended the church of his choice in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, <pb n="43" id="VAA4025-037-1-049"/> and when he returned to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> at the end of eight years, he resumed his work as a Sunday School teacher. In an
                    address to the men's brotherhood, he said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I have come back to Indiana having learned just one thing and that is that there never will
                            be a great man except one who consecrates himself to God, to his country and to the cause of
                            humanity. It is not necessary that his standing be high. The humble may be this man.</p>
                    </quote> This was said after eight years' daily contact with those whom the world calls
                    great.</p>
            <p>Next to his reverence for the Christian religion was his reverence for law and order. He had the
                    highest ideals of the law and of the legal profession. He had the utmost contempt for those who
                    resort to all kinds of tricks to gain their ends. He took his oath as a lawyer seriously and lived
                    up to the teaching that the lawyer is an officer of the court upon whose shoulders rests some of the
                    responsibility for the administration of justice.</p>
            <p>That he appreciated and held at its full value American citizenship is evidenced by unpretentious
                    demeanor throughout his career from his youth and young manhood, as one of the most successful
                    lawyers in Indiana, as governor of a great state and as the occupant of the vice presidency. His
                    estimate of citizenship in our republic is summed up in the first paragraph of his valedictory
                    address delivered on March 4, 1921, on leaving the vice-presidential chair: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    might be together. They never were away from each other at any time except when he was attending to
                    professional or official business.</p>
            <p>Scarcely any more fitting close to this article can be made than to quote Marshall's tribute
                    to the pioneers and their log cabins for he revered both to the end of his life. This tribute
                    deserves a place among the English classics: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>At sight of an old log cabin fifty years slip from my shoulders like a worn-out vesture. I
                            see a sweet faced old lady. She tells me how, in the early twenties of the last century, she
                            rode horseback, with a baby in her arms, from old <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                            </placeName> to the wilds of Indiana, and how at the end of six weeks she dismounted and
                            entered a log cabin, built in the primeval forest. I hear her tell of the wide fire place,
                            the swaying crane and a boy laboriously striving by the flickering firelight to get a little
                            knowledge. Over and over she tells me the trials, the struggles and the triumphs of the
                            pioneer days. She speaks with pleasure of the progress which the state has made; and yet,
                            boy though I was when this vision was a reality, I thought I heard an undertone of sadness
                            as she told me of passing through the morning-glory bedecked door of the old log cabin to
                            their new brick home. She had a sweet, happy ending for her life, rounded out as it was by
                            love and contentment. She did not sneer at the new ways nor feel that the world was awry,
                            but I could tell that young life, young love and a large hope in a log cabin were to her far
                            preferable to listlessness with luxury, hopelessness with plenty and love-lack with
                            prosperity. A rounded life is a pleasant past, a contented present and a hopeful future.
                            Such a life this gray-haired lady, my grandmother, lived.</p>
                        <p>The log cabin has almost disappeared. Let us hope the pioneer still lives, for when he
                            passes, civilization decays. In cabin or in palace, he is always a pioneer who looks upon
                            himself as part of a world-wide, age-old plan; who feels that he may make or mar all time;
                            who looks with unabashed eye on life's struggles; who works toward the
                            accomplishment of good purposes with unflagging zeal; and who sits at eventide at home,
                            content, with wife and love.</p>
                        <p>Dear old log cabin of the days agone. From out your dismantled door may there come to us the
                            spirit of the early pioneer, breathing courage, enthusiasm, patriotism, loyalty to God and
                            man, upon the newer frocked and better dressed pioneers of today. And as we breathe these
                            blessings may our hearts thrill, our muscles stiffen and our ears hear the trumpet call of
                            duty and endeavor.</p>

            <p>A preliminary survey of manuscripts housed in the Library of the Workingmen's Institute in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> has recently been completed by the Indiana Historical Records Survey as the inaugural
                    activity of a program to discover and list all manuscripts located in Indiana libraries and other
                    depositories.</p>
            <p>A member of the staff of the Historical Records Survey, one of the Professional and Service Division
                    projects of the Work Projects Administration, has estimated that there are 14,000 pieces in the
                    manuscript collection maintained by the library of the Workingmen's Institute. For purposes
                    of survey, manuscripts were defined as "private papers in unofficial custody as
                    distinguished from public records in official custody." Thus manuscripts in this sense
                    consist largely of letters, personal papers, old business records, notebooks, and the like, and
                    exclude printed material, church archives, or current business records.</p>
            <p>The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> manuscripts were divided arbitrarily by the Survey into five collections and
                    information was gathered concerning the housing, history, contents, quantity, cataloguing and
                    accessibility of each collection and concerning the depository as a whole. This information,
                    together with similar facts from other manuscript depositories, is to appear in a volume, <hi rend="i">Guide to Depositories of Manuscripts in the <placeName>
                            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                        </placeName>—Indiana,</hi> a publication of the Work Projects Administration. Similar
                    volumes of the series have already been published for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>

                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, while those for eight other states have been approved for publication. In addition,
                    the nation-wide Survey has prepared nearly forty check lists, guides, and calendars for individual
                    manuscript collections or depositories.</p>
            <p>Generally considered as part of the Library's "Special Collection," the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> manuscripts deal principally with the history of the town since 1814, and, together
                    with other items in the collection, treat of the founding, growth, and development of the Rappite
                    and Owenite communities, adding the story of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> through the years that have passed since the period of these experiments. With the <pb n="46" id="VAA4025-037-1-052"/> advice and cooperation of Miss Louise M. Husband, Librarian of
                    the Workingmen's Institute, the Survey found the approximate total of manuscripts to be
                    forty-six bound volumes, ten portfolios, ten notebooks and eight bundles of letters. In addition,
                    there are 1,000 separate letters, miscellaneous pamphlets, drawings, and maps, and the 10,000 cards
                    of the local history card files.</p>
            <p>The collection is open to research workers of mature years who come recommended and notify the
                    Librarian in advance. Researchers work under the supervision of the Librarian and desired material
                    is supplied from the collections, although limited access to manuscript material is sometimes
                    granted to well-qualified research workers. Only one bibliographical key to the manuscripts has been
                    published, the <hi rend="i">List of Books and Pamphlets in a Special Collection in the Library of
                        the Workingmen's Institute, <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                        </placeName>, Ind.,</hi> which was compiled and annotated by Rena Reese in March, 1909. This
                    pamphlet has been brought up to date by a typewritten and handwritten addendum maintained by the
                    Library. The publication of the proposed manuscript guide by the Historical Records Survey will
                    inform research workers in advance what they may expect to find at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, as well as at the several college, university, public, museum, and historical society
                    libraries in Indiana. Thus the scholar can carefully plan his search for source material, and the
                    libraries will be relieved of the duty of conferring with research workers seeking information not
                    in the collections.</p>
            <p>Physically, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> manuscripts are housed in file cases, boxes, a safe, and on sixty-five feet of shelving
                    at various places on the first floor of the library building. This two-story structure, erected in
                    1893, is brick with stone trim, has masonry walls and wood floors throughout, and is not fireproof.
                    It is hoped to add a fireproof addition to house valuable items in the special collection when
                    conditions permit. The library building also houses the 29,000 bound volumes and files of
                    periodicals of the Institute's Library on the first floor and basement, and a museum and
                    art gallery on the second floor.</p>
            <p>Founded in 1838 as one of the many workingmen's institutes provided by William Maclure, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> Library is the only remaining one of the group. Its manuscript <pb n="47" id="VAA4025-037-1-053"/>collections have been built up through the years by gift and purchase,
                    and the organization will buy from any source at "reasonable" prices manuscripts
                    concerning <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> history. The library will neither sell nor exchange items, but will accept conditional
                    deposits and loans.</p>
            <p>About four-fifths of the present <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> manuscript collection has been arranged, the letters alphabetically by author, and the
                    local history card-files alphabetically by author, subject, and title. Only one-twentieth of the
                    manuscript material has been catalogued, and but sixty-three cards list single manuscript items
                    exclusively. These cards are included in the special collection catalogue, which also lists books
                    and pamphlets on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> history. In general, enough information can be obtained from the few cards to determine
                    whether the document is typed or handwritten. Also, the name of the author, the title and date are
                    furnished. Occasionally a card carries a brief biography of the author or a summary of the content
                    of the manuscript, and frequently the conditions of acquisition are stated. There are no cross
                    references on the cards, nor is the location of the manuscript in the library stated, but the
                    intimate knowledge of the librarian concerning manuscript material makes location a relatively easy
                    matter. No manuscripts circulate, but there is a limited amount of desk space for users.</p>
            <p>Outstanding among the manuscripts are records dealing with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> social, business, and religious organizations since 1845; music for square dances
                    written in the eighteen-thirties and 'forties; letters from Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi;
                    business papers of Robert Dale Owen covering the years 1829 to 1869; papers of other members of the
                    Owen family; notes, newspaper clippings, and biographical information on residents, buildings,
                    organizations, and institutions of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> since 1908; the correspondence of William Maclure, Thomas Say, Josiah <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> and others prominent in the early history of the town (some of the letters are as early
                    as 1821); and the letters of Young Ewing Allison.</p>
            <p>The Special Collection itself covers the dates 1821 to 1938, with the greatest concentration of
                    materials from 1830 to 1840. More than forty volumes, in addition to bundles of letters, notebooks,
                    pamphlets, drawings and maps make up this collection which, with the exception of a few typed copies
                        <pb n="48" id="VAA4025-037-1-054"/> of letters, is all original material. Here are the early
                    records of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Posey County</region>
                    </placeName> organizations. Typical are the minutes of the Adelphi boys' debating society,
                    which flourished before the Civil War; the account books of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> Fire Engine and Hook and Ladder Company from 1848 to 1872; financial records of a plank
                    road built between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mt. Vernon</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the eighteen-fifties; the constitution of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> Society for Mutual Improvement; and many library records since 1838. Other manuscripts
                    in the Special Collection include the original 1825 deed of George Rapp and associates to Robert
                    Owen; local family genealogies; correspondence of David Dale Owen and Robert Dale Owen concerning
                    the Smithsonian Institute; photostats of the minutes of the Preliminary Society of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> Community of Equality, 1826; a charge account and register book of the Owen Community
                    tavern of the same period; old maps; the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> Methodist Episcopal Church papers, 1845 to date; and an occasional public record, such
                    as a justice of the peace docket of 1840.</p>
            <p>An estimated one thousand letters, all originals, throw additional light on their authors and on
                    their ideas concerning the "New Moral World" which was to rise on the banks of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> more than a century ago. The collection includes letters by William Amphlett, C. A.
                    Leseur, Madame Fretageot to William Maclure concerning the school at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, William Maclure, Thomas Say, Josiah Warren, and others. Additional correspondence of
                    early Owen community members is in the Julian Owen Collection, presented by the
                    collector—a son of Robert Dale Owen—to his granddaughter, Mrs. Grace Zaring
                    Stone, who in turn gave them to her aunt, Miss Eleanor Cooper (Julian Owen's stepdaughter),
                    who loaned the papers to the Library. The seventy-five piece collection includes: business papers;
                    correspondence; <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> real estate records of Robert Dale Owen; the will of Frances Wright, made in 1831;
                    letters and business papers of Richard Owen; early land deeds; house plans; and a map descriptive of
                    Rappite occupancy of the community. The subject and date of each piece in the Julian Owen Collection
                    was listed and filed with the collection in 1934 by Professor Paul H. Douglas, University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and Miss Eleanor Pancoast.</p>
            <pb n="49" id="VAA4025-037-1-055"/>
            <p>Another collection to be summarized in the proposed manuscript depository guide of the Indiana
                    Historical Records Survey is the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> local history card files, an estimated 10,000 handwritten and typed cards containing a
                    cumulative history of all phases of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> life. To many of the cards are attached newspaper clippings supplementing the
                    handwritten information. Apparently no important fact relating to the people, buildings,
                    organizations, events, or daily life of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> is too small to escape some mention in the card files, a truly astounding collection of
                    miscellany. The cards themselves are cross referenced to books, pamphlets, newspapers and other
                    sources in the library. This collection is all the more remarkable because it has been assembled
                    entirely by the library staff, and was begun in 1908 by Nora C. Fretageot and since continued by the
                    present librarian, Louise M. Husband.</p>
            <p>The Young Ewing Allison Collection of about fifteen letters and six other pieces was assembled and
                    loaned to the depository by the present librarian. It contains letters, a typed autobiography, a
                    bibliography of Mr. Allison's works prepared by the Librarian of the John Crerar Library, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>; and other information by or about Mr. Allison, a former <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> journalist, author, and poet.</p>
            <p>Since undertaking the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> manuscript survey, members of the Work Projects Administration staff assigned to the
                    Indiana Historical Records Survey have been establishing contacts with custodians of other
                    manuscript depositories in an attempt to make the proposed manuscript guide as complete and accurate
                    as possible. The Indiana Survey is sponsored by the Indiana Historical Bureau in the hope that an
                    enumeration of the holdings of manuscript depositories in a published guide will be of service to
                    all who have occasion to use the source material listed.</p>

                    generations, and come down to Samuel Barker the ancestor of the Indiana branch of my family. He
                    fought in the revolutionary war in Captain Rogers' company and married Betsy Rogers, the

                        <region type="county">Vanderburgh</region>
                    </placeName> County, where he settled on a quarter section in the Lower Bayou, ten miles below <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. There he engaged in farming and flat-boating farm produce and live-stock to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in which business he was quite successful. Before the end of 1832, he bought the first
                    lot sold by Abner Luce in the new town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Whether or not this lot was bought with the intention of making his home in the town
                    is not known. His widow, who was the executrix of the estate, sold the lot in the year 1844. He was
                    commissioner of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vanderburgh</region>
                    </placeName> County for several terms. He (William Rogers Barker) died on July 19, 1837, when about
                    sixty-one years of age. His widow, Anna Maria, died on July 24, 1851. Their children were: William
                    Luther Barker (my father), Elizabeth Ann, Thomas Rogers, Saphronia, Matilda Smith, John Wesley,
                    Harriet Newell and James Osgood Andrews. After the death of their father the two older brothers,
                    William L. and Samuel, then aged nineteen and seventeen years, respectively, attempted to continue
                    the flat-boat business, but after a few trips gave it up. On one of these trips to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>, one evening when they were getting ready to tie up for the night, at Bayou la Fourche,
                    Samuel took the skiff and ran out ahead of the boat with the tow line which he wound around a tree.
                    As the boat drew the line taut and came to a stop, a Spaniard rushed up to Samuel flourishing a big
                    knife in his face and excitedly abusing him in Spanish. Uncle Samuel was badly frightened until my
                    father yelled at the Spaniard: <pb n="52" id="VAA4025-037-1-058"/> "You touch that boy and
                    I'll blow your head off." There he stood on the boat with the big rifle that they
                    always carried, ready to make good his threat. The Spaniard left with much muttering and angry
                    gesturing. Then my father asked Samuel to throw off the rope, as the mulberry tree to which he had
                    lashed the boat was regarded by Spaniards as a sacred tree.</p>
            <p>Samuel Barker remained on the farm and kept the family together. He was successful and added many
                    acres to the original landholdings. He was a Methodist and was several times elected on the
                    Republican ticket to the office of County Commissioner of <placeName>

                    </placeName> was named in his honor. His wife's maiden name was Mary King. She was of one
                    of the old families in the Lower Bayou. Their children were Francis A. and Anna. Anna married a
                    Doctor Bell and died leaving two sons, namely Robert and Samuel. The latter was in recent years the
                    Auditor of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vanderburgh</region>

                    </placeName>. He still owns (1932) the Old Bayou farm at Barker's landing where the
                    old-time steamboats took on the cordwood that the boys chopped and exchanged for wheat flour in
                    order that the family could have white bread on Sundays. The old Barker farmhouse, built in 1832, is
                    still standing with the high-water marks of the <placeName>

                    a move up stairs for the family in the house and the livestock in the barn. Communication between
                    the house and barn, and with Henderson, <placeName>

                    floors and an accumulation of driftwood on the farm lands.</p>
            <p>My cousin Francis has two daughters, Mabel and Frances. In conversation with my 'uncle
                    Samuel, after the death of my father, he spoke of his mother as a city-bred, southern lady. The
                    snakes, lizards, spiders and thousand-legged worms incident to her new home in the wilds of the
                    Lower Bayou, were a constant terror to her. In my boyhood home, we had some china jars of about one
                    gallon capacity. My father said that his mother's brothers were sea captains and that they
                    brought these jars filled with preserves to his mother from <placeName>

            <p>My father, William Luther Barker, the oldest son of William Rogers Barker, studied medicine with a
                    Doctor Walker of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>

                    medicine in April, 1846. His early practice covered territory with a radius of fifteen to twenty
                    miles about this village and his professional visits were usually made on horseback over
                    bridle-paths leading from the main roads. He was a charter member of the Mason, Oddfellows, and
                    Knights of Pythias lodges of Boonville, and regimental surgeon of the One Hundred Twentieth Regiment
                    of Indiana volunteers with the rank of Major in the Civil War. His horse fell with him at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>
                    </placeName>, causing a rupture and necessitating his retirement from the service. He was an
                    old-line Whig, then a staunch Republican at a time when that party was largely in the minority in
                    his vicinity. He was drafted by his party to fill up the ticket at times, and although he ran far
                    ahead of his party ticket, he was twice defeated for state representative and once for state
                    senator. He was not a hidebound Republican as he voted for his friends among all classes, and his
                    attachments were not controlled by political, social or religious ties. At various times, he was a
                    member of the board of town trustees of Boonville. He married Mary J. Williams, a native of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, in the year 1847. He died in 1883. His widow (my mother) survived him twenty-two
                    years. Their eldest child (my sister), Katie E. Barker, married Zachary T. Brackenridge in the year
                    1872. Mr. Brackenridge was a practicing attorney of Boonville, and the nephew of John A.
                    Brackenridge, a famous lawyer. Katie's husband died in the year 1874, and in 1878 she
                    married John L. Taylor, another lawyer. She died in the year 1908, leaving no children.</p>
            <p>I was the only son<hi rend="sup">2</hi> of Doctor William Luther Barker. My business career began
                    back in 1870 with a clerkship in the grocery store of Johnson &amp; Brackenridge in Boonville.

                    grocery store. A year or two after I became a grocery clerk, I was employed by the Boonville Banking
                    Company, of which my father was president, and later I worked for its successor, the Boonville
                    National Bank. I served nine years in both, in all. During the following years until 1895, my
                    business was in real estate, insurance and abstracts of title. In the latter year, I organized the
                    People's Bank of Boonville, and was its president for eighteen years. Since 1914, my
                    business has been that of an abstractor of titles. The work involves a combination of local history
                    and real estate law which I enjoy, and I can take a vacation at any time that I wish. My political
                    activities have been limited to a term or two as town treasurer, some fifty years ago, and the
                    chairmanship of the Republican County Executive Committee during the years 1894 and 1895.</p>
            <p>Boonville's first daily newspaper, <hi rend="i">The Daily Newsboy,</hi> was printed at the
                        <hi rend="i">Standard</hi> office in 1876. James A. Hemenway was the business manager and
                    tramped off the daily issue on the old Gordon press. I was the editor-in-chief and type-setter. We
                    worked hard night and day for the seventy-five dollars our week's work netted the business,
                    and some of our advertisers still owe us. After his return from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> in 1882, Hemenway was employed in helping me compile my set of abstract books, then he
                    was deputy county Auditor under Union Bethel for a time. Still later, he went into the law office of
                    my brother-in-law and became his partner. His political career began with his election as
                    prosecuting attorney of the local judicial circuit, in the year 1886.</p>
            <p>As a "joiner" I have done fairly well. The Masonic order was my first venture in
                    fraternal societies. This was in the year 1878, and I have received all the degrees of ancient
                    York-rite Masonry, and have been duly elected to preside as worshipful master of the Blue Lodge and
                    high priest of the chapter of Royal Arch Masons. I am also the representative of the Grand Lodge of <placeName>

                    </placeName> near the Grand Lodge of Indiana. The local Knights of Pythias chapter was always on a
                    boom or in a depression, and I have presided as <pb n="55" id="VAA4025-037-1-061"/> Chancellor
                    Commander under both conditions. I enjoy the good fellowship of the Benevolent and Protective Order

                    getting a leave of absence from his position as Treasurer of the Peoples Trust &amp; Savings
                    Bank of Boonville while he served in the <placeName>

                    now old men. Two great-grandsons, of William Rogers Barker, my sons just mentioned, now past middle
                    age, are probably the terminals of my Barker family line after nearly three hundred years. A modern
                    calculation gives the chance for a man's sons having sons of their own as one in eight, so
                    I conclude we have done well enough to have survived three centuries on this continent.</p>

            <head>At DePauw Fifty Years Ago</head>
            <byline>H<hi rend="sc">OMER</hi> E<hi rend="sc">ILER</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>On September 1, 1889, I entered DePauw University, enrolling as a Freshman, under the principalship
                    of Dr. Thomas J. Bassett, a gentleman well-beloved by the entire student body and faculty. At the
                    beginning of that fall semester, DePauw was without a President. Dr. Alexander Martin was
                    temporarily in charge of the institution. I remember this well because of what happened soon after
                    my entrance. At the time of the fall Methodist Conference, Dr. John P. D. John was elected
                    President, and, as word came to the Campus that he was to arrive on an afternoon train, the student
                    body, <hi rend="i">en masse,</hi> were at the depot to meet him, with all the pent-up welcoming
                    enthusiasm possible to a student body of that day.</p>
            <p>The one item that has forever fixed this event in my memory, was the preparations to escort the new
                    President to the campus. A rope some hundred feet or more in length was attached to a carriage
                    carrying the official welcoming party made up of Dr. Martin, Dr. John B. DeMotte, and Dr. Philip E.
                    Baker. I believe that the venerable Bishop Thomas Bowman, and possibly others, also sat in the
                    carriage with the new President. The student body grasped the rope and drew the party to Meharry
                    Hall where a preliminary oration and an informal induction into the new office was held. I can yet,
                    after half a century, behold the scene, hear the shouting of class yells and recall the general
                    pandemonium that attended this scene. Later came the extraordinary, prepared-for, official induction
                    into office. The old fashioned stage was filled to capacity with faculty, dignitaries of Methodism,
                    and the state and city officials who attended. In my judgment formed at that time, and after fifty
                    years unchanged, DePauw can date her rebirth and rise to a place of leadership among the
                    universities of standing as beginning with the inauguration of that leader <hi rend="i">par
                        excellence,</hi> Dr. John P. D. John.</p>
            <p>I remember him, as well as if yesterday because of many peculiar and incidental personal traits
                    marking this wonderful man. If he had any hairs on his head, I believe they could have been counted.
                    This, with his exceeding high forehead and well rounded face, presented a picture never to be <pb n="58" id="VAA4025-037-1-064"/> erased from memory. Unfortunately, the twitchings of his facial
                    muscles added a mark to aid the memory. All these physical peculiarities, however, were overshadowed
                    by his knowledge and gifted insight into several phases of learning, and the fact that he was
                    approachable by the greenest of "preps" or the most "noble" of
                    seniors. I wonder how many remember the lecture, to my mind, his greatest, "Did God Make
                    man or man make God?" This became a subject of nation-wide interest.</p>
            <p>DePauw has added to her laurels in all the fifty years since because of the Presidency of Dr. John,
                    and, not to speak critically, subsequent presidents have had to go far to surpass the ideal
                    standards of University leadership set by the leader who served DePauw as President from 1889 to
                    1895.</p>
            <p>As I look back upon my days in college, there are many faculty members connected with old DePauw
                    whose lives and outstanding personalities are ever present to my memory. I feel that the first was
                    the officially designated Chancellor, Bishop Thomas Bowman. Extremely small in stature, he ripened
                    at the age of about ninety years, at which time he had as keen an intellect as hosts of men of much
                    younger years. His was a welcome figure at devotionals, and at many social gatherings.</p>
            <p>Another man of prestige was Dr. John Clarke Ridpath, an ever welcome visitor to the DePauw campus. He
                    and Dr. Bassett are easily remembered because of their similarity in physique, and their long
                    beards, so uncommon in this day. One associates with Dr. Bassett several of his
                    colleagues—Dr. Wilbur A. Ayers, Dr. Harry L. Beals, Dr. John B. De-Motte, along with a
                    Miss Dixon and others who brought a great reputation to the Preparatory Department because of their
                    chosen work as teachers.</p>
            <p>My memory likewise takes me back to the humor of student life at DePauw and the delight of the
                    students in playing pranks—pranks from which no occasion or person was ever immune. More
                    especially do I recall a story concerning the beloved Dr. John B. DeMotte that relates to his
                    freshman days. As the story goes, it was the occasion of a morning chapel exercise, and a noted
                    Bishop was presiding. Previously, the ingenious young DeMotte had hollowed. out a space in the <hi rend="i">Bible</hi> and filled it with mice. When the Bishop opened the <hi rend="i">Bible</hi>
                    for the reading, away the mice scampered <pb n="59" id="VAA4025-037-1-065"/> over the pulpit and
                    stage. One can easily imagine the hilarity that ensued. Needless to say, the devotional exercises
                    were considerably devoid of devotion on that occasion.</p>
            <p>Another alumnus of DePauw, prominent during my years at that institution and well deserving of
                    mention, was the esteemed Albert J. Beveridge, who, during his lifetime, gained great honor and
                    prestige both for himself and his Alma Mater. In 1889, talk was still prevalent of the laurels he
                    had won for himself and for DePauw in debate and oratory in competition with men of other
                    institutions as well as in national contests.</p>
            <p>Nothing is of more vivid memory than the recollection of my associates in the Theological Club. In
                    the absence of historical record, the names of several remain with me, not only because of their
                    fellowship in student days, but also because of their particular prominence in later years. One such
                    of these was Dr. Lemuel H. Murlin, a man of many notable achievements. At one time he was the
                    President of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> University, later (1925–1928) serving as the President of DePauw, his <hi rend="i">Alma Mater.</hi> Then there was a Mr. Cook and a Mr. Bennett, of whom I have but hazy
                    memories, who became prominent missionaries in the Orient. There were also two Japanese students,
                    Masuco and Takasugi, who gained considerable honor because of their proficiency in mathematics and
                    physics.</p>
            <p>There was another outstanding student of my day in DePauw with whom I have kept in touch during all
                    the fifty years since, because of her self-sacrifice in devoting her life to foreign missionary work
                    in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName>. I refer to Miss Lillie Dexter Green, who prepared for that special work and was sent
                    to Delhi, <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName>, where she has labored continuously since in missionary work. In recent years, she has
                    had charge of the Methodist College work in the city of Delhi, where she still remains, zealous as
                    ever in her missionary calling.</p>
            <p>From a religious point of view, old DePauw reflected both the name and the spirit of Old Asbury
                    University, continuing like its predecessor the practice of its founder's precepts.
                    Religion pervaded the atmosphere everywhere. The daily chapel exercise was a fixed institution, and
                    merits or de-merits were a recognized practice. Weekly prayer meetings were of a voluntary nature,
                    but well attended. I speak <pb n="60" id="VAA4025-037-1-066"/> of this item because I remember so
                    well the revival interest started in one of the meetings, which I attended. This revival interest
                    soon spread through the entire student body, until Meharry Hall was filled nightly, and the record
                    reveals that never in the history of the institution was there such a genuine, old-fashioned revival
                    as during that winter of 1889–1890. I have no doubt that scores of alumni still living
                    today trace their religious birth to the revival of that year.</p>
            <p>While reminiscing about chapel exercises, I recall that it was compulsory to attend the Sunday
                    afternoon devotions in Meharry Hall. Of course, this was irksome to many young students, who even in
                    that day preferred their Sunday afternoons free for recreation and do-as-you-like amusements. Gossip
                    connected with this Sunday afternoon compulsory attendance relates that one exceptionally bold
                    student expressed himself in verse that soon became a classic among the student body. One reason for
                    the distaste of students for chapel was the long-winded discourses and lectures on religious
                    subjects by Bishops, Doctors of Divinity and Doctors of Law, that were not interesting to the
                    general student body. What brought forth the wonderful string of verses by Mr. M. D. Fulkerson of
                    the class of 1893, was a particular lecture with the subject: "Does Supernatural
                    Inspiration Imply Infallibility?"</p>
            <p>The years have sped on swiftly and the importance of the events of that now distant day when I was a
                    student have been overshadowed by the magnitude of subsequent events. The conditions of a half
                    century ago live again only in one's of memory.</p>

            <p>The Membership Committee of the Indiana Historical Society represents a specialized, but not an
                    exclusive, interest in bringing into the Society as many well-qualified members as possible. The
                    only qualifications required for membership are "good character," interest in
                    history (however mild it may be), and payment of the two-dollar annual membership fee. All of these
                    are assumed to follow sponsorship or proposal for membership by a member of the Society. Election is
                    automatic when the person proposed by a member sends payment for his annual dues to the secretary.</p>
            <p>All members of the Society are urged to nominate for membership persons who they think would be
                    interested in the Society and would promote its activities. What might be called the normal
                    membership of the Society for the last ten or fifteen years has been in the neighborhood of a
                    thousand. If each of these members should suggest one or more names to the Secretary and explain the
                    prerequisites for membership to the person or persons suggested, the Society would undoubtedly grow
                    to a normal membership of two or three thousand. In this way the entire Society constitutes, or
                    should constitute, the membership committee. To bring this about is one of the objects of the
                    specialized Membership Committee. The committee also is at least a little more active than other
                    members of the Society in looking around for prospective members—in this, it has been
                    successful in the past in adding many valuable members. The Committee for 1941 consists of Robert G.

            <p>This Committee is the connecting link between the men and women interested in history, but not
                    engaged in teaching, and professional historians engaged in making students historically minded and
                    in training them in historical work. The importance of this connection can scarcely be exaggerated.
                    Historical societies need the guidance of professional historians and the colleges and universities
                    need contacts with the outside world to keep their faculties from becoming academic and even
                    pedantic. The object of history is to give an understanding of society and its institutions.
                    Progress on this line requires the co-operation of an intelligent people—amateurs and
                    professionals. The Society is fortunate in having a good representation in most of the institutions
                    of higher learning in the state.</p>
            <p>Another service of the College Committee is in bringing together occasionally college and university
                    teachers of history and political science so they become acquainted each with the work of the
                    others. This has perceptibly developed an effective as well as pleasant <hi rend="i">esprit de
                        corps.</hi> In time, it may even bring about a co-ordination of historical work in Indiana
                    colleges and universities which will provide original research in all important phases of the
                    state's history.</p>
            <p>The Committee on Prehistory and Indiana History began active participation in archaeological work

                    </placeName>, May 16, 1927, at which conference, H. C. Shetrone, Curator of the Museum of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Archaeological and Historical Society, spoke about the work of that society and the
                    possibilities of similar work in Indiana. During the preceding year, the Historical <pb n="63" id="VAA4025-037-1-069"/> Bureau had sponsored the excavation of the Albee Mound in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Sullivan County</region>
                    </placeName> under the direction of J. Arthur MacLean, then director of the John Herron Art Museum
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In 1927, the archaeological section of the Society was organized; from then on it took
                    an increasingly large part in the archaeological work carried on in the state. The state Historical
                    Bureau contributed financial support through 1934 and published reports of archaeological work until
                    1937 when the Society became able to assume entire responsibility for archaeological work in the
                    state. Since that time, the Society has conducted excavations and surveys in different parts of the
                    state, including excavation of the Nowlin Mound in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dearborn</region>
                    </placeName> County, and surveys in Allen, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName>, and Clark counties. Since 1938, Glenn A. Black, Field Director of Archaeology for the
                    Indiana Historical Society, has been directing a W.P.A. project, sponsored by the Historical Bureau
                    and the Historical Society, for the excavation of the Angel Mounds group near <placeName>

                    occasional publications upon American anthropology, archaeology, and allied subjects. Volume I with

                        anniversary of Sarah Lincoln's birth. She was Abraham Lincoln's sister, a
                        tragic little figure lifted from oblivion by the fame of her brother. She was born on February
                        10, 1807. She married Aaron Grigsby. She died on January 20, 1828. About thirty years ago, her
                        grave was discovered after being unmarked for probably fifty years. On June 20, 1916, the state
                        of Indiana completed the erection of a monument over her grave at Pigeon Creek Baptist Cemetery,
                        about a mile from the grave of her mother, Nancy Hanks Lincoln. At the dedication of this

                    </placeName> have been intimately associated with the growth and glory of Indiana. The first of
                    these outstanding men, William Henry Harrison, was Governor of the Territory and a hero at <placeName>

                    </placeName>; Harrison's messages and military papers have been collected and ably edited;
                    his Indiana years have been properly stressed. A second occupant of the White House, Abraham
                    Lincoln, spent a quarter of his life on Indiana soil; Indiana's influence on Lincoln has
                    been traced and retraced by seasoned scholars. Another President, Benjamin Harrison, was an Indiana
                    citizen in 1888 at the time of his triumph over Grover <placeName>

            <p>In marked contrast to these eminent leaders, the fourth member of this distinguished company is but
                    rarely associated with Indiana. Yet, both before and during the crucial War of 1812, he rendered
                    important service to the people of Indiana as an officer in the Regular Army, stationed in Indiana
                    Territory. He helped Governor Harrison defend Indiana settlers against the Indian forces of the
                    one-eyed Prophet, brother of Tecumseh. At old Fort Harrison, north of the present city of <placeName>

                    record of Captain and Brevet Major Zachary Taylor, who later at Monterey and Buena Vista captured
                    the imaginations of Americans and became the twelfth president of the Republic.</p>

            <p>In the letter of July 6, 1811, which Captain Taylor addressed to Secretary of War William Eustis,<hi rend="sup">3</hi> the young officer referred to an "unfortunate occurrence that took

                    personal feud between the two Kentuckians.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Army records indicate that Posey was
                    ultimately cleared of guilt in the tragic affair. Indeed, he won promotion to the rank of

                    its natural effect on the morale of the private soldiers. Floyd ordered Taylor to the Post for the

                        <p>Owing to the unfortunate occurrence that took place at this post on the 24 of June I
                                    received an order from Maj. G.R.C. Floyd bearing date <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> (Ky) July 1st 1811 to repair to this place and take command of the
                                    Garrison. Agreeable to which order I arrived here on the 9<hi rend="i">th</hi> Inst
                                    and on the 10<hi rend="i">th</hi> assumed the command of the Post, I have had an
                                    inventory taken of all the public property on hand a copy of which is hereby
                                    enclosed. Owing to the defenceless state of the Garrison and the alarm of the
                                    inhabitance [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] of this Territory from the appearance of
                                    hostilities from the Indians &amp; there being no M Agent here I have thought
                                    proper to appoint Lieut J. W. Albright<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Asst M Agent in order
                                    that the Garrison may be furnished with the necessary artickles [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] for puting it in the best possible state of defence. I think if the
                                    appointment of Lieut. Albright should be confirmed there will be no cause of
                                    complaint so long as he may continue to act. We are extreamly in want of a number of
                                    artickles I found neither Paper Quils Inkpowder or wafers here on my arrival. The
                                    men here are extreamly in want of Clothing so much so that if they were ordered to
                                    march to any place at this time they must do so nearly naked unless they could be
                                    furnished befor they moved. There is more than half there Summer Clotheing due them
                                    at this time. I would have furnished an acct. of the clotheing due the men here but

            <p>Four months after the penning of this letter, Governor Harrison defeated the Indians in the bloody
                    battle of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>—the battle which established Harrison's reputation for courageous
                    generalship and helped to elect him to the presidency over Martin Van Buren in 1840. Contrary to his
                    anticipation, Captain Taylor was not with Harrison at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>. The War Department ordered him first to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                    </placeName> and then to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. However, he returned to Indiana Territory in the spring of 1812 and was in charge of
                    Fort Harrison in June of that year when the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> declared war against powerful Great Britain.</p>
            <p>Taylor's heroic defense of Fort Harrison in September, 1812, was followed by promotion to
                    the grade of Brevet Major and by his participation in two comparatively unimportant expeditions led
                    by General Hopkins, one into <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Territory and the other into what is now northwestern Indiana. Taylor spent a sick
                    leave near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, after which he was entrusted with superintending the Regular Army's

                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. The letter of April 14, 1813, the original of which is in the possession of the writer
                    of this comment, was written by Taylor on April 14, 1813<hi rend="sup">9</hi> (Taylor erroneously
                    dated it "1812"). It was addressed to Brigadier General Thomas Humphrey

                     <hi rend="sup">9</hi> In April, 1812, Taylor was a Captain. He did not become Brevet Major
                            until after the defense of Fort Harrison. The fact that this letter is signed "Z.
                            Taylor, Maj.", therefore is conclusive proof that it could not have been written in
                            April, 1812. In the spring of 1813, Taylor was stationed at <placeName>

                        <salute>Sir,</salute>
                        <p>I arrived at this place, about 9 days since to take charge of the recruiting
                                    district, that has been assigned me. There are two officers employed in recruiting
                                    in the district, one in this and the other in the adjoining Territory. I have only
                                    returns from the officer here, who has forwarded you weekly returns and I presume
                                    the other officer has not enlisted a single man. Of cours you are able to judge of
                                    the prospect there is for raising the number of men contemplated in the district.
                                    Nor is our bad success to be wondered at when we take into view, the small number of
                                    inhabitance [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] in those two Territories, and the number of
                                    ranging companies that are authorized to be raised in them. And the prefferrence
                                    that is given to that kind of service If the 200 men were to be raised as Rangers I
                                    have no doubt but they could be enlisted in eight or ten days nor can it be expected
                                    that men will enlist for five years, or during the war, when they know they will be
                                    subject to strict discipline, and made to do the duties of a soldier, at eight

            <p>Between April 14, 1813, and the termination of the War, Zachary Taylor passed many months in Indiana
                    Territory. His wife, <hi rend="i">née</hi> Margaret Mackall Smith, whom he had married in
                    1810, joined him at <placeName>

                    </placeName>. And there his second daughter was born on March 6, 1814. The baby's parents
                    named her Sarah Knox Taylor—<hi rend="i">Sarah</hi> for her paternal grandmother, <hi rend="i"> Knox </hi> in honor of the fort commanded by her father. In the fullness of time Miss
                    Taylor was to develop into a gay and gracious young lady, the belle of Fort Crawford in what would

                    he was contemplating setting out again for less crowded regions.</p>

                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>, Little Turtle, Wilkinson, Harrison, Tecumseh, Point Saible, Gurdon Hubbard, and many

                    children, grandchildren, dogs, and buffalo. (The white bull was never found and killed.)</p>
            <p>The book is magnificent in its conception and scope, and excellent in its general execution. The
                    story and characters keep well within the bounds of historical accuracy. The dialogue is
                    good—at times spiced with realistic bits from soldier and hunter—but now and
                    then a sentence combines perfect modern English with pioneer words and phrases in a manner a bit
                    noticeable. Admittedly this is a hard thing to handle.</p>
            <p>The central theme, "This land is ours," permeates the book—the
                    Indian's belief as well as the white man's. One of the best things in the book is
                    the treatment of the real wilderness-man's attitude towards the Indian, a far truer picture
                    than that usually portrayed by the expression, "The only good Indian is a dead
                    Indian." The author is almost Parkman-like in his attention to topography and
                    naturalist-like <pb n="73" id="VAA4025-037-1-079"/>in his background of flora and fauna. Characters
                    are adequate, though not outstanding. There are no powerful villains and no overwhelming heroes. The
                    author's characters are in keeping with the book and life. The book is hardly dramatic
                    enough to film into a "super-colossal," horrifying enough to be a thriller, or
                    heart-rending enough to be a best seller. Rather it is a saga of a family and a region.</p>
            <p>A casual reading by someone familiar with the period would have eliminated some of the minor
                    irritations. Pioneers did not clear land by starting forest fires (how the senior <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName> stopped his fires is not clear); nor did they sow wheat in newly-cleared
                    land—if they wanted wheat. Invariably the rifle is loaded in a most amazing way:
                    "Methodically he rammed in the ball and spilled the powder down the muzzle and into the
                    pan." This isn't a slip, it's a ritual. A smooth-bore musket becomes a
                    rifle (283–4). People travel up the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> in "broadhorns," chop limbs with mattocks, and do other interesting
                    things. Better editing would have taken care of the "none were" habit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">This Land is Ours</hi> is recommended not only for the historical student, but for the
                    reader who enjoys a good story and at the same time may like to refresh his mind on some of the
                    struggles by which the heart of our continent became what it is.</p>

                    for he not only helped save one of the first of modern democracies from its autocratic enemies, but
                    he has furnished others with practical and effective patterns of military administration and tactics
                    which, if <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-037-1-080"/> properly applied, may do the same for them. A military
                    engineer who began his career under the Old Régime, he mastered the science of
                    fortification as developed by the great Vauban and others of the older school, and earned wide
                    recognition from his contemporaries through his writings as well as actual conduct of operations in
                    the revolutionary period. Yet, he did not believe that a defensive policy or heavy permanent
                    fortifications were or could be the best protection for the French Republic against the coalition of
                    its enemies. How unfortunate that the military and political leaders of the Third Republic did not
                    follow his constant policy that "tactics must ever make the greatest use of mass action and
                    the offensive" (the <hi rend="i">blitzkrieg</hi>) rather than trusting to the Maginot line!</p>
            <p>To Carnot, a member of the Committee of Public Safety after the adoption of conscription in August
                    1793, fell the monumental task of organizing the Republic's new military establishment. A
                    million barefoot, ragged and hungry conscripts had to be and were rapidly clothed, fed, and
                    equipped—transformed into trained veterans to drive the invading Allied armies from the
                    soil of <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>. Carnot created the new machine, beginning with the army training camp system, procured
                    and administered the equipment and the commissioned personnel, while at the same time he directed to
                    a great extent the operations of the new armies, sometimes in the field and more often from the
                    capital where he was burdened with a multitude of other tasks. The reader is astounded at the
                    prodigious labor required of and performed by the Organizer of Victory in those critical months of
                    1793–'95, all carried out in harmony with the democratic and republican spirit
                    of the times, with little resort to the terrorist measures of the political leaders of that frenzied
                    period. Conscription was in the beginning a democratic military policy, publicly so recognized and
                    adopted, and its results justified its application.</p>
            <p>Under the Empire, Carnot had almost no career in the active military service, largely because of his
                    own choice. He was a true republican, devoted to the principles of the Revolution and to the
                    Republic. These facts undoubtedly influenced Napoleon in his decision to dispense with
                    Carnot's services after the defeat of the Second Coalition. Curiously, however, in the
                    epilogue of the Hundred Days, he rallied <pb n="75" id="VAA4025-037-1-081"/> to the assistance of
                    Bonaparte and received as his reward permanent exile by the restored Bourbons. Ironically, it was
                    the Germans who gave him asylum and they seem to have learned some profitable lessons from this
                    Republican patriot.</p>
            <p>The book is marred by carelessness in proof-reading, especially in the spelling of French names and
                    in the use of accent marks. Such defects do not, however, detract from the great value of Professor
                    Dupre's contribution to the historical literature of the French Revolutionary era.
                    Carnot's biography should find many readers in these hectic times so much like those which <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, 1940. Pp. 379, $1.00.</head>
            <p>This folksong collection consists of one hundred ballads and songs found in Southern Indiana,
                    including many old English and Scottish ballads, and tunes for fourteen of them. As this part of the
                    State was settled more than a century ago, and largely from the South, the collection makes a lively
                    and valuable addition to the store of related folksong surviving in the more isolated regions of the
                    South.</p>
            <p>In a brief introduction, Mr. Brewster recounts his four-year experience in working out this project,
                    from the time when as a teacher of English Literature in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oakland City</settlement>
                    </placeName> High School, Indiana, he added to an English and Scottish ballad assignment a search
                    for fragments of song titles and opening lines known to students' older relatives. After
                    this hesitant beginning had brought in half a dozen valuable songs, including two corrupt but
                    recognizable Child ballads, he extended his search by arousing the interest of other students, of
                    certain Indiana newspapers, and of the Southern Indiana McGuffey Club, until he had gathered some
                    three hundred texts (exclusive of variants) and almost one hundred tunes, from which he has selected
                    the present delightful collection. Mr. Brewster's prefixes to the various songs bring the
                    reader into the very circle of these hundreds of enthusiastic songcatchers who have made this
                    Indiana collection possible.</p>
            <p>Since the people of Southern Indiana are largely of <pb n="76" id="VAA4025-037-1-082"/> Anglo-Saxon
                    stock, this collection does not contain foreign folksongs, nor negro songs, though a few have been
                    touched by negro influence. While ballad-singing has died out in Indiana as an active recreation,
                    yet enough people still cling to the traditional old songs to have preserved them in most
                    interesting forms.</p>
            <p>Besides an invaluable bibliography for the collection as a whole, the author has prefixed to each
                    ballad a very convenient introduction locating similar English, Scottish, and American texts, and
                    occasionally continental texts. Also, the author has added greatly to the interest and value of his
                    book by publishing variant forms when he has found them in his field, variants that frequently show
                    wide differences, as the traditional <hi rend="i">C</hi> form and the Americanized <hi rend="i">B</hi> version of "The Frog Went a-Courting." His excellent index of titles,
                    first lines, and tunes adds much to this well-edited volume.</p>
            <p>Twenty-seven of these Indiana texts are variants of English and Scottish ballads collected by Francis
                    James Child, and they include such favorites as "The Two Sisters," "Lord
                    Randal," "Lord Thomas and Fair Annet," "Lord Lovel,"
                    "Sweet Trinity," "Sir Hugh," and, of course, "Barbara
                    Allen," of which he gives thirteen different Indiana texts.</p>
            <p>Among the American songs are four picturesque versions of "Old Dan Tucker," two of
                    "Simon Slick," four stanzas of "Raccoon's Got a Bushy
                    Tail," a text of "Little Nell of Narragansett Bay," and one ballad which
                    is a genuine Indiana product, "Fuller and Warren," gory with a murder and a
                    hanging, besides "<placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                    </placeName> Mountain," and "Fair Charlotte."</p>
            <p>In the old sailor song, "The Pretty Mohea" still lives in a cocoanut grove, though
                    in one version (where her name has become <hi rend="i">Mauhee</hi>) she invites her friend to her
                        <hi rend="i">wigwam.</hi> In "One Morning in May" the forsaken damsel sings
                    the charming line:</p>
            <p>"That the wild geese may see me as they are passing by."</p>
            <p>In "The Frog Went a-Courting" appear such naturalized forms as jaybird, tick,
                    June-bug, red flea, black flea, and even little fice dog, in addition to such American delectables
                    as black-eyed peas, hominy, and dogwood tea. The old English carol, "The Twelve Days of
                    Christmas," on the other hand, keeps its gifts as foreign as the twelve days themselves <pb n="77" id="VAA4025-037-1-083"/> including twelve lions roaring (in Indiana!), ten lords praying,
                    four collie birds, and three French hens.</p>
            <p>The most intriguing phrases appear in "Lasso Town for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>," <hi rend="i">satchel</hi> for <hi rend="i">psalter, catfoot broth</hi>
                    perhaps for <hi rend="i">catnip broth,</hi> and blood that comes "tinkling o'er my
                    knee." In the old song, "The Drowsy Sleeper," the lover says:</p>
            <p>"From <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>

            </p>
            <p>I've crossed the ocean for your sake."</p>
            <p>This piques the imagination.</p>
            <p>The "Derby Ram" is given in two variants which show the exuberant American
                    imagination feeding fat on the tall tales. Among the numerous nonsense rhymes,
                    "Keemo-Kimo" in three choice variants is the most nonsensical.</p>
            <p>But there is no end to the delights of this charming collection. It is a valuable addition to the
                    scholarship of folklore; better still, it is the essence of literature, a refreshment to the fagged
                    spirit.</p>

            <p>General Taylor, one of the several Americans to become President of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> because of his military fame, has waited long for a biographer. The present volume does
                    not complete the story, dealing with "Old Rough and Ready" only to the termination
                    of his services to his country as a soldier. A second volume which is to cover the political
                    campaign of 1848, the preliminaries of that contest and Taylor's period as President is in
                    the offing. The biographer of General Taylor, Holman Hamilton, is an able young journalist of Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>. Like many other men of his calling, he has undertaken to write history. Not only has
                    much history been written by journalists, but it seems to have been easier for publishers to sell
                    the output of journalistic writers than the works of historians trained in the <hi rend="i">seminars</hi> of the Universities. It became apparent a few years ago that technically prepared
                    writers of history and biography must pay more attention to style, while journalists must do more
                    careful and extensive research. Fortunately, both schools of writers are now making desperate
                    efforts to overcome their handicaps and with considerable success. Certainly, <pb n="78" id="VAA4025-037-1-084"/> any reader will discover that Mr. Hamilton has not only produced an
                    engaging narrative but every page attests the fact that he labored long with the sources before he
                    was willing to write the life of Zachary Taylor.</p>
            <p>About half of the present volume is devoted to the life of Taylor before the Mexican War, and the
                    remainder covers the comparatively short period from 1844 to the end of 1847. Because of the
                    importance of the General's Mexican War activities this is a fair division. To write the
                    first half of the story was very difficult. The scene shifted often and over and over the author was
                    obliged to re-set the stage. The geography of many parts of the country had to be studied and
                    elusive documents sought for far and wide. Having undertaken the task, Mr. Hamilton refused to be
                    balked by any obstacle until his work was done and well done.</p>
            <p>When he had covered the long years that involved so many parts of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, the author took up the work of tracing the activities of General Taylor during the
                    Mexican War. The theater of action did not change so much but the physical factors must be studied
                    more intensively and the multitude of activities handled more critically. From Palo Alto to Buena
                    Vista, the narrative is colorful, detailed and dramatic. Handling raw troops under hard conditions
                    in a foreign country against larger forces tested the prowess of Old Rough and Ready. He was not a
                    perfect general, but he made a great name for himself. The climax of his career came at Buena Vista.
                    Greatly outnumbered, not ready, even arriving rather late at the spot where he was so sorely needed,
                    he yet won the battle. The author rises to the occasion in his treatment of this engagement. The
                    circumstances are adequately portrayed. The parts played by Taylor, Jefferson Davis, Santa Anna and
                    others are impartially set forth. One naturally expected more in relation to the Indiana troops
                    engaged, but perhaps this topic will receive more attention in the next volume. There was much said
                    and written about General Taylor's criticism of troops from the Hoosier state, especially
                    in Indiana during the campaign of 1848.</p>
            <p>The reviewer highly commends this first of two volumes on Taylor to Indiana readers. Such readers
                    will be interested to know that there is a special, autographed Indiana edition of the book. Since
                    Taylor was active in so many <pb n="79" id="VAA4025-037-1-085"/> areas of his own country, rose to
                    such great fame in Mexico, became President of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and was withal a most unique and attractive character, the volume should make a very
                    wide appeal. Not only general readers will find it instructive and entertaining, but scholars will
                    also find it useful because of the exhaustive research done by the author.</p>

            <p>In the introductory comment preceding the "Letters to William R. Holloway," edited

                    Collection was deposited in the Indiana State Library where it may now be found." Miss
                    Esther U. McNitt, Chief of the Indiana Division of the Library, states that the Trustees of <placeName>

            </byline>
            <p>There is an old saying that "poets are born and not made." In fact the same maxim
                    may be and has been applied to teachers, preachers, financiers, industrialists, politicians,
                    statesmen, and others, including "suckers." Barnum said of the latter class that
                    one was "born every minute," implying that such a person was born that way and did
                    not get over it. After all, the saying is not very helpful and I shall not apply it to historians.
                    It does, however, seem to fit most persons who prove to be historians, or who, making the attempt,
                    prove that they do not really belong. The old proverb, "You can't make a silk
                    purse out of a sow's ear," may be useful in the discussion. A friend of mine who
                    is a professor of chemistry told me a few years ago that a chemist had actually made a very good
                    silk purse out of a sow's ear, thus disproving the old maxim. However, since no one save an
                    expert could turn the trick, the saying holds good for nearly everyone, and, for me, it means that
                    there are persons who specialize in history or who take up the writing of history who can never
                    become either historical investigators or writers. They were neither born to be historians nor can
                    they be made into historians.</p>
            <p>As to being born a historian, a poet or anything else, it must be admitted, as I once heard a gifted
                    teacher say, that "being born is an old-fashioned way of getting into the world."
                    It is true though that people are born with varying talents and with varying aptitudes, and, given a
                    person with sufficient natural ability, he can usually be vastly benefited by training. An
                    individual with a natural bent for research and historical writing, however strong his mental
                    capacity, can undoubtedly improve with coaching and practice. The born historian, if there be any
                    such, owes it to himself and to those who may read his works to make the most of his gifts. With
                    high capacity and a natural talent for writing, he has an even deeper obligation than persons less
                    favored to subject himself to the best training obtainable.</p>
            <p>It is hard to conceive of one who is a careful investigator and a good writer of history as being
                    without the spirit of <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-037-1-090"/> scholarship. These things seem to go along
                    together. It is possible, nevertheless, for a graduate student in history or an outsider who dabbles
                    in historical writing to go on for a long time with no conception of the true meaning of historical
                    work. To put in the required time, to pass the examinations, to write the thesis—these
                    seem to be, to many candidates for the master's degree, all that can be asked of them.
                    Likewise to those who write history as a hobby, there often comes no feeling of responsibility and
                    no sense of obligation to be accurate and unbiased. They are often out to prove something, not to
                    search for the truth. Happily, there are both graduate students and amateur historians who are
                    untiring searchers after the facts, who feel that, above everything else, they must discover the
                    truth and who make a real effort to avoid prejudice. Such persons, if they can write well, or if
                    they can be trained or train themselves, to write well are of the salt of the earth.</p>
            <p>I have known candidates who reached the final examination for the doctor's degree with no
                    understanding of the meaning of the process. To them, it was pretty much a matter of residence and
                    credits, just as when they were moving through the grades, the high school and college. As every one
                    knows, there are those who write history, whether self-taught or trained in university <hi rend="i">seminars,</hi> with no reason beyond the desire to write books in order to obtain royalties or
                    get into the public eye, or both. This is not enough. Whether drawn to the work by natural
                    inclination or because of extensive training, or both, there is an ideal that should never be
                    lacking. Those who do research in history should be motivated first and last by a deep desire to
                    discover the truth, to make it available to others, and to combat error. With such desires they will
                    possess or cultivate the patience and skill necessary to thorough work. Those who write history must
                    first of all be willing and able to do the required research, and then they must have no deeper
                    anxiety than to present a truthful account. Other things such as are comprehended in the term
                    literary style are legitimate and highly desirable, but the spirit of scholarship is the primary
                    requisite of the historian.</p>

                    The average motorist speeding along country lanes and byways seldom gives them more than a passing
                    glance, but to the local historian or "family researcher," these burial grounds
                    are storehouses of information. Here, cut in stone and marble, are records usually copied from
                    Bibles many of which have disappeared. The Old Wilson Cemetery, which is situated four miles east of <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> County with an interesting history. Here, buried along with others of his family, lie
                    the remains of Muncietown's first writing teacher, Anderson R. East.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                    There is very little recorded information relative to this man. We first hear of him back in 1832 in
                    Liberty Township. There Asahel Thornburg,<hi rend="sup">3</hi> one of the early landowners in this
                    section, built a small log building for school purposes. In this place Mr. East taught school for
                    two winters, the Thornburg children attending as well as other children of the neighborhood. In
                    1835, he opened his first "Writing School" in the old frame Court House in
                    Muncietown, having from fifteen to twenty pupils at all times. Later, when a small brick schoolhouse
                    was built on east Main Street, he transferred his classes to that building.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> He
                    numbered among his students many of the younger members of the Gilbert, Anthony, Kirby, Jackson,
                    Blount and other representative families of the village. No doubt older persons availed themselves
                    of his "running style" of penmenship, which he offered along with lessons in
                    drawing and painting.</p>

                        <region type="county">Jefferson County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, on April 1, 1832 [?]. He married Mary Buchanan in 1787. One record gives her
                    birth year as 1754, and places the date of her death in 1857. One of these dates is possibly
                    incorrect, since, as they stand, the age would be one hundred three. It is known that George and
                    Mary Benefield and their children, twelve in number, came to Indiana in 1814. One of the sons was
                    George Washington Benefield (1795–1854) who first married Ann Ryker. After her death, he
                    married Margery Van Cleave. The second marriage occurred in 1825. Who were the parents and
                    grandparents of George Benefield? Who were Mary Buchanan's parents, grandparents and
                    great-grandparents?—Mrs. J. C. (Lillian Gwyn) Stimson, 2521 No. 13th St., <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, or near there. This was as early as 1830, probably earlier. The husband died
                    on April 4, 1846, while the wife lived to be over one hundred years of age. Their children were:
                    Nancy (b. March 2, 1801; m. Lambeth Heath, Aug. 13, 1818); Sally (b. June 16, 1803; m. James Davis,

                    1806; m. Jeremiah Heath, March 3, 1825); Jane (b. Dec. 2, 1808; m. Collin Forbes, Jan. 1, 1829);
                    Rebecca (b. Dec. 27, 1810; m. Riley Sarren, Sept. 13, 1827); Esther (b. April 8, 1813; m. William

                    Smith, June 30, 1840; d. April 11, 1846). President Andrew Johnson was, it is claimed, a nephew of
                    Archibald Johnston, being the son of one of the six older brothers of Archibald. The name of this
                    brother was Jacob Johnston. He dropped the "t" from the name. I desire to know the
                    names of the parents of Archibald Johnston and Betsey Booth, with places of birth. I also wish to
                    learn the names and places of birth of the parents of William Forbes (b. Oct. 6, 1807, in
