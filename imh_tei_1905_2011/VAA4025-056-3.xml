            <p>A neglected facet of the history of the settlement of the Old Northwest before the War of 1812
                    concerns the effort to establish a program of educating and civilizing the Indians. Unfortunately,
                    some historians have accepted the "unofficial, &amp; private" letter of
                    February 27, 1803, from Thomas Jefferson to William Henry Harrison as proof that any attempt to
                    civilize the Indians was for the purpose of cheating them out of their lands. Because of its
                    importance to later interpretations of Jefferson's (and Harrison's) Indian policy,
                    the bulk of the President's letter bears repeating here: <text>

                                    to see the good &amp; influential individuals among them run in debt, because we

                                    willing to lop th[em off] by a cession of lands. at our trading houses too we mean

                                    they will consequently retire from the the competition, &amp; we shall thus get
                                    clear of this pest without giving offence or umbrage to the Indians in this way our

            <p>Henry Adams in particular used this letter as proof of Jefferson's perfidy in treating with
                    the Indians. To Adams the tactics suggested by Jefferson would have shocked Jefferson himself as
                    "a method of obtaining the neighboring estate of any Virginia family"; but
                    according to Adams, President Jefferson "not only suggested but vigorously carried out the
                    system toward the Indians."<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>Adams, however, was not an impartial observer and seems to have interpreted Jefferson's
                    statements in the worst possible light. It may be true that Jefferson had the acquisition of the
                    Indian's lands as his goal, but he planned to be "just and liberal." He
                    believed the "decrease of game" would soon render these vast lands
                    "useless" to the Indian. "Motives of pure humanity" required
                    that the Indian be aided in adjusting to a new life.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Jefferson was not the first to advocate a program of this type. Even long-established
                    missions, colleges, and private programs to elevate the Indian had been designed largely to make him
                    a member of American society, to promote peace, etc.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Henry Knox, shortly after
                    becoming the first secretary of war, penned a long recommendation to President Washington that the
                    American people impart their "knowledge of cultivation and the arts to the aboriginals of
                    the country." He recognized difficulties in such a proposal and realized that it would take
                    a long time to carry it out, but to admit that it was impractical or impossible contradicted that
                    favorite eighteenth-century doctrine of the perfectibility of man. The first step would be to
                    "introduce among the Indian tribes a love for exclusive property." Knox believed
                    that it would also be wise to provide the Indians with domestic animals, make presents of medals,
                    gorgets, uniforms, etc., in imitation of the British, and to send missionaries with implements of
                    husbandry. The Secretary of War believed that his plan would serve to attach the Indians to the <placeName>

            <p>Among the Creek and Cherokee much was achieved in the next few years. Jefferson, in his message to
                    Congress on December 8, 1801, reported that the Creek were "acquiring cattle, by every
                    means in their power," and were raising grains and fruits. Indian manufactures were
                    increasing. Instructors in spinning and weaving had set up nine looms, one hundred pairs of cotton
                    cards, and eighty spinning wheels. Jefferson noted some remarkable individual achievements. Three
                    Indian women had clothed a family for two years and had also raised hogs and cattle. One chief had
                    built a loom and two spinning wheels. The production of oil from hickory nuts had grown from a few
                    quarts in 1797 to three hundred gallons, and the oil drew a good price at Mobile and <placeName>

            <p>By the time Jefferson became president, the government had established a precedent of educating and
                    civilizing the Indians where possible. The basic purpose was to teach the women spinning and
                    weaving, the men stock raising and agriculture. The Indian agents were in charge of civilizing their
                    individual tribes or nations and received aid from missionaries, blacksmiths, interpreters, and
                    special assistants. The best statement of this policy is found in the instructions from Secretary of
                    War Henry Dearborn to Return Jonathan Meigs, Indian agent to the Cherokee Nation, dated May 16,
                    1801: <quote rend="blockquote">

                        <p>Your father, the President, has directed me to inform you, that he wishes you to assemble
                            your scattered warriors, and to form towns and villages, in situations best adapted to
                            cultivation; he will cause you to be furnished with horses, cattle, hogs, and implements of
                            husbandry, and will have persons provided to instruct you in the management of them. My
                            children, turn your thoughts seriously to this important object. You know that the game
                            which afforded you subsistence is yearly becoming more scarce, and in a short time you will
                            be left without resource, and your wives and children will in vain ask you for food.</p>
                        <p>
                     <hi rend="i">My Children</hi>, it is very easy for you to avoid this calamity. A great many
                            years ago the white people subsisted as you do now upon the wild beasts of the forest. When
                            those were becoming scarce the Great Spirit communicated to them the method of raising grain
                            for bread, and taught them to bring the ox and the horse under their subjection though they
                            had been as wild as your deer and buffaloe and thus to assist them in cultivating the earth.</p>
                        <p>
                     <hi rend="i">My Children</hi>, you may perhaps think that the plan I have recommended is too
                            difficult to be effected; but you may depend upon it that with the proper exertions on your
                            part there is no doubt of its success. The experiment has been fairly tried with your
                            brothers the Creeks and Cherokees. Many individuals of the former have herds of cattle
                            consisting of some hundreds together with an abundance of corn and vegetables. This has had
                            a most happy effect on their population and all their wigwams are already filled with
                                children.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>

            <p>Wells's career was one of those which could have been found only in a frontier society.
                    Raised among the Indians, he had led a large band of Indians in the massacre of St. Clair's
                    army and had then served with distinction as a scout in the American army under Anthony Wayne.
                    Shortly after the Battle of Fallen Timbers, he returned to the Indians and married the daughter of
                    Little Turtle. His knowledge of the Indians and their great trust in him, as well as his past
                    services to the government, made him the logical choice for the post of Indian agent at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>. What part he and Little Turtle played in the Kirke affair is uncertain, but charges
                    and recriminations flew from all sides, and, in the end, the reputations of both Kirke and Wells
                    were ruined.</p>
            <p>The facts of the case are difficult to sort out, for each side probably exaggerated its claims at the
                    expense of the other. Evidently, on his arrival in the territory, Kirke set out to find Indians

                                    the Indians to continue. Should they see that the Indians would continue the good
                                    work, a school would be established among them. The Quakers also desire to take some

                    be hired to train the other Indians, to attach them to farming, and to induce them to sell their

                    sabotaged by a bitter struggle between Wells and Little Turtle on the one hand, and Johnston and

                    </placeName>. In April, 1808, President Jefferson approved Richard's plan for a
                    coeducational school for poor white children and a few Indians. The Secretary of War promised two to
                    four hundred dollars a year for its support as soon as it should be in operation, the amount to
                    depend on the number of Indians enrolled.<hi rend="sup">66</hi> Richard planned to teach
                    agriculture, trades, and the fundamentals of most branches of learning. Taken as a whole, his views
                    on the subject of civilizing the Indians were the same as the government's except that he
                    intended to train children in schools away from their homes instead of teaching adults in their own

            <p>By November, 1809, the school at <geogName>Spring Hill</geogName> appeared to be well on its way to
                    unqualified success. Richard had equipped a large farmhouse and several outbuildings with the

            <p>Unfortunately governmental bungling and red tape destroyed <geogName>Spring Hill</geogName> and the
                    plans of its founder. The farm was in the hands of the Treasury Department as the result of default
                    on a debt due the government by the original owner. Jefferson, Dearborn, and Secretary of the
                    Treasury Albert Gallatin had reached an agreement that when the farm was placed at auction as
                    required by law, the War Department would bid on it up to the amount of its true value. In addition
                    to Richard, the farm would then be used by two Frenchwomen who wished to conduct a school for Indian
                    girls, by the "practical farmer" employed to teach farming to the Indians, and by
                    the carpenter and blacksmith hired by the government. Since <geogName>Spring Hill</geogName> was the
                    site of Indian encampments when the tribes came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>, it was in an ideal location for bringing its varied services to the attention of the
                    Indians. All these points had to be explained by Jefferson to his successor, James Madison, in a
                    letter in which he argued that the civilized arts taught by the school would "soften,
                    conciliate, &amp; preserve" the Indians. Thus, Jefferson commented, peace could be
                    obtained at the cost of four hundred dollars a year and the price of the farm.<hi rend="sup">70</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The incoming secretary of war, William Eustis, allowed Richard the four hundred dollars but refused

                    so many individuals and governmental departments involved, it is only natural that the plan went

                    </placeName> would have paid had they still been in office. At the same time, Richard was presented
                    with a bill from the Treasury Department for over two hundred dollars in back rent. Richard had not
                    known of that part of the bargain and protested that to pay the bill he would have to sell part of
                    his equipment. He argued that the improvements he had made on the farm were worth far more than the
                    rent payments. So far as that was concerned, those same improvements had been responsible for the
                    high price the farm brought, for a resulting profit for the Treasury, and for the loss of
                    Richard's school.<hi rend="sup">73</hi>

            <p>Though it soon appeared that the judge was dissatisfied with his purchase, neither Father Richard nor
                    the War Department could pay the price he asked and Richard was forced to move. "My present
                    Situation is extremely painfull…. I said to myself: it is then in vain I have worked so
                    hard, travelled so far, and struggled against so many obstacles!"<hi rend="sup">74</hi> But
                    in a letter to Jefferson he said, "I have not given up &amp; I will not give up the
                    design of Instructing lndian children. I am certain that with constancy we shall
                        succeed."<hi rend="sup">75</hi> Unfortunately Richard's hopes and the hopes of
                    all those who thought like him came to nought in the period of deteriorating Indian relations before
                    the War of 1812.</p>
            <p>Whatever the motives of the government between 1800 and 1810, whether to cheat the Indian of his
                    lands or to civilize him and make him one with the American people (and no strong case can be made
                    to support either view), the problems were greater than anyone realized at the time and the means
                    for dealing with them were too feeble for success. Probably the task of educating the Indian would
                    not have been so formidable before the policy of Indian removal to less fertile and more
                    inhospitable lands west of the <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName> was inaugurated, as was proved
                    by the experience with the Cherokee and Creek Indians. In the Old Northwest, land hunger, apathy,
                    personal rivalries, and mounting Indian problems made the experiment impossible. But there were
                    those who tried.</p>

            <p>With more insight than most American policy makers possessed, a British Indian agent, Colonel
                    Alexander McKee, asserted that the Indians "will not quietly give up by negotiation what
                    they have been contending for with their lives since the commencement of these

            <p>Repeatedly during the years from 1792 to 1794 the American olive branch was extended to the Indians.
                    At the same time, however, a determined major military effort was abuilding under Anthony Wayne. If
                    the former failed, the sword would be unsheathed.</p>
            <p>Confident of their success, if it came to a military showdown, the Indians were nevertheless willing
                    to make peace if the Americans met their demands. One of the Indian efforts to this end was a
                    general council held in the summer of 1793 on the lower <geogName>Maumee River</geogName>. William
                    Wells attended this council.</p>
            <p>Wells had been taken captive as a boy of twelve by the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Miami</settlement>
                    </placeName> Indians and was adopted by their chief, Little Turtle. He married a daughter of the
                    chief and lived as an Indian for a number of years. He participated with the Indians in action
                    against Josiah Harmar in 1790 and Arthur St. Clair in 1791. After a visit with his family, he
                    decided to leave the Indians and join the American army. Wells became a scout for Wayne, rendered
                    valuable service in the campaign, and was rather severely wounded in a minor skirmish a few days
                    before the Battle of Fallen Timbers. He also figured in subsequent peace negotiations. Wells later
                    became an Indian agent. He <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The organization of counties and the incorporation of towns was an important function of the Indiana
                    General Assembly in pioneer days. Moreover, such organization and incorporation was as much a part
                    of pioneering as was the building of log cabins, clearing of forests, establishment of grist mills,
                    opening of roads, founding of newspapers, and establishment of churches and schools. Under the
                    Constitution of 1816 the Indiana General Assembly enacted a local or special law for the
                    organization of each county and for the incorporation of each town, with the result that the annual
                    volumes containing the laws were generally cluttered by numerous special laws.</p>
            <p>What is the present area of the city of Anderson was obtained from the Indians by the New Purchase
                    Treaty of 1818.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                    organizing the county considered Andersontown as a possible location for the county seat. Since the
                    commissioners did not decide in favor of Andersontown, however, sessions of the courts were to be
                    held at Pendleton according to the terms of the act establishing the county. Pendleton served as the
                    county seat until 1827, when Andersontown became the county seat. Various changes have been made in
                    the boundaries of the county, before and after 1827, but Anderson (then Andersontown) has remained
                    county seat since that time.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>Andersontown grew slowly, and its population was only 383 by 1850.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> In 1848 its
                    name was shortened to Anderson,<hi rend="sup">4</hi> and the next year the town was incorporated by
                    special act of the general assembly. This act named "John Davis, Esq., P. H. Lemon, Adam
                    Reed, W. G. Atherton, and Brazelton Nowland"<hi rend="sup">5</hi> as trustees of the town,
                    declared Anderson a body politic, and gave the trustees substantial legislative and police
                        powers.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As indicated in the document which follows, the trustees met in 1849, were sworn into office, and
                    began enacting laws, appointing officials, and otherwise establishing town government under the new
                    charter. The record which follows includes minutes of and ordinances passed at early meetings in
                    1849 and 1850. A careful reading of these minutes and ordinances shows that the town organizers gave
                    attention to: the immediate need for revenue from taxes and fees, the problem of restraining
                    livestock from running at large and damaging property, the necessity for removing obstructions from
                    public ways and improving streets and sidewalks, and the question of obtaining persons willing to
                    serve in essential local offices. This document, though brief, affords an interesting glimpse of the
                    beginnings of town government in Anderson following its incorporation by the Indiana General
                    Assembly.</p>

            <p>Published below is a list of affidavits attesting to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay County</region>
                    </placeName> marriages that took place before or during 1852. After the original marriage records
                    were destroyed in the courthouse fire on November 30, 1851, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay County</region>
                    </placeName> marriages prior to that time were re-recorded by affidavit. Since a marriage could not
                    be recorded unless the persons involved arranged for it, the list published here undoubtedly does
                    not include all <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay County</region>
                    </placeName> marriages that occurred by 1852. The original affidavits are recorded in a volume at
                    the County Clerk's Office, <placeName>
                        <country reg="bl">Brazil</country>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. The list given here was compiled from a microfilm copy of the affidavits

            <p>There has long been a need for an historical treatise on the Calumet area of northwestern Indiana.
                    Powell A. Moore, for many years associated with the Indiana University Center in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">East Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, is well qualified to write such a work.</p>
            <p>The Calumet region, defined as the area drained by the Grand Calumet and <geogName>Little Calumet
                        rivers</geogName>, and consisting of the northern halves of Lake and Porter counties, developed
                    slowly; Professor Moore regards it as Indiana's last frontier. He holds that the
                    "formative period" of the Calumet ended in 1933, and he prefers to believe that
                    little of historical consequence has occurred since, at least in terms of departures from
                    established patterns. This contention, in the opinion of the writer, is open to serious question.
                    The politics of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lake County</region>
                    </placeName>, population problems, industrial development, to say nothing of transportation and
                    communication, are all topics with enormous possibilities for scholars interested in the
                    quarter-century after 1933.</p>
            <p>In the Preface, three periods are designated: Indian occupation and haphazard attempts at settlement
                    by whites to 1833; slow, but steady, settlement and development to 1869; industrial growth coupled
                    with rapid increase in population, 1869 to 1933. Once having set up these three periods, however,
                    the author does not clearly distinguish them in the sixteen chapters which follow.</p>
            <p>Approximately the first quarter of the book is devoted to geography, Indian occupation, and the
                    founding of numerous villages in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Porter</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Lake counties. (The chapter entitled "Log Cabin Era, 1816-1852,"
                    pays no heed to the 1833 period boundary.) The next third of the book is concerned with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hammond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Whiting, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">East Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and Gary. Here the emphasis is on the close relationship between industry and urban
                    growth in the Calumet. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hammond</settlement>
                    </placeName> and meat packing, Whiting and petroleum refining, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">East Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Gary and steel—in each case the history is traced carefully, and
                    sometimes includes a mass of detail which seems unnecessary. The last 40 per cent of the work is
                    given over to a topical treatment that deals with population (origins, problems of assimilation),
                    newspapers, education (origins of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Valparaiso</settlement>
                    </placeName> University, the career of William A. Wirt in Gary, and Indiana University's

                        <settlement type="city">East Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>), labor and labor troubles (the Pullman strike, the steel strike of 1919), politics to
                    1933, defiance of Prohibition, and the Great Depression. In connection with the latter topic,
                    Professor Moore carefully describes self-help efforts of cities, townships, and counties which
                    finally had to be replaced by federal relief activities. This data is of value to teachers of recent
                    American history.</p>
            <pb n="250" id="VAA4025-056-3-060"/>
            <p>On the whole, the work lacks balance. It gives the impression that it is a collection of chapters or
                    articles written at different times and for presentation to various types of audiences. Both primary
                    and secondary sources are used; their number is indicative of much painstaking effort. The
                    bibliography is excellent, but most of the materials cited are from the period before 1940.</p>
            <p>Useful for the study of many problems pertaining to Indiana and to the Calumet, in particular, this
                    work's greatest value is in its treatment of the growth of industry in the four largest
                    cities of the Calumet and in its discussion of labor-management relations in certain of the largest
                    companies operating there.</p>

            <p>In <hi rend="i">The Appalachian Frontier</hi> Professor Caruso discusses important chapters or

                    region. After noting the first explorations of the <geogName>Appalachian Mountains</geogName> by
                    Virginians during the seventeenth century, he tells of the coming of the Germans and Scotch-Irish
                    during the eighteenth century. His narrative as well as his maps indicate why and how such
                    settlement generally pressed down the <geogName>Appalachian Valley</geogName>—with
                    vanguards of settlements into tributary valleys and through passes both eastward and

            <p>This volume is an interesting and very readable general account which centers on major high lights
                    and important episodes in the early development of the Appalachian frontier—and some of
                    its western hinterland. Such high lights and episodes stand out in bolder relief than that in which
                    they usually appear in historical writings. Moreover, the importance of the Appalachian frontier is
                    indicated, as is the very great importance of the <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName> frontier, as
                    settlers proceeded westward from the mountains into the foothills and thence into the fertile
                    hinterland farther west. Upperclassmen, graduate students, and general readers can all find much
                    useful material in <hi rend="i">The Appalachian <pb n="251" id="VAA4025-056-3-061"/> Frontier.</hi>
                    Nevertheless, this book is not as rich in factual material as it might be, and Caruso's
                    weighing of his evidence, notably material used from the Draper Collection, is not always as
                    critical as desirable.</p>
            <p>Professor Billington's <hi rend="i">Westward Expansion</hi> which appeared in 1949 was the
                    most detailed history of the American frontier ever published. His new second edition differs from
                    the first in two important aspects. In the first place, the chapter by chapter bibliography has been
                    brought up to date to include numerous articles and books which have appeared within the last
                    decade. This expanded bibliography, like its predecessor, is an annotated one; its ninety-two pages
                    are packed with invaluable suggestions and comments. In the second place, the new edition includes
                    some revision of the text of the previous one to incorporate the most recent findings and viewpoints
                    about the American frontier. In general, however, such revision is of a limited nature—so
                    that one might say that the 1949 text has been "amended" but generally speaking
                    not "revised." Nevertheless, the augmented bibliography and the textual changes
                    combine to make the second edition of <hi rend="i">Westward Expansion</hi> an important and welcome
                    achievement. Professor Billington has established himself as one of the outstanding students of the
                    American frontier, but in the Preface to this new edition he says with candor and humility:
                    "Generations of study are necessary before anything approaching a final history of westward
                    expansion in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> can be written." Reference to Billington's expanded bibliography
                    indicates that articles and books about state and regional topics fortunately continue to make
                    important contributions to various facets of westward expansion.</p>

            <p>This volume on Anthony Wayne is a valuable work on a subject in American history that has too long
                    been slighted. Although this third campaign of the Indian Wars (1790-1795) has with few exceptions
                    become the "forgotten war" in our history texts, it was considered at that time a
                    campaign of great importance in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>' struggle to make a place among the nations of the world. Newspapers, both
                    houses of Congress, and several foreign countries, especially <placeName>
                  <country reg="enk">England</country>, <country reg="fr">France</country>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>, were all much concerned with and interested in the outcome of the campaign.</p>
            <p>Richard Knopf has transcribed and edited the correspondence between Major General Anthony Wayne,
                    commander of the Legion of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and the secretaries of war, Henry Knox, Timothy Pickering, and James McHenry. Of these
                    three Henry Knox plays the most important role.</p>
            <p>While Knopf lets Wayne's correspondence tell its own story, he includes brief statements
                    introducing the correspondence of each new <pb n="252" id="VAA4025-056-3-062"/> year. He adds
                    explanations of the political background and historical significance behind each year's
                    correspondence and behind Wayne's plans and actions. With the aid of excellent footnoting
                    one can easily follow along with Wayne during those challenging and often frustrating years,
                    1792-1796.</p>
            <p>The introductory chapter explains some of the background previous to 1792. It also gives information
                    about the two main characters of the correspondence, Wayne and Knox, as well as about the minor
                    characters, Pickering and McHenry. The correspondence itself "gives in detail the plans,
                    operations, and peace negotiations carried on between the Commander-in-Chief of the Legion of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and the hostile Indian Confederacy. It unwinds the full development of the Indian Wars,
                    military, political, and diplomatic. Here is the panorama of domestic pressures, international
                    cupidity, and political expediency which formed the backdrop of Wayne's frontier
                    enterprise" (p. 10).</p>
            <p>During the four years, 1792-1796, Wayne proved himself to be a worthy ambassador of peace and a great
                    general, a diplomat as well as a soldier. On April 13, 1792, he was commissioned a major general and
                    was named commanding officer of the troops in the service of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, Although Wayne had his faults, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> made a wise decision when he chose Wayne from the field of candidates for this
                    position. And even though he was thought of as an unmitigated egotist and a military perfectionist,
                    his most ardent enemies feared and respected him. The hardships and frustrations that Wayne and his
                    small legion were to endure before achieving their final victory in battle and at the peace
                    conference could well have overcome a lesser man. Wayne's task was made even more difficult
                    by political unrest in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, Spanish and British plots to separate West from East, disloyalty of high-ranking
                    officers, especially Brigadier General James Wilkinson, who was St. Clair's and then
                    Wayne's second-in-command, and party struggles in Congress back East. In spite of all these
                    obstacles, Wayne achieved a final triumph at the Battle of Fallen Timbers and proved himself a fine
                    diplomat in handling the negotiations for the Treaty of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene</region>
                    </placeName> Ville and in taking over the British posts according to the Jay Treaty.</p>
            <p>Most of the correspondence in this volume is concerned with purely military matters, such as the
                    recruitment and training of men, officer appointments and dismissals, and discussions of the
                    relative merits of various plans. Both Wayne and Knox sometimes accompanied an official letter,
                    however, with a personal one not for public record.</p>
            <p>Of interest throughout the correspondence are the references concerning civilian contractors, who
                    often did not live up to their bargain to feed, clothe, and equip the Legion. Indeed, to Wayne,
                    these contractors seemed a constant thorn in his side.</p>
            <p>In spite of the many handicaps and obstacles Wayne faced, he accomplished his mission and truly won
                    for himself "A Name in Am." For those who are interested in the history of the Old
                    Northwest this book is a must.</p>

            <p>A judicial biography should indicate, as far as possible, how a judge's social, economic,
                    political, and legal concepts are molded prior to his selection to the bench and then show how these
                    concepts shape his work on the bench. In addition, there are often personal factors that have great
                    weight in determining a judge's role. Of course, the effect that a judge's
                    decisions have in forming the law must also be demonstrated. Professor Beitzinger's neat
                    little volume satisfactorily meets these criteria.</p>
            <p>When he was appointed chief justice of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> Supreme Court in 1874 at the age of sixty-three Irish-born Edward Ryan had been
                    anything but successful, even in his law practice. Yet he brought to the bench a "keen
                    intellect, profound learning, high principles, and great moral courage" (p. 170). The
                    author competently demonstrates how these qualities along with Ryan's irascible nature and
                    his political and economic views—locofocoism, devotion to states' rights, and
                    basic conservatism—were instrumental in shaping his judicial career.</p>
            <p>Although he was on the bench for only six years (he was elected in his own right in 1875), Ryan left
                    his stamp on the law. His most important contribution was his realistic opinion in <hi rend="i">Attorney General</hi> v. <hi rend="i">Railroad Companies</hi> shortly after his appointment. In
                    this opinion he forcefully asserted the authority of the legislature to regulate corporate
                    combination by upholding the Potter Law of 1874, which, among other things, fixed railroad rates.
                    Ryan also fought vigorously, for he knew no other way, against encroachment on state court
                    jurisdiction by the federal courts, for a high standard of ethics for the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> bench and bar—with lasting effect, successfully for limiting the original
                    jurisdiction of his court to prerogative causes, and unsuccessfully against municipal aid to
                    railroads.</p>
            <p>Particularly interesting aspects of Ryan's pre-judicial career are his role in the
                    Barstow-Bashford gubernatorial controversy of 1855, his defense of law and order during the Booth
                    controversy, and his defense of constitutional rights during the Civil War.</p>
            <p>There are of course points on which Beitzinger's volume can be criticized. The author
                    unfairly ranks Ryan with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kent</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Shaw, and Gibson. Ryan could not begin to accomplish in his six years on the bench
                    what Shaw did in his thirty years and approximately 2,200 opinions. Organization is also open to
                    criticism, e.g., the reader must wait until Chapter Ten to learn the effect of Ryan's
                    Jesuit training on his thinking. But on the whole this biography is a thoroughly researched and
                    interestingly-written addition to an all too uncultivated field.</p>

                    The life and times of Emanuel Philipp, three-term Republican governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> and long-time antagonist of La Follette, are treated with directness and sympathy.
                    Philipp was the son of Swiss immigrants from the back country of central <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>, and his rise is in the Horatio Alger tradition. Blessed with a pleasing yet forceful
                    personality, shrewd business acumen, and tremendous capacity for hard work, he rose in the brewing,
                    lumber, and railroad industries to become a millionaire transportation magnate.</p>
            <p>Like many wealthy businessmen of his day, Philipp entered politics. After an unsuccessful attempt in
                    1900 to work with La Follette and the Progressives, he assumed the leadership of the conservative
                    Republican opposition. In the years which followed, his voice was raised in defense of the status
                    quo and in opposition to "Fighting Bob," the Progressive leader, theorist, and
                    practitioner, who made <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> a virtual laboratory experiment in applied progressivism. In 1908 Philipp's
                    successful libel suit against <hi rend="i">McClure's Magazine</hi>, Ray Stannard Baker, and
                    the excesses of muckraking journalism catapulted him into state and national attention. In 1914 he
                    capitalized on the voters' temporary disenchantment with progressivism to win the
                    governorship of his state. Twice he was re-elected to that office.</p>
            <p>Philipp's administration, sandwiched between the two Progressive administrations of La
                    Follette and John J. Blaine, served a useful purpose in tempering the excesses of extravagance and
                    bureaucratization of the former and thus preparing the way for the latter. During his tenure in
                    office the numerous progressive boards and commissions were consolidated and reorganized in the
                    interest of greater economy, efficiency, and responsibility. Although Philipp's methods
                    were largely negative and his career less glamorous than those of the crusading reformers, Maxwell
                    does not dismiss him as merely a roadblock to progress. Typical of conservative political and
                    economic thought in an era of changing ideas, Philipp's sense of realism is usually treated
                    with sympathy and understanding.</p>
            <p>As governor during the critical period of World War I, Philipp's sane and stable
                    administration was commendable. Originally opposed to American entry into a "foreign
                    war," he avoided the intransigent position assumed by La Follette and provided effective
                    leadership at a time when his state's loyalty was suspect. After the war his opposition to
                    American membership in the League of Nations reflected the views of his Midwestern constituents.</p>
            <p>Professor Maxwell shows a thorough grasp of recent <placeName>

            <p>John Peter Altgeld appeals to most Americans, who know his name as "the Eagle
                    Forgotten" of Vachel Lindsay's poem, as the man who sacrificed his political
                    career to pardon the Haymarket anarchists who he thought had been unjustly imprisoned. The present
                    volume of Altgeld's works reveals him as a many-sided man who deserves to be remembered by
                    history for more than that fearless pardon.</p>
            <p>Students of American political liberalism will welcome this volume, which for the first time makes
                    Altgeld's essays available. It includes his writings on immigration, labor, education, the
                    currency question, law and justice, and prison management, as well as his inaugural address as
                    governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and a lengthy defense of his actions during the Pullman strike of 1894 when he clashed
                    with Grover Cleveland. Altgeld's literary style is not easy, but it presents a wealth of
                    thought and a vigor that expresses his thoughts well.</p>
            <p>These essays reveal that Altgeld was a man of stubborn independence and a champion of justice, and
                    also that he was a hard-headed, competent, and driving lawyer and politician. The same vigor and
                    drive that made him espouse justice and political liberalism also enabled him to achieve outstanding
                    careers both in law and business in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The most interesting of these articles are the ones on Altgeld's proposed reforms in the
                    administration of justice and prisons. His demands for the abolition of legal fines, for
                    indeterminate sentences, a probation system, vocational training for prisoners, and honor farms and
                    minimum security systems for privileged inmates marked him well ahead of his time. That most of
                    these have since been adopted is a tribute to his vision.</p>
            <p>Unpopular causes did not deter Altgeld; indeed, they aroused his sense of justice. A champion of the
                    rights of labor and a believer in free silver, he sacrificed a great deal of personal popularity to
                    espouse both causes. Ineligible for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1896 because of his
                    foreign birth, Altgeld supported Bryan, though with some misgivings.</p>
            <p>Much of Altgeld's constructive program for the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> was lost in the adverse publicity surrounding the Haymarket anarchists' pardon
                    and the Panic of 1893, and these selected writings help restore that program and Altgeld's
                    ideas to their rightful place. This book is not a biography or autobiography, but one could wish for
                    a little more editing and a more detailed introduction. Nonetheless, it is well prepared. A picture
                    of the man and his causes and crusades emerges, and it rests first and foremost on his personal
                    integrity and sense of justice. Perhaps Altgeld himself wrote his epitaph when he said:
                    "The world gives only when it is obliged to, and respects only those who compel its
                    respect" (p. 110).</p>

            <p>Professor G. M. Waller, head of the Department of History and Political Science at <placeName>

                    </placeName> University, has subtitled his biography of Samuel Vetch "Colonial
                    Enterpriser," but "Promoter" might not be an inappropriate term. This
                    colonist of Scottish origins was one of those individuals who demonstrated the fluidity and mobility
                    of seventeenth and eighteenth-century American society by rising to great heights. Of dissenting
                    stock in Restoration <placeName>
                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName>, Vetch served briefly in the military campaigns in Europe before participating in the
                    Darien enterprise, the ill-fated Caledonian attempt to establish a colony and trading station on the
                    Isthmus of Panama. With the failure of the trading venture, Vetch found himself at <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> in possession of some of the Company's merchandise. By judicious, if not
                    entirely principled, use of the Scottish Company's goods, he promptly established himself
                    in the provincial mercantile community. He soon became a leading, but not necessarily legal,
                    merchant. His connections brought him entrance into the political and social world of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> and the Bay Colony and soon into marriage with Margaret Livingston, daughter of the
                    important Livingston clan. There then followed a not too honest but evidently most profitable career
                    as merchant, during which Vetch further built his fortune by legal and illegal trading and shipping
                    ventures. But his well-placed political connections in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> saved him eventually from any legal embarrassment and confirmed his position in the
                    colonies and in the eyes of officials in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Professor Waller has devoted the bulk of his work to the role of Vetch in the "Glorious
                    Enterprise," the attempt to eliminate the French from North America. The transplanted Scot
                    was instrumental in initiating and coordinating colonial and English efforts in the several
                    unsuccessful campaigns against <placeName>
                        <country>New France</country>
                    </placeName> at the beginning of the eighteenth century. The ambitious scheme for the expedition
                    against <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> in 1711—a project in which Vetch was a prime mover—failed, but
                    Vetch reached the summit of his career with the capture of French Acadia. Until 1717 he was governor
                    of the new British colony, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nsc">Nova Scotia</region>
                    </placeName>. But his star faded quickly after this time. Although he claimed to have the support of
                    many influential British politicians, he was unsuccessful in pressing his suit for the governorship
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>. He rose no further and died in 1732, a prisoner in the King's Bench for debt.
                    But the "enterpriser's" career had not been in vain; he left extensive
                    property in the colonies to his widow and offspring.</p>
            <p>Professor Waller's chief contribution has been to illuminate the hitherto neglected career
                    of an important colonial and imperial figure. He is particularly adept at handling the complicated
                    political situation in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>. In seeking evidence for this biography, the author has done extensive research in the
                    repositories of North America, but for the most part he has depended upon incomplete <pb n="257" id="VAA4025-056-3-067"/> transcripts in the Library of Congress and in the Canadian archives for
                    British material.</p>
            <p>Waller's work is more than a biography of Vetch; the career of the Scot is the focus for the
                    wider scene of intercolonial rivalries, provincial politics, and the administration of the empire.
                    Consequently, this history is of greater value than a more narrowly treated biography would be.</p>
            <p>There are, however, some questions which remain unanswered. Perhaps lack of material accounts for the
                    rather skimpy account of Vetch's later years when he apparently had many influential
                    contacts in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Still more important, how much of Vetch's "Great
                    Enterprise" was conceived because of legitimate concern for the empire? Or was he acting to
                    promote the advancement of Samuel Vetch as he did in so many of his other activities? In
                    consistently violating the Trade and Navigation Acts he did not appear to be overly concerned with
                    the imperial interest. In dealing with Vetch's "Glorious Enterprise,"
                    Waller appears to have overestimated the ability of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> to wage war in the colonial sphere. She was not in the same pre-eminent position early
                    in the eighteenth century as she was during the Seven Years' War. Waller concludes that the
                    eventual success of Vetch's plan, the elimination of <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> as a colonial power in North America, freed the colonials from the threat which had
                    tied them to the mother country, brought on the program of imperial taxation, and thus helped
                    institute the American Revolution. This fact, he concludes, was "the imperial irony of
                    history." But are historical developments that inevitable?</p>

            <p>Since 1835 Alexis de Tocqueville has been known chiefly for his classic study, <hi rend="i">Democracy
                        in America</hi>, an analysis and description that remains unsurpassed in perceptivity, lucidity,
                    and charm. For more than a century virtually nothing was known of its background, conception, or
                    preparation. In 1938 George W. Pierson, having discovered some of the notebooks Tocqueville kept on
                    his American tour, published a monumental study based on them, <hi rend="i">Tocqueville and Beaumont
                        in America.</hi> Nineteen years later J. P. Mayer made the original texts available as part of
                    the fifth volume of his complete works of Tocqueville. Now they are available in an English
                    translation by George Lawrence. They comprise thirteen notebooks, some arranged topically and others
                    chronologically, and three travel sketches covering a period of nine months from May 10, 1831,
                    through January, 1832. The contents include notes and extracts from a variety of books, diary
                    entries, observations and comments on American affairs, and reports of interviews, many of them
                    given in dialogue form.</p>
            <p>The wide range of Tocqueville's interests, his sensitivity to the people he met and to his
                    physical surroundings, his delight in the <pb n="258" id="VAA4025-056-3-068"/> adventure of an
                    American tour (especially to the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>), and the cordiality with which he was received are all clearly evident throughout. The
                    rapid growth of his interest beyond the original purpose of studying the penitentiary system is
                    particularly striking. Here is the raw material on which a good many studies will no doubt be based;
                    and much of it, even though not written for the public eye, will be read with pleasure by those who
                    enjoy travel accounts of bygone times.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately the editing is designed neither for the scholar nor the general reader. The
                    introduction is abridged in translation and the bibliography omitted. Most of the footnotes are
                    cross references to Pierson's volume and will be useless to those without it. Some are used
                    to identify such men as Calhoun and John Quincy Adams, but less eminent persons are left in complete
                    obscurity. Occasionally notes in the French edition are silently suppressed. Misleading paging
                    (e.g., pp. 150-151) seems to have been determined by the compositor. The author's errors go
                    uncorrected (e.g., p. 214, Berian for Berrien? and p. 216, Arisban for Harristown or <placeName>

                    </placeName>?). The translation is on the whole excellent, but errors in proofreading are compounded
                    by the introduction of mistakes that do not appear in the <placeName>

            <p>To mark the centennial of the death of William Hickling Prescott the <hi rend="i">Hispanic American
                        Historical Review</hi> devoted an entire issue in 1959 to the writings of the great historian.
                    This book is a clothbound edition of the periodical, and it makes available to a wider public the
                    essays which constitute a reassessment of Prescott and his works. While each essayist acknowledges
                    the merits of Prescott as a historian and as a writer, at the same time he presents a critique with
                    the benefit of one hundred years of hindsight. It is the style of Prescott which comes under most
                    severe scrutiny. Robin A. Humphreys, in "William H. Prescott: The Man and the
                    Historian," calls it "magniloquent." According to Humphreys, Prescott
                    seemed to prefer the Latin for the Anglo-Saxon word and used "verdant" for
                    "green," etc. It may be that "green" is preferable to
                    "verdant" as Humphreys alleges, but it must be admitted that the English language
                    would be impoverished by the complete elimination of all but a basic vocabularly of Germanic words.</p>
            <p>The most interesting contribution, "History as Romantic Art," is that of David
                    Levin, assistant professor of English at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Stanford</settlement>
                    </placeName> University. This essay alone is worth the price of the book, for it shows how the work
                    of any writer, even the greatest, may be improved by skillful analysis and editing. Levin scores
                    Prescott's lack of originality in phraseology, his inattention to detail. Prescott wrote,
                    says Levin, <pb n="259" id="VAA4025-056-3-069"/> with "rhythmic phrases rather than
                    individual words" (p. 40). His histories represent the triumph of form over content, method
                    over sense. Levin feels that Prescott was given to unnecessary simile and repetitions, while he was
                    at his best in the "tableau, the sweeping panorama, the grand procession" (p. 44).
                    He dissects one of Prescott's paragraphs with considerable candor, and anyone concerned
                    with writing history can profit by this analytic example. In short, Levin sees Prescott as a product
                    of his times with all its vices and virtues. His work is the "epitome of romantic
                    art" (p. 45).</p>
            <p>The remaining essays are bibliographic in character. Guillermo Lohman Villena explores the sources
                    used by Prescott in his <hi rend="i">History of the Conquest of Peru</hi>, while C. Harvey Gardiner
                    demonstrates the historian's reliance on the Spaniard, Pascual de Gayangos y Arce, in
                    collecting his source materials. Jerry E. Patterson provides a check list of all the works bearing
                    on the life and writings of Prescott. The editors have also included many interesting contemporary
                    reviews of Prescott's books.</p>
            <p>Whatever the criticisms of Prescott's writing, however, it should be pointed out that he is
                    still read after one hundred years with pleasure and profit. Will the same be said of many
                    historians writing today?</p>

            <p>This rather small book is a collection of articles that Edward Everett Dale has produced over the
                    years. Publication has been in such varied journals and magazines as the <hi rend="i">
                  <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> Historical Review, American Hereford Journal,

                    These articles (twelve in all) have been printed in a single illustrated volume, and their value in
                    chapter form is uniformly high. As Dale points out in the Preface, there is considerable basis for
                    scholarly research in the "Indian-Pioneer Papers" at the University of <placeName>

               </placeName> frontier has given him considerable experience which is reflected in
                    these pages. Perhaps the greatest value in the essays comes from Dale's own experience
                    tempered by his training under Frederick Jackson Turner as a professional historian.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Frontier Ways</hi> should have considerable appeal to the general reader. It is well
                    written, and, having first appeared as separate articles, the chapters do not depend upon one
                    another, a fact that the spare-moment reader will appreciate. These chapters do not describe life in
                    the romantic glow of cowboys' campfires, nor do they tell of great wealth, nor of saloon
                    gunfights. The discomforts and adjustments of simple settlers in the trans-<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> West are presented. The members of this largely unsung group are not even treated as
                    individuals <pb n="260" id="VAA4025-056-3-070"/> but as almost a class. Descriptions of their
                    struggles, their rewarded efforts, their simple enjoyments, their habits and prejudices, and their
                    attempts to make monotonously simple foods attractive can be found in these pages. Dr. Dale
                    describes some of the pioneers' attempts to found and participate in literary societies. He
                    shows a familiarity with their preventatives and medical cures in a land where life was frequently
                    difficult and even inadequate medical aid difficult to obtain. The plain, everyday life of the
                    homesteader and settler is delightfully examined. Recipes with a sturdy sound to them are to be
                    found in the chapter on cowboy cookery. They will definitely never appear in slimming-diet
                    cookbooks. The people Dr. Dale knew in the West around the turn of the twentieth century were more
                    concerned with getting enough nourishing and reasonably varied food to support the tremendous energy
                    they expended than they were with maintaining trim figures.</p>
            <p>This little volume is an experience most readers will enjoy. The illustrations by Malcolm Thrugood
                    are pleasant and folksy but add little to the book. Frontier Ways is real, for it is Edward Everett
                    Dale, a man who, though a good professional historian, saw the American frontier pass.</p>

            <p>The author's reputation as one of the leading historians and interpreters of Quakerism is
                    reinforced by this volume concerning <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> beliefs and practices and Quakerism's relationship to its social and
                    intellectual environment during the course of the historical and cultural changes of three
                    centuries. Tolles has brought together here a series of seven of his published essays and addresses
                    from over a fifteen-year period on subjects so closely related that little more than a foreword and
                    introductory paragraphs to each chapter were needed to make the collection a unified whole.</p>
            <p>The term "Atlantic Community" was coined in our time to include all those countries
                    bordering on the North Atlantic with closely interwoven historical and cultural relationships. The
                    ties of international Quakerism have been so close that Tolles follows other <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> historians in looking on English, Irish, and American Quakers as one community. The
                    binding ties and media of communication have been the traveling ministry, the exchange of epistles
                    between Meetings, the dissemination of a wealth of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> literature, and, in more recent times, joint humanitarian projects.</p>
            <p>As history this volume is topical rather than comprehensive. While references are made, for instance,
                    to separations among Friends, the author supplies little detail and, surprisingly, makes no
                    reference to Elias Hicks, Joseph John Gurney, and John Wilbur, whose opposing ideas rocked
                    nineteenth-century Quakerism on both sides of the Atlantic, creating in this country schisms which
                    are still only partly healed. Other aspects of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> principles and history such as great humani- <pb n="261" id="VAA4025-056-3-071"/>
                    tarian activities and traditional opposition to war and military eervice Tolles frankly leaves to
                    other historians.</p>
            <p>Distinguishing marks of Tolled treatment are his emphasis on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Puritan</settlement>
                    </placeName> rather than the mystical origins of the Society of Friends and on the corporate life of
                    the group rather than on individual experience. A valuable feature of this volume is the treatment
                    of characteristic aspects of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName>: his attitudes—rooted in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> principles— toward politics, business, scientific research, and the arts.
                    Tolles also discusses the effect of these attitudes on individual and cultural development,
                    recognizing that until recent times the repressive attitude toward the fine arts has limited
                    achievement in that area. Yet, "whatever their failures in practice," concludes
                    Tolles, "it was given them to glimpse a vision of perfection and, by striving to achieve it
                    within the conditions of their culture, to hold it up as a goal for the Atlantic Community of their
                    day and ours. That is the real historical significance of the Quakers in the civilization of the
                    Atlantic world" (p. 133).</p>
            <p>Trustworthy scholarship, clear thinking, and lucid writing make the book valuable to anyone who would
                    like to add to his knowledge in this area.</p>

                    understanding regarding their diverse traditions and differing ideologies. In such a spirit,
                    non-Catholics and Catholics have contributed to this volume in which most of the essays presented
                    are the product of two symposia held at the University of Notre Dame under the auspices of the
                    Department of History and the Faculty Seminar in American Civilization. The first half of the volume
                    deals with the general position of Roman Catholics in the <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The second half deals with the adaptation of the immigrant Catholic to the American
                    scene.</p>
            <p>The volume is generally imbued with a truly objective spirit. Indeed, one of the contributors, Will
                    Herberg, of Drew University, in his effort to present an unbiased analysis of the
                    "thoroughgoing secularization" of religion in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> (p. 13), may have overstated his case and minimized the tenacity (especially in
                    churches of Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinistic backgrounds) with which the teachings and values of
                    the Judaeo-Christian tradition are vigorously cherished.</p>
            <p>To this reviewer, the high quality of most of the essays is not attained in that by the French
                    Dominican, R. L. Bruckberger. He ap- <pb n="262" id="VAA4025-056-3-072"/> pears to be strangely
                    inconsistent and narrowly intolerant. On the same page (p. 42) he states that non-Catholic Americans
                    most often "hardly know what to think" religiously, and then he declares that
                    almost all of them "believe in God and in the principal mysteries of Christianity,
                    including the divinity of Christ." He apparently, moreover, has never been able to sense
                    the admirable qualities of American Puritanism along with its excesses. Therefore, he is led to
                    write: "The whole world, with the possible exception of South America, is now dominated by
                    Puritanism and this is a terrible danger" (p. 47). He further attributes to Puritanism
                    "the segregation between men and women, a thing which is so striking in America"
                    (p. 47), yet surely Puritanism never sanctioned the sex "segregation" which is a
                    part of the way of life of his own Dominican order. He also apparently fails to appreciate the

            <p>Customarily the first World War is regarded as a watershed in recent American history dividing
                    modern, contemporary culture formed in the whirligig decade of the twenties from the bygone
                    placidity of the nineteenth century. Henry May has challenged this view with a close inspection of
                    the years preceding America's entry into the war. He chooses 1912 as the watershed year,
                    with the dinner celebrating Howells' seventy-fifth birthday as symbol of the climacteric of
                    traditional American values: moralism, faith in progress, faith in culture— respectable
                    culture. Eastern universities and book and magazine publishers as well as interior strongholds of
                    cultural tradition in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South, California</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and the Midwest endorsed and cherished these values. But the doubts and shafts of
                    naturalists, relativists, Freudians, bohemians, and radical socialists punctured American optimism
                    and confidence even before the postwar disillusionment.</p>
            <p>May ranges broadly over literature, the social sciences and politics, European influences, and
                    American centers of intellectual rebellion, such as the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> of Harriet Monroe's Poetry and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>'s Greenwich Village. On the older phase of intellectual dissent, beginning
                    about 1890, his discussion deals chiefly with new currents of social science lapping at traditional
                    absolutes. The pragmatism of James and Dewey, the behavioristic psychology of John Broadus Watson,
                    the scientific history of Robinson and Beard, and the scientific management of Frederick W. Taylor
                    fall within this rubric. The later wave of rebellion, which started about 1912, emphasizes poets,
                    critics, editors, and publishers. Now sound out the new voices who will be heard so <pb n="263" id="VAA4025-056-3-073"/> prominently in the postwar years: Mencken slashing at American cultural
                    pretensions in the <hi rend="i">Smart Set</hi>, Van Wyck Brooks heralding a sober American maturity,
                    Amy Lowell speaking for emancipated poetry and women, Walter Lippmann bringing Freud and Marx into
                    politics, Emma Goldman with her communism, and Margaret Sanger with her birth control, and many
                    more, slicing and hammering at nineteenth century faiths. When war came, the intellectuals reacted
                    differently, and some like Dewey and Veblen and Mencken swallowed hard before lending their support. <placeName>

                    1917.</p>
            <p>In pushing up the end of innocence by a decade, May has called attention to a fertile and fermenting
                    six years before the war. He has accomplished a feat in synthesizing social philosophies and
                    literary currents ordinarily kept in the separate compartments of the social sciences and
                    humanities, and further, in giving personalities to the institutions that support ideas, the
                    universities and magazines and publishing houses. One question that intrudes itself is whether the
                    end of innocence did not arrive even earlier than 1912. If the older dissenters have to be traced
                    back to 1890, the watershed that divides modern times from nineteenth century optimism may belong in
                    the nineteenth century itself. By the 1880's the new social sciences had arisen; the
                    depression of 1873 and the reformers that came after, from George to Gronlund, were shaking
                    traditional American dogmas. Howells himself embraced socialism. Literary realism seemed as
                    rebellious as the later naturalism now appears. Sandburg today is as venerable a symbol as Howells
                    was in 1912, and his own radicalism of 1912-1917 is now the purest respectability.</p>
            <p>The method of writing intellectual history, still a new field for American history, poses the problem
                    of how much to include. If the historian of ideas is encylopedic, as is Merle Curti in <hi rend="i">The Growth of American Thought</hi>, he cannot discuss ideas in any detail. If he emphasizes
                    systems of thought, as does Stow Persons in <hi rend="i">American Minds</hi>, he necessarily
                    excludes many currents of thought and cultural processes for transmitting ideas. May has tended to
                    use the inclusive approach and has introduced a full roster of rebels and dissenters. As a
                    consequence, treatment is descriptive rather than speculative, and the ideas of Freud or T. S. Eliot
                    or Woodrow Wilson are presented in capsule form. As one technique to epitomize the thought of the
                    intellectuals he discusses, May uses a succinct quotation of one or two sentences from their works.
                    The technique is suggestive, but it also underlines the difficulty of giving satisfactory individual
                    attention to a crowded canvas.</p>

            <p>After a generation during which Professor E. S. Corwin has declared that a "Constitution of
                    Rights, both State rights and private rights, has been replaced to a great extent by a Constitution
                    of Powers," there is a dearth of comprehensive surveys of the field of American <pb n="264" id="VAA4025-056-3-074"/> constitutional law. Good casebooks abound, and a number of valuable
                    studies of the Supreme Court are available; but until <hi rend="i">The American Constitution</hi>
                    appeared, the bulky and rather technical <hi rend="i">Constitution of the <placeName>
                            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                        </placeName> of America: Analysis and Interpretation</hi> (<placeName>

                    </placeName>, 1952) was virtually alone in the field of general constitutional analysis. The latter
                    reference, prepared under the editorship of Professor Corwin, undoubtedly remains the best single
                    purchase in the field by virtue of its combination of comprehensiveness and modest cost. <hi rend="i">The American Constitution</hi> offers, however, a conciseness and a clarity of
                    exposition and analysis that make it far more usable for either textual or general use than the
                    Corwin volume.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The American Constitution</hi> follows the usual pattern in its topical breakdown of the
                    subject. Professor Pritchett's study is characterized, however, by the elimination of
                    relatively insignificant judicial decisions and other materials which frequently serve more to
                    clutter than enhance analysis. Particularly fruitful is his introductory section in which he
                    presents a brief constitutional sketch of the pre-convention period and sets forth his own
                    philosophy of constitutional interpretation. The subsequent exposition and analysis of
                    constitutional doctrine is lucid and in the scholarly tradition of the author's numerous
                    writings.</p>
            <p>Even in as careful a study as this the reader should remain aware that he is dealing with commentary
                    and not with actual texts. Dependence upon the former alone, however able the analysis, may on
                    occasion offer some risks. The disadvantages of commentary can be compounded in the area of
                    constitutional law by the speed with which any commentary is out of date. Professor
                    Pritchett's brief summary of <hi rend="i">

                    (1959) since the publication of the present study.</p>
            <p>Perhaps of greatest interest for the general public in these times is the philosophy of
                    constitutional interpretation and of the role of the Supreme Court that is developed throughout the
                    text. Answering those who would strait-jacket the solution of national problems by an excessive
                    deference to the past, the author presents what he chooses to call the "experiential
                    approach" to constitutional interpretation. In the spirit of such justices as Marshall and
                    Holmes, and drawing directly upon the latter, Professor Pritchett considers the Constitution
                    "more as a political than as a legal document. It considers current understandings as
                    relevant as the debates of the Constitutional Convention…. The goal of constitutional
                    interpretation … is the achieving of consensus as to the <hi rend="i">current
                    meaning</hi> of the document framed in 1787 … while still recognizing guidelines derived
                    from the written document and philosophy of limited governmental power which it sought to
                    express" (pp. 46-47).</p>
            <p>The Supreme Court is counseled "to reach constitutional issues reluctantly and to be chary
                    of disagreeing with legislatures or executives, whether state or national" (p. 154). But
                    the right of each generation to adapt the Constitution to its needs is limited "to the
                    extent that <pb n="265" id="VAA4025-056-3-075"/> such adaptations are reconcilable with the language
                    of the Constitution" (p. 47). Within such limits the author finds occasion to be critical
                    of the work of the Supreme Court, both for engaging too freely in the determination of questions
                    best left to the political branches of the government (p. 281) and for an evasion of its duty in
                    other instances by too free a resort to such shields as "political questions" (p.
                    154).</p>

            <p>Arnold Brecht, professor emeritus of the Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science, New School
                    for Social Research, has had a long and distinguished career as a scholar, political administrator,
                    and political advisor. He was notably successful as a civil servant under the Weimar Republic, and
                    after fleeing <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> in 1933 he began to make a series of notable contributions to the field of political
                    science. The work under review, while not intended to be his final book, is a fitting capstone to
                    his scholarly career, for it is a work that shows great learning and insight.</p>
            <p>Professor Brecht is concerned with <hi rend="i">scientific</hi> political theory rather than with the
                    crosscurrents of contemporary political and social ideologies. His objective is to provide a
                    systematic statement of the philosophical and methodological foundations of present scientific
                    political theory while, at the same time, tracing the genesis of the efforts to develop such a body
                    of theory. The organization of the book entails an initial statement of the primary elements of
                    scientific method, including a careful and extremely lucid statement of scientific value relativism.
                    The latter statement includes a special case study treatment of the impact of scientific value
                    relativism upon traditional theories of justice. The initial value and methodological considerations
                    are succeeded by a rich series of essays dealing with the historical origins of present scientific
                    orientations towards the study of man in society. This historical excursion is followed by a careful
                    consideration of the views of contemporary critics on efforts to construct a science of politics,
                    with particular attention given to criticisms of scientific value relativism.</p>
            <p>This volume is to be commended upon many grounds. Professor Brecht is eminently fair in treatment of
                    intellectual positions with which he does not agree. He does not set up any straw men, and he fully
                    grasps the nature of the arguments which he aims to refute or modify. His own analytical ability is
                    of a very high order, and he is particularly adept at selecting the right illustration and the
                    appropriate phrase. The breadth of his scholarship is great. He knows the relevant literature,
                    including minor works as well as those of major importance. (The notes to each of the chapters will
                    provide enough references to sources to provide a decade of fruitful reading for any graduate
                    student.) <pb n="266" id="VAA4025-056-3-076"/> Not only does Professor Brecht know the relevant
                    literature, but he also has the ability to guide the reader through the tortuously tangled trail of
                    twentieth-century philosophical and scientific controversy without leading him through unnecessarily
                    roundabout paths. This volume is, for that reason, probably the best introduction to the origins and
                    development of modern social sciences now in existence. All in all, this is a work of major
                    proportions which deserves the careful attention of all social scientists, historians, and social
                    philosophers.</p>

                    </placeName>: The Bobbs-Merrill Co., 1960. Pp. 639. Index. $7.50.)</head>
            <p>The difficulties in employing a comprehensive survey of history to establish any set principle or
                    view, both in regard to the mastery of so much information and to the nearly impossible intellectual
                    acumen required to let the facts speak for themselves rather than to the issues concerned, have
                    frequently been illustrated before and are again shown here in Professor Shotwell's book.
                    This work is more than a survey of facts, however, and it should be judged primarily by the validity
                    and the accomplishment of its intent. This intent is to demonstrate that the rule of reason is the
                    only basis upon which civilization may find true freedom and avert utter stalemate or oblivion. For
                    Shotwell the rule of reason is more than logic since it must also account for irrational factors
                    governing human response and activity, and because inexorable and complete logic cannot envision the
                    compromise of conflicting interest in which justice is defined.</p>
            <p>To document this theme the author appeals to the full scope of human history. He draws the obvious
                    lessons that only history explains the transient present since in many ways it is the substance of
                    the present. Shotwell goes on, however, as one of the main objectives in the book to insist that
                    freedom defined as acceptance of responsibility is the result of man's historical
                    emancipation from spiritual, social, and economic oppression by breakthroughs achieved in the advent
                    of religion, the rise of politics and economics, and, ironically, the use of war. Yet, each of these
                    emancipating factors has obviously been the instrument of further oppression in itself, except for
                    the few creative periods when reason did temporarily prevail. Finally, mankind now faces its
                    greatest challenge, the necessity of adjusting to the machine as we turn to a new and unique era
                    requiring. us to "think our way through rather than grapple with nature by animal
                    strength" (p. 577).</p>
            <p>Those of us who are unable to attempt the writing of such a book should be careful in our criticisms
                    of it, but it seems clear that Shotwell's use of antiquity is based on an acquaintance
                    gained in his youth and uncorrected by the voluminous later literature which could be used to
                    challenge many of his factual assumptions about the ancient world. One example illustrating this
                    point is his acceptance of slavery as the basis of ancient economic life. One is tempted to reveal
                    author's and reviewer's weaknesses alike with the old cliche: he is far better in
                    the area of his own immense scholarly contribution, modern international relations, than he is in
                    the fields of ancient and medieval <pb n="267" id="VAA4025-056-3-077"/> history. But there are
                    points of argument with which to disagree as well. In his appraisal of Christian ethics, what of the
                    essential pessimism in regard to the amelioration of social ills in Christ's statement (St.
                    John 8:32), "And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free"? This
                    pronouncement is surcharged with meaning in the study of freedom's development. The case
                    might have been well argued from antiquity; it is more effectively shown in this book from modern
                    history.</p>
            <p>Further, there are indications of haste in the preparation of this work, e.g., the poor explanation
                    for the observation that justice cannot be established in isolation: "it is in the
                    relations with other people that the animal mind tends to reassert itself" (p. 25); or the
                    evaluation of the Roman Republic as the "only creative period" for Roman history
                    (p. 131) when compared with the latter accomplishment of the <hi rend="i">ius gentium</hi> cited on
                    p. 606. It is perhaps only quibbling to point out the frequent faulty spelling of
                    "millennium," finally correct on p. 576, or the "Constane" for
                    "Constantine" on p. 143, but one feels Shotwell's purpose would have been
                    better served by more time and care, which his position as Bryce Professor Emeritus of International

                    novelist, John Dos Passos, this volume bears the traces of his craft. With Thomas Carlyle, Dos
                    Passos sees only great men at the bottom of history. <hi rend="i">Prospects of a Golden Age</hi>
                    tells the story of the Revolutionary generation by picturing its great men at work at their chosen
                    crafts or professions. It includes chapters on surveyors, sailors, painters, lawyers, writers,
                    explorers, architects, and mechanics. The author achieves an ironic effect by describing George
                    Washington surveying in the wilderness and Thomas Jefferson pleading a case before a county court,
                    both unaware of their future greatness. This artistic device at times plays havoc with chronology.
                    The author is the slave of the colorful and dramatic to such an extent that Alexander Hamilton
                    receives less attention than John Ledyard, the eccentric explorer. The great men of history as they
                    appear in these pages have almost none of the faults of men and most of the virtues of angels. Such
                    characterization is neither history nor good fiction, for even the novel, as the author should know,
                    must have its villain as well as its hero. The Revolutionary generation as drawn by Dos Passos was
                    composed of practical dreamers who worked to raise a civilization in the wilderness, yet they found
                    time to dream of a golden age when the country they were constructing would stand at the front of
                    the community of nations. Dos Passos has nothing new to say, but he tells an old story in a way
                    which will intrigue the layman and embarrass the scholar.</p>

            <p>John Bell Rae, now associate professor of history at the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> Institute of Technology, has written a book that will be received with mixed feelings
                    by historians, economists, and students of business history. The book is obviously a labor of love.
                    It is well written and, within the obvious limits of its objective, fulfills a need. Those of us in
                    middle age or later will feel many a nostalgic twinge as we discover what happened to the Overland,
                    Marmon, Moon, Essex, Stutz, and all the other wonderful cars we knew as children.</p>
            <p>Professor Rae has spun out his story of the first forty years of the automobile industry with grace
                    and style, putting it together in such a way that the reader will make his way through this
                    relatively short book with a gratifying sense of <hi rend="i">remembering</hi> what happened. The
                    author has a firm, comfortable grasp of his materials and handles exquisitely the details of growth
                    and change in the many companies of the early industry.</p>
            <p>In the very word "detail," however, the economic and business historian will find a
                    key to the one indisputable defect of this book. The author simply does not impose on his facts a
                    theory of industrial concentration that enables the reader to see why the automobile industry
                    acquired its present oligopoly structure. To be sure, he speaks of "the inevitability of
                    bigness in American automobile manufacturing" (p. 198), and here and there we have
                    statements attributing ultimate big-three domination to lower costs, greater staying power in
                    depression, and readier adaptability of the large firm. But of course anyone can make these
                    inferences without any reference to history. It is the job of the historian to tell us, after a look
                    at the records, how and why the large firm gained its ascendancy over the small. Specifically, from
                    a study like this we should learn what forces determine the optimum size of the firm. For example,
                    is E. A. G. Robinson's classification of technological, managerial, financial, marketing,
                    and risk forces a useful one? Does the change in the number of firms from hundreds at the beginning
                    of the twentieth century to more than a hundred in the early 1920's to five in the late
                    1950's demonstrate the usefulness of the "planning curve" as a concept of
                    economic theory? Does the change in structure of the automobile industry from one approaching the
                    norm of competition to that of an oligopoly so demonstrate the inevitability of bigness that
                    enforcement of the antitrust laws is meaningless? It is to questions such as these that someone must
                    ultimately address himself; indeed, Professor Rae may intend to do so in another volume.</p>
            <p>But perhaps this criticism is not fair. After all, the title of the book is <hi rend="i">American
                        Automobile Manufacturers.</hi> Men, not economic forces, are presumably the author's
                    concern, and for his treatment of men we must give him high marks. Most readers will be helped by
                    the skillful way in which the founders of the industry are brought to life, and Hoosier readers in
                    particular will be engrossed by Rae's treatment of the middle Westerners and their roles in
                    the early industry. Professor Rae's handling of the reasons for geographical concentration
                    of the industry in the <geogName>Great Lakes</geogName> region is persuasive, though it is still not
                    altogether clear why <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> and its environs should become the great <pb n="269" id="VAA4025-056-3-079"/> center of
                    automobile manufacturing unless we are willing to admit that pure chance often determines the course
                    of events. Certainly the fire that caused R. E. Olds to recoup his losses by producing nothing but
                    the curved-dash runabout, the first "merry Oldsmobile" and the first car to sell
                    in quantity, was fortuitous. It was likewise fortuitous that Detroit should be the home of Henry
                    Ford, who insisted that a light car could be made to run on America's abominable roads and
                    who "put <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> finally and unchallengeably ahead of any competitor" (p. 60).</p>
            <p>Mr. Rae's book will do for all of us what a good history book should do. It outlines a way
                    to work through complex and turgid detail, and it furnishes a small encyclopedia for handy
                    reference. More than this, the book gives us in its necessary abstraction from reality an
                    intelligent and perceptive look at what happened, a look that will help a good many of us to
                    understand better this great episode in American economic history.</p>

                    </placeName>, to Switz City. The seven lines here discussed were all associated with the growth of
                    the limestone business. Sulzer offers numerous details regarding their incorporation, construction,
                    maintenance, finance, and operation, as well as their abandonment. Pictures of trains, stations,
                    bridges, and right-of-ways, along with the reproduction of various schedules, add information both
                    useful and interesting. The author has apparently devoted much study to lines discussed, and
                    doubtless he knows more about his subject than does any other person. Nevertheless, the value of his
                    work would be more adequately safeguarded through the years if his sources were more precisely
                    pinpointed. Moreover, Sulzer should have winnowed his evidence more thoroughly than he has to make
                    very clear to readers which part of his account is history and which part is story and legend. The
                    subtitle of this volume indicates that the author plans to publish subsequent studies of abandoned
                    steam railroads in Indiana.</p>

                    </placeName>: Council for Local History, 1959. Pp. 158. Illustrations, map, appendix, bibliography.
                    Paperbound, $4.00.) Jerry Marlette offers an overview of electric railroads in Indiana
                    with emphasis on the period from 1900, when the first such line entered <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, through the 1940's, the decade which marked the virtual disappearance of
                    electric lines from the Hoosier scene. Observing that street railways in this state began during the
                    Civil War when mule power was used to propel them, he notes that the first successful electric
                    street railway line commenced at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1885. Within a decade such lines replaced most of the mule- or horse-drawn railways.
                    The expansion from urban railways to "interurbans" evolved in the 1890's,
                    several such lines having <pb n="270" id="VAA4025-056-3-080"/> been established prior to 1898 when
                    the line between Anderson and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Alexandria</settlement>
                    </placeName>, often termed the first interurban in Indiana, was opened. The rapid expansion of
                    electric lines soon made <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> one of the leading interurban centers of the country. By World War I, however,
                    abandonments had already begun, and the long decline and successive abandonments continued until the
                    system was largely gone by the early 1940's. Although the competition of automobiles,
                    buses, and trucks is recognized as an important factor in the decline of the electric railroads,
                    much emphasis is placed on overcapitalization as an important factor which contributed to their
                    waning. Marlette has obviously done massive research regarding the interurbans of Indiana, and he
                    includes numerous pictures to illustrate his account; but he modestly insists that this is in no
                    sense a complete or definite story. His Preface announces that histories of various individual lines
                    are in progress. It is hoped that in these histories Marlette will make more clear his sources and
                    thus augment the value of his writing in a field which needs additional plowing and thoughtful
                    study.</p>

                    English's Opera House was one of the principal landmarks of "the Circle"
                    in downtown <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. During the Civil War, William H. English moved his family from southern Indiana to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In the capital city this Democratic political leader—who was also banker,
                    real estate operator, and historian—became one of its distinguished citizens and was
                    nominated for the vice-presidency on the Democratic ticket with General Hancock in 1880. Early in
                    that same year, English had announced his intention of building a theatre upon property which he
                    owned on the northwest segment of the Circle. The new building, long known as the English Opera
                    House, was given to English's son Will. This booklet results from "a paper read

                    (Culver, Ind., 1959. Pp. 122, 6. Appendix, index.) Charles C. Mather, who has been associated with
                    Culver Military Academy for approximately four decades, is well qualified to write a history of the
                    academy. Mather stresses that Culver is "indigenous to the Middle West and by the same
                    token is peculiarly American, for if today any section of our country more than another represents
                    those special qualities and characteristics that identify us as American, surely it is found in the
                    great valley of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>" (p. 1). Mather reviews the historical development of the area around Lake
                    Max-inkuckee; the high lights of the career of Henry Harrison Culver, founder of the Academy; the
                    Culver Park Assembly or chautauqua project of the late 1880's and early 1890's;
                    and then the founding of Culver Military Academy in 1894. Most of his history, however, portrays <pb n="271" id="VAA4025-056-3-081"/> the development and growth of Culver since its founding. The
                    high academic standards of this secondary institution are stressed. The picture which Mather paints
                    of Culver is generally favorable, but at times critical evaluations are made of persons and
                    policies. Since 1933 the academy has been owned and operated by the Culver Military Foundation.</p>

                    is known as a realist, his biography of Lincoln was written in the traditional manner of campaign
                    biographies. Presumably, Howells was realistic enough to know that some romance was expected in this
                    kind of writing. Howells' biography was published less than two months after
                    Lincoln's nomination. The unique value of this new edition arises from its inclusion of
                    corrections and comments added by Lincoln during the campaign. Samuel C. Parks, a lawyer and

                    statement that "since Lincoln was a conscientious workman, we can assume that everything in
                    Howells' book which he did not correct was of an accuracy acceptable to him" (p.
                    vii) is neither a logical conclusion nor consistent with related and known facts to the contary.
                    Howells' volume originally appeared as <hi rend="i">Lives and Speeches of Abraham Lincoln
                        and Hannibal Hamlin</hi>, but only the biography of Lincoln with his own annotations are
                    produced here. Also included are the Editor's Preface to a 1938 edition, which relates the
                    history of the volume, and an eyewitness account of the 1860 Republican National Convention, by
                    Murat Halstead, from his Caucuses of 1860.</p>

                    considerable political, cultural, and diplomatic history, though his emphasis is naturally upon
                    economic developments. This volume exhibits the author's broad understanding of American
                    economic history, and it is quite readable. Faulkner's opinions and views are often frankly
                    expressed, but his text is packed with much essential information. A Historg of the Newspapers of <placeName>

                    Attention is also given to Democratic, Whig, and Republican papers of the pre-Civil War era, and
                    there are separate chapters on German and daily newspapers. The contrast between the pioneer
                    newspapers of <placeName>

                    towns is indeed significant. Especially important, as illustrated in this account of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Ann Arbor</settlement>
                    </placeName> papers, is the contrast between the personal journalism which reflected the
                    individualism of pioneer editors and the generally tepid, institutionalized, and impersonal
                    journalism of small towns and cities of recent decades. Moreover, those persons who think that the
                    midwestern pioneers were unconcerned about what happened outside their immediate communities should
                    read carefully a random selection of a few dozen newspapers from the states of the Old Northwest in
                    the pre-Civil War era. Histories similar to Doll's should be written for dozens of early
                    midwestern towns, such as <placeName>
