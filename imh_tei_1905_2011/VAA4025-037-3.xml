                    Friday evenings the classroom was the scene of the Union Literary Society's meetings,
                    throbbing with debates, recitations, readings, and parliamentary exercises. The chairman meted out
                    assignments and levied uncollectable fines; strangely enough, the Society lived for eighteen
                        years.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> With various young ladies for inspiration, lyrics flowed freely

                    of readers possible of capture and then addressing himself to their tastes was a matter of instinct
                    with me." At the moment the Society's taste ran to G.P.R. James, who had
                    reiterated <hi rend="i">Richelieu</hi> (1829) with six other weighty tales of knighthood. James was

            <p>Lewis Wallace's "The Man-at-Arms: A Tale of the Tenth Century" owed much
                    of its romanticized history and extravagant sentiment to James; for battle scenes the Hoosier
                    apprentice acknowledged a debt to James Macpherson's <hi rend="i">Ossian.</hi> In the
                    course of two hundred and fifty closely written pages of foolscap, Pedro, a valiant page, ran the
                    gamut from agony to bliss in his devotion to Inez, the Rose of Guadalajara (meaningfully aged
                    sixteen). Clandestine meetings led to Pedro's banishment, à la <hi rend="i">Romeo and Juliet,</hi> but a nurse and a hermit, also faintly Shakespearean, conspired to
                    effect a secret marriage. Betrayed, Inez was incarcerated by wrathful parents and her marriage
                    fraudulently annulled. She escaped a threatened match with an eligible prince by feigning madness. A
                    helmet hiding his identity, Pedro became a hero of the First Crusade, and in time the father of Inez
                    was overtaken with such remorse that he too, with his family, embarked on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem.
                    There, with Pedro apparently (but only apparently) dying, Inez' sanity returned and the two

                    served a significant purpose. It left with the tyro the lifelong conviction that the sentimental

                    David Wallace assumed an awesome stature as his son recalled his love of literature, especially
                    Macaulay and the English quarterlies, and his fireside readings, with voice and expression of
                    remarkable sensitivity, from the writings of Lamb, Shakespeare, Milton, Scott, and Byron; from the
                    sermons of Chalmers, Hall, Bossuet, and Bourdaloue,<hi rend="sup">37</hi> and from the chronicles of
                    Thucydides and the history of George Bancroft. The elder Wallace had assigned declamations to his
                    sons and criticized the performance, with special attention to enunciation. Material included Thomas

                    of Jeremiah C. Sullivan, who was a justice of the Supreme Court of Indiana from 1837 to 1846. He was
                    a soldier and a father of soldiers, a shrewd lawyer, a learned and able judge, but above all else a
                    deeply religious gentleman.</p>
            <p>He was a native of the Valley of Virgina, where at Harrisonburg, on July 21, 1794, occurred his
                    birth. His father, Thomas Sullivan, son of a distinguished Irish barrister of the Roman Catholic

                    the establishment of the state seminary, and the select committee on Clark's land grant.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> He was chairman of the committee of the whole when it studied the

            <p>The most important act of this Assembly was probably that which finally resulted in the designation
                    and naming of the state capital in its present central position. To find a suitable name was a
                    perplexing problem for the legislators, and, for a time, each new suggestion met with blank silence
                    or derisive laughter. Some favored one of Indian origin, that of Tecumseh being best liked. The name

            <p>Two years later, James Blake asked Senator John Tip-ton if he could obtain the office of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> District Attorney for their mutual friend, "Major Sullivan." Blake
                    told Tipton that because of "some facts that have been developed" Samuel Judah had
                    not been made the candidate for the senatorship, and rumor had it he would either resign or be
                    removed from the office of district attorney. Blake added that as Senator Tipton knew of
                    Sullivan's qualifications he would say nothing about them, but assured him that the
                    appointment would not only gratify himself but would also render general satisfaction.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> Although Judah was dismissed from his office, because he had criticized President
                    Andrew Jackson, Sullivan did not receive the appointment. Nevertheless, he was by this time
                    recognized as one of the most distinguished lawyers in the state.</p>
            <p>It must have occasioned little surprise when Governor David Wallace sent in Sullivan's name
                    to the state Senate for confirmation to the vacancy in the state Supreme Court, created by the death
                    of John T. McKinney, who died in May, 1837. At the same time the Governor nominated Isaac Black-ford
                    and Charles Dewey, who were confirmed unanimously by the forty-six members voting. The vote on
                    Sullivan, however, was twenty-five in the affirmative and twenty in opposition.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> At the time of his appointment he was forty-three years old.</p>
            <p>The cases which came up to the Supreme Court generally were upon such prosaic matters as slander,
                    libel, trespass, and the other usual legal problems. It may be said that while Blackford, Dewey, and
                    Sullivan were upon the bench together, Indiana's Supreme Court stood in high regard
                    throughout the country, as they were thought to be among the ablest to occupy this bench. In the
                    fall term of 1837, Sullivan delivered twelve decisions of the court. He held, in the action of Case
                        <hi rend="i">v.</hi> Winship, that if a man made an absolute sale of goods and continued in

                    where goods had been mortgaged formed no exception to the general rule. He felt that such conduct
                    would enable the defendant "to impose upon mankind by false appearances." Nor
                    would he admit parol evidence in extenuation.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> In another case decided during
                    the same term, he declared that a lower court had been in error in not allowing the defendant to
                    question a juror under oath as to whether he had formed an opinion upon the case. Concerning this he
                    said: "We regard the law as being now well settled, that it is a good cause of challenge to
                    a juror that he has expressed an opinion…. The difficulty is in determining how proof of
                    such an expression of opinion is to be obtained—whether by extrinsic evidence, or by
                    questions put to the juror on the <hi rend="i">voire dire?"</hi> Although a juror could not
                    be required to admit something which might tend to his dishonor or discredit, the judge thought that
                    this would not occur in such a case. He held that in civil cases the rule of misbehavior did not
                    hold, and the juror could admit that he had formed an opinion without being guilty of misbehavior or
                    anything dishonorable.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sullivan wrote fourteen opinions during the May term of 1838. In one he held that an action for
                    slander could be tried in Indiana for words spoken in another state, as the action was transitory,
                    and the defendant's liability followed him wherever he went. It was not necessary that the
                    slander be committed in the county in which the trial was held. The defendant had maintained that he
                    had a right so to speak as the plaintiff had stolen a horse in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, but Judge Sullivan stated that justification in slander required the same kind of
                    proof to maintain it that was necessary to convict the plaintiff of the crime.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
                    Nor, in a suit against a husband and wife, for words spoken by the wife, was evidence of the

                    1838, Judge Sullivan declared that when a court of limited jurisdiction exceeded its rightful powers
                    all concerned were liable to the party injured. Therefore, a justice of the peace who issued a writ
                    of domestic attachment, without requiring bond to be filed according to the statute, was in error
                    and liable. He, the party procuring the act, and the officers who executed the decision were all in
                        trespass.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> In Summy <hi rend="i">v.</hi> Mulford, he declared that if a
                    person erected a mill dam across a water course and so caused the land of another to- be overflowed,
                    without first taking out a writ of <hi rend="i">ad quod damnum,</hi> he could not by subsequently
                    taking out such a writ, have the damages assessed under it and then by tendering the amount of the
                    assessment, avoid an action by the parties injured for the damages sustained.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
                    In a celebrated case, now widely quoted as authority in commentaries and textbooks, the Hoosier
                    justice maintained that although the title may come in question it was not essential to an action in
                    trespass <hi rend="i">quare clausum fregit</hi> that it should. In the case of the State <hi rend="i">v.</hi> Newton, the defendant had entered a school section, cut down and carried away
                    lumber, and as a defense had sought to show that the state did not have title to the land and so
                    could not sue. Sullivan stated that although the grant of section sixteen was not to the state but
                    to the inhabitants of the respective townships in which the lands were located, yet the state might
                    have acquired, subsequently to such grant, a sufficient interest in the land to maintain the

            <p>The Constitution of Indiana at this time provided that the judges of the Supreme Court be appointed

                    James Whitcomb immediately sent to the Senate the name of that veteran jurist, Isaac Blackford, who

                    therefore, preferred younger and more active men. The editor wondered what the citizens of
                    Jefferson, Switzerland, Jennings, and Scott counties would say about this, knowing that Sullivan
                    was, comparatively speaking, a young man, even younger than the Governor, while Judge Dewey had

            <p>Judge Dewey, in a letter published in the <hi rend="i">Republican Banner</hi> of February 10, 1847,
                    charged Governor Whitcomb with bad faith, declaring that the latter had promised, in the presence of

                    later successful.</p>
            <p>During his term of office, Judge Sullivan wrote nearly three hundred decisions of the court; in the
                    November term, 1838, he wrote the fewest, ten; while in the November term, 1843, he wrote the
                    largest number, twenty-seven. Although the court reporter noted that Sullivan "in
                    consequence of indisposition" was absent until the tenth day of the November term, 1845,
                    which was his last, he still managed to write eighteen of the court's decisions. The
                    Governor's statement that Sullivan was too old for his position was ridiculous, for when he
                    retired from the court he was but fifty-two. His judicial opinions revealed a vast fund of legal
                    learning and research, and were, in general, well written, brief, to the point, and well documented
                    with authorities. Of them a contemporary, William W. Woollen, wrote: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Judge Sullivan, in common with most Whigs, opposed this war from beginning to end. Under the
                    signature of "Col. Pluck," he wrote a series of articles for the <hi rend="i">Republican Banner</hi> concerning it. Previous to the declaration of war, in campaign speeches
                    at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Senator Jesse D. Bright and Congressman Thomas J. Henley had ridiculed the idea of war
                    with Mexico, then presaged by the administration's policy, and had declared that if it did
                    come they would clean out Mexico with a regiment of women, armed with broomsticks. These extravagant
                    promises became the target of Sullivan's pen, dipped in rich satire.</p>
            <p>In a letter to the <hi rend="i">Banner,</hi> printed on May 27, 1846, Sullivan praised the editor for
                    being one of the wise men who had lifted up their voices "against the unholy measures which
                    have brought about the present state of affairs." He stated that it was a war which would
                    have been avoided if the administration had been in competent hands. He asked if the
                    "democratic leaders who have been foisted into office by the cry of <placeName>

                    blood in defense of <placeName>

            <p>"Col. Pluck's" next letter, of June 3, 1846, was replete with skillful and
                    humorous thrusts that must have caused the victims to grow hot with wrath. He asked these
                    "Democratic leaders" to take a part in the fighting, saying: "I would not
                    give a copper for their speeches and paper resolutions; we can do without them. We want no flashes
                    of wit, nor paper wads. It is the flash of gunpowder, and the whiz of the leaden ball that are
                    needed at this time." He spoke of Henry Clay's "Raleigh Letter,"
                    and noted that Henley had called Clay a fool; that the former had laughed "as men without
                    brains often do, at the language of wisdom and experience as uttered by Mr.
                    Clay…." Through a long-paragraph he spoke of the "brave and chivalric
                    Henley, the Sagacious Henley, the sapient Henley," and finally ended with this gibe: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            get along without them, and I am not sure the army can. And besides, they agreed to take

                    Finally, on July 8, 1846, "Col. Pluck" declared that he was off to Mexico, to see
                    how the war was being conducted, and to perform "deeds of noble daring." Stating
                    that his soul despised such "things" as Henley, Bright, and Whitcomb, he
                    proclaimed that "Governor Whitcomb, the man without a soul" could not hold him
                    back and keep him boiling in the sun until he decided whether he would accept money from banks to
                    clothe and feed him. Then, late in September, there appeared another letter from the sarcastic
                    Colonel, pretending to come from Mexico, at Taylor's camp. He avowed that his thirst for
                    glory continued unabated, but that he did not think there was any particular glory to be gained in
                    fighting for <placeName>

                    soldiers felt they could gain as much glory by fighting an army of women. To his mind it was

                    </placeName> for the sake of extending slavery. He noted with indignation that the troops from <placeName>

                    the two were warm friends. Sullivan was careful, therefore, to hide his identity, even, it is said,
                    going so far as to have the articles copied by another before sending them to the office of the
                    paper. Soon after the above mentioned letter appeared, the editor of the <hi rend="i">Banner</hi>
                    promised that another would soon arrive from Mexico, but that of September 16 seems to have been the

            <p>Soon the war came to an end, Thomas returned home, as did several other soldiers who felt convinced
                    that their brave deeds fitted them for the presidency, and the country settled down to an uneasy,

            <p>President Zachary Taylor's death led Judge Sullivan to remark to Algernon: "God
                    seems to have a controversy with our nation. We cannot foresee the consequences of Gen.
                    Taylor's death. At present it looks like a chastisement, but it may be that He who sent it,

                    that the General was highly pleased, but Sullivan thought his own reception speech was badly

            <p>Today the iron and steel industry of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> is definitely an out-moded, dwindling industry. In terms of modern economics it is a
                    misplaced industry and exists in its present form largely because of an early start and local
                    initiative. As the present equipment becomes obsolete, it is not being replaced. The Hoosier Rolling
                    Mills ceased production before 1930, leaving Highland Iron and Steel, one of the twelve divisions of
                    the American Chain and Cable Company, as the only rolling mill that remained in operation over a
                    period of time. This plant discontinued operations early in 1940, its employment having declined
                    over 50 per cent within the last two decades. The plant and equipment, however, were purchased by a
                    hastily-formed, local corporation, Highland Iron and Steel, Incorporated, and by June it was
                    operating at almost three-fourths the capacity of its predecessor. The principal products of the new
                    company is railroad "frog iron filler" and about thirty railroad supply houses
                    receive their stock from this plant.</p>
            <p>Many of the principal concerns have been foundries or manufacturers of mining machinery or
                    transportation equipment and they have become consistently less important as mining decreased within
                    the immediate area. Of the four major foundries in 1920, two, the American Car and Foundry Plant and
                    the Eagle Iron Works, have been discontinued, and only one of the producers of malleable iron
                    castings at that time remains in operation. The machinery interests, however, are not the only
                    establishments that have declined, for the Columbian Enameling and Stamping Company has about
                    one-half the twelve hundred employees that were on its payroll twenty years ago. This industry has
                    suffered from the cheapness and popularity of aluminum, especially for kitchen ware. The proof that
                    this trend still continues is evidenced by the recent decision of the American Chain and Cable
                    Company to discontinue their Highland plant and by the fact that the employment of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> Malleable and Manufacturing Company has decreased twenty per cent within the last five
                    years.</p>
            <p>Outside of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, small foundries are the only <pb n="243" id="VAA4025-037-3-041"/> common form of metal
                    workings, the major exception being the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Steel Corporation, making structural steel bridges, which is one of the oldest plants
                    in the Valley. In addition, there are a few miscellaneous establishments using some form of steel as
                    a fabricating material. Telephones are manufactured at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceville</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Despite these major declines and failures, the number of metal processing plants
                    remains about the same. Metal containers (American Can Company), bronze and brass castings, scales,
                    and a greater variety of machinery and foundry products have replaced the lost concerns, but these
                    establishments may be classified as secondary metal industries and are generally smaller and less
                    important than the plants that preceded them. The iron and steel industry is rapidly assuming a
                    position of secondary importance and other forms of manufacture are becoming relatively more
                    significant in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s current industrial economy.</p>
            <p>In summary, the metal industries of the lower <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> Valley have experienced (1) an early development which was based on locational factors
                    that are no longer operative, (2) a lack of industrial linkage between the earlier iron and steel
                    products and the later types of manufacturing, and (3) a decline which is partially traceable to the
                    marginal nature of this group of manufactures. The development of the nineteenth century was
                    dependent upon a local coal supply, the <placeName>
                        <country reg="bl">Brazil</country>
                    </placeName> block coal, which is no longer associated with the industry. It used many nearby and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> ores which are no longer available. The local market (blacksmith shops, the makers of
                    agricultural implements, wagon and carriage builders, and the early foundries and railroad shops)
                    used large quantities of iron and steel which did not necessarily need to be of the standardized
                    quality that is demanded by modern industry. The metal industries are of a marginal character in
                    both their geographic and economic aspects. In the first case the location is not on the direct
                    route which connects the Appalachian coking coal and Mesabi iron ore and the area has access to no
                    other raw metals within a reasonable <pb n="244" id="VAA4025-037-3-042"/> distance. The market is
                    limited in a similar manner for the Valley is on the edge of the manufacturing belt of America.
                    Competition of the more firmly entrenched competitors has tended to retard the development in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> and other <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, during my youthful years, was a busy river town with many freight and
                    passenger boats plying up and down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> River from the great steel city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> to the famous southern terminus of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Such steamboats as the "New South," "John K.
                    Speed," "Guiding Star," and many others did a flourishing business,
                    stopping at all of the larger towns. I have seen the "New South" on its northern
                    trip land at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> laden with tobacco, cotton, sugar cane, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> molasses, tropical fruits, nuts, rice, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> sugar, cocoanuts, and many other products too numerous to mention. These boats would,
                    often be so burdened with freight that the gunwale would not be far out of the water.</p>
            <p>It was a common occurrence for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> people to take a boat for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> on a Saturday morning to shop in the larger city. Many times have I taken this trip for
                    the small sum of fifty cents for the round trip. In good weather, the trips were quite delightful
                    and were enjoyed by many. On the return trip, the boat would leave <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> about five o'clock in the afternoon. The Captain would give the signal to
                    start to the pilot and also to the mate on the deck below, and the mate in turn would direct the
                    deck hands to cut loose the guy lines that held the boat fast to the shore. There were various bell
                    signals from the pilot to the engineer below, each having its particular meaning. Soon we would be
                    in midstream, steaming up the River on our way home. The management of the boat always interested me
                    as no doubt it did other passengers on board. One of my brothers and myself were so impressed with
                    the sounds of the puffing engine, the forcing of the great black smoke from the smoke stacks, the
                    pounding of the buckets, the escaping steam, the massive wheel that propelled the boat as the
                    buckets struck the water, and various other sounds that we learned to imitate them and often gave
                    imitations to our friends at small gatherings from time to time.</p>
            <p>The boat would pick up all kinds of freight on the way up or down the River on such occasions, and I
                    recall that there was a stop at Utica, Indiana, where a lime kiln was located, for the loading of
                    many barrels of lime. Two deck <pb n="246" id="VAA4025-037-3-044"/> hands, or roustabouts as they
                    were sometimes called, would go to the top of the long hill to start the barrels of lime down the
                    chute that extended from the top of the hill to near the River's edge. When a barrel was
                    started on its journey down the hill, one of the fellows at the top would call, "Look o-u-t
                    below-o." The colored deck hand would give this alarm in a singsong manner so
                    characteristic of his race. Two other deck hands were stationed at the lower end to receive the
                    barrels to be loaded on the boat.</p>
            <p>After the boat had finished the loading of the lime, she would pull out and steam up the River, only
                    to land on the <placeName>

                    </placeName> shore to pick up a crate of chickens or perhaps a calf for the market somewhere
                    upstream. Sometimes the deck hand would have trouble loading a calf as it would balk and he would
                    twist its tail to make it move along. This particular stunt was quite amusing for it would often
                    cause the negro, who was trying to get the calf aboard, no little trouble. Sometimes while loading
                    hogs, one of them would get away from the deck hands. Several minutes were often required in
                    catching the hog, and the leaving of the boat would be delayed.</p>
            <p>Large quantities of peaches were shipped by river boats from the Dean Brothers' orchards,
                    which were famous all over the country at that time. These orchards were located on the top of steep
                    hills along the Indiana shore and not far from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charleston</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Quite often the boat would carry a small orchestra to furnish music, which of course added to the
                    enjoyment of the trip, especially on a moonlight night. Dancing was the popular pastime on these
                    trips and most of the passengers participated. Most of the boats were equipped with a bar, as there
                    were no prohibition laws to worry about in those days. One would see occasionally a person who had
                    imbibed too strongly, but not often. Possibly the fellows who drank in those days knew how to handle
                    themselves better than they do now.</p>
            <p>Another type of boat much enjoyed by young and old was the showboat. It was music to my ears to hear
                    the calliope playing the old familiar tunes such as "This House is Haunted,"
                    "Listen to the Mockingbird," and many others too numerous to mention. The music
                    caused much excitement for all <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> folk, as there would be a rush for the <pb n="247" id="VAA4025-037-3-045"/> river bank
                    to see the Showboat steaming up or down the River, as the case might be.</p>
            <p>A man by the name of Captain French owned one of these lovely boats which he christened "The
                    Sensation," He acted as its pilot for many years, showing up and down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> rivers, stopping at most of the smaller towns that dotted the banks of these two rivers
                    from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Showboats were towed by small stern wheel steamers, as the showboats did not have
                    power of their own.</p>
            <p>Captain and Mrs. French were close friends of my parents for many years and whenever they stopped at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, generally called at our home. Captain French was a typical showman of the
                    "Gay Nineties," for he always wore tailormade clothes of a distinctive pattern,
                    the long coat being the cutaway type worn by so many true gentlemen of that particular profession.
                    He was a man about five feet nine, slender build, flowing moustache, fairly sharp features, keen
                    blue eyes, and a tinge of crimson at the end of his long slender nose. He generally wore a black or
                    gray broad brimmed hat, and with an angular stride his appearance was quite striking. He possessed a
                    shrewd sense for business affairs and operated his showboat at a good profit. His wife was an
                    attractive woman and almost as keen for business as her southern styled husband, assisting him in
                    keeping track of income and expenditures, while he managed the showboat.</p>
            <p>Members of our family were often invited to see the show whenever the Frenchs' boat happened
                    to be passing our town. I recall one time in particular when they were to show at Carrollton, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, a small town located about eight miles up the River from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>. "The Sensation" came up the River reaching <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> the latter part of one September afternoon. Captain French had written to us stating
                    the time of his boat's arrival, inviting any or all of us to take in the show if we so
                    desired. He wrote that he would send a boat ashore from midstream to meet us instead of having to
                    land the showboat which would have been a much more difficult operation. One of my brothers and
                    myself decided to take the trip so at the appointed hour we were at the River's bank
                    waiting for "The Sensation" to arrive. It was not long until the boat appeared and
                    soon <pb n="248" id="VAA4025-037-3-046"/> we were in the smaller craft being escorted to the
                    showboat in midstream. As soon as we were aboard ship, the boat began steaming away for Carrollton.
                    It was not long before we arrived, whereupon the showboat was made fast to the bank in preparation
                    for the evening entertainment. With the calliope playing, the crowds began to assemble on the shore
                    with their minds set upon seeing the show. Soon they began pouring onto the boat and it was not long
                    until the theatre of the boat was quite filled.</p>
            <p>The seating arrangement consisted of regular folding theatre chairs which were quite comfortable and,
                    if my memory serves me right, were upholstered with a dark red material. The interior of the theatre
                    was attractively decorated, which, of course, was just another feature to draw the crowd. The show
                    itself was of the vaudeville type, consisting of dog and pony acts, acrobatic stunts, monologues,
                    and blackfaced comedians. The orchestra occupied the pit directly in front of the stage as it does
                    in most theatres.</p>
            <p>The entertainment was quite clever and lasted about two hours. As soon as the show was over and the
                    crowd dispersed, the boat was made loose from its moorings and we headed back down stream. When we
                    arrived at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> at the late hour of twelve, after bidding farewell to our friends for a pleasant
                    evening, the small boat was lowered along side and my brother and I were taken ashore.</p>
            <p>Several years later Captain French had another showboat built and named it "The New
                    Sensation." With the two boats they could cover more territory and serve more towns than
                    was possible with the older boat. Mrs. French took out a license to operate the new boat.</p>
            <p>River traffic was at its height in those days with freight, passenger, showboats, mailboats, and
                    towboats plying up and down the River, day in and day out, year in and year out. In the summer
                    months excursions on the ferryboats, which operated between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, would come up the River, stop at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> and then go on to Carrollton and return. These excursions took place almost every
                    Sunday during the summer months.</p>
            <p>Another means of transportation which was characteristic of those days has ceased to exist. This was
                    the mule drawn street cars. One could enter a car propelled by.one of those stubborn little long
                    eared animals and operated by <pb n="249" id="VAA4025-037-3-047"/> one man who collected the fares
                    in addition to driving the mule. If one wished to mail a letter and had to get stamps at the
                    postoffice, the obliging conductor would stop the car and wait for one to return and continue the
                    trip. Such privileges could be taken advantage of provided the errands happened to be along the
                    right of way. Now and then the little mule would be whipped and prodded to get him to move along a
                    little faster and sometimes this particular urging did not agree with his temperament. He would
                    "whale away" with both heels with a loud and resounding effect against the metal
                    front of the little street car. Such amusing incidents were always enjoyed by the passersby.</p>
            <p>The bus company used the fire engine horses from the engine house on Third Street to carry passengers
                    to and from trains and boats and often while the passengers were being transferred to their
                    destinations, the fire bells would ring, whereupon the bus driver would unhitch the horses
                    immediately, jump on one of them and away he would gallop to the engine house to answer the fire
                    alarm call, leaving the passengers stranded in the bus until the fire was over or until they became
                    tired of waiting and proceeded to walk.</p>
            <p>Like the horse drawn street cars, certain forms, customs, and practices that were followed in the
                    "Gay Nineties" are practically extinct now. It is interesting to note how times
                    have changed, old customs giving way to what we call more modern forms. In front of the cigar
                    stores, there was the Indian figure bedecked with feathers in gay colors, sometimes with a tomahawk
                    in the right hand and a bundle of cigars in the left, standing erect on a pedestal with one foot
                    advanced as though in the act of taking a step forward.</p>
            <p>Harness shops were much in evidence with their usual display of fine sets of harness with silver and
                    gold mountings, and martingale rings of various colors. There was also a rack of plain and fancy
                    buggy whips in front of the store to attract the buyer who possessed the horse and carriage so much
                    in use in that age. Life size figures of very realistic horses, dapple gray or a beautiful bay, with
                    full sets of harness bedecked with gold and silver mountings, occupied the front windows of the
                    harness shop. The owners of the stores were generally hard working, thrifty citizens who were well
                    respected by all who came in contact with them.</p>
            <p>The dress of men and women has changed much since <pb n="250" id="VAA4025-037-3-048"/> the nineties.
                    Women wore long and flowing skirts, bustles, shirt waists, tight fitting basques buttoned down the
                    front from head to waist, picture hats, high button shoes, lace collar and cuff sets, lorgnettes and
                    many other fittings peculiar to that period. The well dressed males wore silk hats, derbies, frock
                    and cutaway coat suits, high button and lace shoes, high stiff collars, stiff bosom shirts, ascot
                    ties or to use a slang expression "dirty shirt hiders," Windsor ties, and
                    detachable stiff cuffs equipped with metal clip cuff holders. Adornments for the men included heavy
                    gold watch chains, conspicuous watch charms, and stick pins. Gold headed canes were often carried.
                    In the winter men wore pulse warmers and ear tabs; the latter were connected together with a small
                    black cord that went under the chin to keep them from being lost or separated.</p>
            <p>Various happenings and pastimes, which were different from those of today, furnished excitement and
                    amusement for everyone. These included street corner fakers, Indian Medicine shows, skating parties
                    when the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> River was frozen over, prohibition evangelists — such as Francis Murphy and
                    son, the signing of the Blue Ribbon Pledge—which I did as a boy and have kept the faith,
                    Hi Henry's Minstrels, Robinson's Circus, Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show,
                    the burning of the Richwood Distilleries across the River on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> shore, strolling in the cemetery on Sunday, the first phonograph or graphophone, the
                    thrill of seeing the cinematograph or moving pictures, and Christmas entertainments at the churches.
                    It was a common custom on the Fourth of July to allow small boys to ring the bells in the fire
                    engine houses to proclaim to the civilians that the important day had arrived, much to the regret of
                    those who wished to take advantage of a holiday to sleep a little longer than common. I had the
                    pleasure of participating in this unusual form of entertainment so eagerly looked forward to by
                    small boys.</p>
            <p>Kerosene lamps were much in evidence in most of the homes as well as some of the stores. The question
                    of supply of the fuel was most important. One enterprising citizen conceived the idea of delivering
                    kerosene, or coal oil as it was commonly called, to the very door. It was a very common sight to see
                    "Coal Oil Bob," as he was called, driving his wagon up one street and down another
                    calling out his wares. <pb n="251" id="VAA4025-037-3-049"/> He made a comfortable living following
                    his trade and was a man who was well liked, as he was jovial and sociable.</p>
            <p>Besides "Coal Oil Bob" whose occupation has ceased to exist in these modern times,
                    there was a poor little old man, Josie —, <hi rend="i">by name,</hi> who eked out an
                    existence by selling wood shavings which were used in starting fires. He gathered the shavings at
                    the cooper shop. He could be seen coming slowly along the street with a couple of gunny sacks filled
                    to overflowing with the shavings on his much deformed back. He was anything but the picture of
                    cleanliness as he strode along with a week's growth of hair upon his grizzled tawny face.
                    He thought that he was a rhymester and soon would have the boys gathered around him begging for
                    poetry. His verse was generally very poor, for instance, to me he would rhyme
                    thus—"Mr. Teebits went to Shebits." It seemed amusing to us at any rate
                    as we always urged him to continue. I think he sold a whole sack of shavings for the small sum of
                    five cents. He was obliged to walk a couple of miles to the cooper shop to secure additional
                    shavings and then back again through the residential part of the town calling out his wares. As I
                    now look back over these years, I can't help thinking how the poor old fellow suffered and
                    sacrificed the joys of real living, merely to make a few pennies to keep body and soul together.
                    Fortunately, for those in such circumstances, commodities were exceptionally low in price, otherwise
                    such fellows would not have lived very long. Josie was a good-natured old fellow and apparently
                    always willing to amuse the small boys with his very simple rhyming.</p>
            <p>At one time <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> was policed by a town marshal, who was short of stature, stockily built, but not fleet
                    of foot. The boys tormented him by making up rhymes about him that were anything but elevating to
                    say the least. He would swear savagely at the culprits and at the same time try to overtake them,
                    but all in vain. I don't think that any fellow bent on thieving or otherwise breaking the
                    law had need to worry about this town marshal being able to catch him in a foot race. He occupied
                    the position until the time of more modern forms of policing.</p>
            <p>Dick —, another of these town characters, was full of wit and humor. He was in his element
                    when full of other things, and was perfectly harmless even when hardly <pb n="252" id="VAA4025-037-3-050"/> able to keep his feet after too much imbibing, which was quite
                    habitual. One of his clever pranks was supposed to have taken place during a trip to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. Entering one of the old time favorite rednezvous, he called for a good old drink of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> Bourbon. The bartender, anxious to please and to show the proper southern hospitality,
                    brought forth Dick's favorite brand. The latter remarked as he drank: "This is
                    fine whiskey, Brother." To this the bartender replied: "There is none
                    better." After taking several drinks and chatting a few minutes, with never an offer to
                    pay, the bartender said: "Well, how about the pay?" "Oh," said
                    Dick, pretending to go through all of his pockets, "that's funny, I thought I had
                    some money," although he did not have any money when he entered the place and was only
                    stalling for time. The bartender then immediately booted Dick out on the sidewalk. His feelings were
                    hurt to say nothing of the rest of his anatomy. It was often said that no one could get ahead of
                    Dick and this case was no exception, for he walked around the streets until the rush hour at the
                    closing of the stores, when he entered the same saloon, which was quite crowded. Being a man of
                    small stature, Dick wedged himself between two big fellows in order not to be noticed so quickly,
                    and called for a glass of whiskey from the same bartender who had ejected him from the building not
                    so many hours before. The bartender did not recognize the little man until he began to collect from
                    the various customers he had served. Then seeing Dick's familiar face, he exclaimed:
                    "What, you here again?" Whereupon, Dick, raising the tails of his long coat, said:
                    "Yes, come and get your pay." The bartender thought the joke a clever one and
                    invited Dick to have one on the house. "Being under the weather," as the saying
                    goes, this unique character was in a happy mood most of the time and it was not uncommon to see
                    several persons gathered around him while he talked glibly. Even little folk enjoyed listening to

            <p>I suppose that most small towns have had and still have their peculiar characters that are a
                    continual source of amusement to the town-folk. Among those at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> might be mentioned the one-armed Civil War veteran who was always on hand to fire the
                    cannon on the Fourth of July and on <pb n="253" id="VAA4025-037-3-051"/> other patriotic occasions.
                    Then there was old Fred —, who was partially paralyzed, whose reddish
                    face—caused by habitual drinking—was generally covered with a week's
                    growth of beard, and who was teased by the youngsters in order to hear his flow of language, which
                    was fit only for a pirate. Jimmie — made his living distributing handbills and running
                    errands. He was quite untidy in appearance, his big, round face being generally covered with a
                    stubby, unruly beard, and his vest being the sole beneficiary of a careless gormandizer. He made
                    various claims about his ability to eat large quantities of food and was said to have refused to
                    enter a contest in the East unless the officials would pay his board during the contest. It was his
                    custom to break off a conversation especially on Saturday with the remark: "I must go home
                    now and take my bath."</p>
            <p>Of a very different character, are recollections of Alex Lanier and Edward Eggleston. The former was
                    the eldest son of J. F. D. Lanier, and to him was left the beautiful old colonial home which
                    overlooks the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> River and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> hills beyond. The grounds were surrounded by substantial stone walls with double iron
                    gates leading to the entrance of the stately old home. By peering through these gates on hot summer
                    days Alex Lanier could be seen sitting under the shade of the lovely old trees, surrounded by
                    tropical plants, fanning himself while lounging comfortably in a large arm chair. He was a bird dog
                    fancier and kept quite a kennel of fine bird dogs.</p>
            <p>As a boy I remember seeing the author of <hi rend="i">The Hoosier Schoolmaster</hi> as he walked
                    about the streets of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> attending to his daily affairs. He was a fairly tall man, with shoulders somewhat
                    stooped, a head of heavy gray hair and rounded features. His dress consisted of a suit of pure black
                    cloth with a cutaway coat and black fedora hat. I fancy I can see him now as he rode about town on
                    an early make of tricycle. He lived with relatives on Main Street between Broadway and Plum streets
                    for a number of years. He seemed to be a man of few words, studious, and of noble character.</p>
            <p>All in all the "Gay Nineties" were most interesting and peaceful times in which to
                    live, when friends were real friends and willing to lend a helping hand with kind and sympathetic
                    feelings for the other fellow in times of trouble. Gangsters <pb n="254" id="VAA4025-037-3-052"/>
                    were unheard of, there were no burglaries of any consequence nor was there any purse-snatching.
                    Automobiles did not extend the daily toll or make walking so dangerous. Most houses were never
                    locked and one could trust a fellowman with almost anything that might be given or loaned to him.
                    People attended church, and also prayer meeting in the middle of the week. The young folk were more
                    considerate of their elders to whose advice they listened quite attentively. Perhaps this was
                    because the parents used the switch to good advantage upon their offspring and because its
                    impressions were quite lasting. Simple living such as filled the lives of folk in the
                    'nineties was most conducive to sincere and strong friendships, more pronounced religious
                    tendencies, a stronger faith in mankind, and more brotherly love.</p>

                    adopted to designate the focus or group which Mr. Quimby finds belongs to the Hopewellian phase.</p>
            <p>The paper is the result of the study by the author of all the available material on the Hopewellian
                    culture phase in <placeName>

                    Society. The article is an excellent illustration of the progress now being made in the study of the
                    Mound Builders (prehistory has become the most generally accepted term) by a careful and detailed
                    analyses of the material thus far recovered from the mounds, by a comparison of the characteristics
                    of artifacts recovered from the mounds which are excavated, and of the reported structure of the
                    mounds, burial customs, et cetera. It is largely by such detailed studies that the true relationship
                    and grouping of the people who built the mounds can be discovered. In the absence of written record
                    and in the absence of survival of any of the social and political divisions with which we are
                    familiar in historical times, the archaeologist must find the basis for the smaller and larger units
                    of his study as well as work out his classifications. Mr. Quimby's article may well
                    establish a basis for further progress in the study of the ascending series of smaller and larger
                    units along which the culture of the Mound Builders developed—sites which are components
                    of foci belonging to the Hopewellian, and other phases of the great patterns of the prehistoric

                        <pb n="256" id="VAA4025-037-3-054"/> the Society of Indiana Pioneers, and the Historical Bureau.
                    The two societies share equally the expenses of the Conference and the Historical Bureau publishes
                    the Proceedings (usually the February number of the <hi rend="i">Indiana History Bulletin</hi>). All
                    the historical organizations in the state are invited to participate in the Conference; a number of
                    them are represented on the program and some members of all of them are usually in attendance. There
                    are special sessions during the Conference of the Business History Society, college teachers of
                    history, the Indiana Association of the History of Medicine, junior historical societies, the
                    Indiana History Teachers Association and local historical societies. Both the Indiana Historical
                    Society and the Society of Indiana Pioneers have their annual business meeting and general session
                    during the Conference. Among those on the committee in charge of the Conference this year are Emsley

                        <salute>My dear Sir—</salute>
                        <p>I come now to redeem my promise, after too much delay, I admit, but yet as soon as I
                                    could find leisure. I know you will pardon the delay, under the circumstances, and
                                    also my use of this paper, for I have no better at hand.</p>
                        <p>You needed to offer no apology for writing me as you did, and I accept your inquiries
                                    as complimentary to myself, and assure you of my sincere appreciation of your kind
                                    Expressions towards me. I deeply fear that I will not be able to make any useful or
                                    satisfactory response to your inquiries. But I will reply in the same spirit of
                                    frankness &amp; patriotism in which you write.</p>
                        <p>My feelings of interest &amp; sympathy toward your people and section have for
                                    years been Earnest and warm. At ti[mes<hi rend="sup">8</hi>] my reflections upon
                                    your unhappy con[di]tions have been such as to fill [me with] sadness. Your letter
                                    recalls many of [my] thoughts. Its references to the manner in which, your local and
                                    national relations, are Environed and Embarrassed by [diffi]culties &amp;
                                    dangers, are so truthful [as to] produce real pain.</p>
                        <p>Many of the evils with which your people &amp; section are affilicted result
                                    logically and directly from certain fundamental changes in our institutions during
                                    the last decade. It is a truism, under any system of elective and representative
                                    institutions that, the body of the representatives will never rise very much above
                                    the body of Electors in virtue, intelligence and patriotism. Therefore, whatever
                                    tends to debauch or demoralize the body of electors, will certainly bear fruit of
                                    like character in the body of representatives. The influence of these principles has
                                    been productive of its most Enduring &amp; disastrous results in your section.
                                    These are things to be profoundly deplored, but they should not be allowed to Excite
                                    unmanly despondency. That, by these Events and influences, the immediate
                                    representation in Congress from your section has been to a great Extent robbed of
                                    its former high and noble qualities, of its culture and discipline, of its courage
                                    and unpurch[a]sable integrity, and of its truly conserva[tive] character, as
                                    illustrated in our Early [poli]tics, is matter for most <list type="footnotes">

                                    were sent up before the war, [wou]ld now be returned, without the dis[ad]vantage of

                                    mark for the honor, welfare and happiness of all sections of our country! Such a
                                    boon may not be anticipated for our country in our time, if it come even within half
                                    a century.</p>
                        <p>But, after all, our greatest duties are to be met and discharged with constant
                                    reference to the present and the future—not the past, Except as the
                                    latter may be appealed to for suggestion &amp; Experience. The evil conditions
                                    are upon us, and we cannot go back—we must go forward, whether wisely or
                                    not. You, I feel no doubt, in the most keenly sensitive manner, appreciate Existing
                                    Conditions and the changed relations they bring in many important respects to public
                                    men. You ask me what I, if a southern representative, with my present knowledge of
                                    Northern Conditions &amp; sentiments, would do, and how I would direct my
                                    conduct. The question is not improper to ask, but is certain[ly] very difficult to
                                    answer. If with my [pres]ent Knowledge of Northern feeling [and] political
                                    sentiments, I were also in as full possession of the same information touching the
                                    South as you are, then [I] could give you intelligent answers. [But] I am unhappily
                                    only in possession of <hi rend="i">half</hi> the situation, and cannot advise with
                                    any desirable fullness of information. Yet during Eight years of Congressional
                                    service, I have watched with deepest interest the Conduct of Southern
                                    representatives in Congress, and some convictions have resulted therefrom concerning
                                    the mistakes of Southern representatives. I may, perhaps, not improperly, resort to
                                    this source for some suggestions.</p>
                        <p>With my views of public duty, I would do as a southern representative just what I
                                    would do as a northern representative, save only my action in reference to matters
                                    Essentially local—in Contradistinction to matters general, national, or
                                    political. Sectionalism, in its real, hurtful, and malign signification, arises not
                                    out of devotion in a mere local &amp; now political sense to domestic interests,
                                    but also solely out of divisions by geographical lines upon questions [of] public
                                    policy which in truth and fact affect in a real and active sense all parts and
                                    sections of the country. The latter, not the former, are the political issues which
                                    arouse passion, or prejudice, or fears. I am sure you will agree with me that, while
                                    our country remains a unit under Existing institutions, the South in any controversy
                                    of a sectional Character has infinitely more to apprehend than the North, and has,
                                    therefore, more to gain, more good results to secure, and more dangers to avoid, by
                                    conduct and policy distinctly national and conservative. As a friend and servant of
                                    the South, I would therefore deprecate and Condemn the spirit of sectionalism, and I
                                    would discountenance Every attempt among southern representatives to organize in
                                    such a spirit for the attainment of any purpose, and I would struggle with steady
                                    aim and Energy to Square my conduct as a public officer and law-maker by the rule of
                                    the most broad, national, just and conservative principles. I would accept the part,
                                        <pb n="260" id="VAA4025-037-3-058"/> so far as its results have been
                                    incorporated into our system, and look to the future for reform, improvemen[t] and
                                    amelioration. I would de[]ly and do right towards all, as far [as] my ability would
                                    Enable me to [do.] I would strive to develope [<hi rend="i">sic.</hi>] and
                                    [en]courage hope and cheerfulne[ss] amongst my people, and give m[y] Earnest and
                                    Effective thought [and] Efforts to the improvement, moral, intellectual, political,
                                    and material, of the body of Electors. This is in truth the greatest field, now
                                    demanding most wise and patient culture, that is open to the really true, good,
                                    generous and patriotic men of the South. The absence of the needful improvement in
                                    these respects amongst your Electors, as now Constituted, is the most fruitful
                                    &amp; fatal source of your misfortunes, and of many misfortunes to the whole
                                    country. The task is one of almost disheartening magnitude. It cannot be
                                    accomplished in a day, or a generation. But it <hi rend="i">must</hi> be
                                    accomplished before thorough and permanent political reform and regeneration can be
                                    secured. It may appear to be a harsh judgment, but it is just and true, that your
                                    representative bodies in the south, and many also in the North, and Even Congress
                                    itself, are corrupt <hi rend="i">because</hi> [the] Constituencies who make the
                                    representatives are Corrupt. The reforms [ou]r Entire Country now needs, [to] be
                                    Effective, must begin in the [re]form of the people themselves, in the cultivation
                                    and practise of higher morality, more honesty, and a general reäwakening
                                    of more Enlightened popular Conscience. Moral insensibility now rules the country.
                                    Selfish, low, and grovelling aspirations now too often usurp control where manly
                                    courage, unselfish patriotism, and incorruptible integrity alone should govern. It
                                    is in view of these reflections and facts, that I rejoice to know that you, one man
                                    at least, Endowed with the qualities and the Experience which fit you for useful
                                    &amp; honorable public service are returned to the House. I by no means agree
                                    that it is a mistake for you to reënter public life. It is Entirely
                                    practicable for you, although almost alone, to Exercise such a Wholesome &amp;

            <head>SOME LETTERS OF JUDGE JEREMIAH C. SULLIVAN</head>
            <byline>Edited by J<hi rend="sc">OSEPH</hi> H<hi rend="sc">ERMAN</hi> S<hi rend="sc">CHAUINGER</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>Some of the letters of Judge Sullivan, whose career has been sketched in an article in this issue of
                    the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> seemed too important to be omitted and yet too
                    long to be quoted in an article of this type. Selections from them, together with some parts of less
                    important letters, have been brought together in order that the Judge's character might be
                    seen from his own writings and that the evidence which the letters contain of developments in
                    Indiana and the nation might be more readily available to students of history.</p>
            <p>The first two letters have less historical significance than the others, but they do reveal the
                    intense religious nature of Judge Sullivan, while the third contains an expression of religious
                    imperialism which is not often seen. Along with his spiritual earnestness went a hostility towards
                    the theatre, which found expression in the seventh letter. The fear of cholera in the river towns
                    and something of the methods used to combat it are described in letters four, five, and eight. That
                    this fear nor the disease itself did not seriously interfere with the prosperity of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in which the Sullivan family lived, is made clear by the sixth letter. Little
                    items of political news are found in the next two selections. Letters eleven to sixteen indicate the
                    reaction to the troubled national situation in 1860 and 1861 as the Civil War began. After these are
                    six letters telling of the entanglement of one of the Judge's sons with the federal
                    government on charges of disloyalty because the son undertook to act as attorney for Confederate
                    privateers <pb n="262" id="VAA4025-037-3-060"/> in order to prevent their treatment as pirates. The
                    last six letters give more or less minor sidelights on the progress of the war, such as the Morgan
                    Raid, and the draft trouble in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> City. Throughout the series the intense nationalism and loyalty of the Judge are
                    evident. His dislike of the southern leaders, whom he held responsible for the war, must have been
                    representative of northern opinion that supported the Radical Republicans during the Reconstruction
                    Era. This change, from the indifference for Free Soilism in 1852, to the vigorous hostility towards
                    slavery and the South during 1860–1864, is probably the most important feature of these
                    documents.</p>
            <p>Only parts of each letter are printed; personal salutations, and items of family interest were
                    omitted. Where the omissions occur within the portions quoted, these omissions are indicated in the
                    usual manner, otherwise no indication is given. Nothing has been done to change the meaning of the
                    letters; spelling, abbreviations, capitalization, italics, and the like are given as found in the
                    originals. Brackets indicate any added explanatory material. The letters are part of the Sullivan
                    Collection in the William Henry Smith Library of the Indiana Historical Society in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. A very few of the letters have been retained by the family, but typewritten
                    copies of important portions of these have been placed in the collection. </p>

                        <p>I expected to have received a letter from you before this time <pb n="263" id="VAA4025-037-3-061"/> but have been disappointed. I am sorry you are so
                                    backward about writing. You should improve opportunities for letter writing, that
                                    you may, by practice and use, become a good letter writer. It is a handsome
                                    accomplishment, and can only be acquired by practice. No man will ever write a good
                                    letter, or generally he will not write good letters until he shall have written some
                                    poor ones. The epistolary style cannot be acquired from books, because the familiar,
                                    conversational style which ought to be employed in letter writing, is not to be
                                    found in them. I would recommend to you to keep a scrap book in which to write down
                                    your thoughts … as a means of improving yourself in every sort of
                                    composition….</p>
                        <p>Whether our University will continue or not is yet somewhat doubtful, though I hope
                                    it may….</p>
                        <p>But I would not have you <hi rend="i">always</hi> at your books. You must give some
                                    time to the exercise of thought and meditation, so as to digest the food you take
                                    into your mind. It is possible for a man to possess a great deal of <hi rend="i">knowledge</hi> and have but little wisdom. Learned <hi rend="i">dunces</hi> are
                                    not uncommon. <hi rend="i">Knowledge &amp; wisdom</hi> are very different
                                    things….</p>
                        <p>Whatever you study or read therefore, meditate upon, until you make every thought
                                    your own and can express it in your own language. <hi rend="i">Think</hi> about it
                                    until you are able to make a practical use of it. You should also relax the mind by
                                    cheerful conversation &amp; singing occasionally; and do not forget that
                                    necessary exercise which the <hi rend="i">body</hi> needs for health.</p>
                        <p>Having said so much about knowledge &amp; wisdom, I should not omit to point you
                                    to the source of all wisdom &amp; knowledge. If wisdom be desirable, surely that
                                    wisdom that is calculated to secure to us the greatest amount of good, is what we
                                    ought to aim after. "The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom."
                                    Cultivate in your heart a reverence for the <hi rend="i">name</hi> and <hi rend="i">authority</hi> of God …. Let your thoughts ascend to Him frequently
                                    that He would guide … and especially that He would use you, if your life
                                    be spared, in that way that will most advance His glory and your good. …</p>

                        <p>I cannot forbear to drop you a line expressing the deep regret &amp; sorrow I
                                    felt today on hearing that you were <hi rend="i">seen at a Theatre</hi> in Cintti
                                    one evening during the last week. I felt not only <hi rend="i">sorrow</hi> but <hi rend="i">disappointment.</hi> When we first contemplated your settlement in
                                    Cintti.; I felt some apprehensions, I admit, that you might possibly be led away by
                                    the fascinations of the City, but my confidence in yr sincerity as a Christian
                                    professor overcame them,—and subsequently not hearing that you visited
                                    such places led me to believe &amp; feel confident that you did not. I was
                                    therefore <hi rend="i">disappointed</hi> when I heard what to me was sad news. I
                                    trust that you yourself have regretted <pb n="265" id="VAA4025-037-3-063"/> it since
                                    it occurred. I think your pastor when he hears it will mourn over it. There are many
                                    members of yr Church that will have no confidence in your piety. Your usefulness to
                                    some extent, indeed, a <hi rend="i">great</hi> extent, will be gone, &amp; I
                                    hope in yr own bosom there is a feeling that you have done wrong. If the 2d Church
                                    were composed of Theatre going christians, what good would it accomplish. Certainly
                                    none. As the whole church should be, so should <hi rend="i">every member</hi> be.</p>
                        <p>Now, my dear Son, I write this for your eyes only. I wish you to resolve the subject
                                    in your own mind, &amp; take it with you to yr closet. If you do not perceive
                                    your error, you will then be in a worse condition than I have supposed. If you feel
                                    that you have done wrong repent sincerely ….</p>
                        <p>The Family has heard nothing of it, and I intend to say nothing to them about it. The
                                    sincere love I bear you, &amp; my desire for your advancement as a christian
                                    prompts what I have written ….</p>

                                    himself to the Gov. received orders to march the same day, and on yesterday marched.
                                    I found him to be extremely popular. Men rushed to his standard, while others who
                                    had been trying to raise companies here for weeks were not near full. The excitement
                                    by the attack on Sumter had the effect to fill his ranks so soon, yet it was very
                                    manifest that he was considered as <hi rend="i">the boy</hi> for the business on

                                    of doubt but that 4/5ths of the people of Indiana are willing to enroll themselves
                                    to fight the Confederate Army as readily as they would an army of foreign invaders.
                                    The feeling is intense, &amp; it will be manifested in the coming contact.</p>

                        <p>I am not surprised when you say "that I (you) am peculiarly unhappy at the
                                    pending war." It is undoubtedly a source of unhappiness to all good men.
                                    But I am surprised that you should, after all that has transpired, feel the least

                                    deserve it, &amp; deserve the doom of thieves and traitors. They have rebelled
                                    against the Govt., and not content with a quiet secession, have attacked and
                                    destroyed Govt. property, but have boldly &amp; defiantly proclaimed that they

                                    take possession &amp; be the Govt—and all this to inaugurate a
                                    Government on the principles enunciated by Vice-Prest. (as he is called) Stephens in
                                    his late speech to his Georgian constituents.</p>
                        <p>No, my son, there should be no sympathy for such men. They ought to be mowed down as
                                    a mower would mow the grass in his meadow. God has permitted this rebellion for wise
                                    and glorious purposes. Slavery will be destroyed, or the <hi rend="i">system</hi>
                                    greatly mitigated, and our country will come out of the conflict the most powerful
                                    nation on the globe. I do not say that there will be a reconstruction. Perhaps not.
                                    I do not think it desirable that there should be, but the heresy of secession will
                                    be rebuked, and rebellion will not again raise its head. I hope there will not be
                                    much shedding of blood as some people apprehend. <placeName>

                                    Regt. and public opinion were too strong for him to overcome, and he was compelled
                                    to yield. I don't think he had any particular objection to Jerry, but he
                                    thought he might possibly advance his own interests by appointing somebody else. I

                        <p>Your letter of the 11th inst came to hand within the last hour. I had heard of
                                    Algernon's arrest, but knew no particulars until today. This afternoon I
                                    saw Mr. Seward's letter of the 11th to Mr. Lord. When the news first
                                    reached me I felt neither alarmed nor mortified, believing that he had done nothing
                                    but what he might properly do in the line of his profession, and that he was
                                    arrested on suspicion, and not from any evidence that the State Department had in
                                    its possession. But Mr. Seward's letter &amp; the extract from Mr.
                                    Lord's note to you, … have produced a little alarm. I still feel
                                    however that all that Algernon has written can be shown &amp; proved to be
                                    consistent with his duties to the Gov't to which he owes allegiance. I
                                    believe that he would not write or say anything <hi rend="i">intentionally</hi>
                                    traitorous.</p>
                        <p>I wrote today to Hon. Wm. M. Tunn, who is now at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, requesting him to call on the Secretary of State, and intercede on
                                    Algernon's behalf. Mr. Dunn is the member of Congress from this District. I
                                    also requested [him] to submit the letter to Mr. Seward. He knows Algernon and I
                                    think will befriend him. I will endeavor to enlist other gentlemen, who have
                                    influence at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, in Algernon's behalf. It may be some time before relief
                                    comes, but I feel assured it will come, and come too, without detriment to his
                                    character.</p>
                        <p>Can you not, through your Uncle Griffin Taylor at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, procure a large petition to the President for Algernon's
                                    liberation? <pb n="269" id="VAA4025-037-3-067"/> Try it, and I will try my hand with
                                    Judge Stern &amp; others.</p>
                        <p>I do not feel able to travel to <placeName>

                                    </placeName>, yet I will make the attempt if nothing else will do …. Be
                                    cheerful, but <hi rend="i">very prudent</hi> in your conversation. Remember the
                                    times are out of joint, and neither party in the North or South will tolerate the
                                    least sympathy for the opposition.</p>

                        <p>When I get a correct understanding of the matter, I will know better, how to act. In
                                    the meantime I will endeavour to get such certificates of character &amp;
                                    letters to Mr. Lincoln as will be available. I anticipate some trouble, for the
                                    reason that the public mind is so excited that no tenderness is felt for anyone who
                                    does an act that has the <hi rend="i">least semblance</hi> of disloyalty. I do not
                                    say this because I think he is in any serious danger, but only to express the
                                    opinion that it will require time &amp; <hi rend="i">good management</hi> to
                                    obtain his release ….</p>
                        <p>Algernon, in the letters which have occasioned his arrest, may have written some
                                    imprudent sentences, but I know he is <hi rend="i">not disloyal.</hi> …
                                    If Algernon would draw up a petition to the President, setting forth his reasons for
                                    writing the letters, his objects in doing so—what he intended to
                                    accomplish, &amp;c., it would I think be of service to him….</p>

                        <p>I had also made arrangements with several prominent gentlemen in this State for their
                                    interference on behalf of Algernon, &amp; I was also expecting letters from
                                    them.</p>
                        <p>I had sent <hi rend="i">my pledge</hi> to Mr. Seward that Algernon was, in my opinion
                                    loyal, and that his family was also.</p>
                        <p>About eight o'clock last night, I was gratified to be informed by telegraph
                                    that "an order had been issued for the discharge of A. S.
                                    Sullivan." I presume therefore he is today with you &amp; Gordie.</p>
                        <p>I hope Algernon will make no objections to taking the <hi rend="i">prescribed
                                    oath.</hi> It binds him to do nothing more than every good citizen should do.</p>
                        <p>Although he is <hi rend="i">discharged</hi> from <hi rend="i">confinement,</hi> he is
                                    not yet <hi rend="i">out of danger.</hi> He may still be <hi rend="i">indicted.</hi>
                                    If he should be indicted it may be a serious matter with him. Mr. Seward insists
                                    that his correspondence with men in the South <hi rend="i">was treasonable.</hi>
                                    Tell Algernon that he <hi rend="i">must not contend</hi> with the Government. The
                                    odds are too great—he would be crushed.</p>
                        <p>I hope that Algernon and yourself will be careful not to say anything that can be
                                    construed into sympathy with the Confederates. The Government has a heavy burden to
                                    bear—the rebellion is a gigantic one, and what the result may or will be
                                    God only knows. <pb n="270" id="VAA4025-037-3-068"/> In the South, if a person (man
                                    or woman) expresses an attachment for the Union, he or she is hunted, punished,
                                    abused, imprisoned or murdered. This conduct produces a corresponding feeling in the
                                    North, and the time is rapidly approaching when all in the North who do not avow
                                    themselves in favor of suppressing the rebellion, will be considered and <hi rend="i">treated</hi> as favouring it.</p>
                        <p>Why a person should not give his support to the Government that protects him,
                                    although he may not approve its policy in all things, I cannot
                                    understand….</p>

                        <p>I cannot believe that you desire the success of the Southern Confederacy. You cannot,
                                    it seems to me, desire the success of an attempt to destroy not only our Govt. (the

                                    not necessary to loyalty. But captious efforts to thwart honest efforts to put down
                                    the rebellion, do look a little that way. Be honest, therefore, in the sight of God,
                                    in giving a sincere support to the constitutionally organized government. Take a
                                    stand by the side of such men as Gen. Dix and you will be right, that is, if I
                                    understand him.</p>

                                    &amp; patronage the odds against you would be fearful. Be therefore <hi rend="i">very prudent.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I think you ought to write a kind letter to Mr. Harris for the part he took in yr
                                    liberation….</p>
                        <p>I have not heard from Jerry for about a month. He was well when I last heard from
                                    him. He was about to go to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName> to interfere for you, if he could have obtained leave, &amp;
                                    probably would have gone if you had not been liberated.</p>

                        <p>I can't conceive why you or any other man can look upon this rebellion (or
                                    Civil War if you will have it so) but with the utmost horror and detestation. The
                                    disturbing cause is well understood, and the time has come for its removal, at least
                                    the signs of the times indicate something like it. It may be that God will afflict
                                    us with war, pestilence &amp; famine for a quarter of a century to come, but,
                                    the end will be the abolition of slavery. When that is accomplished we can be a

                                    son, your duty as a good citizen &amp; your duty to God require you to sustain
                                    the Government in its present struggle. You cannot be <hi rend="i">a happy man and
                                        not do so.</hi>

                                    seeking to tear down the Govt., let it be your delight to uphold it. As to a
                                    Southern Confederacy, that is out of the question. The Northwest will never consent
                                    that the mouth of the <placeName>

                                    are entitled to no mercy. I hope you will see this matter in its true light.</p>
                        <p>But, as you have appeared as a counsel of the Piratemen, at the request of Southern
                                    officials, a thing which I think you had a perfect right to do &amp; as you have
                                    suffered for it, I think you ought to be well paid for your services. But how are

                        <p>I am quite surprised at the information Mr. George Taylor of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Brooklyn</settlement>
                                    </placeName> gave you, as to the cause of your arrest. My first impulse was to write
                                    immediately to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName> for a copy of the letters on file, said to have been written by you
                                    &amp; on which you were arrested. But on reflection, I thought it not prudent to
                                    do so, until I could learn exactly &amp; fully the contents of the letters you
                                    did really write. I think it not best to meddle further with the matter unless I can
                                    be completely satisfied that you will be justified by public opinion, and held
                                    faultless in your course. We must not say or do anything that may excite the wrath

                                    to contend with, and you are not now entirely free from the possibility of danger.
                                    Be prudent, and you will live down the reproach of your arrest, if any reproach
                                    attached to you.</p>

                        <p>Newspapers inform me that he [Jerry] has been nominated by the presidt for Brigadier.
                                    What the result will be before the Senate I do not know. Gov. Morton has political
                                    favourites that he wd prefer to Jerry, and I feel quite certain that if he can
                                    procure Jerry's name to be withdrawn or rejected, that he wd do it,

                                    some doubt however growing out of the fact that the Senate is not inclined to make

                        <p>We are all very well, but the town is in great excitement. Guerillas are in Trimble

                                    are drilling here every day from 3 to 5 o'c p.m. all places of business
                                    closed. We are not yet under martial law to the fullest extent but will probably, in
                                    a few days. The object of the Guerrillas seems to be to supply themselves with
                                    horses &amp; arms and, to some extent provisions. A few nights ago they helped

                        <p>I congratulate you on your escape from the mob. I hope nothing has since happened to
                                    yr. injury or prejudice. I rejoice that the mob was put down. If Fernando Wood were
                                    put down with it, it wd. be a matter also to be rejoiced at. The Government is
                                    determined, I learn, to enforce the draft in N.Y. If it does not enforce
                                    it,—then we have <hi rend="i">no</hi> Government. Let the cannon
                                    &amp; the bayonet be used freely, <hi rend="i">if necessary,</hi> &amp; then
                                    we shall feel that our lives &amp; property are secure. I hope that Gov. Seymour
                                    and "his friends" will acquiesce….</p>

                            </placeName>. Having proceeded some miles, I met two travellers, with whom I breakfasted, at
                            an inn standing at the branching off of two roads, the one conducting to <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                            </placeName>, the other through Mercer; we chose the latter, and, although the longest, we
                            were amply repaid, by arriving to dine at a little town which delighted me, containing an
                            establishment without exception the most perfect that I have seen in America, and the only
                            one in which individual industry is directed to the general good. This town is called
                            Harmony, is regular, and built in the German style, in the centre of a fine valley. The
                            houses are of brick, and the roofs thatched. From this place I proceeded alone, entering a
                            dark forest, through which I advanced twelve miles without perceiving the trace of an
                            habitation. I this day performed thirty-six miles and gained the town of

                        <p>Leaving Pitzburg, I crossed the Allégany, and took the road to Fort
                                    Francklin. After covering a few miles through a wild country, I met two travelers;
                                    one of them, a German, spoke French pretty well for a German. We had lunch together
                                    at a wretched inn, located at the fork of two roads, both of which led to Erie, one
                                    by way of Francklin, the other by Mercer. We took the latter, and arrived at dinner
                                    time in a pretty little town whose aspect delighted me, and amply consoled me for
                                    having taken the longer route. This settlement, which is beyond a doubt the finest
                                    of its kind that I have seen in the interior of America, is the only one in which
                                    individual enterprise has been directed toward the common good. This town is named
                                    Harmony. It is regular, and built in the German manner, in the midst of a superb
                                    valley. The houses are of brick, and the garrets have thatched roofs. An immense
                                    orchard, planted in quincuncial fashion, lies to the rear as far as the little river
                                    which nearly encircles the valley. Several years before, seven or eight hundred
                                    Germans of a peculiar sect had followed a clergyman, who was their leader, into this
                                    region. At first, nothing disturbed them in their rites and ceremonials: everything
                                    was held in common among them; the work, as well, was equally apportioned. They
                                    formed a sort of happy little monarchy; they were beginning successfully to
                                    cultivate grapes on a knoll which rises in the middle of the valley, when, for
                                    reasons unknown, the leader suddenly sold the holdings for 500,000 francs,<hi rend="sup">6</hi> and went off with his followers to clear another piece of land
                                    on the <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                                    </placeName>, which flows in the west and empties much farther down, to the south,
                                    into the <placeName>

                                    he feared lest his proselytes eventually lose something of the strictness of the
                                    principles that he had inculcated in them. These lands, in the hands of divers
                                    individuals, are deteriorating daily. Independently of the sale he had made, the
                                    leader had reserved for himself several parcels, for the sale of which he had sent
                                    his son,<hi rend="sup">7</hi>6 whom I saw at the inn.</p>

            <p>Some of the topics upon which the volume contains a mass of material are: the events of the transfer
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>; the difficulties involved in the establishment of the American system of territorial
                    and local government, complicated by the desire of the native Creoles for immediate statehood and
                    their opposition to new forms of administration with which they were unfamiliar; the conflict
                    between the old and new systems of jurisprudence, and the consequent problems involved in
                    establishing the territorial judiciary according to the American pattern which was strange to the
                    bulk of the population; the strained relations between <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> over the transfer, and the anxiety of Governor Claiborne over the lingering of Spanish
                    officials in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> under various pretexts; the division of the new American residents into two political
                    factions, each seeking to enlist the support of the Creoles in an attempt to control the territorial
                    administration; the attempt to settle the vexing question of land titles and to establish the
                    rectangular system of land survey; the organization of the territorial militia; the extension of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> postal system to the territory and the improvement of postal communication with other
                    parts of the nation; the problem of defense of the territory against the threat of Spanish
                    encroachment from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> and internal commotions, such as the Kemper Insurrection, the Burr Conspiracy, <pb n="277" id="VAA4025-037-3-075"/> and the West <placeName>

                    </placeName> Revolution of 1810; the attempt to establish a system of free public schools along the
                    lines of Jefferson's ideas, in a region where the mass of the population had little or no
                    interest in such a forward-looking plan; the movement for statehood and its successful culmination
                    in 1812.</p>
            <p>There is also much material for the biographer in the lists of civil and military officials in the
                    territory as well as in other documents printed in the volume. The development of commerce and
                    internal improvement, the fear of slave insurrections and the anxiety as to the loyalty of the free
                    people of color, the dissatisfaction of the natives with the prohibition of the foreign slave trade
                    at a time when other parts of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> were still free to import slaves, the difficulty of preventing smuggling and the
                    enforcement of the Embargo Act, the high cost of living in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> as compared with other sections of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and a host of other interesting topics are here represented in a variety of documents.</p>
            <p>While by no means all the manuscript materials available on the history of the Territory of Orleans
                    are contained in this volume, the footnotes locate a vast store of other manuscript materials which
                    the thorough researcher will wish to consult. The information contained in the ample footnotes may,
                    however, be scant consolation for the student who is not in a position to gain access to the sources
                    therein cited.</p>
            <p>The printers have done an excellent job and have produced an attractive volume. There is a very
                    complete index. But the chief defect in the work is the failure of those transcribing the documents
                    to decipher correctly a large number of proper names. The reviewer has found more than fifty
                    instances of such incorrect transcriptions, all of which could easily have been detected by anyone
                    reasonably familiar with the family names in <placeName>

                    volume as a whole.</p>

            <p>This is a volume in the excellent Southern Biography Series, edited by Dean Wendell H. Stephenson and
                    Fred C. Cole of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> State University. General Wheeler furnished an interesting subject for a biography, and
                    he has fortunately fallen into good hands. The narrative flows smoothly, the style of the author is
                    unusually good, and the story is well organized. General Wheeler won renown in the Civil War, though
                    he was only in his twenty-ninth year when the conflict ended. His great successes as a cavalry
                    leader in the "Brothers' War," his capture along with Jefferson Davis in
                    the spring of 1865, his honorable career in the national House of Representatives, and his part in
                    the Spanish American War, when more than sixty years of age, made his life colorful.</p>
            <p>The long public career of Joseph Wheeler and his varied activities made it necessary for the author
                    to cover much material of different kinds and different periods. His notes and bibliography reveal
                    that his preparation for the biography was extensive. He was fortunate in having access to valuable
                    manuscript and printed sources, and was also aided by information contained in a number of scholarly
                    monographs. He has endeavored to acquaint himself with the wide range of geographical data necessary
                    to an understanding of the scattered campaigns engaged in by Wheeler during the Civil War. In some
                    instances, his references to geography are not very accurate, in others they are lacking in clarity.
                    One would judge from his map (opposite p. 88) that Powells River starts at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cumberland Gap</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Further, this map would be much better if additional rivers and mountain ranges had
                    been added. The following sentence is not easily understood by one who knows the geography of east <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>, and cannot help one who does not know it well: "Therefore he [Wheeler]
                    concluded it would be better to move northeastward up the river [<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>

                    </placeName> and Clinch rivers, cross them, and then ride southward again." Moving up the
                    left bank of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>, one could not cross the Little <placeName>

                    </placeName> and the Clinch rivers without crossing the <placeName>

                    </placeName> River between the two. Further, it does not seem that Wheeler <pb n="279" id="VAA4025-037-3-077"/> could be said to have reached the "headwaters" of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> in such a movement. The <hi rend="i">

                    one of high quality. It should commend itself to a wide circle of readers of historical works in
                    addition to persons interested in Southern history.</p>

                    systems of transportation, travel, and communication. It is unnecessary, therefore, to justify a
                    review of this series in a historical publication of Indiana. Some of the chapters of this volume
                    could almost be incorporated into a history of Indiana with only slight modifications. Since <placeName>

                    </placeName> is soon to have a similarly extensive work, the historians of Indiana will, no doubt,
                    be thinking of the possibility of securing such an adequate history of their state.</p>
            <pb n="280" id="VAA4025-037-3-078"/>
            <p>The volume begins with a description of the geographical foundation of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Country, particularly as it is related to glaciers, resources, and Indian
                    thoroughfares. The discussion is restrained in harmony with the conclusion that <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> is a political rather than a geographical unit. The second chapter is unique among the
                    other chapters for it is not the work of Professor Bond, but of Henry Clyde Shetrone, who is highly
                    qualified to write on "The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Aborigines." Professor Bond then resumes his task by describing the opening of
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Country to Europeans by the French, the crossing of the Appalachians by the English fur
                    traders, who engaged the French in serious competition, and the struggle resulting from this
                    competition. The English overthrew the French, but in their efforts to make their victory secure
                    they angered the colonists. The claims of the colonies to western lands were ignored in the effort
                    to conciliate the Indians. The western phases of the Revolution formed another struggle for the
                    interior, which substituted American control for the recently established control by the English,
                    but the retention of the western posts by the latter prevented the full realization of the
                    American's victory. It became necessary to formulate with considerable skill and after
                    preliminary errors several phases of national policy in order that the new nation might reap the
                    benefits of its struggle for independence. These included the passage of the land act of 1785, the
                    adoption of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, negotiations with the Indians, the fortification of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Valley, and the waging of Indian campaigns in the Old Northwest. The interrelations of
                    these policies and the effect of the spread of settlement as a result of three major streams of
                    migration are skillfully narrated. In the treatment of the territorial period the author has not
                    hesitated to criticise measures that have come to be regarded traditionally as nearly flawless. He
                    points out that the land act of 1785 aided the speculators and that it was necessary to modify it
                    before it could satisfy the needs of the poorer settlers. He also observed that the Ordinance of
                    1787 restricted the franchise to landowners and, thereby, denied to many a part in the government
                    under which they lived. The successes and failures of the territorial government, particularly in
                    the early period when the country was governed by a governor and three judges, are related with
                    justice <pb n="281" id="VAA4025-037-3-079"/> to both sides of the controversy. He realizes that the
                    territorial government was not entirely successful, that St. Clair had his limitations, but feels
                    that he made a fairly successful governor. The defeat of the Indians and the surrender of the
                    Northwest posts by the British solved the Indian problem for the time, and this led to rapidly
                    increasing settlement. The growth of population and the controversy with the governor in turn
                    produced the statehood movement. The volume ends with a narration of the struggle to escape the
                    restrictions of territorial government.</p>
            <p>The work forms an important contribution to the historical literature of the Old Northwest, and
                    unfavorable criticism must deal with a few minor points. It contains a large number of excellent
                    maps, many of them being reproductions of early maps, but unfortunately almost every one is so
                    small, page size or less, that their usefulness is open to question. It would seem preferable to
                    have included fewer maps and to have enlarged them to a more practical size. Very few errors were
                    noticed. The expression "gone glimmering" (p. 84) leaves something to be desired,
                    while the statement about sending a "strong French force to capture Montreal" in
                    1756 does not make sense (p.169). Questions might be raised about the omission of events which seem
                    as relevant to the story as many points that are included, such as the lack of a reference to the
                    establishment of the French settlements in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Country since the exploration of the area was described in some detail. More might have
                    been incorporated about the movement of population through the Appalachian Valley and along the
                    Wilderness Road as a counterbalance to the attention paid to the New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> migration. Footnotes are quite numerous and citations to the important works on many
                    points are given, but a bibliography is not included, recent works are not very numerous among the
                    citations, and periodical literature seems not to have been noted very frequently. One of the most
                    important features of such a work should be the listing, either in the footnotes or the bibliography
                    or both, of the best authorities on all phases of the subject. The lack of a bibliography in this
                    instance makes the few failures to cite important pieces of historical literature all the more
                    serious.</p>
            <p>It must be repeated that these minor imperfections do <pb n="282" id="VAA4025-037-3-080"/> not spoil
                    the quality of this excellent book. The author has set a high standard and the authors of the other
                    volumes will do well to equal the first. It is a welcome addition to the literature of the Middle
                    West, and all involved in its production are to be congratulated.</p>

            <p>A critical evaluation of the work of an Indiana historian, Edward Eggleston, is found in an essay
                    included in a little volume entitled: <hi rend="i">Historiography and Urbanization, Essays in
                        American History in Honor of W. Stull Holt,</hi> edited by Eric F. Goldman, and published by The
                    Johns Hopkins Press (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1941). He concludes that Eggleston caught the vision of social history when only John
                    Bach McMaster was writing with such a point of view. "Eggleston … conceived
                    history in terms of the evolution of society and the origin of institutions, social groups, customs,
                    and ideas and not in terms of outstanding individuals (p. 202)." The author, Charles
                    Hirschfeld, believes, however, that Eggleston began too late in life, did not have the physical
                    energy, or the personality and ability to convert his vision into reality. His <hi rend="i">Beginners of a Nation</hi> is regarded as a better piece of work than his <hi rend="i">Transit
                        of Civilization,</hi> which is described as "almost a death-bed effort to preserve in
                    print the results of scholarly labors which a dying author could not bear to see moulder in the
                    oblivion of manuscript literary remains (p. 208)." It is also suggested that the industrial

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> brought changes which Eggleston was not prepared to accept, that his world was the

            <head>Editor's Pages</head>
            <p>The attitude of cordiality, of good wishes, and of indulgence of those little things that accompany
                    newness, which your new editor has found everywhere, is deeply appreciated. He hopes that it will
                    continue and that it will survive the many failures and defects of his work in this new position.
                    Now that this issue is nearly ready for the press, an effort will be made to acknowledge the many
                    communications which have been received during the past weeks when all attention was devoted to more
                    immediate tasks.</p>
            <p>Various questions have been asked about the policies of the new editor. The first policy will be that
                    of learning how to edit the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> as it has been edited. Consequently there
                    will not be any important immediate changes nor any radical departures or thoughtless deviations
                    from the past. When the business at hand is more fully understood there will be time enough to think
                    about changes. The work of the previous editors is definitely appreciated and the first task is to
                    do as well as they have done. That cannot be accomplished, however, without striving at the same
                    time to make the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> better. Undoubtedly each of them strove constantly to
                    make improvements, and therefore, to do as well means to try to do better. It is to be hoped that as
                    time passes evidences of this effort will appear. Suggestions will always be appreciated whether it
                    is possible to adopt them or not. Criticism, whether favorable or unfavorable, will also be welcome.</p>
            <p>There is very real need of cooperation from subscribers and friends generally. More and better papers
                    are needed, and this is not intended to cast reflections upon those that have been published.
                    Additional subscriptions are needed badly, for the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> is expected to be a
                    self-supporting institution, and it is already obvious that its income is not sufficient. It is
                    hoped that your cordiality and good wishes will not only continue but that they may be converted
                    into even more tangible things.</p>
            <p>A particular word of appreciation is due to our immediate predecessor, Professor William O. Lynch.
                    His acquaintance was made fifteen years ago, and for that many years he has not failed to help, to
                    advise, and to encourage. After a time it was discovered that Professor Lynch was <pb n="288" id="VAA4025-037-3-086"/> extending the same kindness to a considerable number of young men whom
                    he referred to as "his boys." It is fairly common in the teaching profession for a
                    teacher to look after the welfare of his students, but Professor Lynch did not make any
                    discrimination between his students and other students. If help was needed and he could give it,
                    that was sufficient. For that reason he is looked upon as an academic father by a large number of
                    younger men in the historical profession. The present editor was never in a class taught by
                    Professor Lynch, but it is not an exaggeration to say that no one has been such a constant and
                    consistent friend. He likes to think of himself as one of the men that Professor Lynch calls
                    "his boys." In the editing of this issue this friendship has been drawn upon as a
                    never failing source of help. It is to be hoped that it will not seem necessary to bother him so
                    much in the future, but it is also our sincere wish that he will continue for many years his active
                    interest in the <hi rend="i">Magazine.</hi> Many friends have written to him to express their
                    appreciation of his work, and these letters are such that they would make any man happy. There are,
                    no doubt, many others that have not proceeded beyond the realm of good intentions. We know that we
                    express the feelings of the readers of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> when we wish for Professor
                    Lynch many additional years of happiness and achievement.</p>

            <head>SPECIAL GENEALOGICAL COLLECTIONS AND RECORDS IN THE INDIANA STATE LIBRARY</head>
            <p>The Genealogy Section of the Indiana State Library, as a separate Section, is only as old as the
                    building which now houses its library collection, but no account of its work is complete without
                    calling attention to those who, previous to 1933, were laying the foundation for its present
                    operation.</p>
            <p>Genealogical research has for many years been a part of the regime of the Indiana State Library. To
                    the librarians, as directors, to the Chiefs of the Indiana History and Reference Divisions, under
                    whose auspices research has been carried on, and to the Catalogue Division for its aid in the
                    classification and shelving of material, great credit is due for paving the way for the separate
                    handling of this phase of library work. Not only has the Genealogy Section inherited a fine
                    collection of material, chosen through the years with almost prophetic instinct, but the methods in
                    practice today are much the same as those of the earlier years of the library. One of the chief
                    purposes of the new Section has been to maintain the standards set for it.</p>
            <p>Certain agencies are contributing to an increased interest in genealogical matters. We are becoming
                    more genealogically minded, or perhaps, record-conscious. The day of the over-zealous housewife who
                    almost literally shoveled accumulations from the attic and, without discrimination, set a match to
                    them, is passing. Difficulties in obtaining age records for pension applicants, the necessity for
                    birth certificates in the industrial and defense worlds, and other conditions have shown the
                    importance of compiling and preserving records. Many of the WPA projects in operation today are
                    connected in some way with genealogical and historical records. Individuals are becoming more
                    interested in family research and it is a hopeful sign that the percentage of young people using the
                    Genealogy Library is far beyond what one might expect it to be.</p>
            <p>From time to time the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> has published lists of material
                    which is being added to the Genealogy Library. It is the purpose of this article to call attention
                    to the many special collections and records that are being placed in the library, hoping thus to
                    stimulate an <pb n="290" id="VAA4025-037-3-088"/> even greater interest in making the Genealogy
                    Section a repository for such important material.</p>
            <p>For many years the genealogy committees of the local chapters of the Daughters of the American
                    Revolution in Indiana have been collecting and compiling records of a vital nature. Their custom has
                    been to make three copies of all such compilations, one for the chapter itself, one for the D. A. R.
                    Library in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, D. C., and one for the Indiana State Library. In this way the Genealogy Section is
                    accumulating a large collection of Family Bible records, marriage and cemetery records, some court
                    records, and many lineage records.</p>
            <p>The Indiana Society of the Sons of the American Revolution has placed some valuable records,
                    miscellaneous material, and many back numbers of its magazine, to which the library now subscribes.</p>
            <p>The Society of Colonial Dames in the State of Indiana is placing on file, as rapidly as they are
                    being completed, the lineages of its members, and in addition is observing a beautiful custom of
                    contributing volumes in honor of deceased members. These have been taking the form of Registers of
                    the Society in the various states.</p>
            <p>The Indiana State Chapter of the Daughters of Founders and Patriots has shown much discrimination in
                    its gifts to the library. These include lineage books of the National Society, such important
                    publications as late editions of Burke's <hi rend="i">Peerage and Landed Gentry,</hi> some
                    special sets, and individual volumes.</p>
            <p>The Society of Mayflower Descendants in the State of Indiana has deposited its entire library
                    collection in the Genealogy Section (including the priceless lineage book of its members). The
                    Society of Colonial Wars has done likewise. Both of these organizations make occasional additions to
                    their collections and thus give the public the use of some valuable material on the early New
                    England and Colonial periods.</p>
            <p>The Indiana Historical Society, through its Committee on Pioneer Cemeteries and Churches, has been
                    doing an extensive work in its collection of cemetery records, all of which are being placed in this
                    library for preservation. Subcommittees have been appointed in nearly every county in the state and
                    at the meeting of the Indiana History Conference <pb n="291" id="VAA4025-037-3-089"/> in December,
                    1940, the Chairman of the committee was able to report that records from nearly one hundred
                    cemeteries in the state had been compiled during the previous year and placed in the Genealogy
                    Section of the Indiana State Library. The importance of this work is recognized when one realizes
                    that many of these cemeteries are old and almost abandoned, and that others have been affected by
                    defense projects and other conditions. One cemetery in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dearborn</region>
                    </placeName> County had to be removed on account of an extension of the levee. Plats of the graves
                    in the old cemetery, before removal, and of the new location of graves have been placed in this
                    library.</p>
            <p>Not only have societies and organizations been contributing in this way, but many individuals have on
                    their own account copied or compiled records. Three young men, in different sections of the state,
                    voluntarily copied cemetery records and offered to place them here. These persons afterwards became
                    members of the Indiana Historical Society's committee. A young woman of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> has been engaged in the free will service of indexing cemetery records on file. In the
                    June, 1941, number of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History,</hi> attention was called to a
                    labor of love on the part of two persons who made copies of some old marriage records recently
                    uncovered in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Orange</region>
                    </placeName> County, placing one copy in the Genealogy Section.</p>
            <p>For the most part, these collections and records have come to the library without solicitation;
                    however, the Genealogy Section has from its very start made an effort to procure histories of
                    Indiana families and has urged each compiler of a genealogy to place one copy here, not only for
                    use, but for insurance against emergencies and vicissitudes. The response to this appeal has been
                    gratifying and these are being received in book, pamphlet, manuscript, and chart form. In this way
                    some very interesting family material has been received from the Society of Indiana Pioneers. Often
                    a history of a family of some other state, having Indiana connections, has been donated to the
                    library. Recently this library was one of eight libraries selected to receive a two-volume typed
                    manuscript copy of the genealogy of a prominent <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> family.</p>
            <p>It should be remembered that while much of this material is placed here with a view to preservation,
                    the greater <pb n="292" id="VAA4025-037-3-090"/> part of it is available for use in the library;
                    none of it can be taken from the building. All of these collections and records are entered in the
                    catalogue in the Genealogy Room. Books as a rule are shelved according to the classification rules
                    of the library. Rare books, manuscripts, and irreplaceable material are, for the most part, kept in
                    locked cases, to be used under surveillance. Occasional checking, especially of the deposits, is
                    practiced. While the Genealogy Section cannot assume unlimited responsibility against emergencies,
                    its purpose is to be on the alert as to the safety of its library collection, and it is glad to have
                    its part in housing what it is hoped will prove to be "Records that defy the tooth of
                    Time."</p>

            <p>In the course of his ministry Elder McCoy was called upon to preach many funeral sermons. It was his
                    custom to write out the salient facts about each person at whose funeral he preached. Some of these
                    notes are now in the keeping of his granddaughter, Mrs. William Elgin Davis of Piqua, <placeName>

                    presented. Since Elder McCoy covered a large territory it is natural that many of Indiana's
                    first settlers should be among those whose names appear here. What makes these abstracts of
                    particular interest to students of local history and genealogy is their wealth of names, dates, and
                    places. It is even possible, in some cases, to follow the families back a generation to the section
                    of the country where they lived before they came to Indiana.</p>
