            <p>From the time he turned from research on the gall wasp to the study of human sexual behavior, Indiana
                    University's Professor Alfred C. Kinsey attracted controversy. His research created an
                    uproar not only with the general public but also with the federal government, and Kinsey's
                    work inadvertently took on legal as well as social importance when his efforts to import foreign
                    erotica for study in his Institute for Sex Research clashed with federal obscenity law and led to
                    lengthy legal battle. The government maintained that the tariff act of 1930 prohibited anyone from
                    importing obscene materials, while Kinsey argued that the principle of academic freedom guaranteed
                    the scholar access to erotic materials necessary for scientific research.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The
                    Kinsey customs decision of 1957 established a milestone in obscenity law with its concept of
                    "variable obscenity," the idea that obscenity is not absolute but is determined by
                    the nature of the audience.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>Years before the legal battle began in 1950, Kinsey tried to forestall any difficulties with the
                    tariff law that his study of imported erotica might produce. In 1947 Kinsey wrote to Huntington
                    Cairns, the Customs Bureau's legal advisor in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, requesting an exception under section 305 of the tariff law of 1930 which would allow
                    the institute to import erotic materials that might provide insight into "the significance
                    of sex in all aspects of human activity."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Kinsey's concern
                    that materials he might seek to import for his studies would run afoul of the bureau was probably
                    justified, for the customs collector at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> has Alden H. Baker, a seventy-seven year old Democratic political figure.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> In July, 1947, Baker seized a shipment to Kinsey for violation of the tariff act because
                    it contained a graphically illustrated book on Japanese sexual practices.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> When
                    news of the seizure reached the Indiana University administration, law professor Leon H. Wallace,
                    whose father was a long time friend of Baker, was asked to intervene. In a visit to the collector,
                    Wallace explained the scientific value of Kinsey's research and the care the institute took
                    to prevent unauthorized public access. Impressed with his argument, Baker agreed to release
                    Kinsey's materials. From this visit arose a <hi rend="i">modus vivendi</hi> which served
                    the purpose of the Institute for Sex Research for the next three years.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although the institute experienced no major customs difficulties during this period, the
                    Wallace-Baker understanding rested on a precarious foundation because it lacked the official
                    blessing of the Customs Bureau. This became clear in January, 1950, when a career customs official,
                    Eugene J. Okon, was appointed Baker's assistant collector. Okon disliked the informal
                    agreement, not because it was with Kinsey but because he felt "it wasn't the place

                    of Customs David B. Strubinger saw enclosed samples of the material Kinsey regularly received. In
                    his reply Strubinger declared: "All the books you have submitted are grossly obscene. The
                    most liberal interpretation could not bring them within the statutory limitations of the

                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> was essential. When he learned of Strubinger's decision, Kinsey called his

                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, who was well known as the author of several books on censorship and as the advocate
                    for Random House publishers in the <hi rend="i">Ulysses</hi> customs case of 1934.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> Ernst's junior partner, Mrs. Harriet F. Pilpel, and Kinsey met with Cairns on June
                    19, 1950, in an attempt to reach an agreement with the Customs Bureau. Pilpel argued that the
                    provisions of the tariff act which prohibited importation of obscene materials carried an
                    "implied exception" in cases of qualified persons who made legitimate use of
                    material which would otherwise be banned. "Obviously," she said, "many
                    works of great merit would be impossible if their authors were not permitted access to raw material
                    which in and of itself is of no intrinsic merit whatsoever."<hi rend="sup">10</hi> She
                    argued that a precedent for the implied exception could be found in <hi rend="i">U.S.</hi> v. <hi rend="i">One Package</hi> (1936), a decision which upheld the right of a physician to import

                    tariff law. In examining the law the court had reached the conclusion that it was not the intent of
                    Congress to ban such items when they were required for trial purposes by "conscientious and
                    competent physicians." The same reasoning might be extended to Kinsey's use of
                        pornography.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Any arrangement, however, required the approval of Walter R. Johnson, the assistant commissioner for
                    the Customs Bureau, who insisted on strict interpretation of the tariff act. On June 27 Johnson told
                    Kinsey that he would "be advised as soon as possible whether we find any possibility of
                    construing ‘established scientific merit’ as equivalent to
                    ‘established scientific significance,’ but we have found nothing so far that
                    would support such a conclusion."<hi rend="sup">12</hi> By September Johnson had decided
                    against granting Kinsey an administrative exception to the law, and he informed Pilpel that any
                    implied exceptions to the tariff act had to be declared by the courts.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Blocked in the attempt to reach an administrative understanding, Kinsey reluctantly agreed to a court
                    test. Although he regretted the time and expense of a court fight, he wrote Pilpel that he was
                    "increasingly convinced that we should push this until we have clearly established our
                    right to import any kind of sexual material."<hi rend="sup">14</hi> His lawyers based the
                    main thrust of their arguments on interpretation of the tariff law rather than on the abstract

                    angry that he was beyond reason. Finally I said, ‘Governor, you're so mad that I
                    can't reason with you. When you calm down, we'll discuss it,’ and I

                        <p>In response to a recent inquiry, the Institute for Sex Research, at Indiana University,

                            circumstances and in other places, would be considered obscene. …</p>
                        <p>The Institute feels that the issue is much broader than that of the importation of a specific
                            object at a given time and place. It considers that the issue is one which concerns all
                            scholars who need access to so-called obscene materials for scientific investigations which
                            in the long run may contribute to human welfare.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>

                    puzzled as well as irritated Kinsey, who had always considered his relationship with the collector
                    to be cordial.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> Baker had probably intended no insult to Kinsey. He was a
                    straitlaced individual who had in all likelihood never felt entirely comfortable passing

                    search of news stories. Alden Baker's office was an informal gathering place for reporters,
                    where they often came to enjoy coffee and conversation with Baker. A reporter entered the customs
                    office only minutes after a package to Kinsey had been opened for inspection. "The stuff
                    was strung out on Baker's desk," Okon recalls, "and when the reporter

            <p>The undesired publicity had a serious effect on the test case Kinsey and his attorneys were
                    preparing. What had promised to be a straightforward resolution in the courts was complicated by
                    notoriety. A British gynecologist who shared Kinsey's interest in the sexual implications
                    of obscene graffiti had agreed for the purposes of the test case to send Kinsey samples of graffiti
                    commonly found in public toilets to help establish the value of patently obscene materials for
                    scientific research. News of the November seizures lessened the gynecologist's willingness
                    to take part in the case. Fearful of professional ruin if his part in the plan became known, the
                    doctor revealed the graffiti proposal to the editor of the <hi rend="i">Journal of Sex
                    Education</hi>, Norman Haire, and requested that he mail a sample of the material to Kinsey. Haire
                    was willing but nervous. In a letter to Kinsey Haire explained that for his own protection he should

                                    for the following reasons:</p>
                        <p>In this country doctors are licensed to practice by the General Medical Council. If a

                                    automatically inform the G.M.C. and the latter then calls on the medical

                                    and that it will be necessary for you to find somebody to send the material who is

            <p>Kinsey was deeply embarrassed by the doctor's discomfiture. In a letter to Haire Kinsey
                    apologized for his part in the endeavor which had caused so much trouble.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> He
                    never again attempted to bring his British friends into the case, and when, later in the year, the
                    attorneys tried to revive the graffiti proposal, Kinsey firmly resisted.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With Haire out of the test case, Kinsey turned to materials from foreign book dealers. From Meyer
                    Loshak and Son of Essex, <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, he ordered several books, among them deSade's <hi rend="i">Les 120 Journees
                        de Sodome.</hi> Kinsey advised Pilpel that the books were as openly erotic "as we can
                        get."<hi rend="sup">34</hi> He also placed a large order, which included erotic
                    drawings by the Belgian artist Felicien Rops, with Philobiblon, a Copenhagen book store.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The orders from Loshak and Philobiblon began to arrive in February, but ironically the <placeName>

                    idea of returning them to the customs office for seizure but concluded that most of the material was
                    not suitable for a test case. They needed, Pilpel stressed to Kinsey, indisputably pornographic
                    items. In a letter to Philobiblon on March 22, 1951, Kinsey explained the need for specifically

                    collection which he began to send in small packages on April 4. Included in the shipments were
                    thirty-one photographs which he described as "the most openly erotic … anyone
                    could imagine—and rather pretty."<hi rend="sup">37</hi> When the photographs

                    </placeName> customs office seized seven of the importations addressed to Kinsey. Pilpel decided
                    that four—the thirty-one photographs, deSade's <hi rend="i">120 Journees</hi>,
                    Pierre Louys' <hi rend="i">Manuel de Civilite pour les Petites Filles</hi>, and any of the
                    books in English—should be included in the test case. She also thought some Japanese
                    erotica seized earlier in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> would contribute to the case but doubted that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> customs would release the material to the <placeName>

                    </placeName> office.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> On that score Kinsey had good news. Alden Baker had
                    retired, and the new collector of customs was Deane E. Walker, a former state school superintendent
                    who had taught high school biology from Kinsey's textbook and who was, in Kinsey's
                    words, "very much interested in the University." Walker agreed to send the
                    Japanese material to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>

            </p>
            <p>Although they had completed the groundwork for the test case, Kinsey's attorneys still had
                    not abandoned hope of reaching an administrative agreement with the Treasury Department. Pilpel
                    thought that if among other things Kinsey stipulated the safeguards taken to prevent public access
                    to institute materials and submitted a "specific analysis of why each of the items now
                    detained is of importance," they might be able to achieve a permanent understanding with
                    the department.<hi rend="sup">40</hi> Kinsey reluctantly agreed to another attempt for an
                    administrative exception, but expressed misgivings. He believed firmly in the right of scientific
                    inquiry, and his difficulties with the Customs Bureau simply increased his <list type="footnotes">

            <p>As 1952 drew to a close, the controversy was no nearer conclusion. Pilpel finally presented her
                    arguments for an administrative exception on May 14, 1953, to Treasury Counsel Charles R. McNeill.
                    The legal arguments were the same as those she offered in the 1950 application to Huntington Cairns:
                    an "implied exception" existed in the tariff act of 1930 for qualified persons as
                    set down in <hi rend="i">U.S.</hi> v. <hi rend="i">One Package.</hi> On this occasion, however, she
                    also argued that the social and scientific value of the institute's research could be
                    attested to by many physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, penologists, and sociologists who had
                    benefited from Kinsey's work.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Months passed before the Treasury Department acted on the request. While the legal case was stalled,
                    Kinsey published <hi rend="i">Sexual Behavior in the Human Female.</hi> Within ten days of the
                    September 14, 1953, publication, the book was in its sixth printing, bringing further attention and
                    criticism to Kinsey and the institute. Congressman Louis B. Heller of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> proposed that the book be banned from the mails until a congressional investigation
                    could be held. In January, 1954, it was rumored that the Special House Committee to Investigate

            <p>Pilpel and McNeill did not meet again until November, 1955, when McNeill indicated that the treasury
                    might accept a loose definition of classical or scientific works, but not to the point of admitting
                    such items as "dirty postcards."<hi rend="sup">45</hi> Since Kinsey had flatly
                    rejected such a compromise, Pilpel informed McNeill on December 8 that the institute felt the
                    artistic value of the importations was immaterial, that "all the challenged importations
                    are germane and important to the scientific studies conducted … and that unless
                    scientific inquiry and research is to be stifled, all the raw materials for such inquiry
                    … must be importable." She urged an immediate Treasury Department decision.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> A decision was indeed forthcoming. On February 13, 1956, Secretary of the
                    Treasury George M. Humphrey ruled against administrative discretion for institute importations and
                    ordered the Justice Department to initiate forfeiture proceedings against the detained materials.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he learned of the decision, Indiana University's President Wells made one last effort
                    to avoid a court battle. He persuaded Governor George N. Craig to write a letter to Humphrey
                    expressing his support for the work of the Institute for Sex Research. But Assistant Secretary David
                    W. Kendall, replying to Craig at Humphrey's request, asserted that the issue was beyond the
                    administrative authority of the Treasury Department. Governor Craig felt the answer was "a
                    pretty good brush off."<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The government filed its libel against the institute's detained materials on August 1, 1956.
                    Wells then asked <placeName>

                    </placeName> lawyer Hubert H. Hickam to represent the university's interests in the case.
                    While he fully recognized the ability of Ernst and Pilpel, the president hoped to reinforce the
                    university's support of the institute by also tapping the legal talents of

            <p>To keep the university's position as uncontroversial as possible, Wells opposed acceptance
                    of an offer by the American Civil Liberties Union to provide legal assistance on the case. Although
                    Kinsey complained to Pilpel's associate Leo Rosen about this rejection of assistance,<hi rend="sup">50</hi> President Wells' concern for the university's public image
                    was understandable. Announcement of the government's action had resulted in a series of
                    anti-Kinsey editorials, particularly in the Hearst newspapers.<hi rend="sup">51</hi> Kinsey,
                    emotionally as well as intellectually involved in the case, had perhaps forgotten that while Wells
                    had to consider the effect of the customs suit on the entire university, he had stood by Kinsey
                    since the beginning of his controversial research.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Exhausted in body and spirit by years of overwork that had begun even before the customs
                    difficulties, Kinsey was by this time a dying man. Several weeks after being hospitalized with heart
                    trouble, he had written to Harriet Pilpel: "I have been more or less continuously in bed,
                    in the hospital and at home, for the last three weeks. It is this heart again, and it impresses me
                    with the importance of getting our business done systematically, while I can still keep at
                        it."<hi rend="sup">53</hi> While recuperating at home Kinsey was visited by President
                    Wells who assured him that the Indiana University Board of Trustees supported his approaching court
                    fight. Wells recalls that Kinsey appeared agitated and far from healthy. When the professor left the
                    room to find some notes, Wells expressed his concern to Mrs. Kinsey, saying, "Clara,
                    we've got to put a stop to this. The man is killing himself." Mrs. Kinsey replied,
                    "I know, but there's nothing to do about it. He won't stop."<hi rend="sup">54</hi>

            <p>Kinsey was still in poor condition when he insisted on returning to work. Blaine Johnson, then a

                    Kinsey showed in other ways. In a telephone conversation with Rosen on August 9, Kinsey informed the
                    attorney that he contemplated a magazine article about the right of a scientist to conduct research
                    on sexual behavior. When Ernst learned Kinsey's intention, he expressed fear that Kinsey
                    was "apt to be too modest and self-effacing" about his own contributions to sex
                    research and suggested that someone else, perhaps George W. Corner or Vannevar Bush, write the
                        article.<hi rend="sup">56</hi> Kinsey's response was stinging: <text>

            </p>
            <p>It was an unfortunate letter, far more indicative of Kinsey's ill health than of a breakdown
                    in the friendship that had developed over the years. The two men had great admiration for each
                    other, and in suggesting that someone else write the article, Ernst was paying a compliment. The
                    episode, however, proved the unhappy final note of their friendship, for twelve days later Kinsey
                    was dead, "the inevitable result of all those years of driving labor, of short nights and
                    long days, of dedication to the point of exhaustion."<hi rend="sup">58</hi>

                    with Assistant District Attorney Benjamin T. Richards, Pilpel sought to avoid argument in court by
                    proposing four stipulations, or agreements: a recognition of the scholarly character of the
                    institute, the importance of its research, the relevance of the detained materials to its work, and
                    the safeguards taken by the institute to restrict public access to erotic materials. The institute
                    attorneys also agreed to seek a summary judgment by the court to avoid the time and expense of a
                    jury trial. Hickam presented a motion for intervention on behalf of Indiana University in the
                    Southern District Court of <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>The government also filed a motion for summary judgment against the detained materials on June 5,
                    1957, citing violation of section 305 of the tariff act of 1930. On July 16 Pilpel and Richards
                    appeared before Judge Edmund L. Palmieri to present their arguments. Pilpel defended the standing of
                    the Institute for Sex Research in the academic community, the careful conditions under which erotic
                    materials were supervised, and the importance of the detained materials to the institute's
                    research. She cited <hi rend="i">U.S.</hi> v. <hi rend="i">One Package</hi> (1936) to show that the
                    courts had admitted that an implied exception to the tariff law existed. She also maintained that
                    obscenity was not absolute but variable, dependent on use, as set down in <hi rend="i">U.S.</hi> v.
                        <hi rend="i">Levine</hi> (1936), in which the court had ruled that the standard of obscenity had
                    to weigh the likelihood of material's appeal to the "salacity of the

                    researchers. But then, after arguing that the institute merited an administrative exception to the
                    law, she boldly switched direction to argue that there existed a constitutional right of freedom of
                    inquiry. There could be no doubt that "official regulation of the manner in which Americans
                    seek to learn the truth is not a valid purpose of the legislative control in this
                        country."<hi rend="sup">62</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Richards countered that while the government did not dispute the high reputation of the Institute for
                    Sex Research or the value of the institute's investigations, neither did the institute
                    dispute the obscene character of the challenged importations. The tariff act of 1930 provided no
                    implied exception for scientists, since the contraceptive devices at issue in the <hi rend="i">One
                        Package</hi> case were not analogous to the obscene materials at issue in <hi rend="i">31
                        Photographs.</hi> As Judge Augustus Hand had ruled in the <hi rend="i">Ulysses</hi> case in
                    1934, "the importation of obscene books is prohibited generally, and no provision is made
                    permitting such importation because of the character of those to whom they are sold." It
                    was the duty of the court, Richards argued, to enforce the statute as it stood until such time as
                    Congress might amend it. Should the court "permit itself to be lured into legislative
                    action in the guise of an implied exception," it would virtually nullify the obscenity
                    provision of the tariff act and "invite wholesale commercial traffic in foreign pornography
                    imported and distributed by spurious scientific organizations."<hi rend="sup">63</hi>
                    Richards denied that forfeiture of the libeled articles would violate the institute's
                    constitutional rights. The most recent case handed down from the Supreme Court, <hi rend="i">Roth</hi> v. <hi rend="i">
                        <placeName>
                            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                        </placeName>
                    </hi> (1957), had reaffirmed the doctrine that obscenity was outside the bounds of constitutional
                    protection. Since the institute materials were admittedly obscene, they could claim no

                    said, that both parties agreed to the prurient nature of the libeled materials and the sole
                    scientific purpose for which the institute utilized them. It was also evident that the institute
                    prevented public access to its obscene collections and that the material probably would not appeal
                    to the prurient interest of the qualified persons who used them.<hi rend="sup">65</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Richards reacted strongly to the proposed stipulations. He agreed that the materials were obviously
                    obscene but would not concede that scholars enjoyed any immunity to the efforts of pornography. The
                    government did not challenge the purposes of the institute or deny the restricted availability of
                    the materials to the public, but Richards argued that these conditions could not be demonstrated in
                        fact.<hi rend="sup">66</hi> Pilpel's rebuttal struck hard at this reasoning. The
                    institute had already presented the affidavits of many experts in the fields of psychology,
                    medicine, and sociology to demonstrate these conditions. Richards, she said, could not at the same
                    time concede the institute's arguments and still deny them by innuendo. If he could not
                    challenge them outright, they had to stand uncontroverted.<hi rend="sup">67</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On October 31 Judge Palmieri handed down a decision in favor of the institute. In his view the
                    question at bar was the meaning of the word "obscene" as it appeared in section
                    305 of the tariff act. The latest definition available to the court in the <hi rend="i">Roth</hi>
                    decision defined obscenity as material that appealed to the prurient interest of the average person.
                    The staff of the Institute for Sex Research was not made up of average persons but of scholars who
                    imported erotic material solely for the purpose of scientific research. This material was carefully
                    restricted from the general public's access, and it was not likely to appeal to the
                    prurient interest of those to whom it was available for study. He therefore ruled that the detained
                    importations were not prohibited to the institute and ordered their release.<hi rend="sup">68</hi>

            <p>The Kinsey customs case was over, nearly seven years after a wandering reporter casually had entered
                    Alden Baker's customs office in search of a cup of coffee. The case cost the institute more
                    than $11,000 in legal fees and would have been double that if not for the generosity of
                    the attorneys involved.<hi rend="sup">69</hi> The research time lost was incalculable.</p>
            <p>What did it all mean? In asserting that scholars might view obscene materials without any appeal to
                    their prurient interest, the Kinsey case established a definition of obscenity based on the variable
                    identity of the receiving group. While Pilpel thought the decision reaffirmed the principle of
                    freedom of scientific inquiry,<hi rend="sup">70</hi> one writer warned that the precedent could
                    provide "an opportunity for trafficking in salacity."<hi rend="sup">71</hi>
                    Professors William B. Lockhart and Robert C. McClure urged the courts to adopt the variable concept
                    as the standard definition of obscenity.<hi rend="sup">72</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The variable concept of obscenity set down in <hi rend="i">31 Photographs</hi> has never been
                    developed, although it occasionally has been paid lip service.<hi rend="sup">73</hi> Instead the
                    Supreme Court has sought to remove itself from the labyrinth of obscenity law by adopting a
                    guideline which allows the local community to define obscenity according to its own contemporary
                    standard. Thus, in <hi rend="i">Miller</hi> v. <hi rend="i">
                        <placeName>

                    </hi> (1973), the court upheld the defendant's conviction for mailing unsolicited sexual
                    materials, such as <hi rend="i">Sex Orgies Illustrated</hi>, because he violated the contemporary

                    community standards has already revealed its limitations, and appellate courts once again are forced
                    to review obscenity decisions.</p>
            <p>No matter what definition of obscenity the courts may adopt, the basic problem remains: obscenity is
                    virtually undefinable, as Justice Potter Stewart acknowledged when he remarked, "I know it
                    when I see it."<hi rend="sup">76</hi> The variable receiving group concept could rise to
                    the foreground in the next obscenity case that appears before any court in the land. But until the
                    term obscenity is defined, and its effects recognized, no test can have any lasting value. Perhaps
                    the work done by Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey and the Institute for Sex Research will be of help in this
                    task.</p>

            <p>Before the end of his first term in 1831 Senator William Hendricks' nonpartisan stance was
                    beginning to alienate persons in each of the emerging political parties. Some of his opponents in
                    Indiana and elsewhere attempted for more than a year to prevent his reelection in 1830. The Adams-<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> faction condemned him for supporting senatorial confirmation of President Andrew
                    Jackson's appointments. Jacksonians criticized him for not being a thorough going
                    Jacksonian in legislative matters.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indiana political parties, however, were loose coalitions for winning elections and controlling
                    patronage rather than organizations of persons holding unique political views. Jacksonianism
                    consisted of loyalty to a person more than adherence to a program. One might easily prefer Jackson
                    to John Quincy Adams or Henry Clay in the White House, yet <list type="footnotes">

            <p>As the end of his second term approached, Hendricks' popularity waned. Politics was becoming
                    increasingly partisan, and for the first time he openly supported a presidential candidate, Martin
                    Van Buren, Jackson's heir apparent. While he thus offended Indiana's Whig
                    supporters of William Henry Harrison, many Democrats remained skeptical of his sincerity; and when
                    he tried to conduct a nonpartisan senatorial campaign, it was declared that his
                    "noncommittal course, and his <hi rend="i">trimming</hi> between the political parties of
                    this State, can no longer serve his purposes. He will be unmasked, and his <hi rend="i">false
                    face</hi> rendered useless."<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Also Hendricks' more than two
                    decades in high public office had aroused jealousy and personal animosity in various quarters. On
                    December 8, 1836, shortly before senatorial balloting began, handbills alleging that he had
                    defrauded his mother-in-law in a real estate transaction, were distributed to members of the General
                    Assembly on behalf of Jeremiah Sullivan,<hi rend="sup">7</hi> who coveted Hendricks' Senate
                    seat. On the ninth senatorial ballot Oliver H. Smith was chosen to succeed Hendricks. Noah Noble had
                    led on the first seven ballots while Hendricks ranked third on the first ballot and second on the
                    third, fourth, and fifth. His largest vote, however, was only fifty, and seventy-four were needed to
                        win.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is impossible to assess the relative effects of several factors on Hendricks' defeat.
                    Among the key factors were his support of Van Buren for the presidency when Harrison carried
                    Indiana, his nonpartisan stance in the Senate, his alleged effort to be all things to all men in
                    Indiana, and his rumored unfair business dealings with his mother-in-law. It appears, however, that
                    he accepted this defeat that ended his career in public office with his usual equanimity. Having
                    "been a favored citizen of the state a good while," he said, he could not complain
                    about the results of the election. He did, however, object to Sullivan's handbill that he

                    public office, he had represented Indiana in Congress longer than any other man. He had sat in the
                    House of Representatives from 1816 to 1822 and the Senate from 1825 to 1837. During these eighteen
                    years in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he gave careful attention to the needs and desires of those who had elected him.
                    According to an anonymous writer, "He left no letter unanswered, no public office or
                    document did he fail to visit or examine on request."<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Despite shifting alignments in an era of growing political partisanship, Hendricks remained
                    independent, although he supported Van Buren in 1836. Regardless of who occupied the White House or
                    what faction controlled Congress, he consistently supported internal improvements built at federal
                    expense; Indian removal to make more land available for settlement and prevent friction between
                    Indians and whites; a liberal federal land policy; a stable monetary system regulated by a national
                    bank; a protective tariff; confinement of slavery to states where it already existed; and a strong
                    central government. Sometimes he supported incompatible programs in the hope that if his first
                    choice failed to pass his second one would be enacted. He often settled for less than he and his
                    constituents wanted because he believed that half a loaf was better than none.</p>
            <p>Admittedly on the national scene Hendricks did not make the impact of such contemporaries as Thomas
                    Hart Benton, John C. Calhoun, Henry Clay, or Daniel Webster, and he antagonized various people. But
                    Smith, his successor, doubtless described him accurately when he said, "He was not of the
                    very first order of talents, but made all up by his plain, practical, good sense. He never attempted
                    to speak upon subjects he did not understand."<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As long as he was in Congress, Hendricks continued to inform his constituents about questions of
                    public interest by means of annual political circulars. Public land policy, internal improvements,
                    Indian affairs, and the tariff were perennial topics. Issues confronting the nation for the first

            <p>In the mid-1830s land receipts were at their peak for the nation as a whole and for Indiana. Some
                    Americans considered land sales an ideal source of revenue in place of taxes, but others wanted to
                    support internal improvements, education, poor relief, and other public activities through land
                    grants to state and local governments and public service institutions.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
                    Hendricks believed that Congress was exploiting the West by selling land to raise revenue instead of
                    making it more readily available to settlers for building up the West or granting it to public
                    agencies for social and economic improvement of the region. As long as he was in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he worked to modify land laws for the benefit of actual settlers. He supported price
                    reduction, price graduation, homesteading on land unsold for ten years, the right of preemption,
                    cession of unsold public lands to states where located, and a minimum purchase of only forty
                        acres.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> Hendricks thought it strange that these proposals were described as
                    wild schemes, with cession to states considered the wildest of them all, when nearly every western
                    legislature was on record as favoring cession. Easterners, according to him, believed they had
                    bought the West with their blood exclusively, but he contended that westerners were also sons of the
                        revolution.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 1833 a new land policy was proposed under the leadership of Henry Clay. The five percent of net
                    proceeds that had long been earmarked for internal improvements for the new states was increased to
                    seventeen and one half percent, and for the next five years the remaining net proceeds were to be
                    distributed among all states in proportion to their congressional representation and spent at each
                    state's discretion. President Jackson, however, vetoed <placeName>

                    were high, traffic and profits low, and operation and maintenance poor. In 1833 the Senate Committee
                    on Roads and Canals recommended that the national government, which already owned one-third of the
                    canal's stock, should buy all privately owned stock and reduce the tolls to equal the cost
                    of operation and maintenance. But the Senate did not act. A few years later the canal company asked
                    Congress either to devote its share of the tolls to canal improvement or to relinquish the
                    government's dividends to the company. Hendricks' committee recommended instead
                    that the secretary of treasury buy enough stock to gain controlling interest or, if that were not
                    possible, sell out. In the latter case Hendricks anticipated that Congress would build a competing

                    become a source of controversy between northern manufacturers and southern producers and exporters
                    of raw materials. The "tariff of abominations," enacted in 1828, had raised the
                    rates to an unprecedented level, and prompted the <placeName>

                    protective tariff.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> In the winter of 1831 Congress gave its attention to the
                    resulting clamor for tariff reform, but some of the rates in the tariff of 1832 were even higher.

                    by either civil or military action. Concurrently with the Force Bill, however, Congress developed
                    the Compromise Tariff of 1833, which provided gradual reduction until July 1, 1842, by which time no

            </p>
            <p>In the West the currency issue was doubtless of greater concern than the tariff. When the Second Bank

                    early thirties, the West suffered from a shortage of circulating medium as money was drained off
                    through payments for land and for goods from the East. But if there were no regulation, Hendricks
                    believed, the West would suffer from inflation, a consequence of wildcat banking.</p>
            <p>In his first annual message President Jackson questioned the constitutionality and expediency of the
                    national bank. He urged Congress to begin planning for an alternative institution or at least
                    extensive modification of the existing one when its charter expired in 1836. The bank, however, re-,
                    quested and Congress enacted charter renewal in 1832. Jackson, not having been consulted about
                    revision of the charter and finding changes that he considered essential absent from the new one,
                    vetoed it; and the Senate failed to override the veto. Then the president, by removing the
                    government's deposits from the Second Bank of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, virtually destroyed it before its current charter expired.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>
                    Hendricks did not approve of the unregulated issue of paper money, nor was he committed to a hard
                    money policy. He favored using whatever forms of circulating medium were necessary and convenient to
                    achieve a prosperous economy; and it was on. this basis that he supported renewal of the bank

                    piling up in the vaults of Jackson's pet banks. This circumstance had been anticipated as
                    early as 1832, and some had proposed reducing revenue by lowering the tariff. Instead of abolishing
                    tariff protection, Hendricks favored reducing revenues by thoroughly revising the land system or
                    reducing the surplus by distributing it among the states. The poor who had helped to build a
                    comfortable society in the East and then come west, he said, would like to duplicate those comforts
                    in the West. In his opinion new revenue policies should be formulated with them in mind.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> A bill providing for the distribution of surplus revenue to the states in
                    proportion to their representation in Congress was enacted in 1836. The states were to receive in
                    1837 any surplus over five million dollars that was in the treasury on January 1 of that year.
                    Indiana's share, which was technically a deposit, was $1,147,005.92; and the
                    first quarterly installment was distributed before Hendricks left <placeName>

                    nations agreed to settle for twenty-five million francs or about five million dollars; but when the
                    French legislature failed to appropriate funds for the first payment, which was due early in 1833,
                    President Jackson recommended that reprisals be authorized by Congress. The Senate unanimously

            <p>SIR:</p>
            <p>The present Session has been one of great length, and as few will have failed to perceive, one also
                    of much political discord and strife.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> The elements of our free institutions
                    always in motion, have more than usually been employed in the work of party, and in the struggle for
                    political power. That the spirit of liberty should always be on the watch-tower, is salutary and
                    needful to the body politic, but the spirit of discord has for years past been gaining a fearful
                    ascendancy, and forebodes much of evil to our free institutions. In the history of former Republics,
                    this spirit has always been the harbinger of destruction: now, it has become dangerous to our best
                    interests, and to the union of the States; and he is no patriot, no matter what name he may assume,
                    or to what party he may belong, who would add fuel <list type="footnotes">

                     <hi rend="sup">*</hi> The editor has attempted to reproduce these circulars as
                            closely as possible to the form in which they were originally published. Vagaries of
                            spelling, capitalization, and paragraphing have been followed exactly as in the original
                            text. In some instances stray marks or imperfections in the original have made it impossible
                            to ascertain whether or not commas or periods are used, and in these cases the editor has
                            made what seems to be the correct punctuation. Letters and words have been put in brackets
                            in two cases: where the letters were omitted in the spelling of the word; and where the
                            print was too faint or fragmented and therefore not legible. A [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] has
                            been used to indicate errors only if it was felt that confusion might result over whether
                            the mistakes were editorial, authorial, or typographical. Otherwise incorrect and phonetic
                            spellings have been retained as found. Obvious repetition of the same word in the text has
                            been deleted. The spelling of Indian names has followed that in the original text. When
                            names first appear in the text, identification of persons or places hag been made in either
                            brackets or footnotes. In cases where geographical locations, acts of Congress, or other
                            types of potentially unclear references are made, bracketed information has been added to
                            clarify the text. These circulars are printed in full from photocopies of the originals.</item>

                    detail, as I have been in the habit of doing on former occasions, the prominent Legislative business
                    of the Session.</p>
            <p>A few subjects have occupied much of the time and attention of the present Session. These have been
                    the Bank Charter, the apportionment of representatives among the several States under the late
                    census, and the tariff. The latter has occupied more of the time of the Senate than any other, but
                    as yet no tariff bill has been taken up in that body. On this subject the south is much agitated,
                    and threaten nullification and disunion, if the protective principle of the tariff, be not repealed
                    or modified.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> They attribute all the evils, real and imaginary, which they
                    either feel or fear, to its existence, and are worked up into a state of feverish excitement [.] A
                    very lengthy debate took place in the Senate, on resolutions, declaring, that the duties on such
                    articles as are not manufactured in this country, ought to be forthwith repealed; but no final vote
                    was taken upon them.</p>
            <p>In the House of Representatives too this subject was taken up at an early period of the Session, and
                    bills by various Committees, as well as one of the Secretary of the Treasury [Louis McLane], were
                    reported to the House.</p>
            <p>The protective principle of the tariff cannot be abandoned. To do this would be to consign to
                    destruction the many millions of capital already invested under the guardianship of former laws, and
                    to check for years to come, the current of prosperity, which the success of our domestic industry,
                    is even now giving to the country. The measure of protection however which is necessary for the
                    manufacturers, is that of which but few can be competent to judge. It is that on which the
                    manufacturers themselves and their most zealous advocates are by no means agreed. Early in the
                    Session the leading tariff men, were in favor of doing nothing more, than repeal the duties on
                    unprotected articles. Subsequently other grounds have been taken, and the committee on manufactures
                    of the House, have recently reported a bill, materially modifying the tariff of 1828. This subject

            </p>
            <p>I am one of those who believe, that the evils of which the southern States so loudly complain, cannot
                    fairly be ascribed to the tariff. It is probably true that if the workshops of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, instead of our own factories, supplied as heretofore our articles protected by the
                    tariff, that a more extensive, and of course a more advantageous export trade, could be carried on
                    by the planters of the south; for then their cotton would not only furnish the raw material out of
                    which the cotton fabric is made, but would in exchange pay for a very large portion of all our
                    importations. Formerly the agricultural productions of the grain growing states being excluded from
                    the markets and exchanges of Europe, the whole trade was thrown into the hands of the south. Not so
                    in this country. The agricultural productions of the grain growing States are necessary for the
                    manufacturers, and are taken in exchange for their fabrics; hence a foreign trade is more valuable
                    to the southern States than a domestic trade, and a domestic trade is more valuable to the middle
                    and northern States than a foreign trade. But the evils of the south may be fairly traced to a very
                    different cause; her overgrown and impoverishing black population.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> By the
                    culture of the slave the value of the soil is diminished. Large districts of better lands are opened
                    in the new States. To these the enterprising are rapidly hastening. A greater proportion of whites
                    emigrate than of blacks, and the evils of a superincumbent black population are daily increasing.</p>
            <p>The prosperous financial condition of the country, has presented to the present Session, the
                    difficulty of reducing the revenue. At the commencement of the last war, the debt of the Revolution

                    ever since, in discharge of the principal and interest of the debt. The receipts into the treasury
                    for many years past, have averaged at about $24,000,000, but the last year they amounted
                    to more than 28,000,000. The debt is reduced to $24,000,000, and its payment is certain
                    within the ensuing year. After this debt shall have been paid, a revenue beyond
                    $15,000,000 per annum cannot be needed, and even this amount will allow enlarged
                    appropriations for internal improvements. In the prospects then of reducing the revenues one half,
                    every interest is putting in its claims for relief; the planters of the south, the interests of
                    commerce rnd [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] navigation, and the landed interests of the new States.</p>
            <p>The subject of the Public Lands is one of increasing magnitude and perplexity. Many propositions have
                    been made, but there is now little prospect of any thing being done during the present Session, save
                    a provision authorizing the issuing of scrip for forfeited monies in cases not heretofore provided
                    for by law; a provision extending the preemption law to settlers on lands not surveyed till after
                    its expiration, and the 40 acre law as it is called which authorises to a certain extent, the sale
                    of the Public Lands in 40 acre tracts.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>The reduction of the revenues of the country consequent on the final extinction of the National Debt
                    is now near at hand, and it was thought reasonable, that in this jubilee, the land interests of the
                    new States should participate. It was however a matter of equal regret and surprise, that so little
                    inclination to favor this interest should be found to exist; and at a time when it was proposed to
                    diminish the revenue $7,000,000 by repealing the duties on the luxuries of life, because
                    the revenue was no longer needed; that there should be so much aversion, to diminishing the price of
                    any portion of the public lands, no matter how long they might have been in market or how inferior
                    their quality. Almost every thing else connected with the revenue, had been referred to the
                    Committee on manufactures, and this subject was also referred to that Committee. A report was made
                    recognising the reasonableness and justice of the claims of the new States to a larger dividend than
                    the five per cent now received of the sales. <list type="footnotes">

                    propositions are the principal ones now before the Senate, but it is not probable that either will

            <p>Among the difficult and perplexing questions of the present Session, may be mentioned, the
                    apportionment of representatives among the several States, under the present census. It was much to
                    be desired, that a bill should have passed on this subject, in time to have afforded the
                    Legislatures of the states an opportunity of fixing congressional districts, during their recent
                    Sessions. Accordingly, this subject was early taken up in the House of Representatives, but such has
                    been the difficulties involved, and the delays consequent in both Houses, that the bill did not
                    become a law, until very recently; and the States whose congressional elections take place within
                    the present year, will necessarily have extra Sessions on this account during the summer.</p>

                    entitled to seven members in the House of Representatives. The census of 1790 was the first census
                    under the constitution, and the number of Representatives, originally 65, was increased to 105; for
                    the second census, the number was increased to 141; for the third to 181; for the fourth to 213;

                    organized with 240. That body has increased from 65 to 240 members, while the ratio has been raised
                    from 30,000 to 47,600 [47,700]. The census of 1790 gave [the <placeName>

                    </placeName>] a population of 3,921,327. A census has been taken every ten years since, and resulted
                    as follows: in 1800, 5,319,762; in 1810, 7,239,902; in 1820, 9,637,999; and in 1830, the census
                    shewed a population of 12,716,602 souls—of these 1,982,822 are slaves. The increase of
                    our population in the last ten years almost equals the whole amount in 1790.</p>
            <p>Another law, and perhaps a final one, has passed during the present Session for the relief of the
                    surviving officers and soldiers of the Revolution. It is comprehensive and liberal, and will it is
                    believed, embrace all, who have borne any considerable part, in the sufferings and the triumphs of
                    that eventful war. It embraces those who served in the continental line, state troops, volunteers,
                    or militia, and gives full pay for life, according to rank, not exceeding in any case the pay of a
                    captain in the line, to all who have served, at one or more terms, a period of two years; to
                    commence the 4th day of March, 1831. And to those who have served less than two years, but over six
                    months, a sum proportioned to the term they may have so served.</p>
            <p>The appropriations for the Cumberland road have long since passed the Senate [.] They were reported
                    to the House in a separate bill, which proposed $110,000 to be expended in <placeName>

                    present condition, and there can be no doubt of these appropriations becoming a law, having already

                    those who needed it most was most careful not to embarrass the bill with any thing which threatened
                    its defeat. Accordingly the members from the western States, generally voted against the proposition
                    to exclude newspapers from postage, because it was believed by them, that the Department could not
                    sustain this burden, and that with it, the bill could not become a law.</p>
            <p>At an early period of the Session, bills passed the Senate for an additional land office in the state
                    of Indiana, and appropriating money to defray the expenses of a treaty with the Indians in our

                    topics, and on these subjects bills have passed both Houses.</p>
            <p>An attempt was made at the last Session of Congress to adjust and finally settle the tariff. A law
                    then passed materially modifying it, and reducing the revenue much below the receipts under the law
                    of 1828.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> This bill passed in the hope, that it would tranquilize the stormy
                    elements of the Southern States and allay the dangerous excitement existing in that section if it
                    did not give entire satisfaction as a final adjustment of the question. Such indeed was the opinion
                    expressed by Southern Members, a large majority of whom voted for the bill. Vain however has been
                    the expectation; for the short interval between the last and present Session, has been actively
                    employed, in sowing the seeds of disunion, and in producing the present distracted state of our
                    common country. The present Session had scarcely commenced, when the ant [i]-tariff, party commenced
                    a series of operations, which at an early period of it, produced a bill in the House of
                    Representatives, on which that portion of the national Legislature, have been chiefly employed ever
                    since. The secretary of the Treasury had said in his annual report, that the revenue would admit,
                    after the present year, of a further reduction of 6000,000; And this was the hinge on which has been
                    hung all the anti-tariff movements of the Session [.] But this was a mere estimate, which might, or
                    might not be correct; for the tariff of July 1832, has not yet gone into operation, and no one can
                    tell with certainty what its effects upon the revenue will be. Nor was it proposed to pass any bill
                    to go into operation before the next Session of Congress. Yet so much has this subject been
                    disturbed, under all these circumstances, that it has literally occupied the House of
                    Representatives all winter, to the exclusion of almost every thing else. This has become the great
                    exciting interest of the country, and to it, aspiring and ambitious politicians look for elevation.
                    One of its greatest evils is, the combinations it produces, and that it is viewed as the political
                    ladder, to the Presidency of the <placeName>

            <p>The history of this matter would be too long for a letter. It may be traced back to the embargo times
                    of 1807, and up to the declaration of the late war with Great Britain. Then <list type="footnotes">

                    builders and mariners, and the people of the South were planters, and to a limited extent
                    manufacturers. The embargoes had crippled and rendered precarious the shipping interests of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and they were driven to the course of policy dictated by the South; a policy which
                    kept them more on land, and less on water, and which shaped and imposed the tariff system upon the
                    people of the <placeName>

                    into these pursuits, and now millions, and perhaps hundreds of millions, are invested in
                    manufacturing establishments, and endangered by a spirit of determined hostility against the tariff.
                    The tariff will no doubt be further modified and reduced; for the public debt being paid, ten or
                    twelve millions a year, of the revenue necessary heretofore can be dispensed with; but that which
                    will still be necessary ought to be levied, with a view to the protection of our valuable
                    manufactures. The protective principle cannot be yielded, without yielding much of the prosperity
                    and independence of the country.</p>

                    circumstances, the President in his Message of the 16th of January, informed Congress, that an
                    emergency had arisen in the state of <placeName>

                    necessary to meet the case. This resulted in "A bill further to provide for the collection
                    of duties on imports" which passed both Houses with great unanimity, and has become a law.
                    This bill is what its title purports it to be, and has for its object, the due execution of the laws

            <p>A crisis had indeed arisen, and it would have been delicacy inconsistent with duty, to stand still,
                    and see the revenue officers of the General Government, fall victims to the military power of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>

                    Nor can she be recognised as the sole judge, of all the cases of difficulty, she may think proper to
                    make with the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Her doctrine too that a majority in this government cannot be permitted to rule, is
                    perhaps more inadmissible than any other. It is, in itself, anti-republican, and at war with the
                    doctrines of all former periods of our <pb n="341" id="VAA4025-071-4-047"/> history, and yet strange
                    as it may appear, this doctrine is openly and boldly avowed, by the leaders of this new school.</p>

            <p>The Public Lands, seem to be a never-ending source of trouble. For the last ten years, propositions
                    have been made and renewed every Session, to reduce their price, and especially in the old
                    Districts, where they have been long in market and remain unsold. Propositions too, to graduate the
                    price according to quality, and to give advantages to actual settlers, have as often been made, and
                    as often rejected. On this subject a preponderating power of the old States is against us, and the
                    policy of giving to the new States a larger percentage upon the sales, and of dividing the residue
                    of their proceeds among the several States, is the only thing practicable, either at present, or in
                    prospect. Accordingly the bill which passed the Senate last year, has again passed both Houses. It
                    gives to the new States twelve and an half per cent, upon the money received in each, in addition to
                    the five per cent heretofore received, and divides the residue among all the States, old and new,
                    agreeably to their Representative population; the whole to be applied by the Legislatures of the
                    States, to such objects as they may think proper. The quantity of 500,000 acres of land for internal
                    improvements, is also granted to such of the new S[t]ates, as have not heretofore received grants
                    for such purposes, and to such as have received in such grants, a lesser quantity, that deficiency
                    is made up. The bill expires by its own limitation in <list type="footnotes">

                    has been little else than a scene of political warfare and strife. Less Legislative business has
                    been done than at any previous Session. The great exciting question has been the Bank and the
                        deposites.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> On this single subject, by far the greater portion of the
                    Session has been employed. It would be useless to enter into details of this matter. They would be
                    endless. Every one must, in a greater or less degree, be familiar with the subject: one, which is
                    believed to have agitated Congress, and the country more, than almost any other since the days of
                    the revolution. The questions of the Tariff and Nullification, heretofore engrossing almost entirely
                    public attention, have scarcely been spoken of, and that of the Public Lands has been wholly crowded
                    out of view by it. The Land bill is among the unfinished business of the Session.</p>
            <p>The fiscal affairs of the country were, agreeably to the Report of the Secretary of the Treasury
                    [Roger B. Taney] in December last, in a prosperous condition. The amount of public debt remaining
                    unpaid, was, on the 1st of January last, less than $5,000,000. This is the remnant of the
                    old debt of the revolution, and the debt created by the late war with <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. Our chief source of revenue is the tariff, or in other words, duties collected by the
                    custom houses on imported goods: and in modifying the tariff to the diminished wants of the country,
                    the difficulty has been to know where to stop. The business of reduction has been an agreeable
                    employment, and Congress has already gone too far in reducing the tariff, in passing a second law
                    before a former one <list type="footnotes">

                            the <placeName>

                            </placeName> in 1832. During the remaining four years of the old charter Jackson, despite
                            vigorous objections from the Senate, gradually removed federal deposits from the bank and
                            placed the funds in selected state banks. In retaliation Nicholas Biddle, president of the
                            bank, allegedly manipulated the monetary system in an effort to force the government to come
                            to terms with him. See Remini, <hi rend="i">Andrew Jackson and the Bank War</hi>,

                    neither could be foreseen. This was the case last session, when a second tariff-reducing law was
                    enacted, before the law of a previous Session had gone into operation,<hi rend="sup">25</hi> until
                    it has become doubtful whether Congress will not be under the necessity of imposing additional
                    tariff duties, in lieu of those recently taken off. These reductions were made to the manifest
                    jeopardy of the manufacturers, and the manufacturing interests, have ever since, been in a depressed
                    and sickly condition. Many establishments have already ceased their operations, and their
                    proprietors will no doubt direct their capital into other channels, no longer willing to hazard
                    every thing, in the doubtful experiment, whether the manufacturing interests can live under the
                    tariff reducing law of 1833.</p>
            <p>The reduction of the revenue, and the possible necessity for its increase, has very much injured the
                    prospect of internal improvements. The manufacturers, while protected by a sustaining tariff, were
                    the close allies of internal improvements; for the tariff, while it protected their interests,
                    furnished the means of making roads and canals, which were also necessary to that interest, in the
                    transportation of their fabrics throughout the whole country.</p>
            <p>The effects of these causes have already been felt, and deeply felt, in the difficulties experienced
                    in obtaining an appropriation for the Cumberland Road. Those interested in this road, must have
                    observed difficulties, and the road will feel them in the fact, that midsummer must pass by, before
                    the work of the present year can commence, owing to the late period of the Session at which the
                    appropriation was made. It will feel them too, in the increased difficulty of future appropriations.
                    The amounts this year appropriated to the progress of the work, are $200,000 to be
                    expended in the State of <placeName>

            <p>The subject of Public Lands is one of increasing importance. The large sums those lands are now
                    bringing into the Treasury, make them more than heretofore, a bone of contention. Those who would
                    destroy the tariff, and grasp at every other source of revenue, are more zealous than ever, to
                    retain their proceeds for the ordinary disbursements of Government. The old tariff States, wish the
                    Federal Government to be sustained by the duties on imported goods, and the proceeds of the Public
                    Lands distributed among all the States. Both these classes of politicians are opposed to any change
                    of the Land system; opposed to reduction of price, to graduation, and to all advantages to actual
                    settlers. The Representatives of the new States are not entirely agreed in this matter, nor have
                    they power to control it if they were. With few exceptions we all go for the graduating principle,
                    while some would carry that principle farther than others. We all go for reduction of the price, and
                    for privileges and favors to actual settlers. In the details of these principles we might not all
                    agree, but we have never yet been able to induce Congress to go with him who demanded least, and who
                    would be willing to stop first. We all think too "That in convenient time, this machinery
                    of Land Offices, &amp;c. should be withdrawn from the states, and that the right of soil, and
                    the future disposition of it, should be surrendered to the States respectively."<hi rend="sup">29</hi>—These principles embrace, it is believed, the whole land system of

                    the Land Offices, go into the Treasury of the U. States. By the bill all will be paid over to the
                    States; giving also the new States a preference over the old States, in this distribution of 17 1/2
                    p. ct. of the receipts into their own Land Offices, being 12 1/2 p. ct. in addition to that they
                    already receive.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> Now if we do not adopt some such regulation as this, the Land
                    system remains as it is, and we get no part of the money. I say remains as it is, for every effort
                    to change it for many years past, has been unavailing.—But if we pass the bill the system
                    in other respects, remains as it is, and the States get the money.</p>
            <p>The bill appropriates for five years, from and after the 31st December, 1832. The nett proceeds of
                    the Sales of the Public Lands. One year of the term had expired on the 31st of December, 1833. The
                    amount received that year is known, and the dividend of each State is a matter of easy calculation.
                    The nett proceeds is about four per cent, less than the aggregate receipts. The aggregate receipts
                    for the year 1833, are $4,939,519 53, of which sum $694,319 81 was received in
                    the State of Indiana. 17 1/2 per cent, of the nett proceeds of this latter sum is
                    $116,645 70; the amount, to which Indiana would be entitled, as a primary
                    dividend.—Deduct 17 1/2 per cent, from the nett proceeds of the aggregate receipts, and
                    $3,912,099 49 is left to be divided among the 24 States of the Union, according to their
                    respective federal representative population, of which sum, Indiana would be entitled to
                    $114,102 - 90[.] These two sums amount to $230,748 60, the amount to which the
                    State would be entitled of the monies, which <list type="footnotes">

                    supposition that the present year, and the three subsequent years, will be as productive as the past
                    year; and the probability is that they will be more so, the dividend to which Indiana would be
                    entitled, under the five years existence of the Bill, would be $1,153,743.</p>
            <p>In addition to this, the Bill also gives to the State of Indiana, 115,272 acres of land, which at the
                    minimum price would be worth $144,090 00; making the whole amount, to which the State
                    would be entitled by the Bill, agreeably to the last years receipts, the sum of
                    $1,297,833 00. I make no error in estimating the nett proceeds; having the office
                    calculations before me; and the Bill now before the Senate, whatever may have been the provisions of
                    previous Bills, authorizes a dividend of the nett proceeds. I have been thus particular in stating
                    the provisions of this Land Bill, and the advantages offered by it to the State, whose interests are
                    entrusted in part to my care, knowing that a difference of opinion exists among the most honest, and
                    intelligent of our citizens, in relation to it, and believing that the subject is not generally well
                    understood. It is my firm belief, that whoever lives to the 31st December, 1837, should this Bill
                    not become a law, will see the Land System as it now is, and the monies paid into the Treasury of
                    the Union, instead of the Treasuries of the 24 States. The 31st of December, 1837, is the period
                    when the Bill would expire by its own limitations.</p>
            <p>The fear that the passage of this Bill would diminish the prospect of reducing the price, is not well
                    founded. The Bill itself expressly excludes such conclusion. The Bill however, is left among the
                    unfinished business of the Session.</p>
            <p>Another preemption law has passed, providing, "that every Settler or occupant of Public

            <p>The session having drawn to a close, I hasten, before leaving this place, to communicate, as has been
                    my practice ever since I have first been honored with a seat in Congress, to the People of the
                    State, the leading topics and features of the session. In these communications it has not been my
                    object to enforce my own opinions, either in reference to the measures of the present administration
                    of the General Government, or the Presidential election to come, but to confine myself, chiefly, to
                    the legislative proceedings of Congress, and the condition of the various interests of the country,
                    at home and abroad. It has been my object to speak of facts, rather than to give opinions, and
                    although it is impracticable to address such letter to every individual, even of my own
                    acquaintance, in the State, yet it is intended to be considered as addressed to every citizen, and
                    shall, if possible, be put and placed in every neighborhood and within the reach and view of every
                    citizen of the State.</p>
            <p>Confining myself however to these objects, and from them it is not my purpose to depart, this letter
                    must necessarily be less interesting than some which I have heretofore on similar occasions written,

                    have been a member. The political excitements heretofore numerous, and producing legislative
                    discussions and enactments of so much interest, has not so much abounded, as on former occasions.
                    The session has indeed been one comparatively of undisturbed calm and tranquillity. Few subjects and
                    few occasions have occurred to produce even animated debate. Among these may be mentioned the
                    subject of Executive patronage, on which a lengthy report was made in the Senate; and the subject of
                    our relations with <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, which is every day becoming more and more interesting.</p>
            <p>The subject of Executive patronage<hi rend="sup">36</hi> was referred to a select Committee of the
                    Senate, which made a lengthy report, the object of which was to compare the number of appointments
                    reposing on Executive power at the present time, or in the year 1833, with the number thus dependant
                    at a former period; and to compare also the expenditure of recent years, with that of former ones.
                    This comparison and this view of that sensitive subject, naturally tinctured the report, and the
                    measures proposed by the Committee, strongly with the spirit of party; and by this Committee
                    measures have been introduced, which in former years, have been repudiated and opposed by the party
                    which now sustain them. Such were the bills which passed the Senate, but which did not receive the
                    sanction of the House, on the subject of appointments to office, and of regulating the deposites of
                    the public moneys.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another measure proposed by this Committee was, an amendment of the Constitution, for a limited
                    period, to operate till January 1843, so as to permit a distribution of the surplus revenue, which
                    before that time is expected to accumulate in the Treasury. This surplus revenue is expected to
                    accrue on account of the final extinguishment of the national debt, and will be made up of that
                    annual surplus, over and above the current expenditures, which has her[e]tofore been applied to the
                    payment of the debt. This surplus, to a considerable extent, say nine millions a year, it is

                    tariff compromise bill of 1833, which will not expire till the year 1843, and those who deny the
                    constitutional power of distributing the surplus revenue among the States, require this amendment of
                    the Constitution for that purpose. The measure, however, has very little prospect of success, for
                    those who assert the existing power under the Constitution as it is, and those who would not thus
                    tamper with that sacred instrument for any such <hi rend="i">temporary</hi> purpose, will not be
                    found voting for such amendment; and these it is believed make a large majority of both houses.</p>
            <p>There are, however, in this report, some curious and startling facts. The number of those dependant
                    in a greater or less degree on the Treasury of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, are stated to exceed one hundred thousand; almost double the number so dependent ten
                    years ago. And the current expenditures of the Government are stated to have been in 1833 much
                    greater than the current expenditures in 1825. This report, and the measures by way of remedy
                    proposed, have produced animated discussions, but do not promise to be productive of any practical
                    result. The subject will probably be exhausted in ministering food to party appetite. Should the
                    revenue in coming years be found greatly to exceed the wants of the Government, the tariff will, or
                    ought to be, so modified as to protect the manufactures of the country, and let articles not
                    manufactured in the country come in duty free; thus diminishing to the amount necessary for the
                    current expenditures. But in this regulation it is to be hoped that some permanent beneficial
                    arrangement will be made for the internal improvement of the country, in its roads, rivers, and
                    canals. And it is reasonable too to hope, though there does not appear much foundation for such
                    hope, that under such circumstances, when we have more revenue than we know what to do with, and
                    when the difficulty is not, how we shall raise revenue, but how we shall diminish it, we shall
                    obtain for the new States some favorable regulation on the subject of the lands.</p>
            <p>To an unbiassed reader of the Constitution, one unlearned in the various constructions of that
                    instrument, it would certainly appear strange, that, with an overflowing Treasury, and one difficult
                    to diminish there should be hesitation, or difficulty, with any class of politicians, on the subject
                    of internal <pb n="353" id="VAA4025-071-4-059"/> improvements, which all admit the value of, and
                    which the States, however destitute of means, are prosecuting with energy and zeal.</p>
            <p>For the same reason, the superabundance of our revenue, it would seem at first view strange, that so
                    much disinclination should be felt, by the Representatives of the old States, to the wishes of the
                    new States, on the subject of the public lands. But this can be accounted for, by the consideration,
                    that the reduction of the price in the new States, diminishes the value of land in the old States,
                    and that every inducement to actual settlers in the new States, draws proportionally the population,
                    and diminishes the prosperity of the old States; and there appears to be as little prospect of
                    reduction of price, as any other measure proposed in relation to the public lands. The graduating
                    principle, though unquestionably reasonable and just, and especially so in districts which have been
                    long in market, is considered but the proposition in another form, to reduce the price, and has no
                    prospect of success. The bill proposing a distribution of the proceeds of the public lands for five
                    years from and after the 31st of December, 1832, has not been acted on by either house during the
                    session. The proceeds of the public lands during the last year are much greater than ever before.</p>
            <p>Our relations with <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> is a vexed and dangerous subject. The history of this matter is perhaps generally
                    understood.—It is however, short, and may be stated in a few words. By treaty with that
                    Government, on the 4th of July, 1831, <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> became bound to pay to this Government, for the benefit of citizens of the U. States,
                    25,000,000, of f[r]ancs, or $5,000,000, on account of spoliations on American commerce
                        [.]<hi rend="sup">38</hi> This sum, the Legislative Dapartment [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] of that
                    Government has thus far refused to appropriate and pay. In consequence of this, the President of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, in his last annual message, alluded to the subject in strong terms of reprobation, and
                    recommending the passage of law, authorizing reprisals upon the commerce of <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, in the event of the Chamber of Deputies adjourning their present session, without
                    appropriating money to pay this debt. The message of the President having arrived at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> before the Legislative body had determined the question of payment, a great sensation
                    seems to have been produced by it. The <list type="footnotes">

                    ports have been tendered to our Minister, Mr. [Edward] Livingston. Thus stands the case by our last
                    advices from Europe; and if the French Chambers persevere in their refusal to camply [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] with the sol[e]mn obligations of treaty, war will in all probability grow out of the
                    case. The Senate, as early as January, unanimously determined not to legislate on the subject at the
                    present session, and the House of Representatives at a late period, have come to a similar
                    conclus[i]on. Both nations are strongly interested in the preservation of peace. A large and
                    prosperous commerce exists between them, which would be interrupted, and, for a while destroyed, by
                    a state of war. The amount in controversy, would be as dust in the ballance, compared with the
                    expenses of a war to either nation. Both Governments are powerful on the ocean; <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> much the largest fleet, but the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> the most naval efficiency and power. Nothing but the strong appetite of the French
                    people for war, and their injustice towards us on the present occasion, can lead to that
                    catastrophe. We have a large squadron in the Mediterranean, which might be endangered by a sudden
                    determination on hostilities on their part. It would be exposed to the power of their whole naval
                    force.</p>
            <p>A war with <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> would be a war upon the ocean, and there exclusively, and the navy alone could
                    participate in it. In such a war the ardor and chivalry of the army, and the youth of our country,
                    could not be gratified, and there is less danger of appetite for war in our own country, than if the
                    conflict were to be carried on both by land and sea. It would especially do us in the interior much
                    evil, and could not do us any good; would destroy to a great extent the coasting trade, and impose
                    upon us the additional cost of transporting much of our produce to the eastern Atlantic cities over
                    the mountains or by way of the lakes, instead of a water communication by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> and around the coast.</p>
            <p>A few general subjects which occupied the session to a late hour, crowded out much business which had
                    matured, and which would have required but a short portion of time; and in this way more unfinished
                    business than usual has been left on the files of the session. Of this may be named the bill

            <p>These bills having passed the Senate, could not be reached in the House, chiefly owing to the last

                    acted on by either house. Among these may be mentioned the bill to establish post roads, and the

                            circuits courts should be abolished; otherwise, he said, their jurisdiction should be

            <p>A<hi rend="sc">NOTHER</hi> Session of strange and peculiar character is drawing near to a close, and
                    as heretofore has been my custom, I purpose on the present occasion, to give to the People of the
                    State, a brief outline of the business transacted by it, and pending before it. It has been a
                    Session of great interest, novel in its character and incidents and calculated to produce a strong
                    and exciting action upon the body politic throughout the <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The Surplus Revenue, strange as it may appear, has been the most difficult question of the Session.
                    The surplus on hand, was admitted, by a report of the Secretary of the Treasury [Levi Woodbury], of
                    the 9th of June last, to be upwards of thirty-three millions. This in the vaults of the Deposite
                    Banks, was withdraw [n] from circulation, or its circulation in all respects, subjected to the
                    discretion of those institutions.—Various plans have been proposed for getting rid of it:
                    such as Distribution among the States; building Fortifications on the sea board, and ships of war;
                    and the Land Bill. These several schemes have had their advocates, but, until a late period of the
                    Session, the probability was, that the whole surplus would be expended, in building fortifications,
                    and ships of war, and in arming them. The friends of the Land Bill were not however opposed to a
                    gradual increase of the Navy and fortifications, nor to appropriations much enlarged for these
                    objects; but they contended for a distribution of the proceeds of land sales, leaving the revenue
                    from all other sources, for the current expenditures of the Government.</p>
            <p>I voted for the Land bill; think the distribution it proposes, the best that we in the new States can
                    ever hope to get, and believe that unless we get this, we get nothing else valuable to us on that
                    subject.—Reduction of price, and graduation, have been unsuccessfully tried for ten or
                    fifteen years. I have heretofore in letters like this, given my views in this matter, and entered
                    into calculations to show the amount which this bill, in five years, would divide to the State of

                    increase of land sales of late, and especially within the last year, that all my calculations have
                    been left far on the back ground. The receipts from the Public Lands during the past year exceeded
                    fifteen millions, and there is good reasons to believe that during the present year, they will
                    exceed twenty millions.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> The dividend to which Indiana would be entitled of the
                    sum on hand, the 27th January last, is, agreeably to a report of the committee on Public lands,
                    $917,213 and this is little more than two-fifths of the sum which would have been
                    distributed by the bill. This is in my opinion better for us, than building ships to rot in our
                    docks and harbours, before we shall ever find use for them, for we have at present more than are
                    ever employed at the same time. It is better too than building useless fortifications, which must be
                    abandoned in a great measure to dilapidation after they are built; for unless we greatly increase
                    our Army, we shall not have men enough to garrison them.</p>
            <p>It is believed by many, whose opinions are entitled to great respect, that the amount which would be
                    distributed by the Land Bill, in five years, would be upwards of $50,000,000, and that
                    the surplus for distribution by the other mode, will be somewhere between thirty and forty millions.
                    The Land Bill had long been before the House of Representatives, having passed the Senate, and no
                    action upon it promising a favourable result having been had, other dispositions of the surplus were
                    proposed.</p>
            <p>The propositions to deposite in the State Treasuries, the surplus which shall be on hand on the first
                    of January next, leaving five millions in the Treasury of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, has been adopted by large majorities of both Houses and received the sanction of the
                    President. From thirty-five to forty millions will in all probability be deposited in the State
                    Treasuries under that law. But the distribution of the same sum by the Land Bill, would have been
                    better for the new States by ten per cent., because by it, they would have received ten per cent, of
                    the monies received from the sales, before any general division would have taken place. By the other
                    bill no such advantage is given to the new States. This <list type="footnotes">

                    way. On the 27th of January last, agreeably to a report of the Committee on the Public Lands of the
                    Senate, there were for distribution as proposed by the Land Bill, $20,571,125. - 75[.]
                    The dividend of Indiana out of this sum, is $917,213, agreeably to the Land Bill.
                    Agreeably to the other bill it is ten per cent. less. But the Land Bill does not terminate on the
                    first of January next, as the other bill does. It distributes the proceeds of the Land sales till
                    the 31st of December, 1837, ten or fifteen millions in all probability after the other bill will
                    cease to operate on the receipts into the Treasury. In addition to this, the Land Bill contained an
                    appropriation of 115,000 acres of land in favour of the State of Indiana, which if judiciously
                    selected in the new lands, not yet brought into market, would have been worth from three to
                    $500,000. Taking then these three items, the difference in the amounts distributed under
                    the two bills; the ten per. cent., and the 115,000 acres of land, and it is a calculation perfectly
                    safe, that the difference to Indiana between these two bills, would exceed one million of dollars.
                    The time however will soon come, in which this whole matter will be told in dollars and cents at the
                    Treasury. On the first of January next it will be known how much will be deposited in the Treasuries
                    under the law just passed, and on the 31st December, 1837, it will be known how much has been
                    received from the land sales in five previous years. Besides the distributions under the Land Bill
                    were final payments to the States.—By the other bill the money deposited in the State
                    Treasuries are liable to be recalled whenever the Secretary of the Treasury shall determine that
                    such recall is necessary for the Government. Such recall however, is by no means probable. The law
                    which has just passed is worth to the State, probably more than a million of dollars.</p>
            <p>I voted for both bills; think the provisions of either better in all respects, than the former
                    condition of things, and have given my reasons for prefering the Land Bill. Had both bills passed,
                    the land proceeds would have first been distributed, because the Land Bill designates a particular
                    fund, and makes a final disposition of it. In that event, the other bill would have merely regulated
                    the deposites of the current revenue, for the time being, in the local Banks.</p>

                    Indian war, in which the country has ever been engaged. The Seminoles are a small tribe of Indians,
                    surrounded by the Gulf and Atlantic coasts on the South and East, and by <placeName>

                    country, and have kept in check and eluded the pursuit of armies, which in the open field could have
                    consumed them in an hour.—They are yet unsubdued, having laid the country waste from the

                    attempted to some extent, a union and a concert with the Seminoles. A fearful retribution however
                    awaits them, unless prevented by speedy and entire submission. They have no inaccessible country in
                    which to hide themselves. These things will hasten the removal of all the Southern Indians, to the

                    </placeName>; the rising of the Creeks; the strong detachment necessary to be kept up on the Sabine,

                    </placeName>, and indeed, upon the whole line. This location of the Indians, and our existing
                    treaties with them, by which we guarantee them peace among themselves, and protection against the
                    wandering tribes further West, has created the necessity for Dragoon service; but it will greatly
                    increase our power and control over them. It will enable our troops to find them embodied, and in a
                    plain smooth country, remote from impenetrable forest and fastnesses, such as have enabled them thus
                    far to injure and elude our troops in <placeName>

                    The Pottawattamies will, no doubt, soon be gone; but the Miamies own large and desirable

                    ratification. Two unsuccessful efforts have been made to have it modified, and so the matter rests.
                    Believing that time would increase rather than diminish the difficulty of treating with them, I

                    exclusively belonging to themselves. The expediency of abolishing it here was, however, the chief
                    question, and the petitioners have no right to complain of any thing, unless it be the
                    disinclination to receive their petitions, and the rejection of the prayer of their petitions

                    better it is for the peace and welfare of the Union.</p>
            <p>The present Congress met at a period when the Foreign Relations of the country were lowering and
                    portentous. When the country was on the very verge of a French war, which no one seemed to have
                    realized or expected, and of which the danger was not discovered until it was exhibited by the

                    had to a certain extent, spent their force in the presidential election, and the public mind as it
                    seemed to require a season of rest, so it appears to have settled down into a spirit and condition
                    of repose. The presidential election resulted in a choice of one of the candidates, not as had been
                    predicted by many, and wished by some.<hi rend="sup">57</hi> Had that election come into the House
                    of Representatives, as in 1825 the excitement would have been kept up, and the scenes of that epoch,

            <p>The election for Vice President, did not however result in the choice of any one of the candidates in
                    the colleges of electors. Of the two hundred and ninety four electoral votes given, one hundred and
                    forty eight were necessary to a choice, and Colonel [Richard M.] Johnson of <placeName>

                    of the votes were divided among three other candidates. This election under the Constitution of the <placeName>

            <p>The session has been a short one, and but little new business originated. It has chiefly been
                    employed in legislating upon the unfinished business of last session.</p>
            <p>The Treasury Circular requiring the payment of specie for public lands, will in all probability,
                    before the close of the present session, be superceded by law. A bill to that effect has already
                    passed the Senate. The object of this bill is, gradually to throw the influence of the treasury,
                    into the scale of specie circulation, in place of small bank notes, by excluding such from being
                    received in the land offices and custom-houses. It provides for the receipt of all solvent bank
                    paper of the country which shall be accredited as specie by the deposit banks. No notes are to be
                    received, or accredited by the deposite banks of less denomination than five dollars. After July
                    1839, and until July, 1841 none of a less denomination than ten dollars; and after that, none are to
                    be received of a less denomination than twenty dollars. Nor is any bank to receive of the public
                    deposites, which shall refuse to comply with these regulations. Thus will this matter hereafter be
                    regulated by law, and be taken, in a great measure, out of the control of the Treasury Department.
                    This bill has been adopted by a very large vote of the Senate, and cannot fail to remove the fiscal
                    pressure from the country, as far as that pressure has been produced, or kept in existence by the
                    operation of the Specie Circular.<hi rend="sup">61</hi>

            <p>In both Houses, bills have been reported to modify the tariff, to the revenue necessary for the
                    current expenses of the Government, but there is no probability that any law will pass on that
                    subject at the present Session. It would in the opinion of many, be a violation of good faith to
                    disturb the compromise arrangement of 1833, which will not expire till 1842. Besides, no one can
                    tell what amount of revenue will then be necessary for the Government—what new
                    expenditures; what change of policy; what wars the country may be engaged in. Already have we been
                    subjected to the expenditure of millions, which at the date of that compromise, no one could have
                    foreseen, as at all probable. These have been occasioned by various causes; the miserable Seminole
                    war which still lingers; and the consequent increase of the Army; a corresponding increase of Naval
                    expenditures, induced by the troubles apparent with <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> not long since, and the unprecedented expansion of our commerce in every direction.
                    These have required a proportionate enlargement of our Naval equipments, and our squadrons and ships
                    are cruising on almost every ocean and sea on the face of the globe. The tariff then will not
                    probably be touched at present, and the bills referred to, may be considered as feelers of public
                    sentiment, rather than movements promising immediate legislation.<hi rend="sup">64</hi>

            <p>The Public Lands, as heretofore, have been a very fruitful source of legislative effort, and have

                    in his message at the commencement of the session, had recommended the limitation of the sales to
                    actual settlers, and the subject was referred of course to the Committee on the Public Lands. The
                    Committee reported a bill in conformity to the message, with the principle of pre-emption in favor
                    of early occupants. The subject is one on which a greater variety of opinion exists than almost any
                    other. The bill was amended, and finally passed the Senate, but its fate in the House is
                        doubtful.<hi rend="sup">65</hi> It is limited to the year 1840. The land receipts of the year

                    </placeName>, a wretched military despotism.—Revolutions only change its form; its spirit
                    and genius remain the same, and the change produced by Santa Anna, in 1834, from confederation, to
                    consolidation, tho' much to be complained of on the part of the States, which were thus
                    deprived of self government, was one li[t]tle felt or understood by the Spanish and Mexican
                    population. In <placeName>

            <p>Our foreign relations are in a condition of prosperity and peace. With the exception of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, our intercourse with all the nations of the earth, is on a footing or [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] perfect harmony and good will. Seldom has peace been more general on the earth, than
                    at the present time. A civil war it is true prevails in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and the affairs of Portugal are not entirely at rest. The recent expedition too of the
                    French, has retired from Algiers in disaster and disgrace. But with a few such exceptions as these,
                    a profound peace exists throughout the civilized world; the sword has returned to its scabbard, and
                    men to the arts of peace.</p>

                    circumstance, a large amount of the appropriation of last year remains unexpended. To this balance,
                    $100,000 will probably be added for our State, and the work it is hoped and believed will
                    progress rapidly during the present year.<hi rend="sup">68</hi>

                    she presented herself at the last Session, and demanded admission as a State of the Union. This was
                    refused her, and a law passed, requiring her so to modify her Constitution in the article of
                    boundary, as to exclude the disputed Territory. On this subject she has held within the last six
                    months two conventions, the latter of which modified her boundaries as proposed by the law of last

                    great Republic, than the last twenty years. The picture is one of dazzling national glory; and is
                    only dimmed and obscured by our own discords and the prospects of disunion.—Twenty years
                    ago, the Land Sales had for the past years, averaged less than $1,000,000 a
                    year.—Last year they exceeded $26,000,000. In 1820 the population of the <placeName>

            <p>Nothing mars our view of unrivaled future prosperity, and of our march to it, so much as the
                    condition of slavery in the Southern States, and the feeling and spirit of abolition which prevails
                    in the North. This is the rock on which the vessel of the Union is likely to split. The condition of
                    slavery in the Southern States, it is admitted by all, cannot always remain as it is. The free
                    population of the South are continually draining in a greater or less degree to the North [.] This
                    process is materially affecting that condition in the South. It is giving slavery more power, or
                    rather the slave population greater comparative numbers than before. In addition to this, slaves are
                    continually crowding further to the South. Slavery has long since been wholly abolished in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, and all the States further North. There is little of it even now in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>, <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>,
                            <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, will soon cease to de [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] slaveholding States.—The
                    slave population will be crowded into the States further South, where their numbers and physical
                    power cannot fail to endanger the peace and safety of the whites. This is a gloomy picture, but in
                    the ordinary course of events, it is sure to be realized. Still the non-slaveholding States have
                    nothing to do with slavery in the Southern States. This is a matter of State regulation altogether.
                    If the Union had not been formed, could the people north of the Potomac have interferred with
                    slavery in the South? Surely not. The Union was formed without giving the Federal Government any
                    power over the subject slave [except] in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="dcu">District of Columbia</country>
                    </placeName>.—Wisdom and patriotism itself, then, would say let this matter alone. Let
                    the Southern States treat this delicate and dangerous subject in their own way. Let not the States
                    and the people of the North hasten the evil day. <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>, whether annexed to the Union or not, is a great slave market for the South. It will
                    induce the current of slave population there, and may divert and possibly prevent the disasters of a
                    too great accumulation of slaves in the States furthest South. This may diffuse the slave population
                    so as to diminish at all events the danger to be apprehended from it.</p>
            <p>A few days will terminate the present Session, and with it in all probability forever, the period of
                    my public labors in the service of Indiana. It is not for me to say in what manner I have discharged
                    the duties committed to my care. This however I might be permitted to say, and I hope I might <pb n="374" id="VAA4025-071-4-080"/> say it without arrogance, that in every situation of public
                    life to which I have been called, in no instance, has any consideration of personal interest, or
                    ambition, been allowed to take place of the interests of the State. However humble may have been the
                    talents and qualifications brought into her service, they have been faithfully employed in giving
                    impulse to her best interests. Others may serve her with more ability, but none with more devotion,
                    zeal and fidelity, than the humble indivi[d]ual, who owes [so much] to her partiality ond [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] kindnes[s], and who now closes a public life, unsought, and unlooked for in
                    its commencement, of twenty-one years.<hi rend="sup">71</hi>—Whatever may have been the
                    ardor and intensity of my zeal and industry in her service, and of my devotion to her interests;
                    whatever may have been the buffetings of political life and the fiery ordeal through which I have
                    passed, conscious I am, that I shall never cease to owe her a debt of gratitude, and one so large
                    that I shall never be able to pay.</p>
            <p>Neither prosperity nor adversity can ever eradicate these things from my mind, or separate me in
                    heart and affection from the people of the State. I have seen many days of her prosperity: in which
                    she has grown and flourished like "a green bay tree." I have seen many of her
                    important interests rising into existence. Some of them in infancy have been especially committed to
                    my care; some of these have since gained colossal size and strength, and now march forward with
                    irresistible power, overcoming by their own energies every thing that comes in their
                    way.—Such is the <placeName>

                    </placeName> and Erie Canal, and the Cumberland Road. These were the first important public works
                    commenced in our State and they are still, and ever will be, the main arteries in our system of
                    internal improvement. Whilst I shall live to behold the waters of the <placeName>

            <p>This brief volume, part of the Twayne <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Authors Series, is a literary study of Newton Booth Tarkington (1869–1946),
                    whom the author asserts is in need of reassessment. Criticized because he adhered "to a
                    constant attitude toward basic aspects of literature," Tarkington was "a practical
                    idealist who envisioned a gradual merging of tempered materialism and enlightened capitalism which
                    would result in a progressively higher standard of living for all" (p. 7–8).
                    "A Howellsian Realist," he was a "conservative in a time of
                    liberalization" who ironically became "a rebel against what he considered to be a
                    distressing attack upon formalism and taste in modern literature, an alarming invasion of morality
                    during the Flapper Age, and a depersonalization of the individual in a mechanized society"
                    (preface). Author of over thirty novels, the Hoosier writer recorded late in his life that his
                    peers, perhaps understandably, judged him "a complacent old gentleman" (p. 144).
                    He had none of William Dean Howells' misgivings about lifelong adherence to the literary
                    principles of the genteel tradition and cherished an "indomitable optimism"
                    intended to "lift the human spirit" (pp. 141, 142).</p>
            <p>In organizing his case Fennimore stresses Tarkington's formative years, his
                    "practical idealism" after use of regional and historical romance, his reliance on
                    characterization, his special contribution to juvenile literature, and his place among American
                    writers. The author's seven chapters are divided into numerous subtopics. Such a format is
                    distracting, as is the writer's imprecise or obscure prose. The author seems to assume that
                    his audience has read much Tarkington and that the reader understands such concepts as
                    "practical idealism" (p. 59) and "selective realism" (p. 47).
                    The work, intended as a literary study and not a biography, relies heavily on secondary sources,
                    particularly one by James Woodress. More use of Tarkington papers, or at least Tarkington novels,
                    could have been made. It is distressing that the author admits that the best work on his subject has
                    already been written by Woodress, thus raising the question as to why another book is needed.</p>
            <pb n="376" id="VAA4025-071-4-082"/>
            <p>What is more bothersome is the writer's uncritical account of Tarkington. Perhaps that
                    results from his feeling that the nation needs the inspirational qualities of his subject (p. 142).
                    Whether such qualities make one an artist is another matter. Tarkington rejected thorough going
                    realism because "a thing is not art if a pinch of dirt is deliberately added to make it
                    sell" (p. 133) and naturalism because it was "inimical to his artistic
                    temperament, as well as to his religious ideals" (p. 31). Whether his novels provided a
                    significant amount of realism is debatable, particularly since entertainment and humor were basic to
                    them. Tarkington's professed aversion to the writer's exploiting the public seems
                    weakened by the remark that he was "an astute judge of both the literary mart and popular
                    taste" (p. 80), and by the fact that all but one of his novels were first serialized in a
                    periodical. A millionaire from his writings, he judged "monetary success [as] the
                    justifiable product of professional craftsmanship" (p. 48). Tarkington felt a writer was
                    obliged to lift the human spirit, not to right wrongs. The frequent reference to Tarkington as a
                    craftsman also undermines the author's claim as to his subject's creativity (pp.
                    48, 78, for example).</p>
            <p>In sum, Fennimore presents a picture of a skilled writer who, although touching upon social concerns,
                    was neither realist nor naturalist. Tarkington is lauded because of his popular appeal, as judged by
                    book sales, as well as for that "practical idealism" which "would stand
                    us in good stead in a none-too-brave new world" (p. 142). Fennimore presents a case for his
                    subject as a talented writer who provided entertaining and uplifting literature and offered
                    occasional glimpses of the influence of industrialization and urbanization in the Middle West. None
                    of this convinces one, however, to think of Tarkington as an artist.</p>

            <p>The term "dean," as well as the educational role once identified by it, has
                    recently lost some of the aura with which it was once surrounded. This is a natural result of the
                    massive <pb n="377" id="VAA4025-071-4-083"/> expansion of universities and the proliferation of
                    their once simple but functional governance structure. It is clear, however, that the dean depicted
                    in this book held office back in an era when deans were truly deans.</p>
            <p>Andrey A. Potter served as dean of the Division of Engineering at <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> State College (Manhattan) from 1913 to 1920 and then went to Purdue University where he
                    held the position of dean of the Schools of Engineering until his formal retirement in 1953. At
                    neither institution was Potter merely a presider, office holder, or passive administrator; rather he
                    was a catalyst for building, an inspirational leader, and the personification of a gentleman
                    professor. Clearly he excelled in all three of the categories for which the performance of
                    university professionals are allegedly judged (teaching, research, and service). It is men like
                    Potter whose exemplary record gave rise to these performance criteria.</p>
            <p>As summarized by Professor Eckles, Potter's life and career read like a Horatio Alger novel.
                    Just prior to his sixteenth birthday the future dean journeyed—alone—to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vilna</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Russia. His family had early recognized and nurtured his versatile interests, among
                    which were history, poetry, languages, science, and music. "He narrowly escaped becoming a
                    child musical prodigy" (p. 6), but his real lodestar was America's Benjamin
                    Franklin. When he stepped off the train at North Station in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1897, he learned "that Benjamin Franklin was not in residence" (p.
                    8), but he quickly adjusted to the situation by gaining admission to "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> Tech," today's <placeName>

                    </placeName> Institute of Technology. There he received a sound curricular basis for what would be a
                    remarkable professional career.</p>
            <p>This background and his subsequent experience with the General Electric Company in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Schenectady</settlement>
                    </placeName> were vital components in Potter's career preparation, but these alone did not
                    create the dean. In molding his career Potter made full use of many, many talents, some of which
                    were congenital, others of which he learned and cultivated in his adopted country. He personified
                    the engineer-scientist, and at times the managerial entrepreneur. But the dean's prime
                    quality was his ability to lead and inspire through personal example. This best accounts for his
                    successes in the instructional laboratory, for his administrative effectiveness, and for the
                    deserving accolades he received from his professional contemporaries at Purdue and elsewhere
                    throughout the nation.</p>
            <pb n="378" id="VAA4025-071-4-084"/>
            <p>Undoubtedly many persons have helped pave the way for Purdue University's current status of
                    greatness, but this biographical account provides convincing evidence that Dean A. A. Potter was
                    among those at the forefront of this development. And although this account is not a model of
                    biographical scholarship, it does provide interesting insights about Purdue University as an
                    evolving institution and the role that personal leadership has had in this development.</p>

                    index. $15.95.)</head>
            <p>As Shade notes in his introduction, historians have presented conflicting interpretations about
                    "western banking" in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. He suggests that Frederick Jackson Turner viewed currency inflation and wildcat
                    banking as frontier phenomenon, but later pointed out the significant increase of state banks in the
                    thirties and the antibank movement which followed in most states. In Shade's words, Bray
                    Hammond contended that "opposition to banks and monetary expansion typified the
                    agricultural West and that the push for easy money was more closely related to the needs of business
                    enterprise" (p. 13). <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hammond</settlement>
                    </placeName> considered western emphasis on state banking monopolies immediately preceding the Panic
                    of 1837, its strong antibank sentiment in the forties, and the development of free banking in the
                    fifties "as responses to the area's changing economic structure" (p. 13).
                    More recently, Shade notes, James Roger Sharp argued "that the conflict over banks after
                    1837 reflected the true nature of Jacksonian democracy and the essential difference between the
                    parties in the following decade" (p. 14).</p>
            <p>Shade states: "Nowhere was the contest over banks more bitterly fought than in the rapidly
                    growing states of … <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>, <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>" (p. 11). Suggesting that before the Panic of 1837 "neither free
                    banking nor wildcat banks … were common" in the Old Northwest, Shade concludes
                    that this panic "accelerated the polarization of attitudes on the bank issue as parties
                    emerged more distinctly in the late 1830s" (p. 15). Then in the forties Democrats became
                        <pb n="379" id="VAA4025-071-4-085"/> increasingly against banks and generally opposed free
                    banking in the fifties, while the Whigs, unable to obtain a national bank, became proponents of free
                    banking. The Republicans espoused free banking in the fifties and then secured its nationalization,
                    against vigorous Democratic opposition, with the creation of national banks during the sixties.</p>
            <p>Shade explains this polarization between parties in the Old Northwest on the basis of underlying
                    social and cultural cleavages. Though considering economic influences, he insists that the basic
                    "conflict" was "between the Yankee-Protestants in the Whig and Republican
                    parties" versus "an ethnically and religiously diverse" Democratic party
                    which "combined enthusiasm for cultural pluralism with vicious antiblack racism"
                    (p. 253). But Shade's evidence for this thesis is not substantial enough to be convincing.
                    To credit the triumph which free banking gained from the Indiana Constitution of 1851 and the free
                    banking law of 1852 to the Whigs and Republicans is surprising in view of the lopsided dominance
                    which the Democrats had of the convention and legislature which authorized same. Though Indiana
                    Whigs and Republicans were doubtless more homogeneous than their Democratic rivals, no Hoosier party
                    could then have garnered a viable majority from "Yankee-Protestants" nor did the
                    Democrats have any monopoly on "vicious antiblack racism." Nevertheless, this
                    volume adds much useful information and important perspectives about banking in the Old Northwest.</p>

            <p>Henry Blake Fuller (1857–1929) was a writer of considerable interest to anyone concerned
                    with the development of American fiction in the decades around the turn of the century. In addition,
                    Fuller's divided allegiance to Europe and America—particularly to a
                    "refined" but decadent <placeName>
                        <country reg="it">Italy</country>
                    </placeName> and a "raw" but vital <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>—typifies the American artist's ambivalent attitude toward the
                    values of the old world and the new. Literary critics and historians like Van Wyck <pb n="380" id="VAA4025-071-4-086"/> Brooks, Granville Hicks, Alfred Kazin, Larzer Ziff, and Edmund Wilson
                    have found much to admire in Fuller's work; indeed, Wilson suggested that one of the short
                    stories might well be required reading for a course in American history, so concisely did it capture
                    an important shift in national attitudes. By all odds, Fuller should years ago have been the subject
                    of the full length portrait Bowron has given us here, and <hi rend="i">Henry B. Fuller of <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> makes an important contribution to an understanding of American literature
                    during a period of sweeping change.</p>
            <p>Bowron, whose research on Fuller began nearly thirty years ago, is clearly convinced of his
                    subject's importance, maintaining that among other things the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> writer was the "first novelist fully conscious of the need to make use of the
                    post-Civil War American city as material for <hi rend="i">art</hi>—and capable of doing
                    so" (p. xv). Though he acknowledges the difficulty of providing precise biographical
                    information about the reclusive Fuller and claims that his study "will not concern itself
                    with personal history as such but with a way of life and the special quality of the literature which
                    that way of life produced" (p. xxv), Bowron nonetheless presents as detailed an account of
                    Fuller's life as is likely to appear for some time. This carefully researched
                    "personal history" is based largely on Fuller's own diaries and letters,
                    as well as on the recollections of relatives and friends. Furthermore, Bowron indicates the
                    "special quality" of Fuller's work by his critical appraisals of
                    individual titles and their relationship to the so called <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Renaissance and to the mainstream of American literary and intellectual history.</p>
            <p>Since the poverty of published research on Fuller forced Bowron to concentrate on assimilating the
                    known information (widely scattered in sources spanning a century), he had little opportunity to
                    investigate the more obscure corners of Fuller's life and career. For example, nothing is
                    said of Fuller's alleged homosexuality (first mentioned by Wilson only as recently as
                    1970), nor is there much emphasis on Fuller's later years. Most of the book deals with
                    Fuller's life to 1900, with just thirty-five pages allocated to the last four decades of
                    his life—years that saw the publication of nearly half his creative output. One feels
                    that more attention might have been paid to later, frankly experimental works like the 1918 novel
                        <hi rend="i">On the Stairs</hi> or to Fuller's achievement as a <pb n="381" id="VAA4025-071-4-087"/> literary critic in the 1920s. But if one is inclined to object that <hi rend="i">Henry B. Fuller of <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> fails to break such new ground, this intelligent survey compensates with its
                    assimilation of materials—an accomplishment which will certainly provide the basis for
                    further studies of a neglected writer whose "ordeal," as Bowron shows us, was at
                    once so intensely personal and so characteristically American.</p>

            <p>The title calls this book a novel; the dust jacket bills it as a "fascinating historical
                    account"; the author's statement of dedication denotes it "a novel
                    … based on history." A statement in the foreword by Josephine M. Elliott,
                    archivist, Indiana State University, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, most aptly describes the fictionalized narrative: a "story of a sweet and
                    poignant romance" (p. 7). The author's preface asserts that the characters of this
                    story mainly "were all real people, but their lives bear the mark of fiction" (p.
                    9). In addition Henderson explains: "Several minor incidents and one major event (the
                    attempted elopement of Gertrude Rapp) are based on the author's imagination and/or the
                    faded remnants of old rumors. Almost all other events in the story are based on fact" (p.
                    9). The heroine of this story is Hildegarde Mutschler, a real person whose life is essentially
                    accurately portrayed here. The author's introduction closes by noting the significance of
                    this book about Hildegarde: "And those who loved her watched and held their breath, not
                    quite sure how she would be blown by the winds which buffeted her with such contrary
                    forces" (p. 13).</p>
            <p>This review quotes heavily from the book in order to demonstrate what seems to be a conflict in
                    conception and purpose. The apparatus of four prefatory statements and an afterword (p. 237) go far
                    in trying to create the impression of an historical account. This is not to minimize the amount of
                    research the author has done to establish the framework for this story, but in no way can this story
                    be considered an <pb n="382" id="VAA4025-071-4-088"/> "historical account of" or
                    even "A Novel About the Harmonist Society." The events of the history of Father
                    George Rapp's Harmonist Society—real and imagined—serve basically one
                    purpose, as a vehicle for the presentation of the inner conflict of Hildegarde Mutschler. Events and
                    people generally are presented as Hildegarde's perception of them and interpreted in terms
                    of her. There are glimpses of Harmonist life accurately portrayed, but this is in reality a romantic
                    tale about a young woman torn between the celibate life of the Harmonists and life with a husband
                    and children. Many women would agree with the author's (Hildegarde's) reasoning
                    and her ultimate choice. Considered in these terms the story is a success. In addition the book is
                    very readable.</p>

            <p>Ralph Newman has searched Lincoln's autobiographical observations, arranged them
                    chronologically, and provided transitions and notes. The result is a very brief account, revealing
                    Lincoln's genius for precise phrasing as well as his modesty, humor, and tragic sense of
                    life. Some quotations have contemporary relevance. "I thought the act of sending an armed
                    force among the Mexicans," Lincoln said of President James K. Polk, "was <hi rend="i">unconstitutional</hi>, because the power of levying war is vested in Congress, and not
                    in the President" (p. 40). After the unsuccessful contest with Stephen Douglas in 1858,
                    Lincoln announced: "The cause of civil liberty must not be surrendered at the end of <hi rend="i">one</hi>, or even <hi rend="i">one hundred</hi> defeats" (p. 49). Newman fails
                    to include Lincoln's opposition to suffrage for blacks and his parenthetical support for
                    woman's suffrage during his campaign for the <placeName>

            <p>Scholars will find nothing new, but general readers will be engrossed with the familiar eloquence of
                    Lincoln's sparse prose. He went to school "by littles"; his store
                    "winked out"; his marrying was "a matter of profound wonder."
                    His election to Congress, he said, "has not pleased me as much as I expected" (p.
                    39). After assuming a task "greater than that which rested upon <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>" (p. 60), he wished that "war was an easier and pleasanter business
                    than it is; but it does not admit of holidays" (p. 73). Responding to a serenade after <placeName>

                    </placeName>, he asked the band to play "Dixie," claiming it as "our

                    </placeName> was unable to free her own prose from the well worn stereotypes and stock phrases of
                    historical romance. Her Indians, for example, never hide, <pb n="384" id="VAA4025-071-4-090"/> wait,
                    or spy; they "lurk" (pp. 72, 135, 247). They also "go on the
                    warpath" (p. 102), where they engage in "drenching the frontiers with the
                    blood" of the settlers (p. 32) and setting the South "aflame" with horror
                    (p. 249). The settlers—"hardy" (p. 22), "plain" and
                    "unassuming" (p. 3)—who find haven in "the trackless
                    west" and form "the backbone of the westward movement" (p. 16) go
                    "about the business of forming a permanent government with one hand and defending
                    themselves from the Indians with another" (p. 185), all the while observing "the
                    little amenities which, from the beginning, have made the social life of the South so gracious and
                    charming" (p. 207). As deplorable as this surfeit of cliche are the occasions when the
                    narrative stumbles into factual error (John Adams was not president during the Genet Affair [p.
                    219]), semantic error ("revolting," as in "<placeName>

                    "rebelling"), and unintentional humor (the life of a man who died of knife wounds
                    "was cut short prematurely" [p. 321]).</p>

                    which did not extend to examining manuscript materials, scholarly journal articles, or recent
                    monographs. Of the 129 items in her bibliography, including even Parson Weems' biography of
                    George Washington, only four books (two of them <placeName>

                    Edward Pessen. (<placeName>

                    essay. Paperbound, $3.95.)</head>
            <p>The sixteen essays in this anthology examine the past and present fluidity of the American social
                    structure. The selections are arranged by broad, chronological divisions: the colonial and
                    Revolutionary periods, the "Era of the Common Man," the "Early Industrial
                    Era" (1860–1900), and the twentieth century. The essays were written during a
                    twenty-four year span and the authors, scholars in different disciplines, employ a variety of
                    sources and methodologies.</p>
            <p>William Reavis and Russell Menard both examine social mobility in colonial <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                    </placeName>. Reavis shows that an English commoner could achieve a significant improvement in his
                    status simply by boarding a ship for the colony. "Shipboard mobility" offered an
                    easier path than a slow climb "through the ranks." Menard's study
                    indicates that until approximately 1660 indentured servants often became men of means and position
                    shortly after their contract expired. After that year, however, there was a "general
                    constriction of opportunity" (p. 31) as both population and competition increased.</p>
            <p>Those familiar with the editor's published works during the past decade will not be
                    surprised that he characterizes the "Era of the Common Man" as one of
                    "surprising immobility." In passages reprinted from his recent article in the <hi rend="i">American Historical Review</hi> Pessen argues that "the antebellum decades
                    were featured by an inequality that surpasses anything experienced by the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in the twentieth century" (pp. 118–19). Stuart Blumin adds credence
                    to this idea with his discovery that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s wealth distribution on the eve of the Civil War indicated "a
                    society of extreme economic stratification" (p. 91).</p>
            <p>Frances W. Gregory and Irene D. Neu demonstrate that the typical industrial leader of the 1870s did
                    not rise from rags to riches solely on the strength of hard work and clean living. Indeed, he
                    probably never wore rags at all. Chances were good that he had been "born and bred in an
                    atmosphere in which business and a relatively high social standing were intimately associated with
                    his family life" (p. 188). Examining the other end of the social scale, Stephan Themstrom
                        <pb n="386" id="VAA4025-071-4-092"/> shows that intergenerational mobility among laborers in
                    late nineteenth century <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Newburyport</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
               </placeName>, was steady but modest. Upward
                    movement <hi rend="i">within</hi> the working class constituted the most common form of social
                    advance.</p>
            <p>The essays in the final section, dealing with the twentieth century, are written by sociologists.
                    Included are Gordon Lewis' examination of "The Backgrounds and Careers of Small
                    Businessmen in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>" and a summary of Otis D. Duncan and Peter
                    M. Blau's detailed analysis of occupational mobility in contemporary America.</p>
            <p>It is unclear for what audience this book is intended. Undergraduate history majors are likely to
                    find some of the sociologists too technical, while their peers in sociology will object to the
                    relative lack of sophistication of the historians' treatments. Graduate students and
                    researchers in the field will find the volume's utility severely limited as a result of the
                    editor's (or publisher's) regrettable decision to delete the footnotes to all the
                    essays. Still, the material collected here does provide a useful introduction to the questions which
                    have been asked regarding American social structure. Interested students may find their way to the
                    plethora of additional literature on the subject by consulting the editor's bibliographical

            <p>From his acceptance of the teachings of Joseph Smith until his death, Charles C. Rich played a
                    prominent role in the development of Mormonism. A biography of Rich was published in 1936, but it is
                    now out of print. In addition, new material relating to the life of this important Mormon leader was
                    uncovered by members of the Rich family. This prompted the author to undertake the task of writing a
                    new biography. Professor Arrington has depicted a deeply religious man who was always willing to
                    sacrifice his own welfare for the betterment of the whole Mormon flock.</p>
            <p>Rich emerges as an example of a dedicated leader who rarely questioned the wisdom of the dictates of
                    Brigham <pb n="387" id="VAA4025-071-4-093"/> Young. As chapters reveal the life of Rich, the reader
                    can observe the growing pains of the young Mormon church. From his part in the establishment of a
                    Mormon colony in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> to his mission to aid European Mormons, Rich made a significant contribution to the
                    eventual success of many Mormon dreams. Even the disappointment of failures seems part of a pattern
                    designed to test the mettle of this courageous frontiersman.</p>
            <p>The author examines the institution of plural marriage with much understanding and compassion. The
                    incredible obstacles confronting Rich as he attempted to provide for his family present a saga of
                    courage and faith. Nevertheless, the reader is left with the impression that without the help and
                    cooperation of each of his six wives, the Rich clan would have been hard pressed to maintain any
                    semblance of stability. In effect the book is also a biography of some of his wives. Each of their
                    roles, so important in the total picture of the life of this remarkable man, is brought out in some
                    detail.</p>
            <p>A number of illustrations bring an additional dimension to the book. Well documented, the volume will
                    be useful to the serious scholar. A reasonable price, sturdy binding, and good craftsmanship make
                    this work one which will stand the tests of time, economy, and heavy usage. Volume one of the Series
                    Studies in Mormon History published by the Brigham Young University Press under the editorship of
                    James B. Allen, this biography of Rich is a worthy contribution to the growing knowledge of the
                    leaders of the early Mormon church and their important contributions to the development of the
                    American frontier. This volume should be on the bookshelf of scholars and general readers interested

            <p>When writing about the Civil War era, historians often focus on the war itself and neglect other
                    matters of national importance, particularly Indian affairs. This is unfortunate <pb n="388" id="VAA4025-071-4-094"/> because the Civil War was not only a period of strife between
                    northerner and southerner but also one between red man and white. The policy of concentrating the
                    tribes on reservations, begun in the 1850s, had not worked as well as federal officials believed.
                    The Indians feared federal motives and seethed with discontent, but most realized they were helpless
                    to stop the surge of white settlement. With the outbreak of the Civil War conditions changed. The <placeName>

                    </placeName> substantially reduced western garrisons and focused its military might on crushing the
                    southern rebellion, and many of the Indians seized the opportunity to lash out at encroaching miners
                    and farmers. This was especially true in two areas of the country—<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cou">Colorado</region>
                    </placeName> Territory and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>—where two of the most brutal massacres in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> history occurred: the Santee Sioux Uprising of 1862 and the Sand Creek Massacre of
                    1864.</p>
            <p>In this well researched and readable book, Professor Danziger provides the first comprehensive
                    analysis of Indian affairs during the Civil War, focusing on the Santee Sioux and the Cheyenne and
                    Arapahoe, who were the victims at Sand Creek. Danziger chose these tribes to demonstrate the
                    difficulty of developing and administering an effective Indian policy that had, at once, to provide
                    for the needs of a settled, progressive, largely agricultural tribe like the Santee and also a means
                    of coping with nomadic and militant tribes like the Cheyenne, who were determined to resist the
                    continual pressure on them to live on reservations. Ironically, the policy that emerged satisfied no
                    one. The patient and peaceful Santee erupted in hopeless rage at land hungry whites and corrupt
                    traders, killing some eight hundred Minnesotans in a few days in August, 1862, whereas white
                    exasperation at controlling such free spirits as the southern Cheyenne and Arapahoe led, in 1864, to
                    the wanton murder of some 450 peaceful villagers by <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cou">Colorado</region>
                    </placeName> volunteers under Colonel John A. Chivington.</p>
            <p>Danziger shows that despite its good intentions the Lincoln administration was preoccupied with the
                    eastern military theater. It left the administration of Indian affairs largely to an understaffed
                    and rather ineffectual Office of Indian Affairs headed by Commissioner William P. Dole, a friend of
                    Lincoln from his <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> days. Dole was a skillful administrator but too inexperienced in Indian affairs to cope
                        <pb n="389" id="VAA4025-071-4-095"/> effectively as head of this far flung and complex
                    department. Still, "deplorable as the Indians' plight was during the early sixties
                    it would have been far worse without the special protection of the Indian Office. The office stood
                    alone between them and utter degradation and annihilation" (p. 206).</p>

            <p>This volume surveys the activities, motives, leadership, techniques, and accomplishments of the
                    movement for uplift and efficiency of country life in America during the Progressive Era. The
                    research was based most extensively on magazine articles but also on much work with manuscript
                    collections and public papers such as the Liberty Hyde Bailey papers at Cornell University and the
                    1909 <hi rend="i">Report of the Country Life Commission.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bowers' central thesis, restated at the conclusion of each chapter on the movement, is that
                    country life reformers were victims of a characteristic American schizophrenia. On one hand they
                    looked back to the mythical virtues of an agrarian utopia, rooted in the goodness of nature and
                    productive of sturdy individualism. On the other hand, they saw the needs of scientific
                    industrialized agriculture in a market economy. Incapable of building a coherent ideology, the
                    movement foundered upon its fundamental contradiction. The thesis is not new, but Bowers pulls
                    together a good deal of information which illuminates the problem. Particularly helpful is his
                    collection and analysis of biographical data on a representative sample of country life leaders. The
                    eighty-four persons on his final list, trimmed from an original 150, were well educated,
                    comfortable, secure nonfarmers. The status and motives of these midwesterners are basically in
                    accord with George E. Mowry's <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                        </placeName> Progressives</hi> (1951).</p>
            <p>Some readers will question whether Bowers really earns the right to be so critical, and at times
                    almost contemptuous, of his double minded reformers. Should one criticize the <pb n="390" id="VAA4025-071-4-096"/> movement for not bringing actual farmers into leadership positions
                    without making clear what these farmers might have contributed to the movement's ideology
                    or program? Exactly how could the movement have been more creative or productive of helpful change
                    if it had abandoned the agrarian myth and had acknowledged the inevitability of industrialization?
                    When Bowers moves beyond description to criticism, the grounds for his judgments are not examined.</p>
            <p>The book is well organized, usually in topical rather than chronological fashion. The promise in the
                    title that the story will include the impact of World War I and the immediate postwar period (to
                    1920) is not fulfilled. The writing is usually clear but seldom vivid or distinguished. This volume
                    sketches in more completeness one significant corner of the Progressive movement, but it falls
                    somewhat short in interpretive insight.</p>

            <p>With the publication of <hi rend="i">Hutterite Society</hi>, which is the fruit of fifteen years of
                    research, John A. Hostetler, noted authority on the Amish, now also becomes the leading authority on
                    the Hutterites. For a long time to come scholars will likely consider this volume in the
                    "definitive" category.</p>
            <p>The author, a sociologist, gives an excellent account of the social and cultural organization of
                    Hutterite society, together with a full historical background. The latter is necessary because a
                    "knowledge of the history of the Hutterites and of how they incorporate the past into the
                    present is central to understanding" their society (p. xiii). The Hutterites stem from the
                    pacifist Anabaptist wing of the Reformation, and the characteristic which chiefly distinguishes them
                    from other Anabaptists is their emphasis on communal living.</p>
            <p>The author authoritatively discusses their origins in the 1520s in southern <placeName>

                    </placeName> and their migrations, usually because of severe persecution, to Moravia,

                  <country reg="xo">Slovakia</country>, <country reg="hu">Hungary</country>

                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>. During a "golden age" in Moravia in the latter half of the sixteenth
                    century they prospered and became so skilled as artisans and craftsmen, especially in pottery
                    making, that, unlike their system in North America, agriculture was only one of their many economic
                    activities. Disturbed over the curtailment of their religious liberties in Russia during the 1870s,
                    Hutterites emigrated to the area which became the state of South Dakota. In North America the
                    Hutterites prospered, and, almost exclusively through internal growth, have increased from a few
                    hundred in 1874 to twenty-two thousand today. These figures apply only to those who had revived
                    communal living in Russia after having abandoned it for several decades in the nineteenth century.
                    About an equal number of noncommunal Hutterites came and generally joined various Mennonite groups.</p>
            <p>Hostetler ably discusses their adaptation to the North American environment, their social and
                    cultural organizations and problems of colony living, their harassment and persecution as
                    conscientious objectors during World War I—two of them actually died as a result of their
                    treatment at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Leavenworth</settlement>

                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> as a result, and the return of some of these to the <placeName>

                    </placeName> years later when a saner atmosphere prevailed.</p>
            <p>A number of scholars have told many parts of the story before, but none has put them together, along
                    with the sociological analysis, as completely and objectively as has this author. His indebtedness
                    to previous writers in the field and the scholarly character of his work are indicated in the
                    copious footnotes, the essay on "Hutterite Historiography," and his twenty pages
                    of bibliography.</p>
            <p>This reviewer has little to offer in the way of adverse criticism. Though conscious of the newer
                    trend toward emphasizing the "polygenesis" origins of Anabaptism rather than the
                    "monogenesis," he would question whether the Hutterites were as "distinct
                    historically" from the Swiss Brethren as Hostetler claims (p. 8). The statement that the
                    "council makes all major decisions" (p. 162), might be misleading. It does so, as
                    the author later points out, under the direction of the church. Excellent photographic illustrations
                    add to the value of this important work.</p>

            <p>This study, which still has the flavor of the doctoral dissertation from which it sprang, concerns
                    the impact of state tax policy on the economy of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>. Brownlee seeks to discover whether the state income tax (passed in 1911) promoted or
                    retarded economic growth in that state. But the study's focus is not limited to an economic
                    question. It also concerns the political cauldron within which the income tax was formulated,
                    executed, and retained. The author successfully places his work within the frame of the
                    historiography of progressivism, including the ideas of Richard Hofstadter, Samuel Hays, and Robert
                    Wiebe.</p>
            <p>Brownlee's conclusion is that the state income tax had a detrimental effect on the growth of
                    manufacturing and made <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> less attractive for investment capital. In seeking to explain why the state would adopt
                    such an unbusinesslike strategy, Brownlee emphasizes two factors: the political power and
                    aspirations of the farmers and the political weakness and naivete of the manufacturers. The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> farmer sought to use the state tax system to create what the author calls an
                    "agricultural service state." Using Jacksonian and populist rhetoric about
                    redistributing wealth by tax reform, the Republican farmers really sought a Hamiltonian governmental
                    order which provided aid for agriculture in the new industrial system. Brownlee's
                    conclusion on the motives of these "reformers" agrees with the findings of Hays in
                    explaining progressivism in terms of interest group behavior. The agricultural service state would
                    help the small, specialized <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> farmer cope with his new position within a national economy.</p>
            <p>The manufacturing interest could not avoid subsidizing the farmer. Numerically small and politically
                    weak, manufacturers made matters worse by demonstrating an uncompromising opposition to taxation.
                    They failed to seek out common ground with other nonfarming political factions and remained
                    isolated. In 1928 when they had some hopes of relief with the election of Walter Kohler, a
                    manufacturer, to the governor's office, the crash and depression arrived to unify all
                    progressive elements.</p>
            <pb n="393" id="VAA4025-071-4-099"/>
            <p>The author contributes to the historiography of progressivism, but his conclusion that the
                    "progressive tax policy was irrational" (p. 95) appears overdrawn. The case for
                    the irrationality of the income tax rests primarily on the author's reiteration that such a
                    tax hindered economic growth in the state. So frequently does the author press this point that it
                    takes on the aroma of special pleading. Yet how unreasonable was it for the farmers to promote a
                    policy which fostered their economic growth, even if industrial development in the state was slowed?
                    Only if one accepts Brownlee's identification of economic progress with industrial growth
                    does the farm tax policy appear "irrational." The author's conclusion
                    imposes upon the citizens of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> a value scheme that most of them did not share. The vast majority of citizens of the
                    state were farmers whose idea of the good state reflected their economic position. To accuse them of
                    irrationality because they did not share the vision of industrialists, who, the author admits, had
                    their own narrow view of profit maximization, seems unfair.</p>
            <p>The book also suffers from a number of other weaknesses. The first chapter reads like an excerpt from
                    a textbook in economics. Indeed, the entire study lacks the historical flavor which comes from
                    concentration on human beings rather than abstract groups and economic trends. The publishers ask
                    ten dollars for this book of ninty-eight pages of text. At that price at least they could put the
                    notes at the bottom of the page instead of the rear of the text.</p>

            <p>A study of Gilded Age periodicals for children, R. Gordon Kelly recognizes, tells far more about
                    adults than about young people. <hi rend="i">Self</hi> in the subtitle of this monograph refers to
                    the authors and publishers of five periodicals; <hi rend="i">Society</hi> concerns that small and
                    declining band of New Englanders trying to protect the vestiges of gentry culture against the
                    onslaughts of competitive individualism, unfettered materialism, <pb n="394" id="VAA4025-071-4-100"/> and urban industrial development. Kelly has analyzed some of the cultural artifacts of (to borrow
                    words and concepts from Peter Laslett) a "world we have lost."</p>
            <p>The loss, as Kelly knows, came a step at a time. In addition to setting the cultural and intellectual
                    fashions, seventeenth and eighteenth century gentlemen controlled money, office, and status. They
                    were far more interested in disciplining than in liberating the individual, far more committed to a
                    gospel of service than of wealth, and far more concerned to cultivate the wilderness than to
                    manufacture its resources. As founding fathers of a new republic, they favored government by the
                    elected best over rule by the well born, the well heeled, or the average man. But Americans would
                    not long forego the forbidden fruit in their gentry Eden. The glid of the nineteenth century
                    gradually replaced the enlightenment of the eighteenth. Americans increasingly reached for and
                    grasped their seemingly infinite bounty; they migrated incessantly from place to place and station
                    to station; and they came to measure worth largely by wealth. The self made man pushed aside the
                    self controlled; democracy supplanted republicanism; plutocrats superseded natural aristocrats.
                    Mostly shorn of political and economic power in post-Civil War America, the gentry remnants
                    continued to affirm a now socially desiccated culture from their embattled strongholds in the
                    nation's professions, libraries, liberal arts colleges, and publishing houses.</p>
            <p>Choosing to contruct his analysis of the gentry with a number of borrowed conceptual
                    tools—a definition of culture from anthropologists, an approach to imaginative literature
                    from sociologists of knowledge, an application of literary formulas from a specialist in popular
                    culture, and a particular reconstruction of American gentry values and ideas from an intellectual
                    historian—Kelly's medium affects his message. His emphases on culture, social
                    constructions of reality, social functions of literary formulas, and intellectual history all lead
                    him away from an analysis of the objective and material elements of human reality to the subjective
                    and perceptual ones. And his brevity prohibits an adequate integration of his chosen approaches let
                    alone a thorough application of each. For example, Kelly attributes the gentry's
                    concentration upon "strategies of explanation, justification, and reassurance" to
                    "several social factors"—largely associated <pb n="395" id="VAA4025-071-4-101"/> with the factory and the city—that threatened the ideal of
                    the gentleman in the Gilded Age (p. 147). (Kelly is, incidently, far more concerned about the gentry
                    in general than he is about the lady in particular.) But his contentions that certain late
                    nineteenth century socioeconomic factors caused expressions of insecurity rely more upon assertion
                    than documentation and pay too little attention to the pervasive sense of precariousness evident in
                    much of the writing of English and American gentlemen since at least the early seventeenth century.</p>
            <p>Despite a Scottish verdict of not proven for some of his suggestions, Kelly has drafted a key chapter
                    in the story of the gradual shift from an aristocratic-republican to a plutocratic-democratic social
                    order, a change that has never been sufficiently thorough to free the latter completely from the
                    former. This may explain why some children cannot find the Hardy Boys series, a contemporary
                    equivalent of Horatio Alger, in the local library.</p>

            <p>It is a well known fact that historical interpretation moves cyclically. What was once the widely
                    accepted view of the past has been revised by the next generation, and the revisionists are soon
                    themselves revised. Such oscillations, of course, reflect another well known characteristic of
                    historiography: the contemporary view of the past derives from present values and problems as much
                    perhaps as from the historian's sources. Some degree of this relativism seems inescapable
                    and may be desirable in terms of interest and usefulness of history.</p>
            <p>In his new study of interpretive currents of the twentieth century, Bernard Sternsher nicely
                    demonstrates these features of the discipline. The progressive historians in the early years of the
                    century wrote about the tensions and conflicts in this country from the colonial period to their own
                    time because they were concerned about the injustice they perceived in an environment of corporate
                    power, human exploitation, and political corruption. By the 1950s, during years of affluence <pb n="396" id="VAA4025-071-4-102"/> and comparative stability, the fashion had shifted toward a
                    consensual perspective, with emphasis upon the "givens" of American history, the
                    middle ground of agreement, the rejjection of extremist behavior. As foreign and domestic problems
                    mounted in the 1960s and as activism, even radicalism, recruited younger scholars, the trend in
                    teaching and writing returned to the theme of conflict.</p>
            <p>Throughout the book Sternsher focuses upon the consensus historians, Daniel Boorstin and Louis Hartz,
                    who most systematically and effectively stated the case for American unity and moderation. In fact,
                    as the author says, the positions of the two differed in some respects. Boorstin, as an eminent
                    social historian, concluded there was little ideological conflict because America had little use for
                    ideas and reacted pragmatically to their surroundings. Hartz saw the dynamic importance of ideas but
                    felt that there was a remarkable consensus of thought on this side of the Atlantic because there
                    were no encumbrances of anachronistic feudalism or uncertainty about national ideals.</p>
            <p>In his discussion of conflict historians Sternsher draws upon a wide variety and a large number of
                    recent publications, many of them in related fields of social science. Merely as survey and
                    commentary, this section is valuable. Substantial space is given to the Jacksonian era, to
                    quantitative investigations of social and economic classes by Edward Pessen for example, and to
                    Pessen's findings that there were far less social mobility and political democracy than
                    textbooks depict. Another prominent topic is the New Deal, as one might expect from the biographer
                    of Rexford Tugwell. Here, Sternsher shows a scholarly movement away from the prevalent liberal
                    treatment of Rooseveltian reform toward criticism of its excessive caution and limited
                    accomplishments. He explores the work of New Left historians extensively, many of them Marxian and
                    all of them sympathetic toward the losers, the oppressed, and the agitators of the past.</p>
            <p>Sternsher's judgments are convincing on the whole. His verdict is negative toward Boorstin
                    because of a total retreat from theory, quite positive toward Hartz (who in many instances seems
                    vindicated by recent behavioral studies), and again rather negative toward the New Left because of
                    their propagandistic proclivities and failure to come up with attractive <pb n="397" id="VAA4025-071-4-103"/> alternatives. Whether or not one accepts these judgments, the book is a
                    competent foray into the philosophy of history. It may be too intricate and verbose for some tastes,
                    though that could be a congenital infirmity of such writings.</p>

            <p>Bernard DeVoto, who died in 1955, was one of the most versatile men of letters of the midcentury.
                    After twelve years of teaching English and American literature at Northwestern and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> universities, he briefly edited the <hi rend="i">Saturday Review of Literature</hi> and
                    contributed the "Easy Chair" to <hi rend="i">Harper's Magazine</hi>,
                    making of the latter a personal forum for his views on literature and ecology. For much of his life
                    he strove to write fiction without ever achieving notable success; indeed he used pseudonyms such as
                    John August when he produced potboilers. He was also a book reviewer, a critic, an essayist, and a
                    highly successful historian. In between editorial stints and research he wrote letters, thousands of
                    them. For the present volume Wallace Stegner has selected 148 of these letters to show the facets of
                    DeVoto's character and his multiple interests.</p>
            <p>These are extraordinary letters by any criterion, but they are not the kind of letters that readers
                    of John Keats, Horace Walpole, or Lord Chesterfield might expect. There is much about
                    DeVoto's education here, almost in the vein of Henry Adams, but almost nothing about his
                    family or domestic life. There is little bantering or day dreaming or even humor; when DeVoto
                    attempted pleasantries, he became elephantine. Occasional autobiographical notes do intrude, to be
                    sure—his obvious chagrin when he was denied a permanent post at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> or his constant assertion that he did not want to become a writer but hoped instead to
                    go into psychiatry.</p>
            <p>Instead there are amazingly long letters about how to write fiction, about accuracy in historical
                    writing, about history, and science, and about the imperative need to save the forest lands and the
                    water resources of the American West. In ordinary correspondent might dismiss these topics in a few
                    hundred words; but DeVoto wrote 3,500 words to Dale Morgan on Mormon history, three thousand words
                    to Harold <pb n="398" id="VAA4025-071-4-104"/> Stassen on the conservation of the public domain, six
                    pages to Mae Porter to point out how unreliable her research was, and four pages to Lawrence Kubie
                    on the psychiatric aspects of drama and fiction.</p>
            <p>Undoubtedly these letters were impulsive; yet, they also reveal enormous vitality, a point which
                    Stegner reiterates. They show DeVoto's interest in ideas, in clarity of expression, in
                    factual accuracy. As a letter writer DeVoto was contumacious, vehement, arrogant, and often
                    repetitious. He certainly did not blue pencil his own correspondence although he kept carbon copies.
                    Nor did he hesitate to speak bluntly and scornfully if this was his mood. Van Wyck Brooks, whom he
                    demolished in <hi rend="i">Mark Twain's America</hi>, wrote a silly book. Albert Bigelow
                    Paine's editing of Twain's work was capricious and arbitrary. Ruth
                    Suckow's novel <hi rend="i">The Folks</hi> lacked wit, subtlety, and style; and Edmund
                    Wilson, whom he admired in many ways, could also be humorless, myopic, and idiotically pedantic.
                    Moreover, he thought Thomas Wolfe was a bad novelist with a deleterious effect on younger writers.</p>
            <p>DeVoto knew personally many of the notable scientists, writers, scholars, and public figures of his
                    day, but he wrote extensively to unknowns as well as to celebrities. If there are letters to Adlai
                    Stevenson (whose campaign he supported), Garrett Mattingly, Malcolm Cowley, Elmer Davis, Henry
                    Seidel Canby, Hans Zinsser, Wendell Willkie, and Robert Frost, there are also letters to obscure
                    book reviewers and to earnest students asking for assistance. He gave freely of his time to anyone
                    who professed an interest in his work and showed some ability to recognize and express an idea. Some
                    of the subjects DeVoto espoused were topical and retain little interest today. On the other hand his
                    notions about the writing of fiction and history remain viable.</p>
            <p>Stegner has arranged the letters not chronologically but by subject clusters so that some groups span
                    twenty or more years, a plan that permits the reader to watch DeVoto's development. The
                    editing is concise and generally limited to identifications, although Stegner occasionally points
                    out inconsistencies or obvious misstatements. There are only a few minor slips: Douglas Freeman has
                    the wrong first name, Frances Densmore's last name is misspelled, and Stegner speaks
                    carelessly of the University of Indiana.</p>
