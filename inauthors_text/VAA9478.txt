					The Light of the Sun
					
					
						PERSONS

						
							CORONA
							blind.
						

						
							MARAH
							her companion.
						

						
							HENRY
							Marah's brother.
						


						
							MICHAL
							Corona's husband.
						
					
					
					THE LIGHT OF THE SUN
					A balcony, enclosed at back by a balustrade. 'Beyond, a short distance, is
						the sea. The swish of the water running on the sand is heard now and then. The time is
						just before sunset.
					CORONA enters, and feels her way along the balustrade, then across the
							balcony to a seat, her fingers moving nervously through the air. She is fair, tall,
							and of sensitive beauty.
					
						CORONA

						
							Marah!
						
					
					
						MARAH
						(From within.)

						
							Yes, I am here, and come at once.
						
					


					Enter MARAH, a dark, animated young woman. She walks
							to the balustrade, and looks toward the sunset and the sea.


					
						CORONA

						
							Marah.
						

					
					
						MARAH

						
							I am here by the balustrade.
						
					

					
						CORONA

						
							You came so softly I scarce heard your steps.
						
					
					

						MARAH

						
							I know how sweet the stillness is to you.
						
					
					
						CORONA

						
							Is Henry coming?
						
					
					

						MARAH

						
							I do not see him.
						
					
					
					
						CORONA

						
							What time is it?
						
					
					
						MARAH

						
							The sun begins to sink,
							And all the sky is filled with crimson light.
						
					
					
						CORONA

						
							Within your voice there are some worship notes,
							As if some one you loved had pressed your lips.
						
					
					
						MARAH

						
							It is the wonder of the western sky
							That makes one ache for whispered words at dusk,
							For tenderness that drives away all care,
							As dark pursues the lingering light of day.
						
					
					
						CORONA

						
							Do you see all of this within the sky?
						
					
					
						MARAH

						
							Corona, often have I wondered why
							It is the evening that we women love.
						
					
					
						CORONA

						
							Because it is the time of coming home,
							When they afield and journeying seek for rest.
							Oh! often have I tried, but all in vain,
							To see again the sky I must have seen
							Ere darkness closed its door and shut me in.
							But almost nothing I remember now
							Except my mother's face. 
									(Calling.)
								 MARAH!
						
					
					
						MARAH

						
							I listen.
						
					
					
					
						CORONA

						
							And I have told you how it comes to me
							At night as I lie still and wait for sleep.
							I think in all the world there must be naught
							As wonderful as my sweet mother's face.
							O Marah, tell me of the western sky.
							I understand you better than the others.
							Did you not say it was like tenderness?
						
					
					
						MARAH

						
							Like tenderness.
						
					
					
						CORONA

						
							Then all things beautiful
							Out there bring tenderness. I understand.
						
					
					
						MARAH

						
							Yes.
						
					
					
						CORONA

						
							Then is Michal unto me the god
							Of beauty. When I hear his distant voice,
							As he comes up the way, I tremble here,

							
								(Placing her hand on her breast.)
							

							And drink the sound as one all day athirst.
							His touch of hand is sunset unto me,
							His lips make me forget my eyes are dim.
							O Marah!--are you listening?
						
					
					
						MARAH

						
							Yes, I listen.
						
					
					
					
						CORONA

						
							The sunset is no lure to me, nor moon,
							Nor stars, nor dawn; of these you often speak,
							And often I have heard since childhood years.
							But him would I behold who sent the rain
							Upon my leaves, and made the birds to sing
							Upon each branch within my lightless woods.
							Do you remember how I used to sit
							Disconsolate, like brooding winter time,
							Or like some aged woman by a fire
							Who freezing waits the kindly touch of death?
							When Michal came and softly pressed my lips,
							I who was never born began to live
							And feel in me the breath of things unknown.
						
					
					
						MARAH
						(Smiling.)

						
							Quite eloquent you grow.
						
					
					
						CORONA

						
							Were you not so
							A moment since? I feel you're smiling now.
							I tell you, Marah, life is naught to me
							Excepting as I live in this great love;
							And death's cold kiss were sweet when it is gone.
						
					
					
					
						MARAH
						(Coming to her.)

						
							Dear heart, 'tis true I did a moment smile.
							But what if you and I were both deceived,
							My wondrous sunset but an empty thing
							That lives within my wandering mind alone,
							Your kingly Michal but a restless dream
							That agitates a cavern of your brain!
							O'er all of us illusion spreads her wings
							Like birds that warmly nurse their brood at dusk.
							The things that now you crave to see may take
							Away your joy.
						
					
					
						CORONA

						
							Your speech is strange to-night.
							I like it not, and understand it not.
							Dear Marah, often now it seems to me
							You plunge your mind in these chill waves of thought.
							I will not follow you, the world is sweet
							And warm. Look out and see if Henry comes.
						
					
					
						MARAH

						
							I look, but do not see him on the way.
						
					
					
						CORONA

						
							Does tenderness still glow within the west?
						
					
					
						MARAH

						
							More beautiful it grows.
						
					
					
					
						CORONA

						
							Come, play a while;
							Too serious we have been. Do tell me, Marah,
							Is your nose as straight and thin as mine, thus.
							
								(Stroking her nose.)
							
						
					
					
						MARAH

						
							
								(Laughing.)
							
							I'm glad 'tis much like yours.
						
					
					
						CORONA

						
							But Michal's curves.
							And here (indicating) just here doth have a little
								hump.
							Is it somewhat the same with other men?
						
					
					
						MARAH

						
							'Tis much the same with them.
						
					
					
						CORONA

						
							Who's coming now?
						
					
					
						MARAH

						
							I hear no steps.
						
					
					
						CORONA

						
							'Tis Henry, I am sure.
						
					
					
						MARAH

						
							
								(Looking out by the balustrade.)
							
							'Tis he.
						
					
					
						CORONA

						
							I would that he did hurry now,
							For he will bring me words of joy, I know.
						
					
					
					
						MARAH

						
							What words?
						
					
					
						CORONA

						
							O Marah! you shall hear at once.
							I feel that ere the light of day is past
							I shall behold the world I crave to see,
							And your dear sunset, but o'er all his face!
							Long have I nursed this hope till now it lives;
							And Henry, too, has bent his will to this,
							That I shall see, and walk no more in darkness.
							I have not told you, for you had no faith
							That I should ever look upon the world.
							
								(Rising.)
							
							O Henry, Henry, speed your steps to me,
							Who knock and wait before the door of light!
							Enter HENRY.

						
					
					
						HENRY

						
							Good news! To-morrow he will come whose art
							Will send the sunlight bounding through your eyes.
							He bade me counsel you prepare to see,
							For very near at hand may be the hour
							When you will look upon the sunlit world.
							'Tis said the fault lies not within your eyes,
							For they are like twin stars set in the night;
							And soon--oh, very soon may be the time
							When wide the doors will swing to let light in!
							Corona, now--perhaps this very hour
							You'll cast aside the leaden cloak of night!
							Oh, then we four shall dance upon the air,
							And make such revels as befits our joy!
							There's no mistake, I do report aright!
						
					
					
					
						MARAH

						
							 Henry--
						
					
					
						CORONA

						
							
								(Feeling her way to HENRY.Interrupting.)
							
							Nay, Marah, you must let me speak.
							I swear to God if He will give me light,
							That I may once behold my human god,
							I'll be as bending as a babe in arms
							Unto His will, and ne'er complain again
							No matter what the slight of nature be!
							How often in the evening have I sat
							With Michal by my side, and heard his voice,
							That stilled the tumult of my restless soul,
							My truant hand would steal into his own--
							Oh! I have felt inside my head, it seemed
							Just back of both my eyes, an urging force
							Within the nerves that strove to break the wall,
							Like some wild beast that beats the iron bars.
							And now this urging force begins again,
							I feel the throbs each time it strikes a blow.
							Already I do know that light is born
							Within the darkened chamber of my brain;
							Already I do look upon the world--
							Our world--his world and mine! The sunlit sea
							Shall woo me, too, and so the wandering moon;
							And I with mine own eyes shall him behold
							Who raised me from the dead and taught me life.
							Where is he, Henry? I must find him now.
							
								(She feels her way out, calling.)
							
							O Michal, Michal!
						
					
					
					
						MARAH

						
							See what you have wrought!
							Her brain have you set going as the wind;
							Her hope is sharpened like an edged shaft
							That will but cruelly pierce her to the quick,
							If failure doom this doubtful enterprise.
						
					
					
						HENRY

						
							It will not fail. I'm sure it will not fail.
						
					
					
						MARAH

						
							A thousand times more mischief have you wrought!
							Oh! you yourself are blinder than the blind,
							Your eyes are open, yet you cannot see!
							The trees you see, the sunset, and the moon;
							But wandering moons and sunsets made of dreams,
							That lift our lowly life to higher heights,
							Have never set their torch within your brain.
							Think--do we live by sight and sound alone?
							Far more we dwell within the gilded house
							That fancy garnishes with beaten gold.
						
					
					
						HENRY

						
							I do not understand. What harm if light
							Be brought to her to look upon the world?
							I did but think to do a kindly deed.
							You love Corona dearly--do you not?
						
					
					
						MARAH

						
							A thousand times I love her more than you,
							For I would leave her to her world of dreams,
							Far sweeter than this world that we both see.

							

							She wanders in a garden where each flower,
							Though it lack form and hue, is spirit made;
							Her heart is tenderer than springtime dawn.
							Has she not taught us all that life is good?
							'Tis so because her world herself she makes.
							What she would think as true, is true for her;
							Because she cannot with her eyes disprove.
							While we with eyes live but a moment's bliss,
							When we in daydreams run away and leave
							Our eyes behind. Oh! can't you understand?
						
					
					
						HENRY

						
							I own I do not understand your meaning
							That blindness better is than sight.
						
					
					
						MARAH

						
							O Henry,
							Must I spell out the words, pronounce each letter?
						
					
					
						HENRY

						
							You are unlike yourself. I'll hear no more.
						
					
					
						MARAH

						
							Wait, for we both stand this quiet evening
							Before the door of a disrupted house.
							Often have I been seized with fear that light
							Might one day burst into her sightless eyes,
							And she too suddenly behold the world.
							Her eyes are clear and look like mine and yours,
							Save they are dreamier than distant stars
							Upon a summer night. Now mark my words:
							Long have I known by simple touch of skill,
							Or by some chance, or by the growth of time,
							That sunlight through Corona's eyes might course,
							But silent have I kept.
						
					
					
					
						HENRY

						
							Oh, monstrous!
						
					
					
						MARAH

						
							And Michal, too, has known.
						
					
					
						HENRY

						
							More monstrous!
						
					
					
						MARAH

						
							And fearful have we been that she might see.
						
					
					
						HENRY

						
							What touch of hell has tainted both your souls!
							Contamination has been brooding here,
							And you would blind me with your sophistry!
						
					
					
						MARAH

						
							Yourself shall punish you for speech like this.
						
					
					
						HENRY

						
							I'll hear no more.
						
					
					
						MARAH

						
							You shall hear all at once.
							Though pained, I pass the sting you gave just now.
						
					
					
						HENRY

						
							What more is there to hear than I have heard!
							With your own lips have you condemned yourself.
						
					
					
					
						MARAH

						
							Be careful else you burn the only bridge
							That lies between us two. You shall hear more.
							I'll spell the words. Oh! with your noble face
							How can you be as stupid as a child!
							We two shall sadly part some day in death,
							I beg, therefore, you listen to my words.
							Corona wanders in a joyous world
							That is not ours, a world of beauty made;
							And if that world be marred, it is her death.
							Her love for Michal is--Oh, you, a man,
							How can you understand a woman's love!
							A thousand, thousand times more dear that love
							Than your desire for my own chastity.
							He is the balmy summer air she breathes,
							Her consolation by the winter fire;
							And in the night she sleeps within his arms;
							And once she told me that he wakened her
							With kisses on her lips each breaking morn.
							And you, O brother, you would this destroy!
							For think of him the Michal of her dreams,
							And him the Michal that we daily see;
						
						(MICHAL has entered at back, and stands unobserved. His face is
								terrible to behold.)
						The ugly pot the potter marred in making,
						The face bedaubed with scarlet marks from birth.
						Oh! often have I looked upon his face,
						And gone without and spat to purge myself;
						As if the goodly air we both did breathe
						Were poisoned by his breath. If he by chance
						Did touch me with his lips, some lapse in nature
						Would my flesh derange with torturing pain,
						Like women who are slighted in their birth.

						

						His eyes are like the eyes I've seen in swine,
						Blinking from out their pulpy bed of mire.
						Corona feels his strong and gentle soul;
						And he within the gallery of her mind
						Is like some noble-featured, happy prince,
						On whom the gods have done their choicest work.
						O you, my brother, will not rend her world,
						And place a leech upon her tender throat!
						We all do wander in our different dreams;
						Let her abide in hers, her love of him.
						(Turning, she sees MICHAL.)
						Ugh! Look, Henry!
					
					
						HENRY

						
							Michal, have you o'erheard?
						
					

					
						MICHAL

						
							I have o'erheard, but I am dead within,
							And blame her not. We both have lived a lie.
							O Marah! I would come and take your hand,
							But I would spare your eyes and touch the pain;
							I was not made for daytime, but the night,
							And have no heart to look upon myself.
							My mother oft did tell me long ago
							That I a suckling babe did pain her breast;
							And while I pressed for drink, her eyes she closed.
							In childhood human playmates had I none.
							The dogs were kinder, for I stroked their fur;
							And all my early love I gave to them,
							For they alone were pleased to be by me.
							And as the world its back upon me turned,
							Not harder but more tender grew my heart.
							I dared not go about in time of day,
							Lest by some jeer my soul be made to bleed.

							

							The night had all affection for my youth;
							I lay upon its bosom like a child,
							And loved the candled starlight of the sky.
							I trod the silver of the milky ways,
							As one would journey in his native land;
							And worshiped as an ardent neophyte
							Bows low in prayer before his soul's own god.
							Each star did speak to me in silent speech
							The language of the cities made of gold.
							The soft night wind did fill my listening ears
							With music strange from out some distant world;
							And all the sorrow of the ages past
							Was sweet to me, for I was made of sorrow.
							The mighty pillars deep within my soul
							Were laid there by my sorrow, calm and strong;
							And I had learned of sorrow how to love,
							And sorrow drove me forth into the night
							Where I might freely look upon the world.
							And often in the night I walked abroad,
							And spoke with men who could not see my face.
							And women at the nightly festivals
							Oft wandered from the crowd to quiet lanes;
							And there, enshrouded by the kindly dark,
							My boyish lips did speak with them.
							And once Corona came. With her alone
							I dared to walk beneath the sun and moon.
							And then we both did meet again, again,
							Until none dared to part us, for like mine
							Her life was bound forever in this love.
							At first when I did speak of lacking grace
							Of feature, I was bidden to be silent;
							She said I was but weary and disheartened,
							Denying me the right to judge myself.

							

							When oft again I spoke, she would not hear,
							And playful, like a child, did stop her ears.
							The tide of love did bear us quickly hence;
							It seemed as if the gods did guide our course.
							Together grew the fiber of our lives,
							Ere I could think what had befallen us.
							To her I wear the visage of a king.
							Oh! I have wronged Corona, and should die!
						
					

					
						MARAH

						
							I, too, have wronged her.
						
					

					
						HENRY

						
							I much more than both.
						
					
					
						MICHAL

						
							My soul is sick as one who looks on death.
						
					

					
						MARAH

						
							O Michal! grieve no more, let tears be mine,
							If I could weep, at once I'd call them forth.
							We all do love her as a mother loves,
							Save you, who worship--
							(CORONA heard calling near the balustrade.)
							Michal! Michal!
						
					

					
						MARAH

						
							Peace!
							Now let our wills be masters of ourselves.
							Let not this house of glass break at our feet.
							(CORONA nearer.)
							O Michal! Michal!
						
					

					

					
						MICHAL

						
							I shall speak to her.
						
					

					
						MARAH

						
							It must not be, we are distracted yet,
							And should betray ourselves. Let her pass on,
							Till we in calm bethink what shall be done.
							For love of her forbear, forbear to speak!
							Break not the golden dream. Let her pass on.
							
								(Whispering.)
							
							Now silence.
							
								(A pause.)
							
							CORONA enters.
						
					

					
						CORONA

						
							
								(Feeling her way along the balustrade.)
							
							Michal, Michal!
							
								(Farther on.)
							
							Michal! Michal!
							
								(Near the end of the balustrade.)
							
							O Marah, Henry, Michal, Michal! Gone.
							
								(Lifting her arms toward MICHAL. Joyfully.)
							
							O Michal, Michal! I shall see you, Michal!
							(CORONA passes off. Heard in the distance.)
							Michal, Michal!
							
								(A pause. More faintly.)
							
							Michal, Michal!
						
					

					
						MARAH

						
							Quickly,
							My brother, follow close behind her steps,
							So nothing that is ill befall her now.
							She wanders in a maddened fit of joy.
							(Exit HENRY.)

						
					

					

					
						MICHAL

						
							With her enshrouded eyes she stared at me,
							And I beheld the hate of all the world.
							The stars of all my life dash through the sky.
							The end is near. If she behold my face,
							I am as one already mute in death.
						
					

					
						MARAH

						
							Speak not too loud lest we be overheard.
							Although I cannot look upon your face,
							I see your soul, and inwardly I weep.
							A thousand, thousand lies I've lived for you;
							Because your heart is tender as a rose,
							And you her lonely life have filled with love.
							I'll serve you to the limit of my power.
							Now let us both arouse our saner selves,
							And think what shall be done. Come, come, Michal,
							And draw thyself together, like the soul
							I know thou art.
						
					

					
						MICHAL

						
							Already she is changed,
							The light is piercing through her starless night.
						
					

					
						MARAH

						
							Come, come, this is the image made of fear.
							I'll go myself and cool her flaming mind,
							That withers up the garden of her life.
							Stay here till I return; and then we three
							Shall try our might to smother out her hope.
						
					

					
						MICHAL

						
							I cannot, she hath set her soul on this.
						
					

					

					
						MARAH

						
							Forbear to speak to her till I return.
							If power be mine this temple shall not fall
							(Starts off as HENRY enters.)
						
					

					
						HENRY

						
							Marah, she still calls for you and Michal,
							And laughs and weeps as does a fitful child;
							She bade me quickly find and fetch her husband.
							"Ah, first of all my eyes shall drink him in,"
							She says again and o'er again, and thus
							And thus she smites her forehead with her hand.
							What shall be done?
						
					

					
						MICHAL

						
							I'll go to her at once,
							While yet her eyes are without earthly light.
							She suffers now, I cannot stay. (Starts off.)
						
					

					
						HENRY

						
							Michal,
							Wait, look!
						
					

					
						MARAH

						
							She comes and does not feel her way.
							Be silent both and let me speak to her.
							
								(A pause.)
							
							(CORONA heard calling in the distance.)
							Michal, Michal!
							
								(Nearer.)
							
							Michal, Michal!
							
								(She enters.)
							
						
					

					

					
						CORONA

						

							
								(Agitated.)
							
							Marah!


						
					

					
						MARAH

						
							Corona, do a moment calm yourself.
						
					

					
						CORONA

						
							O touch me not!
						
					

					
						MARAH

						
							I am not touching you.
						
					

					
						CORONA

						
							Yes, yes you are; your hand is on my head.
							A piercing pain runs through my throat and breast.
							
								(Moving frantically backward and forward.)
							
							Michal, Michal! Tell me, where is he? Speak!
							This instant something comes to life in me.
							O Marah, something batters at my head,
							It is the world outside that would come in,
							And light the candles of my darkened house!
						
					

					
						MARAH

						
							Corona!--
						
					

					
						CORONA

						
							Nay, let me enjoy this birth,
							For to myself I now bring forth a world,
							The world you oft have told me of--tenderness,
							The world of him I love.
							
								(Abruptly facing the sunset. A piercing cry.)
							
							Look, look, the sun!

							

							Michal, Marah, the world is born--I see!
							
								(Throws herself about HENRY'S neck.)
							
							Michal, Michal! (Pressing her face against his.)
							Michal, Michal, kiss me!
							Thou heaven born, why art thou silent now?
							My eyes do drink thee in. My lips do thirst.
							Oh, moisten thou my lips with seas of love!
							O Michal, speak, that I may hear thy voice
							And see thee all at once--Michal, Michal!
							Draw not away from me, loose not my grasp;
							Thy touch is cold, and palsied is thy tongue!
						
					

					
						HENRY

						
							Let me but stand aside.
						
					

					
						CORONA

						
							Thy voice--thy voice!
							
								(Drawing away.)
							
							'Tis changed--'tis not thy voice--'tis Henry's voice!
							Michal, Michal, where is he--where is he?
							
								(Faces MICHAL, shrinking.)
							
							Who is this?
						
					

					
						MARAH

						
							
								(Quickly.) A stranger just come to us.
						
					

					
						CORONA

						
							
								(To MICHAL.)
							
							Begone, thy face doth hurt my new-born sight.
						
					

					
						MARAH

						
							He came to tell us Michal--
						
					

					

					
						CORONA

						
							(Interrupting.) Let him speak.
						
					

					
						MARAH

						
							
								(Quickly)
							
							He cannot, he is mute.
						
					

					
						CORONA

						
							You said he came
							To tell--
						
					

					
						MARAH

						
							
								(Interrupting.)
							
							He did but motion with his hands.
						
					

					
						CORONA

						
							Take him away, I will not look on him,
							His face doth sicken me.
							(MICHAL drawing a dagger stabs himself in the breast.)
						
					

					
						MARAH

						
							
								(Rushing toward him.)
							
							Michal! Michal!
							Great God, forbear--forbear! Michal! Michal!
						
					

					
						CORONA

						
							Give me the dagger, I will pierce my eyes,
							And sit again with Michal in the night.
						
					

					

					
						 HENRY

						
							
								(Seizing her.)
							
							Corona--
						
					

					
						CORONA

						
							I grow sick, my limbs grow weak;
							Some fit of dreaming has turned cold my blood.
							The hand--the withered hand that holds the knife--
							Oh! wake me, Michal! Michal!(Sinking on his body.)
							Michal! Michal!

						HER ACCEPTANCE

						
							I'll give my answer now, dear; it is "yes."
							More gently or you'll hurt me--yet 'tis bliss--
							Now but once more, and--and once more--'tis bliss!
							Wait, dear; let us sit still a while and talk,
							You in that chair and I in this one here,
							A little while, not long, I'm sure you will.
							I wish to tell you something--now, to-night,
							Before we go too far in this new way.
							You do not start; that shows your faith in me:
							It is about my future, not my past,
							You know I have not lived much in my life;
							But I have thought and seen the lives of others,
							Of women who have gone with men in marriage.
							Don't be impatient, dear, I'll not be long;
							I know you think it is some idle tale
							By which I hope to make you laugh--but no.
							And please--a little while; I cannot think,
							I only dream, when you have hold my hand.
							So--that is better, you off there, I here--
							A little while.
							I have but one regret,
							I wish I came to you as free as air.
							A few of us can come to men that way,
							By fortune favored with inheritance,
							Or by some genius, got I know not how.
							But most of us come sadly empty handed.
							The world will not let us come otherwise,
							And we are still dependent creatures all.
							I wish you did not have to buy me, dear.
							I am so much degraded by the sale
							That were you some one else I should not sell,
						

						

						
							O that I were as free to choose as you,
							And yet I'm sure I should choose only you.
							When once I go from here to be with you,
							I'll be a heavy weight upon your back.
							Alone you might have freely gone your way,
							No common slave of endless dreary toil;
							But now you bind yourself upon the rocks
							For me and little children born of us.
							And should you fail of cunning at your task,
							And fail to work and lie and bind men down
							To serve your aim for gold, then all is done
							With you; then must you sweat until you die.
							Because of me you'll grind and sweat the more;
							And unborn babes will cry into your ears
							With voices real that whip your tired life
							To longer hours. And your sad drudgery
							I cannot help; 'twill pierce me to the soul.
							And though I suffer, too, and daily toil,
							Eternal servant of a child's caprice,
							I still shall be a weight upon your back.

						

						

							Ah! now your heart is filled with noble things,
							Love, music, and the sky. You walk on clouds,
							The world is as a garden set with jewels,
							And softly sweetened as a room perfumed.
							For you all this shall change as I have said,
							I hear you groan beneath your heavy load,
							I feel no more your tender, sweet young soul,
							I see your head bound down upon your task,
							Lest some one steal your task and take our bread.
							At this great cost you pay for me, and I--
							I should deny you nothing at this price.
							And through the ages women somehow know,
						


						

						

							By history taught, that they must yield themselves.
							This is the thing they give for the price men pay,
							Although it often be a gift of shame.
							And I have known some in this commerce long,
							Returning every piece of gold they cost
							With outraged inches of their tender flesh.
							Dear heart, with us let it be otherwise;
							And though you pay for me this bitter price,
							Still let us both be owners of ourselves,
							And never touch save out of love.--Kiss me.

						

					

					
						YES OR NO

						(Suggested by the painting of Sir John Millais.)

						
							I KNOW my heart and yet I answer not,
							For some I've seen grow sad by deep regret.
							Better than love that fails is solitude,
							Barren and hungry-hearted to the last.
							It has still the happiness of day dreams,
							For love that fails awakes the sleeper quick
							With ruthless hands of saddened memory.
							Better is solitude that still is sweet
							In thought and not unkindly looked upon,
							Whose virgin cheeks remember not love's kiss
							At break of dawn nor in night's deepest sleep,
							Whose breast is strange to touch of children's lips.
							Far better not to know love's throbbing joy,
							Than sadly to remember love is dead,
							And hear cold words that once were soft and sweet,
							And feel no more the press of eager arms
							Where oft thy head did lie in bliss at eve,
							And deign to beg where once thou didst permit.
							Give me stern love that's fierce in jealousy,

						


						

						
							Ardent, like love that's born by open fields
							In silence save the soft winds whispering,
							And grows each starry night by garden stile,
							And lingers late before the last farewell;
							So strange and wondrous sweet it would not part
							But for the swiftly moving pallid stars
							That call ere long the noiseless break of dawn;
							Love that does not forget the first sweet kiss,
							The gentle, hesitating touch of hand,
							That blissful calm that made us one at first
							By cheerful glow of winter evening fire;
							Such love that stronger grows through changing years,
							When age shall steal the rose from off my cheek
							And dim my eyes and bend me slowly down.
							And in that distant time wilt thou forget
							The ancient trees 'neath which we sat at dusk,
							And how, like twilight's spreading dark, our souls
							Went forth with night's still music o'er the world,
							And we both dwelt again in olden times
							By glistening shores of sun-kissed golden seas,
							And heard the echoed songs of all the world
							Resound as softer grew the thickening dark?
							Love's music old, wilt thou then break the reed
							In twain by cruel neglect of thy warm lips?
							Or wilt thou find the music sweeter still,
							Like early childhood's oft-repeated songs?
							Though I pale before thee on life's long way,
							Wilt thou then still find joy in all my smiles?
							And sit with gladness by my side at eve?
							And walk with me through memory's olden lanes,
							To mark again the hallowed spots where first
							Thou kissed my cheek and shyly spoke my name--
							Where once with saddened hearts we quarreled a while,
						

						

						

							And thou with moistened eyes besought my love,
							Which was again thine own ere thou didst ask--
							And where in shade of yonder sighing woods
							Oft tranced I sat and listened to thy hopes,
							And silently implored a part in all
							Close by thy side through joyous coming years?
							When once I give thee all wilt thou forget,
							In stress of other things, to kiss the lips
							That yearn for thee by lonely evening light?
							Then wilt thou whisper in my ear as now,
							And set astir the chords of love's sweet dream,
							And say the things that draw me close to thee
							Ere slumber close our eyes in still of night?
							I hear again thy oft repeated vows.
							Would thou wert nigh to still my wavering thoughts,
							And speak once more the words that are my bliss--
							That feed my heart which thou hast hunger taught.
						
					

					
						HER SOLITUDE

						
							MY LIFE is still to-night, no bitterness,
							Nor joy; and but one endless thought creeps out,
							As dreaming here I sit and think about
							My days that pass without dear love's caress.
							And yet, O God! I cannot, cannot guess
							Why lonely I must dwell and ever doubt
							The time will come when he, my own, will rout
							My fears and all my restless heart's distress.
							Why didst thou plant in me this longing so
							That in my wake and sleep forever calls
							And yet beyond my pale of fortune falls?
							Not always I'll be young, the bloom will go.
							All this, O God! I have not understood.
							Am I not worthy--have not I been good?
						

					

					

					
						HER DREAM

						
							I THOUGHT I lived with you beneath a sun
							Whose golden rays ne'er left the deep blue sky,
							But shone and shone where rolling meadows lie
							With dew as when the day had just begun,
							And danced in leafy vales where waters run
							And where the sweet brook's murmurs never die,
							And on the mountain peak's so still and high
							Which all but fearless strong-winged birds must shun.
							I thought that time went sweet and soft and slow,
							And left no marks save those of gentleness
							That bound you to my life with strong caress;
							And you saw naught but all my soul's deep truth,
							No fading bloom, nor form the years bent low,
							But ever still the beauty of my youth.
						

					

					
						A WOMAN'S QUESTION

						
							AM I not meek?
							I give my hand, my lips, my cheek,
							My dear, to you,
							My life, my soul; and shall not rue.
						

						
							Sink deep in joy
							And revel long; I'll be your toy,
							My dear. From now
							To play the part you'll teach me how.
						

						
							To your desire
							Of dawn and dark, though like the fire,
							My dear, I yield,
							As withered grass in a burning field.

						

						

						
							Your heart's caprice,
							For all of me, will it ne'er cease,
							My dear, to cling
							To both the flesh and soul I bring?
						

					

					
						THE ONE MAN

						
							THE written law and the custom had denied me love. But as with
								other women, instinct had taught me to be silent. I was in the flower of my youth,
								and each day I hungered more and more.
						

						
							Still, when I uttered a sound, the elders raised their fingers, and shamed me to
								silence, saying that love was only according to the written law and the custom.
						

						
							Thus a year passed, and several years passed, and the flower of my youth began to
								fade, and the eternal hunger in my heart made me sick of soul, and joy was no more
								in me.
						

						
							Then one night I lifted my eyes again to the god of my childhood, and again
								earnestly I sought an answer in the stars; when lot I saw that the written law and
								the custom were man-made, and that the hunger in my heart and the flower of my youth
								were God-made.
						

						
							And I trod forth in the middle of the night to yield myself to the arms that would
								hold me fast, and to the lips that would moisten mine. And my heart beat as never
								before, and the stars sang, and the night and the god of the night smiled upon
								me.
						

						

						
							And when I came to the arms that would hold me fast and the lips that would moisten
								mine to give myself up, I said, "Here, pluck the flower of my youth, and feed my
								heart."
						

						
							But the arms of him I loved were listless and would entwine me not, nor would his
								lips press mine; and there was some talk, and I cried aloud bitterly, understanding
								not. Then said he I loved, "The written law and the custom would crucify you on the
								street before all the people."
						

						
							I went away, and walked in the dim night, wondering why the people should deny the
								will of God, and punish them that obey His command, for the love in me was
								heaven-born.
						

						
							And soon thereafter I returned to him I loved, and said, "I will endure the
								punishment of the written law and the custom, touch me, touch me, touch me with your
								hand! and I will proclaim my joy aloud; for what is wrought in love's name is
								justified of God."
						

						
							"Then," said he, "must you perish, for they that need the written law and the
								custom will not hold them guiltless that need it not."
						

						
							"Death be welcome," I cried, "better a thousand times to live an hour and love and
								die at once, in the night, or be stoned upon the street, than die by inches, to
								wither and rot, and grow into old age as some unwatered flowerless vine, creeping
								over the juiceless earth, ugly to behold and barren."
						

						

						
							"Wait," palliated my love, "perhaps all shall be fulfilled even yet according to
								the written law and the custom. Wait "
						

						
							"Waited have I all these years. The fruit is ripe, the time is here, it is the
								season. See, I am still beautiful, the rose still lights my cheek, my eyes not yet
								are dim, my bosom breathes like wind-swept fields of grain, and I nightly dream the
								dream of women loved!"
						

						
							Then he said, "The written law and the custom are for the good of all the people,
								and the good of all the people is the will of God. Wait!"
						

						
							"No," I cried, "I will have my hand touched by you whom I love. I will walk with
								you in the evening and in the night unafraid, and I will not part from you; the dawn
								shall be a knell for twain in your house, and the dusk shall not divide us."
						

						
							"Wait!" said he again.
						

						
							"I will tear down the walls that surround me, break the locks that imprison me,
								pull back the veil that blinds me. A mountain of laws shall not deny me, nor a sea
								of ice freeze my desire. I was made to breathe the sweet, and though death steal
								upon me at dusk, this day shall I follow the voice of the stars and the god of the
								stars."
						

						
							Softly he said, "Too much I love you;" and touching me with his hand, he led me to
								where the day was darkening; and long we sat and spake no word, for the tumult was
								not of human speech; and soon the night  came, and the
								stars crept through the dark; yet spake he no word, nor touched me again with his
								hand.
						

						
							And after a long time, in perfect calm, he whispered, "We will obey the law;" and
								arising, we wandered slowly off together, out into the light and the world.
						

					


					
						I GIVE MYSELF FOR LOVE

						
							O YOU who love me, do you wish to bind
							Me fast; when you grow cold
							That no escape I find?
						

						
							My heart I cannot barter for all days,
							Though swearing with my tongue
							A thousand, thousand ways.
						

						
							The house of love is spirit, and no key
							Will firmly close its doors
							Forever and for thee.
						

						
							Yet if you love but me, the one true way,
							Without agreements long,
							I'll go with you to-day.
						

						
							But if by spring or noon of summer you
							Look sad upon my face,
							We'll smile and say adieu.
						

						
							Glad, glad that we have tasted to the core
							The sweet of all the world,
							Though we shall taste no more.
						

						

						
							For this I give my all--below, above,
							On earth, and after it--
							I give myself for love.
						

					

					
						A WOMAN ROCKING HER CHILD

						
							"I SEE that you are rocking him again."
						

						
							"Oh, yes!"
						

						
							"You're spoiling him by custom of that sort,
							And, too, you tire yourself, who need more rest."
						

						
							"I love to rock him so each night."
						

						
							"Shall I recount to you a gruesome tale?"
						

						
							"Yes, if you like."
						

						
							"Then stop, don't rock a while."
						

						
							"No, no, it might awaken him. See how
							He sleeps. I listen now; recite the tale
							By which for sport you seek to frighten me.
							I'm not afraid, too rich am I in joy."
						

						
							"It is the history of a child, like him.
							To make the tale more real, it  is the child
							You rock so softly now as he shall live
							Till death has gently kissed you on the lips.
							For months his mother,  you , will toil for him
							From morn's first twilight till the day is done.
							And though you're worn, you'll rock him every evening.
							Soon one by one the breaths of each disease
							Will seek to quench the candle of his life,
						

						

						
							Until his tender flesh shall livid grow;
							And every time 'twill be like letting blood
							Directly from the chambers of your heart.
							Then you, on his account, stabbed at his birth,
							And worn by days of anxious servitude,
							Shall fall so deep into the gaping pit
							Of death that life will seem far off and strange.
							If this you knew would surely come to pass
							Would you as now continue rocking him?"
						

						
							"Oh, yes!"
						

						
							"A lusty child in his eleventh year--
							One day while chastening him, he'll strike you back;
							And there will be a bruise upon your hip.
							Would you continue rocking him--?"
						

						
							"Yes, yes!"
						

						
							"Until his fifteenth year a million times
							He will annoy you with his many wants;
							And you shall be this wanton's perfect victim.
							One day, with friends, some worthless thing he'll steal;
							And you will humbly go before the judge
							And plead for him, inside the prisoners' dock.
							This shame will be a poison in your blood.
							Will you continue rocking him?"
						

						
							"Yes."
						

						
							"He will be handsome--"
						

						
							"Oh, I am sure of that!"
						


						

						
							"He will be handsome, and at twenty-four
							A maid he'll wed against her father's wish.
							Though rich, he'll turn the lovers from his door.
							And you will plan, economize, and toil
							For years, as one in bondage held by them,
							That these two idle ones shall feel no want.
							Knowing that, will you continue rocking him?"
						

						
							"Yes."
						

						
							"Then some years more, when you are stooped with care,
							Her father, reconciled, will bid them come
							And live with him; and they will be installed
							Behind the battlements of all his wealth.
							Will you be happy then?"
						

						
							"Yes, yes!"
						

						
							"The years are moving swiftly; there will be
							Some white and silver hair upon your head,
							And forward you will stoop a little more,
							And your right limb will pain you with each step.
							You will not often get to see your son.
							One day henceforth he will avoid your calls;
							And you'll be asked to come in at the rear,
							The servants' entrance. You will sway a little,
							As one who's hurt, and part of you will die.
							That true, will you continue rocking him,
							Who lies so helpless there within your arms?"
						

						
							"Yes."
						

						
							"That other sweeter tie is snapped by death,
							And you will be alone in all the world--
						

						

						
							Alone, except this full-grown man, your son.
							One day his wife, whom you had spared from want,
							Will tell you not to kiss her children's lips,
							Because--you will not hear the reason given;
							And you will speak of it to him, your son;
							And he will tell you that he has no time
							To listen to the twaddle of old age;
							And he will go to join his jolly friends,
							And you will sit alone. If you knew that
							Would you continue rocking him?"
						

						
							"Yes."
						

						
							"Then there will be a mighty scene take place;
							The actors will be he, his wife, and you.
							Your head will be the color of the snow,
							And there will be a tremor in your voice,
							Your eyes will be moist with the sorrows of age.
							You'll speak to him of recent ills you bore,
							Injustices provoked by him and her;
							You will recount the love of other years,
							His childhood, how you rocked him in the dark,
							And nursed him year by year with tender care.
							But he will shake his head impatiently,
							And speak as if he had not heard your words.
							Henceforth your every action will be watched,
							As one that wanders in uncertain dreams;
							And gone will be the world you knew in youth,
							And loneliness will sit within your soul.
							Will you continue rocking him?"
						

						
							"Yes."
						

						
							"And then at last you'll gladly fall asleep;
							And as you go out to your earthen bed,
						


						

						
							He'll have his empty carriage follow you.
							Would you indeed continue rocking him
							If this--all this--you knew would come to pass?"
						

						
							"Yes."
						

						
							"I cannot understand."
						

						
							"Of course you can't."
						

						
							"Again I say I cannot understand."
						

						
							"Of course you can't, you're but his father, dear."
						

					


					
						THE LOVE-MAD HUSS'

						
							"AT EVE hard by Neponset's crystal wave--
							Neponset's gleaming wave--
							I saw her last. The night was wild,
							The dark fell fast, and cold the blast,
							And all alone she ran;
							Along the snowy path no sound she gave
							That eve hard by Neponset's crystal wave.
						

						
							Her pallid face, part hid by fallen hair,
							Long, streaming, waving hair,
							The wind made rise and fall and curl;
							And wild the guise about her eyes
							As she ran by me swift,
							All open at the throat, her arms both bare,
							Her pallid face part hid by fallen hair.
						


						

						
							I watched her as she sped along the night,
							The glimmer of the night,
							Till she was gone. I went to rest,
							Yet ever on until the dawn
							She ran within my sleep,
							Her hair awry, her face a haggard white--
							I watched her as she sped along the night.
						

						
							Next morning as I walked upon the shore,
							Neponset's blustrous shore,
							I saw barred tight a mourning house,
							To mark the flight a soul that night
							Had made. Of one I asked,
							"Who's dead?"--"The love-mad huss, she is no more--
							Was found at dawn upon the frozen shore."
						

						
							Now ever on that gusty, fitful shore,
							Neponset's icy shore,
							I see her go through night's wild blast,
							In lonely woe, still to and fro;
							The marble face, the eyes
							Of withered white--she paces evermore
							Upon Neponset's fitful, icy shore.
						

					

					
						TO HER HUSBAND

						
							I THOUGHT of our wedding, a long time ago,
							The noise that it made and the grand public show.
							You said I was charmingly beautiful, dear--
							You're thinking it still? That sounds good to the ear
							Of even a wife who is losing no sleep
							Concerning the love that she never could keep.
							I knew you were rich, but you're much richer now.
							How mad we both were on our hearing of how

							

							The friend of our bosom depicted us two
							As animal things with ideas so few!
							When once you've extracted his joy-giving juice--
							A friend--what's a friend but a thing for abuse?
							If life never taught us another dread thing,
							It taught us that lesson with many a sting.
							It seems long ago that we lived through that day.
							I'm weary again and without much delay
							Should leave you at once for a journey quite far--
							You say you'd be glad if I went to a star?
							It's pitiful how we both sit here and stare,
							All wilted inside in this stifling air.
							Each time I came back from my journeying, then
							We lighted the candle of pleasure again.
							It burned and it burned and it much smaller grew,
							And every time it went out for us two.
							I'm fearing to go and return through that door,
							The candle is spent and will burn nevermore.
							And you've gone away several times in the past,
							And when you returned did the thing ever last?
							How clever we've been in our conduct--and why?
							You're never annoyed with a wee baby's cry,
							You're never annoyed with a few weeks of scare
							That I shall be bringing a boisterous heir.
							How cunning I am! You should like me for that,
							I've never been careless and ugly and fat.
							You show me with pride, and I oft play the part
							A woman who's clever can play well by heart.
							But that is outside; it is different here.
							You've always been good; I don't loathe you, my dear.
							I thought of the words that the minister used
							That night when he called and so much us amused;
							And yet of his cant I've been thinking a lot.

							

							I laughed at the time, but I've not quite forgot.
							His words ran like this, I've been saying them o'er,
							"In things of the flesh you should barter no more;
							Not even by law is such barter made right:
							I fear you are bodies, not souls, in God's sight."
							That sounds, does it not, as if we were both lost?
							You never complained of the price that I cost.
							I've paid in return--have I not, my dear sir?--
							I'm going to bed; but now please don't infer
							I hate you a bit, for I don't. Like a ball
							Our lives keep on rolling and rolling, that's all.
						

					

					
						HE WILL COME

						
							HE WILL come, she said
							Deep in her bounding, girlish heart, and smiled,
							Assurance on her lips;
							And childhood's dreaming fancies wild
							That over blissful pathways led--
							He will come, she said.
						

						
							He will come, she said,
							As many daily tasks and years came on;
							And from her cherry lips
							And cheeks the girlish glow had gone;
							And though her glad, wild dreams had fled--
							He will come, she said.
						

						
							He will come, she said,
							As o'er the saddened chords of her pure heart
							The hand of bitterness
							Oft now and then a tune would start,
							When some old playmate's life was wed--
							He will come, she said.
						

						

						
							He will come, she said,
							And sweetly smiled with faith again serene
							In that one perfect love
							Beyond the faded and the green
							Of earth. Ere last they laid her dead,
							He has come, she said.
						

					

					
						TO YOU WHO COME AT EVENING

						
							I KNOW you oft have told me, dear,
							The world is full of hate and strife;
							But I'm content with you and life--
							With you each night beside me here.
						

						
							You often fear that I am sad,
							Because some things you think I miss;
							I would not lose a single kiss
							For that which makes some persons glad.
						

						
							And when you touch me with your hand,
							And say the words you used to say,
							Why--all the night is turned to day,
							And I forget the things I'd planned.
						

						
							And often when we here have sat,
							And I have said, "Tell me again,"
							I've seen you smile a bit, but then,
							You see, we women live on that.
						

						
							We women love that we may live;
							The heart is hungry, too, and I--
							No matter if you don't know why--
							Well, I'm content with what you give.
						

					

					

					
						THE BRIDE

						
							YOU tremble, dear. See, I am not afraid,
							And all myself I give; my heart is light;
							The crimson on my cheek should flee in fright,
							And yet does not; 'tis there delayed
							Because I have no fear. I oft have prayed,
							With warming breath of whispers in the night,
							For this sweet hour with you, and tight
							Have clasped my hands, as in my thoughts you strayed.
							My lips I've saved for you and all the cheer
							That summer's dewy morns tossed in my heart,
							That when at eve you're wearied, I might start
							Some trifling little talk, which all the fear
							Of morrows and the day should swiftly part
							From you, and make you glad that I am here.
						

					

					
						THE ONE WOMAN

						
							HOW could I help but love you, coming up a cool and radiant
								fountain in the hot and dreary night of life?
							I swear the sins of youthful women lay upon my hands, the grimy sweat of wearied
								men in strife,
							Who'd clothed my body with garments fair, and the agonies of children, too,
								condemned to toil that I might freely live.
							I swear the cries of beaten slaves turned not my ear, nor wails of stunted children
								that the sea of want doth give.
							There was no order in my days. I slept and ate as instinct called, and heeded every
								wanton passion near,
							A face, a form, a game of chance, the gossip of the idle wags, and lived to finish
								quickly earth's career.

							

							And though I shall regret what now I here confess, and cringing turn from this
								swift lash that o'er my back I send--
							I swear that thing called soul had not set torch within the bloodstained walls
								where creaked my heart, bent on low passion's end.
							How could I help but love you, coming like a balmy light into the dead and moonless
								night of empty years?
							You spoke, and I saw the blood of murdered innocence glare red upon my hands, and
								heard the wailing sea of tears.
							You touched my hand, and through my restless life stole scenes of quiet woods and
								dancing shafts of gold upon the green;
							And daffodils and running vines, and larks' and linnets' songs, and the softly
								sounding lyre of doves perched high unseen.
							Things I had dreamed of in my dreaming childhood came again, and solitude with you
								was what I longed for most;
							Out of other distant worlds remembered visions sprang that long ere earthly birth I
								knew 'mid God's immortal host.
							And when I kissed your lips this world was born again, and in the still and starry
								night I was with you and God;
							And truth and mercy bloomed within my soul, and kindly words bred fast upon my
								lips, and bliss came where I trod.
							And long I lay upon the grassy earth, your hand in mine, and listened to your voice
								that showed the better way;

							

							And your own God I learned to love, but loved you more o'er all I ever knew, you
								who were fated not to stay.
							If I am aught, and tired men and weary women know my voice, and smile amid their
								tears, it is for you;
							And if a song has left my lips, some clear and simple song that comfort brings
								within some lonely heart of rue,
							It is not mine, but comes from out the mellow shaded woods of memory now mouldering
								in the faded past;
							And if the springtide and the autumn bring reborn the songs of love, it is because
								your spirit holds me fast--
							Because I pressed my lips to yours in the secret, voiceless woods, where daffodils
								and running vines forever blow;
							And where in tender dreams of waking hours, through all the silent years, my
								vagrant footsteps often come and go.
						

					
				
				
				
					On the Shores of the Sky

					

					

					
						THE AWAKENING

						
							FROM every village and city and house of the fields, I saw arise
								a vapor, like the star-dust of the night. And each trembling shaft murmured like
								running water as it climbed out of the dark world. All else was unchanged; it was
								the world I had known from childhood.
						

						
							I also was lifted out of the dark world, and I felt that I was being carried
								through space, as I had sometimes felt in dreams. High up the sounds of the rising
								vapor blended, and I heard the symphony of universal love shifting over the cities
								of the earth.
						

						
							The music swayed backward and forward and filled the spaces of the sky in diverse
								running streams, like the currents of the sea. Half asleep I lay on the breathing
								breast of the music rising, ever rising out of the troubled world below.
						

						
							The pyramids may have crumbled ere I awoke, and rivers have been born on the
								bleached earth of dead continents. It was no oblivious sleep, but one that feels
								itself ever awakening, like the gentle sleep aroused by music in the dawn, or the
								soft sleep of love that feels the warmth of lips in the twilight.
						

						
							When I awoke, I saw that the vapor had descended, and that the symphony of
								universal love filled all the cities of the earth. And I saw a strange race of
								people--strange with beauty. In the streets men went arm in arm. And there was no
								haste, and the world was like a garden fanned by perfumed breezes, and the places
								where men worked were adorned like the palaces of  old
								times, and there was no sorrow anywhere, and no haste there was, only sweet exchange
								of service, and none cringed, but all walked erect, looking kindly upon one another.
								But stranger than all else, I saw no sorrow.
						

						
							I asked, "What year is it?" and I was told. And one said to me, "Thy face is
								strangely marked." And looking into a glass, I saw that my face had still the lines
								of sorrow that life had graven there ere I slept, and this I told. But none that
								stood round me remembered sorrow, save an old man who had had an ancient book in his
								youth wherein was written of sorrow.
						

						
							And I saw that the history of the sorrow of the world had faded and was a thing
								buried in olden times, and I understood then that I had been long asleep. But now
								the snow of death was melted by love, and as a drowsy swimmer on a sun-kissed beach,
								I warmed myself, touching this one by the hand, and that one on the lips, to assure
								myself that I moved not among the visions of my brain, and that the hands and lips
								were warm.
						

						
							But it was the earth-the earth of old times! save that the promise of the human
								heart had been fulfilled. I sank down and prayed, and I should have wept and
								moistened the ground, but I could not, for tears had faded forever from the
								earth.
						

					

					
						YOU WITH THE STILL SOUL

						
							MAYBE you have a still soul that goes murmurless like the water
								in the deep of rivers;
						

						
							And perchance you wander silent amid the din of the world's grinding barter like
								one journeying in strange lands.
						

						
						
							You, too, with the still soul, have your mission, for beneath the dashing, noisy
								waves must ever run the silent waters that give the tide its course.
						

					

					
						WHO ENTERETH HERE

						(For the Door of Your Dream House.)

						
							WHOE'ER thou art that entereth here,
							Forget the struggling world
							And every trembling fear.
						

						
							Take from thy heart each evil thought,
							And all that selfishness
							Within thy life hath wrought.
						

						
							For once inside this place thou'lt find
							No barter, servant's fear,
							Nor master's voice unkind.
						

						
							Here all are kin of God above--
							Thou, too, dear heart; and here
							The rule of life is love.
						

					

					
						TO A SOLITARY

						
							HOW often have I unpacked my heart under the stars, careless of
								the swift night hours, and scornful of the days and years as they passed the horizon
								of the present!
						

						
							Why did I not disembosom myself to one who could understand, instead of carrying
								the conventional face in the sunlight of many days?
						

						

						
							I lacked courage, faith; and so was kept from my own by cloistering the inner songs
								save from the dead ears of the silent night.
						

						
							The fingers of the gods I found cold, lacking the warmth of human hands, and the
								voice of the stars in the night--though unforgettable--was still incomplete without
								the music of human whispers.
						

						
							In meditation I trod the snow-stained mountains, where the air is chill, unwarmed
								by human breath; and though my vision widened, the sweet noises of the peopled
								valley died away, and the songs of love with ered on my lips.
						

						
							I do not counsel you, O solitary! to shun eternally the mountain, and the purer
								air, and the broader vision, and the prayers by the star-tapers of the night, and
								the footsteps of God echoing on the mosaic of the inner cathedral.
						

						
							I do not counsel you to blind the spirit-eyes, impatient to look from the spires of
								immortality, or to be ignorant of the inarticulate language of the golden worlds
								that nightly sweep the brooding dome, or never to bathe yourself in the strange
								solitude of the moon.
						

						
							I do not counsel you to quench the beacon on the hilltop of your timeless self, or
								to stop your ears to strains of immortal music. These--all these the sweet people of
								the valley need, still prostrate in the church of things.
						

						
							Therefore, O solitary! bring now and then from the mountain your vision, your
								music, and your light. Set your lamp in the darkened places, and sing in the  crowded world the whispered melodies of your better
								self; re-echo with your own feet the steps of God heard in the inner cathedral,
								breathe the breath of purer air, and paint on the curtain of daily life your visions
								of the timeless hour.
						

						
							Though some understand you not, others will kiss your lips to smiles, and sit with
								you in the luminous hour, and you shall feel the warmth of strong hands, and the
								light that is within you shall be like that of a wedding house.
						

						
							And you, O solitary, shall touch your kin with the naked hand, and blend with the
								music of the world your spirit songs, and walk attended in the quiet evening over
								the paths warmed by human steps, knowing the pressure of a woman's hand at
								dawn--you! Godlike yet human still.
						

					

					

						I SEE THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF GRANDILOQUENCE

						
							I SEE there is a good deal of grandiloquence in my book--my
								friends and foes have told me.
						

						
							I think it must be true, for there is a good deal of grandiloquence in me--and in
								nature also:
						

						
							I saw a sunset last evening that was a gross imposition upon modesty;
						

						
							And no artist would have had the hardihood to paint that western sea of flame as it
								was there painted on the curtain of the coming night.
						

					

					

					
						THE NOISE OF THE CITY

						
							IF THE noise of the city offend you, go afield, when you may,
								with the birds and the wild, free life that troubles not;
						

						
							The growing grain and the placid sky have a kind of voice; and though you are
								alone, the boundlessness of the universe is with you.
						

						
							The dream of imperishable passions in old history, the love of mothers for
								children, and the love of chil dren, born and unborn, and all love, swarm in the
								soft air, speaking to the inner ear in the still language.
						

						
							Go afield with the birds and the growing grain and the placid sky, and dream and
								forget; and you will see that you are changed when you awake and the gleams of the
								city peep in your twilight returning.
						

					


					
						AFIELD

						
							FILLED with dreams and songs and love, I wander afield.
						

						
							Meditation, softened by the peaceful lands of grain and the illimitable blue sea
								overhead, draws my heart to my lips as one whose talent is in song.
						

						
							I yield to the thousand felicities of this transport, like a child led by his
								father's hand; and no questions darken this day of my content.
						

					

					

					
						SOMETHING WILL RISE IN YOU

						
							OCCASIONALLY permit self-abandonment to the caprice of beauty;
								rush past the sentinel that keeps you in the prisoned city, and live for an hour in
								the house of the world, acquainting yourself with the still people of the air.
						

						
							Learn the music of a summer night by the restless wave of the sea, or surrender to
								the sunlight of an open country where the illimitable sky at last meets to kiss the
								sweet, green earth, and stay till the crimson shafts burn the western world;
						

						
							And something will rise in you that is not connected with the tiring routine of
								your trade-something strange and calm.
						

					

					
						THOU MOTHER

						
							DO I but dream, or do I look on thee
							Once more? 'Tis thou, my eyes do not deceive.
							Again thou whisperest through the years to me,
							I feel the pressure of thy lips at eve;
							Again thy kindly, moistened eyes I see,
							And hear sweet counsel that I should not grieve,
							Thy gentle arms around me tight as we
							Rock slow, and I thy sweet caress receive.
							Yet oft I see thy face with sorrow wrung,
							Until sometime in fright I scarce believe
							That I still dream. The tales when thou wast young,
							Thine own sweet hopes, thy lips, and laughter free,
							In some weird way are strangely haunting me.
							Thou mother of my childhood's pleasant days,

							

							Still whispering hope and courage through the years,
							In quiet, cooling eve and daylight's rays;
							Art thou some happy dream dispelling fears?
							Or dost thou walk indeed along the ways,
							And know my joys, and all my inward tears
							That cease to flow when thou dost near me seem?
							O let me sleep, thou God, if I but dream!
						

					

					
						O SWEET CONTENT!

						
							O SWEET content! where is thy mild abode
							Where I may dwell in endless peace?
							Show me the much-sought road
							And give the lease.
						

						
							The answer came, "Then cease to vainly roam
							In search of me, for thou wilt find
							My quiet, hidden home
							Within thy mind."
						

					

					
						WILL YOU COME BACK TO ME?

						
							WILL you come back to me,
							My friend,
							Where evening's golden shafts still blend
							Night's sea--
							Will you come back to me?
						

						
							I need you more with all the years
							That come,
							Each bringing its fast-growing sum
							Of fears.
							I need you more with years.
						

						

						
							Some place you've gone, I know not where.
							I bend
							My head each stilly night and send
							A prayer
							To you away somewhere.
						

						
							And should you hear my voice at last,
							Come quick,
							Soon will the night be falling thick,
							And past
							Will be my voice at last.
						

						
							And once again we'll live in dreams
							Of youth.
							The tender thoughts of childhood's truth
							Our themes
							Again shall be in dreams.
						

						
							Will you in truth then come to me,
							My friend,
							Where evening's golden shafts still blend
							Night's sea--
							Will you come back to me?
						

					

					
						I SIT AND WAIT

						
							I SIT and wait upon my soul to-night,
							And watch the changing sky,
							The clouds and stars that fly
							Within the silent moon's far-reaching light
							That glorifies the night.
						

						

						
							Now would some keen, hard-headed son of trade
							Laugh loud at me, and say,
							"Your soul is gone? which way?
							And tell me of what stuff a soul is made.
							The thing's no good in trade."
						

						
							And proud philosophers would hard contend
							To tell me all they knew
							Of souls in me and you;
							Forgetting where the lights of heaven blend
							And shine, while they contend.
						

						
							So each one to his wish, and as for me,
							I sit to-night and wait
							In slumb'rous moonlight late,
							To feel the freedom of the world in me
							Like waves of a shoreless sea.
						

						
							Far vanished earth, I journey with the dead
							That smile in bliss afar
							On yonder liquid star,
							And on and on to ruby worlds of red
							From earthly vision fled;
						

						
							Where lonely faces I have known on earth
							Now smile in endless bliss,
							And fling to me the kiss
							Of love, 'mid twilight music soft with mirth
							Remembered long ere birth.
						

						
							And evening gardens built of pleasant thought,
							Where tripping laughters greet
							The timid bridal feet
							Of them new-wed to bliss; and sleep is naught
							But love subdued and caught.
						

						

						
							Oh, wake me not! but let me still beguile
							Myself in this sweet sleep,
							As through the world I creep
							On nameless wings, and rest myself, and smile--
							Let me be dead a while.
						

					

					
						THE DAWN


						
							ONE morn I rose and looked upon the world.
							"Have I been blind until this hour?" I said.
							O'er every trembling leaf the sun had spread,
							And was like golden tapestry unfurled;
							And as the moments passed more light was hurled
							Upon the drinking earth athirst for light;
							And I, beholding all this wondrous sight,
							Cried out aloud, "O God, I love Thy world!"
							And since that waking, often I drink deep
							The joy of dawn, and peace abides with me;
							And though I know that I again shall see
							Dark fear with withered hand approach my sleep,
							More sure am I when lonely night shall flee,
							At dawn the sun will bring good cheer to me.
						

					

					
						ONE WILL PASS THE DOOR

						
							YOUR first duty is to learn to live in the world, for to this you
								are born.
						

						
							But, meantime, make for yourself a secret room in the inner house of consciousness,
								where you may rest from the strain of the world, and disentangle yourself from that
								which is unworthy of your soul.
						

						

						
							Into this room let no unsympathetic person enter, for he would laugh at you in the
								temple of your better self.
						

						
							Yet, in a long time, perhaps some one who understands will pass the door. And who
								shall say what your life may be from that hour!
						

					

					
						COME, YOU WHO ARE WEARY 

						
							COME, you who are weary, and sit in the shadow of my faith; and
								when you are rested we shall journey together, singing gleefully on the highway,
								lending many a hand, yet passing ever on and on; and at nightfall, tired and
								content, we shall light the candles in the house of love, thank God in cheerful
								words, and lie down to peaceful sleep.
						
					

					
						ON A MAY MORNING

						
							I AM the dawn, the whisper of winds, the perfume of morning.
						

						
							The passing night fondled me, hovering close to me, softly, silently.
						

						
							The breaking day builds the spirit temple of my joy. I abandon myself!
						

						
							It seems to me that never before have I walked with the spirit as now, nor overcome
								space, time, and the elements as I overcome them now.
						

						
							I would liquefy myself to mingle my substance with the clouds and creep into the
								crannies of the good-tasting earth.
						

						

						
							I caress the good-tasting earth--lie upon it for hours, my body at full length. I
								converse with it; and the language is more articulate than the language of men. It
								is my mother, and the mother of my sisters and brothers, the grass and the trees,
								and all breathing and breathless living things--the great mother ever pregnant!
						

						
							I would comb her hair with my fingers, and dry my lips upon her cheek, and beat her
								with gentle blows of affection, and press my naked limbs against her.
						

						
							Insane, egotistical rapture! mirth inspiring!
						

						
							For a few hours here in the still morning I wash myself clean of civilization, and
								purge myself of things and the accumulated rubbish of time.
						

						
							I push back history, dismiss interpreters, and stand erect before the dawn, looking
								the universe in the face, and asking my own questions.
						

						
							To-morrow I shall return to the human wheels; but now I defy the world of customs
								and laws, of sophistry and serfdom; and I yield myself childlike to the light and
								the air and the sweet-scented dew.
						

						
							A bird flies through the sky, and I fly with it. I am in each pearl of moisture
								sparkling in the sun. I lie lazy on the clouds. And I acknowledge my kinship with
								each winged thing.
						

						
							I see all as one, and nothing repels me, as this new day climbs noiselessly out of
								the valley of night.
						

						
							Peace lies over the world and over the world of my soul.
						

					

					

					
						NOTHING

						
							"WHAT are you writing?"
						

						
							I looked up, yet I saw no one. It was near the middle of the night, the room was
								nearly dark, save the table over which I leaned holding my pen. Was I dreaming?
								Looking up again, I saw, or thought I saw, the figure of a woman standing in the dim
								light. Her hair lay over her shoulders, and her face I had seen somewhere.
						

						
							"What are you writing?"
						

						
							"A story of perfect love," I answered.
						

						
							"Lay down your pen and live with me the story you are writing," she said.
						

						
							"I am ready!" I cried, and arising, I started toward her; but there was nothing
								there.
						

					

					
						A CHILD

						
							SOMEWHERE a child is crying to me--somewhere in the future crying
								to me, calling me by name, by words of endearment.
						

						
							I almost see its face, somewhat like my own long ago.
						

						
							I almost hold it fast to me.
						

						
							I, almost stretching my arms to take it out of the air, feel anew strange currents
								of life passing in and out of me.
						

						

						
							The man in me arises, and I am lifted up by the thought that I shall not die, but
								live again in these hands that stroke my cheek, and in these lips that mingle their
								moisture with mine.
						

						
							I should be silent, but cannot--will not, and am unashamed.
						

						
							Thus, sitting in the gloaming, I yield to this weird vision of a child--my child
								crying to me; out of the fathoms of things unformed calling me to take it to
								myself.
						

						
							Often have I rocked you in the night, child of my dream, when the stars peeped at
								us and the earth slept.
						

						
							Often have I walked with you, holding you by the hand.
						

						
							And often have you looked into my face, dimming my mind; and the philosophies of
								ages vanished, and the wonders of science faded, and there was no meaning in the
								world but love of you.
						

						
							Thus sitting in the gloaming, I beckon you to come to me, I talk to you, and fondle
								you, child who is calling me.
						

					

					
						ONCE I LIVED ON A HIGH MOUNTAIN

						
							ONCE I lived on a high mountain, dead to the distant world of
								men, dead to possession of any thing, dead to myself of flesh. The quiet sun
								attending me by day, made of earth a dome of beaten gold, I wandering always on the
								top, and looking downward on the world. By night the moon walked with me, my brother
								of the sky, saying things  in a voiceless voice, which
								I understood. The stars knew me in the night and smiled, children of the house of
								God playing on the mead of heaven, calling often to each other. Not once saw I God
								face to face, yet heard Him when I stopped my ears, whispering as does the sea on
								the bosom of the night. I feared to close my eyes, banishing the world, and call Him
								to show His face, lest I should die. Yet always by day and night I saw His children
								of the mead looking down on me, I looking downward on the world. Speaking with no
								one, human speech I nigh forgot--the sighing seas of God breathing in my breast. All
								the music of forgotten worlds echoed in my brain; and the unborn children sang, and
								the dead children sang. But naught could I see save the dome of beaten gold, and the
								playing babes of the sky, and the sun and the moon. And none would come to touch me,
								and take me by the human hand, and press me tight in arms that held the warmth of
								earth as I. I saw naught but eternal things, heard naught but eternal speech; I
								alone was ephemeral amid these timeless beings. The purity of the mountain top froze
								the crimson rivers of my flesh; and since I was to die, I longed for mortal kin. The
								kindly human voice, with the sin of the crowded world, and duty, and toil, and
								laughter--all called for me to come; and rushing down from the mountain top, I
								sought again the world of women and men, the warm water of human things touching me
								on every side. In lane and mart I walked with men; drank from the cup of love till I
								was subdued with joy, yielding child-like to the manner of the world. Now the
								mountain top is far away; but the love of dying things is mine, for out of death our
								love is made; and I am with my kin.
						

					
				
				
				
					In the Gloaming and the
						Night

					

					

					
						THE LUMINOUS WORLDS AND THE LOVE OF THE NIGHT

						
							LONG did I believe myself evil because I did not worship
								according to the fashion.
						

						
							Long did I walk in the night and look at the stars, questioning my soul, and
								endeavoring to deliver myself out of the hands of the brass images of the earth.
						

						
							Now and then a luminous world rent the sky and burst into invisible dust; and then
								again the still face of the night looked down upon me, a single sand grain on one of
								the beaches of a million seas.
						

						
							And after a while a great calm came upon me, and though I know not why, I stretched
								forth my arms, as if to embrace one I loved, and something within me said, "It is
								enough."
						

						
							And the brass images of the earth fell from me, and I was made free as the wind is
								free, and fearless as the wind is fearless--out of the voice of the luminous worlds
								and the love of the night.
						

						
							But thereafter the children of the brass images shook their heads, for they still
								worshiped the idols of old times.
						

						
							And when I uttered the arguments of the voice of the luminous worlds and the love
								of the night, they understood them not.
						

						

						
							Better should I have known, for the things that are inarticulate cannot be made
								articulate, and there is no language of the voice of the luminous worlds and the
								love of the night.
						
					


					
						REVELATION

						
							I


							
								ONCE, after long weeks in the dust and heat of the city, in the
									noisy strife of the crowded world, covered daily with the grime of toil--
							

							
								Once, I say, I stood in the still night upon the shore of a lake; and for a long
									time I watched the lurid west. And with my own eyes I saw God painting upon the
									sky-curtain of the softening dark;
							

							
								And, after a while, the moon and her brood of stars wandered through the
									night;
							

							
								And I said to myself I need no bibles of old revelation; this is revelation; out
									of this beauty is my faith born.
							

						



						
							II


							
								Now that night is passed, and I again hear the noise and feel the grime of the
									crowded world;
							

							
								But now I am more patient and longer suffering, for I know that nightly God is
									painting His revelation on the sky-curtain over the lake where I stood.
							

							
								And over every lake, and over the crest of every hill, and over the green level
									of every open field, and if we could but see, over the sky-obscuring houses of
									every city--is God painting His revelation.
							
						
					


					


					
						THE LURE OF THE WORLD

						
							"YOU are going away," she said pensively. "I shall miss you, for
								you have come so often."
						
						
							Outside it was dark and winter, the wind howled about the house, scattering the
								snow off roof and knoll over the desolate frozen streets; the tall, stark trees
								creaked against the bitter blasts--outside it was dark and winter. "I go to-night,"
								said a voice dead with resignation.
						

						
							"We have known each other so long that I cannot think how it will be when you are
								gone. Why don't you stay? You have everything here, friends and home. What else do
								you want? Can the world out there give you more?"
						

						
							The wind blew, the night grew darker, the windows rattled in the casements. "I go
								to-night," the dead voice said.
						

						
							"I cannot understand. Were our many meetings only a summer's idyl, only a little
								page in your life's romance? You remember we walked in the woods when the trees were
								green, the grass soft, and the sky a dome of shining sapphire. Were we not happy?
								You often told me so. It will be summer again like that. Oh, stay! Hear the moan of
								the wind; and the world is cold outside. Oh, stay!"
						

						
							The door opened, the wind howled, the trees creaked, the night was darker, and the
								dead voice only said, "I go to-night."
						

						
							Into the dark, with outstretched arms, she cried, "Oh, stay! I cannot understand! I
								cannot understand!"
						

						
							And the night wind moaned, "Cannot--cannot understand!"
						

					

					

					
						IN THE NIGHT'S MYSTERIOUS STILLNESS


						
							HAVE you ever walked into the still, still night, and sat where
								you could see the lights dying one by one in the distant city--
						

						
							Sat until the stars sang to rest the weariness of the world in you--until you lost
								yourself in dreams on the soft bosom of the night,
						

						
							And felt again the peace of early youth welling up in you like a fountain of sweet
								waters--until like a child in the father's arms, you felt unafraid,
						

						
							And withered memories bloomed again in that inner garden, and little things were
								forgot in the vast stillness of the glorious growing night,
						

						
							And the same old ships of gold that sailed over the Pharaohs sailed over you in the
								same old sea of dark,
						

						
							And epochs and wars and the myriad passions and loves of the myriad years faded in
								the infinite peace of the still, still night?
						

					

					
						I GO INSIDE AND CLOSE THE DOOR

						
							I GO inside and close the door; the world has beaten me, and the
								love has passed out of me. I lock the door, and sit thinking of the still woods
								where I mused in old times, and of the friends and the days that are gone.
						

						
							I sit thinking of gentle men and women who prowl not about the haunts of trade,
								thinking of nights of rest  and peace, so that the love
								which has passed out of me may return, and the trembling nerves may grow calm, and
								the world grow sweet again. Therefore I go inside and close the door.
						

					

					
						A FEW HOURS AGO

						
							A FEW hours ago, hot and tired, I was surrounded by the jargon of
								business, myself a part of it.
						

						
							Now, somewhere near the middle of the night, I am sitting by an open window.
						

						
							Everything is still, and the soft night air is cool.
						

						
							The sky seems very near, and the stars lie over the heavens like fields of daisies
								stretching on and on.
						

						
							The moon is passing in and out of the clouds, making a shadow-checkered day of the
								night, and breaking the sky with shafts of gold.
						

						
							All silent, the universe is doing its work--beautiful, mysterious, religious!
						

						
							What was all the jargon about a few hours ago?
						
					

					
						I LOOKED OUT AT THE NIGHT

						
							FOR a little while I looked out at the night, my eyes wandering
								from star to star; and I thought how small are all our cares, and how useless our
								daily pother!
						

						

						
							As I sat dreaming, thinking, there arose grimly before me the stern face of duty,
								eyeing me like some monster from the pit of a nether world.
						

						
							And for a while there was this conflict within me, the still, sweet face of the
								night and the stern face of duty--the vision and the world.
						

						
							I would abandon myself to the still, sweet face; it invites and calms me, like the
								great quiet that follows the passion storms of love.
						

						
							But to-morrow the wheels will grind again, and the monster will sit in the high
								place, lashing the back of the world.
						

						
							O that we had not made slaves of ourselves, multiplying our homage to custom!
						

						
							O that we had the virtue to be less civilized! the power to abolish the law--save
								the law of the soul, to be kind and honest and live plainly!
						

						
							I look again at the still, sweet face of the night, as if to say adieu; yet I
								linger and look again and again, loath to go, as a man parting at evening from the
								woman he loves.
						

					

					
						O LONELY WORKERS!

						
							HIDE it as men will, even from themselves, behind the efforts of
								every man is the vision of a woman;
						

						
							It looms across the lonely way, and on the background of every evening's
								twilight,
						

						

						
							When the day's work is done and the worker's heart creeps to his lips and whispers
								for sweet companionship in the silent hours.
						

						
							O lonely workers of the world, wandering, plodding, and ever wandering, may the
								kindly peace of this midsummer night woo you also!
						

					

					
						SCORN NOT THE INNER SONG

						
							WHAT dreams of golden lights are these
							That steal upon the placid leas
							And through your heart
							Where passions dart
							At day?
						

						
							What mystic murmurs these you hear
							That come and ever more come near
							In softest gloom
							Of twilight's bloom
							At eve?
						

						
							Are these a premonition rare
							Of what the other life so fair
							Shall be at last
							When this is past
							And gone?
						

						
							Scorn not, therefore, the inner song
							The soul sings for itself along
							The hastening years
							Of many tears
							At eve.
						

						

						
							Nor scorn the peaceful whispers high
							That steal across the evening sky
							And part your soul
							From all the dole
							Of day.
						

					


					
						AT NIGHTFALL

						
							THOUGH I know I shall sometime no more open my eyes to the night
								or the day,
						

						
							I am one who looks at the stars when unchained from the work-bench at
								nightfall.
						

						
							They are a sign that I am not ephemeral, nor you, nor you, whoever you are.
						

						
							The dawn comes and the dark and the sign sparkling in the brooding night forever
								and forever.
						

					

					
						I GO OUT INTO THE NIGHT

						
							IGO out into the night and stretch forth my arms, as if to
								embrace one I love.
						

						
							I walk along streets which I have never before trodden, thinking I shall meet some
								one who is looking for me.
						

						
							The solace of the stars is sweet, and the stillness has a voice I understand.
						

						
							It seems to say, "Patience, work, gentleness," and I walk on, still thinking I
								shall meet some one who is looking for me.
						

						
							The light in each house tells its little story of rewards. Weary, surfeited with
								dreams, and solitary, I fall asleep at last, still thinking some one is looking for
								me.
						

					

					

					
						ERE YOU LIE DOWN TO SLEEP

						
							ERE you lie down to sleep in the night, sit still a while, and
								nurse again to life your gentler self. Forget the restless, noisy spirit of the day,
								and encourage to speech the soft voices within you that timidly whisper of the peace
								of the great, still night; and occasionally look out at the quiet stars. The night
								will soothe you like a tender mother, folding you against her soft bosom, and hiding
								you from the harm of the world. Though despised and rejected by men in the light of
								day, the night will not reject you; and in the still of her soft shadows you are
								free. After the day's struggle, there is no freedom like unfettered thoughts, no
								sound like the music of silence. And though behind you lies a road of dust and heat,
								and before you the fear of untried paths, in this brief hour you are master of all
								highways, and the universe nestles in your soul. Therefore, in the night, sit still
								a while and dream awake, ere you lie down to sleep.
						

					


					
						GOOD NIGHT

						
							GOOD night, thou sweet, old world, good night;
							Enfold me in the gentle light
							Of other days, when gleams
							Of dewy meadows held my dreams;
							And quiet walks, as day sank low,
							Dispelled each touch of woe.
							Let me forget these joys be gone,
							But feel them coming on
							From out the past, with laughter's cries
							And dream-enamored skies
							Of old. One hand let me hold tight.
							Good night, thou sweet, old world, good night.

						AMERICA

						
							LINCOLN, rise up from out thy tomb to-day,
							Thou lover of the lives of common men,
							America hath work for thee again.
							Here women want in sight of wealth's display,
							Man grinds his brother down and holds a sway
							As in the times of bloody lash and den,
							Save now the flesh is white, not black as then.
							In toiling holes young girls grow old, decay.
							Though thou art dead, could but thy soul return
							In one who loved his fellow-men as thou;
							Instead of greed that we might justice learn,
							Love character in place of gold as now,
							Write far across our native land's sweet soil,
							"Here none shall live upon another's toil!"
						

					


					
						LAMENTATIONS

						
							O THAT I could sing a song that would soften the heart of the
								world!
						

						
							O that I had the art to put emotion into words, and make the pages of my book a
								living thing!
						

						
							Impatient I grow at the lethargy of words. I would beat them, prick them with
								spears, whip them with iron whips, to make them cry out the passion of my soul!
						

						
							I would let out all the penned-up tumult that tortures me within.
						

						
							I would deliver the world from the gods of stone and the gods of gold; I would
								deliver the world from the  dead gods of old
								superstition, more cruel than prisons, and blind--a thousand years blind! I would
								open the doors and uncivilize mankind.
						

						
							I would counsel that most things called learning be unlearned, and that most
								traditions be forgotten. I would proclaim the new wisdom--older than the old--which
								in the process of civilizing ourselves we have forgotten.
						

						
							Ten thousand years before great cities stood on this continent, brown men sat
								peacefully together with women and children, and looked at the stars at night and
								wondered at the beauty and mystery of trees, and sang love songs to the great God,
								and believed!
						

						
							I would abolish the universal mad-house called large cities, turning the giddy
								inmates into green fields by running waters, teaching them lessons in stillness and
								placidity.
						

						
							Nature's laws would I make the rules of virtue. Perversion and unkindness only
								would I call sin.
						

						
							O that I could sing a song that would soften the heart of the world, that brother
								would not stand armed against brother, and sister against sister!
						

						
							For I myself am weary of battle, and the tenderness I stifle in me may not come to
								life again.
						

						
							I would have all men rich in spirit and comfortable in body, for I despise
								poverty.
						

						
							I would make love free among men and women, without barter in houses and lands,
								that no man should  buy what he could not win, and no
								woman should sell herself--one man for one woman, distinguishing love from lust. It
								is the same whether a woman sell herself in or out of the law; or whether a man buy
								a woman in or out of the law.
						

						
							I would awaken the sleepers to the glory of the world, the harps that play in every
								wind-swept forest, the living colors of every nightfall's western sky, the sapphire
								dome of the days of summer, and the still stars creeping through the ebony of
								night.
						

						
							Never in the wild witchery of dream have I seen a world comparable in beauty to
								this:
						

						
							The red gold of the west at twilight often with beauty pains my heart, speaking a
								language like the lure of far-reaching sea waves, or the call of sweet-singing birds
								at dawn on inland meads.
						

						
							What more revelation does the world demand? Here is revelation upon revelation!
						


						
							The book of day and the book of night burst with wonder, testifying that there is
								more in the world than we, and that we shall yet be other than we are.
						

						
							O that I could sing a song that would soften the heart of the world!
						

						
							But I cannot; and my wild cries are a picture that is faded, a harp with loosened
								chords, a reed that is broken. The fires of my soul turn to ashes upon the page.
						

					

					

					
						THE GREATER HEROISM

						
							WORK as if thy task were made for thee;
							Be strong as if thou hadst courage,
							And charitable as if thou hadst been rewarded;
							Remain poor if riches are dishonorable,
							And carry poverty with the dignity of virtue.
							When others dine sumptuously, eat thy crust;
							Let love be thy guide and justice thy God--
							Not for thyself alone, but for all men.
							Pursuing these things thou wilt be misjudged
							And, in the gloaming of thy days, forgotten;
							Then, uncomplaining, lie thou down at even,
							Cheered by the love in thy heart,
							And by the full-grown soul of thy charity;
							Then hast thou won the heroic battle,
							Yet not stained the sweet earth with blood;
							But in the garden of love and sacrifice,
							Hast thou planted serenely growing flowers,
							That shall still blow when thou dost slumber
							In the shadow-land of dreamless sleep.
						

					

					
						I WENT INTO A MAGNIFICENT CHURCH

						
							I WENT into a magnificent church in a great city, and I heard the
								minister tell the people about Christ.
						

						
							And the longer I listened the more I wondered why the people did not silence
								him.
						

						
							For, as I looked about me, I saw them that had crucified Christ, and them that had
								defamed Him and turned Him out.
						

						

						
							And when I left the church, I went without the city to a wood; and I sat for a long
								time, thinking of the sweet-souled Christs that had yet to die that love might some
								day flourish on the earth.
						

						
							And I remembered how dearly liberty had been bought from the self-righteous masters
								of each age, who worshiped according to the fashion; and my thoughts were somehow
								heavy with the sorrow of the world.
						

						
							And there in the whispering wood, where every leaf was a tongue softly humming the
								songs of summer, the beauty of the world soon lifted me out of the things of the
								present, like a melody remembered out of childhood; and there I, too, silently
								within, prayed that I might at least once in my life boldly strike the iron
								harpstrings of the heroic.
						

						
							And soon darkness came on, and the lights of the city looked out into the night;
								and on my way back, as I went by the magnificent church, it was silent and dark; yet
								I somehow fancied that I could still hear the minister telling the people about
								Christ.
						

						
							And as I turned away from the great stone arches of the magnificent church, now
								sullenly grand in the mystic glimmer of the night, I remembered that the Son of Man
								wandered barefoot over the Judean hills, and at night had not where to lay His
								head.
						

					

					

					
						I JOURNEYED FROM UNIVERSITY TO UNIVERSITY

						
							I JOURNEYED from university to university, and I saw everywhere
								the past rebuilt before the eyes of young men and young women--Egypt, Greece, Rome;
								language, architecture, laws--saw the earth and sky explained, and the habits of
								mind and the habits of body--
						

						
							Everywhere chairs of this and that, largely endowed.
						

						
							But nowhere saw I a chair of the human heart;
						

						
							Nowhere a sweet breath to cool the heat of that human slaughter called traffic.
						

					

					
						A CERTAIN RICH MAN'S DREAM

						
							HE DREAMED his gardens grand he trod
							Till morn. An angel fair from God
							He saw nearby the gate
							He asked to be his mate.
						

						
							He told of all who lived by toil
							In houses his, on bounteous soil,
							And that in trade he led;
							And asking then he said:
						

						
							"I've gained so much of earth, shall I
							Not merit heaven when I die?"
							"Not so," the angel quoth,
							"No man can merit both."
						

					

					

					
						TO THE MASTERS OF MEN

						
							THEY that toil--
							What have they done that they should beg
							To work and run by your command?
							I cannot understand.
						

						
							They that toil--
							Why do they fear some heartless ill
							When you draw near their slavish life,
							Bound to unending strife?
						

						
							They that toil--
							Some day they'll know this earth is for
							Them too, and lo! who shall withstand
							Their loud and fierce command?
						

						
							They that toil--
							They slumber low; but they shall wake
							And they shall know their mighty power
							In that strange reckoning hour.
						

						
							They that toil--
							God made them, too, with love of life
							No less than you-in breaking storms
							They'll come in myriad swarms.
						

						
							Therefore, O
							Ye masters all! ere whirlwinds rise
							And temples fall, and daylight wane,
							On earth let justice reign!
						

					

					

					
						THOU THAT ART IDLE BORN

						
							THOU that art idle born--knowest thou the weariness of toil
							When the flesh refuses and cries "no farther,"
							And the soul believes no longer in God,
							And the night and the day are hateful;
							When fear of want knocks ever at the door,
							And evil dreams harass thy midnight sleep?
						

						
							There are none such, sayest thou,
							O beautiful one that art idle born?
							They are in thy house, in the street, everywhere.
							They adore thee, thy beauty, thy imperious manner,
							Thy placid eyes, and thy careless self-assurance,
							Thy soft white flesh--
							Thou--thou that art idle born!
						

						
							What great virtue is thine
							That God has so elevated thee
							That men and women and children serve thee,
							Yet thou servest not at all?
							And what great wrong have they done
							Who serve always yet are never served?
							Does God not love them also?
						

						
							No bitterness to thee that art idle born--
							Only be thou gentle and kind,
							And touch with thy soft hand the leaden brow,
							Grown ill and old in service;
							And with thy beautiful face and thy body,
							And the things that cover thy beautiful body,
							Give thou no offense.
						


						

						
							Soon the shadows gather
							And creep over the garden of thy soul,
							And it grows still with thee,
							Thy memories fading like an evening's twilight,
							And thou sleepest in thy last chamber,
							And the vain flesh is humble--
							Thou--thou that art idle born!
						

					

					
						THE ENEMY

						
							FOR a long time one who had seen the spirit told the people about
								the love of God, inspired hope in their tired souls, and taught them the things that
								we call the things of the spirit.
						

						
							His daily bread he earned by whatever there was for his hands to do; for the
								people, though they took the product of his soul, yet they gave him naught therefor
								of material things.
						

						
							And it happened, in the valley where the people lived, that a great storm swept
								over the fields, destroying the grain; and they that had toiled had nothing for
								their 'labors; and the fields stood barren like a desert, and hunger and anguish
								spread over the valley.
						

						
							And some of them cried out, "Where was God when the storm raged?" And others said
								sullenly, "There is no God!" And still others were silent. The most violent said,
								"Let us punish him who has deceived us, teaching us all these years of the love of
								God."
						

						
							And straight they went to the house of him who had seen the spirit, and in anger
								questioned him; but he  made no answer, for sorrow for
								the people was heavy upon his heart.
						

						
							And they took him out of his house, and led him to a hill, and slew him, he who had
								taught them the love of God. And there was rejoicing in the valley that the people
								should be no more deceived.
						

					

					
						SUNDAY NIGHT

						
							BACK to the world to-morrow morn,
							Back to the white-heat world,
							To grinding barter, sweat and swirl,
							Back to the lips with anger curled.
						

						
							I'd linger here in the still, still night,
							With stars in the wondrous sky,
							And gentle words, and slowing steps
							Of worshipers going by.
						

						
							Does life demand so much of food,
							Of costly raiment rare,
							That but an hour may be plucked
							From all the days of care?
						

						
							The world is sold to the mammon god;
							The many serve the few,
							And whips crack loud o'er myriad heads
							Each hour to starve or do.
						

						
							Back to the world to-morrow morn,
							Back to the white-heat world,
							To grinding barter, sweat and swirl,
							Back to the lips with anger curled.
						

					


					

					
						DESIRE

						
							I SAID to my desire, "What wilt thou have? Wilt thou have gold
								and all the things that can be bought therewith, houses, gardens with great green
								walls, and the beauties of art?"
						

						
							My desire made no reply.
						

						
							"Shall I go with thee on a long journey--to the far seas of Africa, or to the warm
								sunshine of Italy, or to the cold north and flit with thee over the crystal
								snows?"
						

						
							My desire made no reply.
						

						
							"Ah, fame--wouldst thou have fame--the crook of every knee, the nod of every head,
								the loud acclaim of thee everywhere?"
						

						
							Yet made my desire no answer.
						

						
							"Wouldst thou have love," said I at last, "a woman to hold thee as a god, to look
								upon thee with spiritual lust, to drain with thee the cup of heaven and the cup of
								earth, to kiss thee ere thou slumberest, and to wake thee with her lips at
								dawn?"
						

						
							My desire said, "I desire nothing, and cannot have it, therefore am I
								miserable."
						

					

					
						HIS LAST TOAST

						
							LET saints declare I shall not dare
							Or burn in the pits of hell.
							Let loud men scorn and women mourn
							Whene'er my tale they tell;
						

						

						
							I cannot stay in the deadened way
							Of narrow, hide-bound creeds;
							I'll win the smile that shall beguile
							My heart where'er it leads.
						

						
							Away with tears and shrinking fears
							That breed from the gossip's tongue.
							I'll live to-day in my own way,
							Though night shall see me hung,
							And my good name be dragged to shame
							And damned for evermore;
							So here's farewell to them that tell
							My tale when all is o'er.
						

					

					
						SUICIDE

						(CHATTERTON)

						
							THOU God, I'll speak with Thee as if Thou wert,
							And say this is the last of earth I see.
							The night is deadly still, and wandering free
							I soon shall send my prisoned soul alert
							Upon the air. No more the stinging hurt
							Of life, for quickly it is done with me.
							My flesh they soon will bear across the lea--
							Poor livid flesh, thou art but made of dirt.
						

						
							The hope to serve that once did smite my lyre
							In sweet ambition's sunlit days has fled.
							Unsought my roses fade that once were red,
							And withered is my garden as by fire.
							O thou great God, I have but one desire,
							To rest my tortured body with the dead!
						

					

					

					
						NIGHT MEDITATIONS

						
							THIS beautiful world, set in a heaven of wonders, abounding in
								the gifts of nature, modeled in the great fancy of some spendthrift god of
								beauty--this beautiful world! why is it the theatre of man's cruelty?
						

						
							I looked at the sun this evening as he sank behind the earth, and I wondered if all
								this bewildering beauty was but to mock the little soul of man; and as I looked
								again and again, I felt a great tenderness steal upon me like the tenderness of one
								who loves; and as the darkness succeeded the glaring red of the west, the cares of
								the world fled from me and sank with the departed sun over the edge of the
								world.
						

						
							Yet I fear this tenderness that the twilight wrought in me, for to-morrow in the
								fierce fight for life it may be the weak place in my armor--and I am condemned to
								fight upon the street.
						

						
							Yet not for myself I cry aloud, for I am one who sometimes sits at the feast. But I
								sit there only in body while my soul refuses to come, awaiting my return by the
								quiet of the midnight lamp, there to chide me gently for the wasted hours.
						

						
							But I cry aloud for them in the dark corners of the earth. Great God, are we less
								than the animals, that the powerful among us should gather and store for days that
								never come--more than the need of a life of a thousand years? What brute maims and
								kills his kind for purposes like these?
						

						

						
							Thou maker of worlds, soften this our life ere we perish. In the clatter of trade
								thy name is not heard, and thy candle is spent in the darkness of selfish gain. The
								fires of love are cold, and greed is master of the world. Long have I prayed that
								thou soften the heart of greed. Now I cry aloud that murdered justice rise like an
								ugly vision at a feast.
						

						
							Great God, is it Thy will that the enemies of society shall prosper, and the
								virtuous and the useful be damned to slavery and want?
						

						
							Great God, art Thou dead? Or living, is Thy hand palsied--Thou whom we thought so
								powerful--Thou maker of worlds? Is justice harder to make than a world? I shall
								remember my question, and Thou wilt answer me at the gate of Paradise.
						

						
							Or if, after all, this life should be the end, who will requite the toilers in the
								dark corners of the earth? The faith that Thou wilt yet do justice stays the
								knife.
						

						
							My brother, I think of you toiling in the dark corners. How sweet to you must often
								seem the peace in the gloom of the grave. For in the grave there is no weariness and
								hard words have lost their sting.
						

						
							Great God, if Thou hearest our cry, turn not away from us, we are Thy children. The
								journey is strange and we have lost our way. Some perish in pitfalls, and some of
								gentle spirit await the call of death. Again, again--oh, soften the heart of greed,
								and before the rulers of men let rise the pale faces in the dark corners of
								want!
						

					

					

					
						THE FOOL AND THE CITY OF CONTENT


						
							THERE was a fool once, and to every one that passed him he said,
								"Look!" pointing with his finger. But no one saw anything. Yet he continued to point
								ever more and more urgently.
						

						
							And after a while a few persons thought he must surely see something, and they
								stood by him longer than the others, and tried a little to see at what he was
								pointing.
						

						
							But most of the people shook their heads and smiled, and after a while no one
								heeded the fool, and there he stood pointing and hailing each passerby year after
								year, until he died. And when he was dead, the people in jest made a mound of earth
								over his grave, to commemorate the fool.
						

						
							And year after year the tradition of the fool went from father to son until a few
								generations had passed, when behold! one day a youth stood where the fool had stood,
								and he looked as his father laughingly pointed as the fool had done;
						

						
							And the youth cried out, "O father, see!" and the father's face grew solemn, for he
								likewise saw or thought he saw, and he called to others, and the laughter was
								hushed, and each beholder called his friends and his kin, and each shuddered as he
								looked.
						

						
							And through the city of content there ran a shudder like that which ran through
								each beholder. But it was too late; and ere long rivers of crimson flowed through
								the streets, and at noonday it was dark like a starless  night, and shrieks of inhuman things rent the silence, and in each house death
								kissed some one on the lips.
						

						
							And the fool arose from his tomb and wept for the children of the people he had
								loved.
						

					

					
						MYSELF

						
							ALL the questions have I asked,
							All things have I tried;
							But nothing satisfied.
							"There is no vital task
							Except to wait till time has fled
							And I am dead,"
							I said.
						

						
							Thus I walked in living death,
							Smiled at God's great trick
							Of life, till I grew sick
							Of smiles; and then in breath
							All hot and vile with bitter cry
							I prayed that I
							Might die.
						

						
							Back I pushed all human creeds,
							Standing lone and nude
							With God in solitude,
							And lo! from out the weeds
							Of human thought I looked in awe,
							MYSELF I saw
							Was law.
						

					

					

					
						I STOOD AT THE CROSSING OF TWO STREETS


						
							I STOOD at the crossing of two streets in a great city, and I
								watched the lines of humanity coming and going.
						

						
							I stood until my limbs ached, and I grew weary of watching.
						

						
							It seemed to me that these lines of life moved more quickly all the time.
						

						
							Nearly every face was hard set, and I remember none that smiled. No calm steps
								there were, or pleasant exchange of human speech, only a hurrying to and fro;
						

						
							Some breaking into and through the lines, that they might go the faster.
						

						
							I wandered away, sick at heart, like a wound-belated soldier crossing a battlefield
								strewn with dying, or like one passing a mad-house wherein are confined his
								kinsmen;
						

						
							And I thought of Dante and his visions.
						

						
							What to this hurrying mass are the beauties of art and the songs of poets!
						

						
							What self-forgetful soul shall break the arms that hold o'er these the iron lash of
								need!
						

						
							Who shall touch to joy and faith this nervous, fearing race,
						

						
							And plant again the blooms of love and the dreams of hope!
						

						
							I wandered away, sick at heart, wondering that this should be the boast of man.
						

					

					

					
						I PONDER O'ER LOVE

						
							I PONDER o'er love and o'er death,
							O'er fame and unrequited toil,
							O'er placid young men and young women
							Dreaming in the day of their dreams,
							O'er hard-headed men of trade,
							And the public cheat held in high esteem,
							O'er the patient artist buying with his youth
							That which he shall gain in age
							But cannot enjoy, the day of pleasure being past;
							O'er the young nun, barred from the world,
							Yet bound by nature to be still a woman;
							I ponder o'er the tragedy of idealists
							Living in a world of bog;
							O'er ministers grown larger than their doctrine,
							O'er the chance-taker who has lost,
							And o'er him who has won,
							O'er proud, beautiful, idle women,
							And humble, ugly, toiling ones,
							O'er the tired worker in the shop,
							And the master of the shop,
							O'er solitary women who sit in gloom,
							O'er the bride and the bridegroom
							And the secret chamber that is theirs,
							O'er the dead love of them that still live,
							O'er the mystery of the mother's love,
							And the agony of ungrateful children loved,
							O'er lonely sailors out at sea,
							Ever watching the dead, dead waters,
							O'er soul-poisoned kings of nations and gold;
							I ponder o'er myself, indifferently just,
							Breathless in the roaring sea of time.--


							

							Let me forgive much, forget more;
							Let me close my eyes and fall half asleep,
							That the pictures may grow softer and stiller,
							And the life, O thou God! again grow gentle.
						

					

					
						THE TASK

						

							I

							
								I KNOW I do not understand this world,
								This universe of life and growth and death.
								I do not damn the Maker, saying still
								Within myself that surely all is well.
								The myriad stars shine nightly in the sky,
								The earth yields forth her budding brood in spring,
								And always dawn and noon and dark succeed;
								Volcanoes burst and flooding rains descend,
								And sprigs shoot forth where barren winter lay;
								The piping winds bound through the bending trees,
								And withered leaves again return to earth;
								Soft lips grow hard and tresses gold turn gray;
								Sweet babes are born, and stooping, aged men
								Depart into the soft and silent night.
								And not one jot of all this can I change.
							

						

						
							II

							
								Nor you, my metaphysics peddling friend,
								Explaining how the cosmic wheels go round.
								I, too, was once a trader in that junk,
								And oft have strutted in the lecture room,
								Showing all my choicest wares to students bland:
								Kant's  rend="i"Dinge an sich I doled in precious lots
								To scholars, in return for which they gave
								A year of nightly brooding, swearing still


								

								'Twas worth the price to be so well equipped
								For life. (I know they cursed me later on,
								As I my pompous masters, too, have cursed.)
								And gloomy Schopenhauer's raging  rend="i"Will
								I crammed into the throats of sweet young men;
								And all the other tribes of babbling seers
								I sold with profit to myself, until
								At last my heart awoke and called me fool--
								Called me fool, for I had seen how each
								By reason stoutly contradicted each;
								Saw the world submerged in theories wild,
								Saw all things proven which men pleased to think,
								Until my mind in contradiction fell.
								But o'er the dreams of philosophic seers,
								I heard with certain ear the moaning cries
								That burst from out the souls of human want.
								These alone, when all else failed, were real!
							

						

						
							III

							
								And you, my dealers in theology,
								Forgetting all the Christs that tread the earth,
								And calling loud for patrons everywhere,
								Know you the chambers in the house of God?
								Just how He made the thing and of what stuff?
								With Christ have you walked through the pits of hell?
								And do you know the souls of mortals doomed?
								Who told you all the secret ways of God,
								That you may dole the keys of paradise
								To them that buy in fear your ragged wares?
								Back to the vales of darkness all ye mongers
								That steal of earth its joy, and fill the world
								With midnight mists of ignorance and fear!
								With all your wisdom not a raindrop more
								Nor less shall fall to quench the thirst of earth.
							

						

						

						

							IV

							
								Amid the pedantry of mountebanks,
								Parading wrathful gods with horned heads,
								The silent universe goes on its way,
								Scornful of twaddling bugs' sophistic lore.
								The myriad stars shine nightly in the sky,
								The earth yields forth her budding brood in spring;
								All nature moves as by a hand unseen.
								And not one jot of all this can I change,
								Nor you, my mortal friend, whoe'er you are.
								Ignorant am I of cosmic things,
								And you, and ignorant shall ever be.
								But we are not forlorn in wild despair:
								We still may turn our eyes across the night,
								All lustrous in the gold of other worlds,
								Where seas of dark reach on to seas of dawn,
								And whisper to the silent soul within,
								That all's in place in this God-impassioned world.
							

						

						
							V

							
								But there are things my eyes have often seen
								That stop the crimson rivers of the heart,
								That cause the breath to halt ere it rush forth
								To mingle with the breathings of the world--
								Not cosmic things no human hand can change,
								Nor tampered history, sacred or profane,
								The bouncing ball of babbling pedantry;
								But worlds of faces damned ere they did leave
								The yielding womb to be despised of men,
								Born slaves to know the lash from childhood frail,
								And fed into the mouths of mammoth mills
								Where Christian lords pile up their godless gold.
								What boots the question here of trinity?
							

						


						

						
							VI

							
								And I have seen ill-shapen women stare
								From sorrow sodden faces early old,
								As plodding on to toil they went at dawn,
								Still childless, homeless, solitary souls.
								Once these were young and sweet to look upon,
								And fit for babes to bloom upon their breasts,
								Like drowsy roses dewy fresh at dawn.
								These oft had whispered prayers for lover's kiss
								That's born of righteous love in stilly night,
								And dreamed the dream but women understand
								Of unborn babes that smiled within their sleep,
								Nightly clamoring to be born of them.
								Unloved they wandered in a loveless world
								To join the women dead from early times,
								The helots mute of wanton avarice.
								What grief so great to wither in the bud,
								And ne'er press tight the moistened lips of love,
								To dream of music that one may not hear,
								And miss the clinging arms at break of dawn!
								And millions yet shall die with withered breasts
								Where babes have never touched their tender lips.
							

						

						
							VII

							
								And I have heard the cries of younger men
								That saw no more the stars above their heads,
								Shut ever in by trade's benighting bog--
								Young men that still did hold to early dreams,
								O'ermatched by them whose cunning had no heart,
								And left the prey of human vulture's greed
								With saddened eyes that kindly looked at death.
								No love's embrace to speed their nightly coming,
								Nor children clamoring for sweet caress,


								


								And claiming yet another fabled story
								Ere led by gentle hands to dreamland's door;
								Lonely followers of goodness still,
								Though laughed to scorn by them whom they did serve.
								What earthly captain with his spoils of trade
								Shall right the wrongs of these that lie so still,
								If God perchance forget again to touch
								To conscious life these earthly scar-marked souls,
								And light again the citadels of thought?
								O who will close the wounds of these that fell
								Before the piping spears of avarice?
							

						

						
							VIII

							
								And here and there, I know, the sweet green earth,
								Where now some quiet planter turns the soil,
								Shall once again be wet with human blood;
								And oft again the knife shall deftly rise
								To strike a brother down in godless wars,
								And children weep again o'er grassy mounds,
								And stooping women, from whose face the rose
								Has fled, shall think again of early love;
								And younger women dream what might have been.
								And all for what? That traffic patriots
								May wreck for profit's sake the weaker nations.
								O profit, crowned on high as earthly king,
								Stretching thy blood-stained hand across the world,
								Well armed with Bible, rum and edged blade,
								To thee a life is but a leaf of grass;
								Thy ears are deaf to stunted children's wails,
								And dumb thy palsied tongue to mercy's word!
								Thou soulless low-browed god of gloated gold,
								When shall we shake thee off, and once again
								Build up the kingdom of the human heart!
							

						

						

						
							IX

							
								The fight to live is now with man, not nature.
								The goodly earth yields but by touch of hand
								Enough for all. But o'er the bloom of fields,
								And treasures hid deep down, and useful craft,
								The misered hand of greed crawls in the night;
								And all the air is charged with words of gain,
								From trader's shop unto the thrones of art.
								The smell of profit clings e'en to the God
								That men implore and barter with in prayer,
								And all who breathe must breathe this charged fume.
								Thus millions wither ere the noon of life
								And die in soul long ere we bury them.
								The rushing steps that move in crowded marts
								Go not of choice, but driven by the lash,
								And dare not pause lest they be trampled down.
							

						

						
							X

							
								Here, then, abides the work of wakened man;
								To break the chains that would a brother bind,
								And stay the misered hand that now is full,
								To draw grim profit's heel from childhood frail,
								And loose the women slaves in holes of hell,
								To lift the human heart from graves of gold,
								And knock unceasingly on temple doors
								Where feeble souls have slumbered long,
								To plant a rose in every barren breast,
								And in the din and tumult of the world
								To sing and teach and live the things of love.
							

						

						
							XI

							
								The sunshine calmly paints its twilight hues
								Each day in still extremities of earth;

								

								And nowhere blooms a leaf but speaks of love;
								The stars fret not aglow in mellow night,
								And soft peep forth like village lights at eve;
								The forest winds resound the melodies
								That live alone in quiet, wooded worlds;
								O'er ragged mountains, plains and lapping seas,
								The silent ships float on the soundless wave;
								The nightingale still spends his only song
								In noon of night; and wander birds still rove,
								As in the olden times, each with his mate;
								The quiet moonlight tiptoes o'er the earth,
								Like playful water on a sandy beach;
								And wandering in its noiseless path of gold
								Arises olden bliss we knew ere birth,
								And silent robes of beauty deck the world,
								From tender leaf to twilight's quiet stars.--
								O lift us up, thou God of all, to love,
								Above the soulless martyrdom of things!
								The rushing world is hungry at the heart.
							

						
					
				
				
				
				
					In the Garden of Love

					

					

					
						ONE OF LONG AGO

						
							HAST never sat with sadness in the stilly, stilly night,
							When all the dancing day's bright beams of sun had gone to flight,
							And through the pulseless falling dark a luring wind sang low
							The music that the stars march to so silently and slow?
						

						
							Hast never sat and thought of one, 'mid sad old memory's tears,--
							One who had lived within your heart through all the joyous years?
							'Tis sweet this sadness that comes on when night begins to fall,
							And spreads its silent softening dark through chamber doors and hall.
						

						
							It is the only heritage that time has left me now;
							And on its steady course it keeps my vessel's shattered prow.
							And thus in corners of each life you'll find some hidden face
							That through the years keeps marching on and holds each soul in place.
						

						
							So let the night grow thicker still and breezes turn to storm,
							There's armored safe within my heart and free from earthly harm
							This smiling face of one who looks into my eyes e'en now,
							While through the world I go alone till snow lies on my brow.
						

					


					

					
						TO BE WITH YOU

						
							TO BE with you this evening, rarest of the evenings all,
							And listen to the whispering leaves and to the night bird's call,
							The silvery moonlight on your face--
							To be with you in some still place.
						

						
							To be somewhere alone with you and watch the myriad stars,
							Far golden worlds beyond the noisy earth's unkindly jars,
							As quietly they sail night's sea
							Above the world and you and me.
						

						
							To be with you somewhere within this evening's mystic shade,
							To hear your plans and hopes and tell you mine, all unafraid
							That you'd forget to hold them dear,
							When I'm away and you're not here.
						

						
							To be with you and listen to the harp of summer's breeze,
							Alone with night and wavering stars, beneath the lisping trees,
							To feel the cool of falling dew--
							To be somewhere alone with you.
						

						
							To be with you this evening, rarest of the evenings all,
							And listen to the whispering leaves and to the night bird's call,
							The silvery moonlight on your face--
							To be with you in some still place.
						

					

					

					
						A MAN AND A WOMAN

						
							A MAN and a woman once walked in the evening to a wood, that the
								trees might hide them from the light.
						

						
							Far into the deep shadows wandered they, when one said, in fear, "Let us return."
								It does not matter which one said it.
						

						
							Still they wandered in the dark, watching the light within themselves, as it glowed
								in the garden of their love.
						

						
							The night came over the world and the wood; and seeing they had tarried too long,
								they determined to return at dawn.
						

						
							But--it is an odd story--do you know, it never again grew morning in that wood?
						

					

					
						AT THE DANCE

						
							WE circled oft the hall in varying motions,
							And talked, through all the music wrought,
							Of friends and dress and common things;
							But here is the speech I thought:
						

						
							"Before the night has yielded all its music
							And the dance is o'er and dawn is here,
							And the dream waltz plays as each sleeps on,
							Oh, say you love me, dear!
						

						
						
							"I hold you near to me; you are my captive;
							And the mellow night is full of dew,
							And as the winking, sleepy stars
							Wink on, I dance with you.
						

						
							"Oh, say you love me, dear, while yet the music
							Still trembles through the waves of night,
							Your fallen curls creep o'er my face,
							And the house of life is light!
						

						
							"For o'er and o'er again this evening's dancing
							I'll dance with you in memory's hall,
							And feel your whispers on my cheek
							And the rebel curls that fall.
						

						
							"And when life's lonely way grows hard and narrow,
							And some great lord your hand shall sue,
							I'll then remember fondly still
							That I have danced with you."
						

						
							Instead, we talked of friends and dress and nothings;
							And the silent speech my heart had said
							Lay silent still, and the dance wore on,
							Till the dance and night were fled.
						

					


					
						WHILE A SEASON CHANGED

						
							WHILE a season changed I lingered in a strange city, filled with
								men and women and children, just as other cities;
						

						
							With buildings and trade and the petty histories of each, and the petty histories
								of families, preserved by word of lips;
						
						

						
							With nightly entertainments and spectacles, with actors and orators and pleasant
								singers, with ministers, with rich and poor, just as other cities;
						

						
							But all has passed out of me now except the still face of a solitary woman looking
								at me through the dim years.
						

					

					
						WHEN I COME HOME

						
							WHEN I come home will you be there to greet
							Me with a smile and outstretched arms,
							A heart of quickened beat,
							When our eyes meet?
						

						
							And will you tell me all your thoughts and deeds,
							As in the gloaming night again
							We take the path that leads
							O'er grassy meads?
						

						
							And as of old will you my grief beguile--
							The grief the weary days have brought?
							And will you make me smile
							With you the while?
						

						
							And as the mellow years come on, will you
							Remember still that love is young
							And fresh as morning dew
							For me and you?
						

						
							I'm coming home ere long to you who wait
							So patiently as seasons go,
							Beside the woodland gate
							In evenings late.
						

						
						
							In fancy's eye a thousand times I see
							You there with eager, anxious look
							That scans the rolling lea
							In search of me.
						

						
							I see you run into my arms at last,
							And feel the tremor of your lips.
							The world aside is cast,
							And care is past.
						

						
							I'm coming home ere long to you who wait
							So patiently as seasons go,
							Beside the woodland gate
							In evenings late.
						

					

					
						SONG

						
							THE night is here and through the sky the stars are creeping;
							The tired day has closed its door;
							My heart is sad and I am weeping,
							I see her face no more.
							"O stars," I cry, "send out within your golden gleaming
							This message to my only love.
							Perhaps she, too, is sitting dreaming,
							With eyes that look above:
							"Oh, here, dear heart, how oft I've sat in summer weather,
							Alone with stars and dreams of you!
							The stars will bring us yet together,
							Like dawn that's kissed with dew.
							"Although I know my wild heart's savage love will soften,
							None other shall I ever woo,
							And in the starry night yet often
							I'll breathe a prayer to you."
						

					


					

					
						AFTER THE DAY

						
							DRAW your chair beside me here,
							As in other times, my dear;
							Do not talk or even smile,
							Sit in silence for a while;
							Sweet contentment over all,
							As the shadows on us fall.
							'Tis the best of all my life,
							After each day's toil and strife,
							In the time of night and dew,
							Thus to sit alone with you.
						

					


					
						LET PASS

						
							LET pass, dear heart, let pass
							This pain, this brief distress that grieves thee so--
							These unkind words, and doubtful, glancing eyes,
							In which till now had shone but kindly looks;
							I say let pass the talk of talkers all.
							Not one still star of all the night knows aught
							Of their ill words, nor does the growing green
							In stilly woods where plays the summer sun,
							Nor shall the days that come to thee anon,
							Nor shall the gentle rain of summers nigh,
							Nor olden paths that sweetly greet thy feet.
							Thy soul's deep purposes they do not know;
							Or knowing, still they could not understand.
							Keep thou yet on the way thou lovest best,
							For none of all the world knows it as thou,
							And all the precious facts that are thy life.
							Therefore, this brief distress that grieves thee so,
							Let pass, dear heart, let pass.
						

					

					

					
						THE DEAD WIFE

						
							O THOU whose lips I've pressed in hush of night,
							Whose tiny hand has trembled in my own
							Beneath the talking boughs the wind has blown,
							Hid snugly from the evening's starry light--
							O thou, my all, why hast thou quit my sight?
							Thy straggling curls will no more touch my cheek,
							Thy voice and smile are gone where'er I seek
							With watchful eyes and my strong passion's might.
							If all my soul's deep grief thou now dost see,
							If thou dost know the lonely inward tears
							My heart hath shed along the saddened years,
							Break through thy silent doors to life and me,
							Who hourly watch and wait with trembling fears,
							Lest in the realm of death I know not thee.
						

					

					
						LOVE SOME ONE

						
							LOVE some one--in God's name love some one--for this is the bread
								of the inner life, without which a part of you will starve and die; and though you
								feel you must be stern, even hard, in your life of affairs, make for yourself at
								least a little corner, somewhere in the great world, where you may unbosom and be
								kind.
						

					
				
				
				
					The Crowded World

					

					

					
						THE CROWDED WORLD

						
							DEPART from me ye who are weary and heavy laden, for I am turmoil
								and distress. Who seeketh gold and the plaudits of men will find them in me, but who
								seeketh the things of the spirit will not find them in me. I am the battleground and
								the battle, the thunder of war, the cry of children. Who goeth in me must hasten and
								not tarry, for I am the riot of men. Towers of Babel build I, yet warm no
								hearth-stone for the human heart. I am careless of life, and whosoever looketh
								upward shall not long abide in me; for I am turmoil and distress and the riot of
								men.
						

					

					
						THE PARABLE OF THE SEA

						
							HE PUSHED his boat from the shore and laughed with the laughter
								of the sea. No desire of the sky was in his heart, only a strong man's love for the
								game of the lapping wave.
						

						
							And playful was the sea as a tigress with her cub; but he had known the teeth of
								angry waves, and he kept his eyes over the water.
						

						
							And as the gentle rocking changed to moving hills and valleys, and as the salt
								spray washed his face, and the lisp and swish of the sea turned to groans, still
								kept he his eyes over the water.
						

						
							And then, as if determined to embrace him, the monster angry grew; with frothy
								tendrils yearning up the sides of his boat; and the symphony of the sea broke loose
									 like the grating of the gates of hell; and a whir
								was in the wind; and a rain arose out of the sea; and he kept his eyes over the
								water.
						

						
							And after many strokes he reached the shore; and he laughed at the sea, and laughed
								over his triumph, for the frothy tendrils still yearned up the rocks where he bound
								fast his boat.
						

						
							And soon the whir went out of the wind, and the moving hills and valleys of the sea
								turned to still meadows, and peace lay over the water, and the sea waited.
						

						
							Then came forth another, a youth; and he lay in his bark that rocked nimbly with
								the rocking of the waves; and he rested and dreamed and, as the twilight turned to
								night, looked often at the stars, fashioning out of his desire a temple for the
								heart of man.
						

						
							The gentle swells murmured, singing to rest his soul, and filling with music the
								temple of his dream; and as time passed on he looked ever longer toward the sky and
								the stars.
						

						
							At last the murmuring sea, singing to rest his soul, and filling with music the
								temple of his dream, took him to herself, caressing him tenderly, kissing his cheek
								and stroking softly his body; and the foam of the sea was in his hair, and a weed of
								the sea lay on his breast.
						

						
							Then the sea ceased to murmur and gurgle and lisp and lap; and the stillness lying
								over the water was as a prayer; and the people of the sea gathered round him, and
								the universe was still as it was before time, and the sea waited.
						

					

					


					
						THERE WAS A YOUNG ARTIST

						
							THERE was a young artist once, and his heart was filled with
								love, and truth was on his lips, and he sought to do men good.
						

						
							He painted a picture called "The Love of the World"; but before he had finished, he
								sat often with hunger and went clad in the garments of want.
						

						
							At last the picture was finished, but there was no one to requite him either in
								love or gold.
						

						
							His friends knew he was only one of them, and they were sure he was not a great
								artist; and strangers knew not of him.
						

						
							And soon want laid its hand upon him, and the love in his heart turned to hate, and
								the truth on his lips turned to lies;
						

						
							For the God he had worshipped and trusted and leaned upon was dead or had forsaken
								him;
						

						
							And out of desperation he painted another picture, and also called it "The Love of
								the World," but in his heart he knew it was "The Hate of the World."
						

						
							But the lie was caught up by the people, and strangers came, and he had food and
								wherewith to clothe himself, and years went on, and he'prospered.
						

						
							Only a spark of the early artist lived in his heart; and often when he stood before
								the picture in the house of him who had bought it, he looked cautiously about, and
								if alone, drew himself up erect, and pronounced aloud the words, "The Hate of the
								World."
						

						

						
							And once standing so, and pronouncing the words aloud, he was overheard by his
								friend who had purchased the picture.
						

						
							And his friend besought him to speak the words no more, lest he be overheard, and
								the picture become valueless.
						

						
							But ever thereafter the owner himself saw "The Hate of the World" when he stood
								before the picture; and once he likewise pronounced the words aloud as he stood
								before it.
						

						
							And he likewise was overheard by a neighbor who chanced to be his guest; and so ere
								long all the people came to understand that the picture which they had loved was in
								fact "The Hate of the World."
						

						
							And each in his time, as he stood before it, pronounced the fatal words; and the
								people sought out the artist, and demanded to know why he had deceived them.
						

						
							Then brought he forth his first picture, which was indeed "The Love of the World";
								and when he told the people, they laughed at him, and believed him not. And some
								were for bruising his flesh, and some for taking his life, and others said, "We will
								drive him from the city."
						

						
							And they drove him from the city; and as he passed out the gate, and turned and
								looked over the buildings and the towers of the temples of justice and of God, he
								wept; for it was the city of his birth.
						

						
							And they burned his first picture before his eyes. And the magistrates of the city
								assembled, and forbade that there be painted any other picture, or carven any
								statue, lest the people be defiled.
						

					

					

					
						I KNOW

						
							AND will you put the verse aside
							Because you've tried
							To all the measure of your strength?
							And ask at length,
							Why should you follow words like these
							Which wish to please?
							And are you tired--your courage low?--
							I know.
						

						
							These words are dead, they clothe you not,
							Nor fill the lot
							Of pressing needs that steal your days
							Till evening's rays.
							You will not read--nor have the time?
							You say I rhyme
							With selfishness and pride aglow?
							I know.
						

						
							And true it is these words are dead;
							No cloth they spread,
							Nor shelter bring to you at night,
							Nor gold by light
							Of morning when perchance you stray
							So still away
							From strangers' doors in spirits low--
							I know.
						

						
							The strong man's hopeless work of years,
							His inward tears;
							The dying youth of her unwooed,
							Her solitude;
							The broken heart's unseen distress,
							Its sleeplessness;
							The honored now dishonored so--
							I know.
						

						


						
							Where'er you are, though far or near,
							I'd bring you cheer;
							And you of full-blown maiden's grace,
							 And you of face
							All warped and drawn in time's caprice,
							I'd bring you peace.
							In secret longing all you go--
							I know.
						

						
							I've dined in good men's gracious halls;
							I've heard the calls
							Of lonely fishers where I slept
							And waters crept
							Along the barren banks of need.
							I've piped the reed,
							And broken love's sad music low
							I know.
						

						
							To you who walk in shadows dark
							And keenly hark
							For kindly words if but to live,
							Myself I give,
							My life and all my heart and hand
							Here where I stand.
							'Tis thus that both our lives will grow
							I know.
						

						
							I bring but this one common thought
							My life has wrought;
							That from the dregs of drear despair
							Still everywhere
							There is a joy I yet may sip--
							'Tis comradeship
							With all mankind, the high and low
							I know.
						

					


					

					
						O PASSER-BY

						
							O PASSER-BY, O passer-by!
							Have you good words of me
							Upon your lips as I draw nigh
							To you each day?
							If so, I ask
							That you'd them say,
							For soon I'm gone and cannot hear,
							So speak the kindly word
							I beg, and smile while yet I'm near.
							I'd speak to you,
							If courage came,
							And I quite knew
							You'd take the love my heart oft sends,
							And give me yours as well.
							O passer-by, come, let's be friends!
							Life's smiles and tears
							And happiness
							And childish fears
							Are mine, just like your own each day,
							(You understand, I know.)
							So come and let's be friends, I say.
						

					


					
						YOU WHO WRANGLE WITH ME AT THE MART

						
							YOU who see the stern side of me, you who wrangle with me at the
								mart, discussing prices with me, pro and con--do not condemn me.
						

						
							I do not condemn you, for you are a chattel like myself, answering the necessities
								of the day--you who wrangle with me at the mart.
						

						

						

							Underneath the wrinkled face, you have to me a gentle face, and between the rough
								words, I hear your other voice--kind and low;
						

						
							This I shall remember, forgetting all else; for this shall I hear again; and by
								this, in the glow of another dawn, shall I know you.
						

					

					
						BROKEN VETERAN OF COMMERCIAL WARS

						
							AFTER the smoke and roaring and desolation of the battle of
								middle life,
						

						
							After long marches and countermarches, privation, dreary, godless skies, and
								speechless weariness,
						

						
							After changes and the death of the beloved and all who knew you in your youth,
						

						
							Will you, broken veteran of commercial wars, turn again to the green fields of your
								youth?
						

						
							And though the spoils of war be yours, once more, with the simplicity of childhood,
								will you plant love in your heart,
						

						
							Grow gentle and walk again with God over the olden hills and by the still flowing
								waters,
						

						
							And be pleased once more to be innocent in your desires and to grow sweetly tender
								in your heart--you, you, broken veteran of commercial wars?
						

					

					

					
						A VISIT TO A MAN OF FAME

						
							THUS spoke he: If you expect perfection in this world, you are
								condemned. In my youth I saw the golden city of joy just before me--always just
								before me.
						

						
							Oh, it was beautiful! It was winter and night was coming on, and a young woman was
								looking out of a door now and then. A bright fire sparkled and gave life to the
								room. A baby slept in a white bed; the evening meal was laid. There was a bird in a
								cage and a dog lying by the fire. I said the woman looked out now and then.
								Stillness, gentleness, light and warmth breathed through the scene in contrast with
								the dark and cold outside; and strange, this never, never changed: it was always
								winter and night was coming on, and always quiet and peaceful, warmth and light, and
								always a young woman looking out of the door now and then.
						

						
							And every day I prayed inwardly that I might know the love of this vision; and in
								my credulous youth I trusted the great God, Him of the sky sown with stars and the
								sun and the moon.
						

						
							But I never knew the room and the woman and the child and the cheering glow and the
								peace. I was always behind the carnival of silver and gold; and who would know love
								must be in the midst of the carnival, for it is the age of the carnival of silver
								and gold. And the vision remained the counterfeit coinage of my brain, a lure in the
								soul, as you poets say, something like music one thinks one hears in the night.
						

						


						
							Now I am an old man, and now I am in the midst of the carnival of silver and gold,
								and the dancers dangle round me, and there are women-so many women, good and
								beautiful; but I have no desire, the fruit of my labor has ripened, but the leaves
								of the tree of passion are dead; the dream is spent, the heart hunger forgot, and I
								lie like a shell on the shore of time, awaiting a wave that shall wash me to
								sea.
						

					

					
						TO-MORROW

						
							HOW oft you've said to-morrow
							Is time enough to speak a gentle word
							To one whose olden friendship time had blurred
							And set to naught sweet trysts of other years,
							When life and love and faith were pledged with tears
							That flowed as others' griefs you heard--
							To-morrow you intend to speak the word.
						

						
							In discontent, to-morrow
							Is then the golden day when you have thought
							To build the temple which in dreams you'd wrought
							So beautiful that aged men would say
							With pride they knew you in their childhood's day.
							Though old ambitions come to naught,
							To-morrow is the golden time you've thought.
						

						
							When worn with care, to-morrow
							You'll change your course for one which steals away
							To quiet lands where cooling shadows stray,
							And sunbeams tremble on the placid green,
							Far off in some forgotten olden scene;
							And there as once you'll rest and play.
							To-morrow you are going far away.
						

						
						
							In childhood scenes, to-morrow
							With long embrace your heart will melt like snow,
							Close by the Mother's heart whose love you know.
							Those lips from which the rose is gone will press
							Your joyous, tearful cheek with mild caress.
							Again she'll speak in accents low.
							To-morrow you will kiss the brow of snow.
						

						
							Art lonely? Then to-morrow
							You'll freely yield your aching heart the time
							To weave some love romance of purest rhyme.
							With throbbing heart at fall of silent night
							You'll speed to one who waits by evening light,
							With thoughts uplifted and sublime.
							To-morrow you will yield your heart the time.
						

						
							When age has come, to-morrow
							You'll speak with God to leave some kindly deeds
							Writ by your name that softened selfish creeds
							Of man's slow moving love of brotherhood,
							That brought new hope to them who near you stood
							In life's dark streets or sunlit meads.
							To-morrow you'll ask God for better deeds.
						

						
							To-morrow,O to-morrow!
							Fast fall the fading years. A thought, a dream
							Of gentle words; of faith and love a theme;
							A smile, a step or two, and all is done.
							Quick is the veering stream of life full run;
							Yet in the crimson west still gleam
							To-morrow and to-morrow's endless dream.
						

					

					

					
						THE HATE AND THE LOVE OF THE WORLD

						
							I HAVE seen men binding their brothers in chains, and crafty
								traders reaching for the bread that women and babes lifted to their mouths;
						

						
							I have seen merciless greed extracting yet the last pittance from the defenseless
								and weak;
						

						
							I have seen suffering go unaided, and known the stinging malice of them I
								loved;
						

						
							I have heard the iron din of war, and have seen the waxen face of early death;
						

						
							And I have cried in my heart, "the world is hate!"
						

						
							I have heard birds calling their mates in the still forests, and insects chirping
								to their loves in the tangled grass of meadows;
						

						
							I have seen mothers caressing their babes, and aged men supporting with devotion
								the slow steps of stooping women;
						

						
							I have seen cheerful hearthstones surrounded by laughing children and strong men
								and sweet women;
						

						
							I have heard the tender words of lovers in the pure passion of youth;
						

						
							And I have cried in my heart, "the world is love!"
						

					

					

					
						OFTEN IN THE CROWDED MART

						
							THOUGH changed as are my songs from youth,
							A voice within my heart still sings,
							"Live thou in tenderness and truth,
							And love mankind instead of things."
							And often in the crowded mart,
							With wrangling, selfish slaves of men,
							These words like some old song will start,
							And bring me to myself again.
						

					

					
						IN THE HOSPITAL

						
							NO ONE has come to me to-day,
							And night is almost here;
							And as the world grows hard within
							The world without grows dear.
						

						
							O beautiful world of green and gold,
							Of bloom and blossom gay,
							Of laughter, health and perfect sleep,
							O take me back some day!
						

						
							O take me back! I still am young,
							And still would know the sweet
							Of lover's whisper in the dawn,
							When lips on lips shall meet.
						

						
							I still would hear a woman's voice
							By quiet evening light,
							And plans repeated o'er and o'er,
							And last a sweet good-night.
						

						

						
							O beautiful world of green and gold!
							I now resign to fate,
							While evening shadows softly fall,
							And I lie still and wait.
						

					

					
						IF YOU HAVE MADE GENTLER THE CHURLISH WORLD

						
							IF YOU have spoken something beautiful,
							Or touched the dead canvas to life,
							Or made the cold stone to speak--
							You who know the secret heart of beauty;
							If you have done one thing
							That has made gentler the churlish world,
							Though mankind pass you by,
							And feed and clothe you grudgingly--
							Though the world starve you,
							And God answer not your nightly prayers,
							And you grow old hungering still at heart,
							And walk friendless in your way,
							And lie down at last forgotten--
							If all this befall you who have created beauty,
							You shall still leave a bequest to the world
							Greater than institutions and rules and commerce;
							And by the immutable law of human heart
							The God of the universe is your debtor,
							If you have made gentler the churlish world.
						

					

					
						A TRADESMAN AND A POET

						
							"Do THESE things pay--these poems that you write?"
						

						
							"Oh! yes, so much I am almost ashamed Of my reward, so very great it is."
						

						

						
							"Then tell me why you are so poorly dressed?"
						

						
							"I did not know that I was poorly dressed."
						

						
							"Indeed you are. And think of how you live. You should have blooming gardens,
								houses grand, If your reward is great as you have said. I understand you live in
								three small rooms."
						

						
							"And that is two too many, I'm afraid."
						

						
							"You do not travel. Do you travel, sir?"
						

						
							"Oh! yes, I go each week into the woods, And often sit upon the river bank."
						

						
							"You are not loved by any woman, sir; And have you any children of your own?"
						

						
							"I love all women, every child is mine."
						

						
							"Come, come, these poems do not pay, I know."
						

						
							"Oh! yes, they pay me very well, indeed."
						

						
							"Then what have you been doing with the pay Received? Have you some secret
								investments?"
						

						
							"Yes, yes! I have some secret investments."
						

						
							"Oh! that is very different. Oh, yes!"
						

					


					
						THE HOUSE OF FORTUNE

						
							IF YOU are young, sympathetic, poor, ambitious and honest, it
								were easier for you if you had died a babe in your mother's arms.
						

						
							For the citadels of fortune are climbed by them that ask no question of right and
								wrong, and are not much  moved by the tender touch of
								love. And this is what is called worldly wisdom.
						

						
							But you, if you are poor and love your fellow-men, the gilded doorway of the house
								of fortune is closed to you; and you will look with moistened eyes and hunger in
								your heart till the evening shadows of your last day, yet will it not open.
						

						
							And here is the triumph: to stand cheerfully outside and serve, though the coveted
								doorway open ever and anon to them of lesser virtue; and to grow old meanwhile, with
								face turned toward the golden west, watching the last sunset, loving, hoping and
								believing still; and through the shadows of the falling night, to see yet a few of
								the faces of youth's old dreams still luring us onward and onward.
						

						
							After all, perhaps this is to have entered the doorway, and to have dwelt in the
								house of fortune.
						

					

					
						AS I RETURNED TO THE DIM OF MY STUDY

						
							YOU pallid-faced person with the book under your arm, you with
								eyes that look far away, and you with eyes that look in, sitting nightly by your
								lamp--
						

						
							You who daily browse in libraries and dusty bookshops--is it an explanation of the
								cosmic wheels you seek? I, too, with rapture have searched in libraries, touching
								this volume, scanning that, and pondering long over yet another.
						

						
							Oh! with what a throbbing heart have I implored the pages to yield their wisdom to
								me! No speech can explain the unworldly joy that was in me, while I pursued the
								thoughts of one the world had dubbed an immortal seer.
						

						
						
							And at last, having mastered the thought, I cried to the great God in thanks for my
								joy. Had He not made me a confidant of His wisdom? Was I not also now a keeper of
								immortal truth?
						

						
							How I have walked in the sunlight with an air of superior knowledge, questioning
								the advantage of further study!
						

						
							Poor fool!
						

						
							The awakening--the terrible awakening to find that I had been dreaming day and
								night for months, to find that my immortal seer was not the only immortal seer, that
								he was no seer at all, to find that another held the secrets of God whispered from
								on high!
						

						
							The second cry of ecstasy was less joyous, the third still less, the fourth still
								less, until at last there was no more ecstasy, distrust pricking me like a
								thorn.
						

						
							But now I know the greater wisdom; for pursuing one night the last pages of the
								last metaphysician who would teach me what he knew not himself, I heard a child
								crying in the dark,
						

						
							And I sought out the child in the dark, and carried it on my shoulder to the love
								from which it had wandered. And on my return, I passed a house where there was
								laughter, and music, and dancing;
						

						
							And farther on, under the light of a lamp, one called me by name, and took my hand,
								and pressed it in his own, and spoke kindly;
						

						
							And as I returned to my metaphysician, in the dim of my study, I smiled; for I saw
								that the thing I sought was in me, and in the child, and in the dancers, and in him
								who took me by the hand.

						THE OLD MAGNOLIA TREE

						(A Tale of South Carolina)

						
							"YOU want to see some one?" the lady said,
							As an old, bent darky lifted up his head
							From out his hands; and rising from the door,
							Came slowly toward her, for she said no more,
							And stopped inside the gate to know his will.
							The spacious lawn and house within were still;
							For empty was the place, some weeks had passed,
							Or maybe months and weeks, since tenants last
							Had trod the rooms that now lay grim and bare.
							Upon the lawn were trees, palmetto, pear,
							And evergreen, and near the fence there stood
							An old magnolia tree of scented wood;
							Long years the burning Carolina sun
							Had met its leaves where boys now men had run.
							Deep cracked and old, four mighty pillars sent
							Their tops to meet an arched roof that bent
							And leaned. And yet some recent art not mean
							With color made the house look bright and clean.
							"You want to see some one?" the lady said,
							The silvery-haired old negro bowed his head,
							And coming near with salutations dumb,
							He finally replied, "Ah does, yes um."
							And bowing on with many side steps slow
							And questioning smiles and trembling voice still low:
							"Is you de one dat's gwine to move into
							Dis house dat's made so fine, please, Miss, is you?
							Ah's lived heah long 'fo' you was born, ah guess--
							Please, Miss, de dog a-tryin' tear your dress.
							Ah's only lived one place 'cept jes' right heah;

							

							Mas' Hambleton fetched me from way down fah
							Sabannah rivah--Hambleton--yes um.
							Ah watch de chores an' does whatevah come."
							The lady was the minister's good wife,
							But lately come to guard the spiritual life
							That parish held far down the Congaree,
							In sunny Carolina, 'mid a sea
							Of white-capped cotton fields now fresh o'errun,
							Immaculate beneath the Southern sun.
							He might stay, the lady said, and do the chores,
							And mow the lawn, and mind the outer doors,
							And water flowers, and trim the trees, with all
							There'd be enough until each evening's fall.
							And so he stayed, this darky old, and said
							But little as the burning days turned red
							In evening's hour, and did his work all well
							And kindly, with a mind that did not dwell
							In hesitation on the longest task;
							Nor for a single half-day's rest did ask,
							As months went on in that hot Southern clime,
							Until again 'twas cotton picking time.
							And now the minister's good wife called him,
							As oft, while day at east was growing dim,
							And said, "To-morrow rake the leaves to burn,
							For now it is the cooler season's turn;
							And I think, too, the old magnolia tree
							You might cut down, and then you come to me;
							And there next spring we'll make a flower bed."
							He smiled and bowed, "Yes um, yes um," he said.
							He raked the lawn and raked and raked yet more,
							Until it looked like one vast velvet floor;
							But swung no ax into that dying tree,
							And sat beneath its limbs content and free
							Till evening late, still humming some old song,

							

							And thus a week and days soon slipped along.
							The minister's good wife called him once more,
							And standing in the mighty pillared door,
							She said, "You haven't cut that tree down yet--
							The old magnolia near the fence; don't let
							Me see it there this time to-morrow eve";
							And with these earnest words she turned to leave.
							"Please, Miss, de ole tree make a lot o' shade
							When de sun all day a-shinin' hot an' raid."
							"Oh--no, I think not much; fell it to-morrow."
							"Yes um," he said, as if his heart knew sorrow.
							To-morrows and to-morrows quickly came,
							The old magnolia tree still stood the same.
							Once it was an ax he lacked, and then
							His back was feeble, and he asked again
							A few days yet to do the task, and said,
							As before, "Yes um," and humbly bowed his head.
							And so the torrid Southern summer passed,
							And solemn, cooler evenings came at last;
							And now the good wife's o'ertaxed patience failed,
							And once again the old negro she hailed,
							And once again demanded--would he fell
							The tree, or would he then and there dare tell
							That this command he had no mind to heed,
							"It's but an old o'ergrown and dying weed,
							I'll have it cut; if you have not the will
							Or strength for it, there are some others still.
							I'll have it down--to-morrow--by this hour!"
							With these sharp words his form began to cower,
							And o'er his face now old with years of life
							There spread the signs of grieving, inward strife.
							"Well, well, and what reply have you?" she said;
							The old black man raised up his silvery head,
							And turned his kindly eyes upon her face,

							

							Where shone the power of that other race.
							"Don' talk like dat," and then he paused until
							His timid heart was mastered by his will.
							"Dem buds now turnin' white an' bloomin', Miss;
							An' when de wind it tetch 'em wid a kiss,
							Dey smell so sweet. Ah's seed 'em bloom up dah
							Along 'fo' you was born or come down heah."
							She tossed her head and with a woman's frown,
							"To-morrow morn, I say, it shall be down!"
							"No, Miss, ma good ole Missus she done plan'
							Dat tree when de war was los', an ah--ah can'
							Cut ut down. Young Mas' he nevah love young Missus
							At furse, she jes' a-grievin' for his kisses,
							Bofe pa'nts say dey should marry, an' dey did.
							Sometimes young Mas' to Cha'leston goes an' hid
							Fu' days, an' half de niggers sta'ts to hunt,
							An' den he talks to Miss so cross an' blunt
							When he comes back, po' Miss she cry and cry,
							An' den get sick till Mas' afeared she die."
							Impatient with his tale of times far gone,
							The woman raised her hand, yet he went on.
							"But when de baby Mary come, young Mas'
							He change an' love young Miss and hole her fas'
							In bofe his ahms an' kiss her evah day,
							An' kiss de lid'le baby, too, an' say
							He nevah, nevah know what babies for--
							Dat--dat was 'fo' de war--'fo' de war.
							An' ole Mas', too, an' good ole Missus bofe,
							Dey laugh an' cry wid joy fu' days, and loaf
							'Round young Mas' house, an' quarrel wid Ann de nurse,
							'Cause each one wan' to hole de baby furse;
							An' jump around wid ut an' laugh and dance--
							Ole Mas' an' Missus dem--dem young Mas' pa'nts.
							Den d'rectly say de war a-gwine come on,

							

							Ole Mas' an' young Mas' bofe to Cha'leston gone,
							A-sayin', 'You take kyar ma babe and Miss,'
							An' ride away, an' from dat day to dis
							Ah ain't seed him no mo', but ole Mas' he
							Come back, a bullet hole shot fru his knee;
							An' mos' de heartless niggers runs away
							An' leave Miss an' de baby, but ah stay.
							De lid'le baby Mary, she grow fas',
							An' 'fo' we know free summahs dey done pass,
							An' den one night de wind blow fierce and loud.
							Dey say de blue-coats heah, a mighty crowd,
							Gen' Sherman's ahmy come from up de sea;
							De cannons roar, de houses burn, and we--
							We scared to deaf--de niggers, whites, an' all;
							In fron' de house we hear de devils call,
							A-sayin', 'Bu'n ut down and dem inside'
							De barns a-smokin' whah de niggers hide,
							De sky all raid wid flames like blood--de shrieks
							De women folks a-makin' as dey seeks
							To hide--de white an' black, no dif'ence now!
							De babe she lay on Miss's breast, her brow
							A-burnin' wid de fevah. Now dey come,
							Like mad men drunk fu' human blood, an' some
							A-wavin' torches run inside de gate,
							Ah jumps clean fru de window, an' says, 'Wait!
							Dah's a babe inside dat's sick an' nigh to deaf!'
							Seem like dat crowd of blue-coats hole dah breaf,
							Some come a-runnin' 'round whah ah was sayin'
							Ut ovah--ovah 'g'in while dey was stayin'.
							One shouts, 'We gwine set all you niggers free!'
							Ah shouts, 'Ah is, you needn' stay fu' me!'
							Den on ma head a knock--ag'in--once mo',
							Ah reels, a-stagg'rin' retch out fu' de do',
							An' drap right down and hears ma Massa say,

							

							'Take kyar ma babe an' Miss,' an' ride away.
							One beside de captain shouts, 'De house! de house!'
							'Stan' back!' he say, an' dey was still as a mouse.
							An' as ah turn, dah in de torches' light,
							Stan' Miss an' de babe, like angels dressed in white;
							An' de sound of marchin' seem to die away,
							An' da'kness come a-fallin' whah ah lay,
							An' seem like summah time a-long ago,
							An' winds a-blowin' fru de trees so low,
							Like fa' off music from de crooked lane
							Whah cabins stand along de fields o' cane,
							And whah de niggers dance an' sing an' sing
							Till stars a-wavin' an' de valleys ring.
							Ah soon wakes up, but de babe she gone to res'
							Dat winter night, asleep on Miss's breas'.
							We bury her one morn, young Miss an' me,
							Dah by de fence whah she could always see
							De place her baby Mary sleep so still.
							An' when de springtime come ah makes a hill
							Besides de grabe; an' Miss, so po' an' white,
							She drap a seed, den fol' her hands up tight,
							An' raise her eyes to de evenin' sky, an' pray
							To herself-like, den aloud an' slow she say,
							'Lawd, bring fort' de tender leaf from out de ground,
							An' let de years spread branches fa' around,
							An' let de tree live on in place de dead.'
							She drap her hands, an' dat was all she said.
							De years dey come, an' creepin' past dey go,
							An' from de seed dat same magnolia grow.
							Young Miss she soon turn ole an' put away;
							Ah only an' dat tree is heah to stay.
							Sometimes it seem to talk; an' evah breeze
							At night finds dis ole body on uts knees,
							An' dah de sound of whisp'rin' leaves above

							

							Seem like de voices ole of dem ah love;
							An' evah mornin' 'fo' you's up ah hears
							De warbler sing so sweet it fetch de tears;
							An' in de risin' sunlight of' ah see
							Young Miss an' de babe sit dah beneaf dat tree,
							An' thinks ah hear young Mas' a-callin' say,
							'Take kyar ma babe and Miss!' and ride away."
						

					

					
						JEFF

						(The Story of a Horse)


						
							A SOUTHERN city on an autumn day--
							Ten years and more the war had passed away--
							A street where men and loaded wagons stand;
							And coming slowly through that street of sand
							A load of wood drawn by a horse that's lean
							And old. The driver with a savage mien
							Now swiftly lashes him, again, again;
							He sways as struggling for his life, and then
							An aged darky standing by cries out,
							"You stop, white gem'man; Lawd, what you about!
							Dat po' ole hoss, he ain' done you no harm."
							The angered driver grasps the negro's arm.
						

						
							Let go ma wrist; don' pull dat way;
							You crack ma bones--let go, ah say!
							'Cause don' you see ma head is white,
							An' ah ain' got no strength to fight
							White gem'man; now ah say let go!
							Ah tol' you not to whip him so.
							Ah seed you do ut of' befo',
							A-standin' in ma cabin do',
							Until ah is dat ole hoss Jeff,

							

							An' all de sense ah got done lef
							Ma head. White gem'man, you can' blame
							Ole Jeff, 'cause he is po' an' lame;
							An' he can' pull like young hoss kin,
							His ribs a-stickin' fru his skin.
							What! Does ah know dat hoss's name?
							As sho' as ef mine was de same.
							A heap o' times ah strides his back,
							Long 'fo' he knowd de cruel whip's crack,
							An' of ah rub him till he shine
							Wid dapples like a melon rin'.
							Dat's ma ole Massa's hoss--dat's Jeff.
							De war begin', ole Mas' he lef';
							De bugles call, de drums roll on;
							Ole Missus cry; an' dey bofe gone,
							Ole Mas' an' Jeff a-carryin' him;
							Ah watch 'em till ma eyes grow dim.
							Den months go by. One day at las'
							We gits a letter dat was pass'
							Along de line and give to me,
							A-sayin' dat ole Massa he
							Is gwine to 'rive not fa' away,
							An' dat fu' me to come an' stay
							Wid him, an' ride as fas' ah kin,
							Jes' like a race hoss gwine to win.
							De letter make po' Missus cry.
							Dat's all it say, 'cept jes' "Good-bye."
							Po' Missus fearin' dat he lay
							Wid fevah, sent me off dat day;
							A-sayin', "Go, now go as fas'
							As wind, till you fin' him at las',
							An' stay until de war is fru;
							Don' come back 'lone, ah say to you!"
							Away till da'k, an' nevah slow,

							

							Ah ride an' ride like winds dat blow;
							An' on agin at breakin' day,
							Ah nevah stops 'cept to find de way,
							An' 'cept when white boys calls to as',
							"Say, niggah, whah you ridin' so fas'?"
							Ah tells 'em, den ah gallops on
							Till da'kness come an' daylight gone.
							De evenin' of de second day
							Ah finds de place ole Massa say;
							But noffin dar 'cept jes' de light
							Of stars a-winkin' in de night.
							Folks say de army norfward gone;
							Ah takes de road at breakin' dawn,
							An' swings de reins an' lets 'er go;
							Dat hoss do somehow surely know
							Ole Massa sent fu' us to come.
							We pass de fiel's an' houses, some
							Whah lights a-gleamin' seem to say,
							"Ride fas' 'cause soon anothah day
							Is heah an' you ain' foun' ole Massal"
							Ah tells dat hoss an' he go fassa.
							Den soon he stop, fro up his ears;
							De furse time in ma life ah hears
							De stranges' kind o' poppin' soun'.
							Ah swings de reins an' de noise is drown';
							But as ah gallop all de while
							De soun' gits loudah evah mile,
							Jes' pop an' crack an' crash an' pop,
							Seems like ut nevah gwine to stop.
							Ah hears de cannons roar an' groan,
							A terrible loud an' mockin' moan;
							Ah sees de smoke rise to de sky,
							An' hears de bullets whistlin' by;
							Ah pass some men a-runnin' roun'

							

							Attendin' wounded on de groun'.
							An' den ah 'quired, but none can tell
							Me whah Mas' is. Ah's feared he fell
							'Fo' now, an' lay among de dead;
							'Cause whah ah as' dey shakes dar head.
							Ah mounts a hill, an' plain as day
							Ah sees de bluecoats an' de gray.
							Ah looks fu' Massa dar below,
							Whah human bodies seem to flow
							In smoke an' flame; an' noise like dat
							Ah nevah hears. Some fallin' flat
							An' don' git up; de livin' runs
							O'er dead an' bleedin', shootin' guns;
							An' bullets singin' songs of deaf
							Nigh takes away ma stagger'n breaf.
							Dar somewhah in dat hell ah knows
							Ole Massa is among de foes.
							De lines dey swing an' reel an' swing,
							De cannons groan, de bullets sing;
							An' now de graycoats fallin' back,
							Dar flag drap down, an' in dar track
							De bluecoats press like flames o' hell
							Right o'er de backs of dem dat fell.
							An' now de graycoats turn an' rally;
							An' down de middle of de valley,
							A big white hoss like sto'm winds sail,
							Right whah de whizzin' bullets hail
							In fron' dat flame-line' road to deaf--
							It's Massa on de white hoss Jeff!
							He lifts de flag an' sta'ts ahead
							Into dat wall of fire an' lead.
							De graycoats follow wid a yell;
							An' all de roarin' seem like hell
							Broke fru de groun'; an' in de smoke

							

							Dat's red wid flame, at evah stroke
							Dat white hoss Jeff crowd on an' on.
							He drap to his knees, an' up an' gone,
							Again he drap, an' rise de same.
							An' now behin' a wall of flame
							Seem like a million bluecoats come.
							De gray a-drappin' dead an' dumb,
							On evah side dey fallin' back,
							A-leavin' wounded in dar track;
							De bluecoats charge like a hurricane
							Right o'er de wounded an' de slain.
							An' in dat bloody roar of deaf
							Ole Massa wheels around dat Jeff
							To save his life, 'cause all is los'.
							An' evah ridah on his hoss

							As 'roun' ma ears de bullets whiz.
							Ah mounts ma hoss an' lets 'im go;
							An' as ah look aroun' jes' so,
							Here comes dat Jeff an' ma ole Massa.
							Ah nevah sees a hoss go fassa,

							Ah spurs ma hoss in dat ride o' deaf,
							To keep ma eyes on Mass an' Jeff,
							Ole Missus' words, "Stay by his side,"
							Ring in ma ear as on ah ride.
							An' fru dat fores' we jes' fly,
							An' some a-drappin' off to die;

							Beneaf de bluecoat's losses' feet.
							O' fiel's an' fence an' log an' lane
							Whah cotton grows an' sugar-cane,
							'Neaf trees we dodge each bendin' limb,

							

							As fas' ah rides, ma eyes on him

							Ah looks ag'in an' dey bofe gone.
							'Dar ain' no time to stop an' fin'
							Ole Mass an' Jeff, 'cause jes' behin'
							De bluecoats comin' like a cloud
							Of flyin' flame an' smoke; an' loud
							De raspin' rattle pain ma soul
							Fu Jeff an' Massa, gray an' ole.
							Ah turns an' turns, but don' see him
							An' Jeff no mo,' ma sight grow dim.
							A crack--ma arm--ah knows ah's hit!
							Ah staggers some, but tight ah sit
							An' spurs; fu' miles dey po' de lead
							Into our back an' side an' head.
							Ah turns to lef" an' down a hill,
							An' hides ma hoss inside a mill;
							Den waits, an' hears de awful cry
							Of all de bluecoats ridin' by.
							What ef dey stop, ah holds ma breaf;
							Still on dey come in dat ride o' deaf,
							But dey don' stop, an' all grow still
							'Cept poppin' sounds fa' down de hill.
							An' now an' den some stragglers pass,
							Until ah surely finks de las'

							'Cept jes' a mou'nful evenin' breeze,
							Ah guides ma hoss back fru de trees;
							Ole Missus' words, as on ah ride,
							Ring in ma ears, "Stay by his side--
							Stay by him till de war is fru,

							

							Don' come back 'lone, ah say to you."
							An' many times on bended knee
							Each dead man's face ah search to see
							If it ma Massa; till de light
							Of day all gone, an' lonesome night
							Spread o'er de groun' an' trees about.
							An' aftah while de stars come out
							All still, jes' like dat dey look down,
							An' look an' look upon de groun',
							Whah many lays dat long ago
							In playful childhood use' to know
							Some tendah arms dat held 'em tight
							An' lips dat pressed dar own each night.
							Ma hoss he stumble 'long de way.
							Den jes' dat sudden-like he neigh,
							An' neigh ag'in! den evahthing
							All still 'cept jes' de wind dat sing.
							He stop an' prick his ears up high;
							Seem like something is standin' nigh--
							A-standin' jes' along our way.
							Anothah hoss begins to neigh.
							Ah sees dat we ain' all alone,
							Ma hoss a-standin' still like stone.
							Den gives a lunge an' plunge an' boun',
							An' quick as dat drags me aroun'
							De trees an' logs, like he ma boss,
							An' stops in fron' dat othah hoss.
							Dat othah hoss don' make no soun';
							His rider flat upon de groun',
							De stirrup holdin' one foot fas',
							De othah lyin' in de grass.
							Ah strikes a match--ah holds ma breaf--
							It's Massa an' de white hoss Jeff!
							Old Massa's face like wax so white.

							

							Ah loads him on dat hoss, an' tight
							Ah ties him 'cross his back; den step
							By step all fru dat woods we crep',
							Jes' like a funeral in de da'k.
							De stars look down as if to ha'k
							Ag'in an' see what we about.
							Long time pass, den de sun come out
							An' spread de daylight all 'roun',
							As on an' on we homeward boun'.
							Ole Missus nearly die. Ole Mass
							He laid away. De war gone pas',
							An' men don' kill each othah, an'
							Jes' poverty is in de lan'.
							Ole Missus she done sell nigh all
							We got 'cept Jeff. An den one fall
							She sell him, too; but ah done keeps
							Ma eyes on him dat of'en weeps
							When some his owners treats him bad;
							An' when dey treats him good ah's glad
							Jes' like a chil'. See heah, kin' man,
							Dat Jeff hoss done got ole; he can'
							Do much mo' work. Ah give you dis
							Heah watch fu' him; an' you won' miss
							Him none. You will? an' it's a trade?
							Lawd, it's de bes' ah evah made!
							Same as you loves your chil' or wife,
							Ah loves dat hoss jes' like ma life.
							Dey all done gone away, you see,
							'Cept jes' us two, ole Jeff an' me.
							An' ah ain' nevah done agwine
							To part from him no mo'. He mine,
							Ah his, an' we bofe ole an' bent;
							'Fo' long we gwine whah Massa went.

							

							He led his horse away, and sidewise stepped
							And smiled, so happy that he almost wept.
							That night he fed him such a meal as fit
							The horses of a king, and long did sit
							By him and talk of good old times gone past,
							And always of the master first and last;
							And soon he closed his eyes in sleep, and then
							Within his dreams he lived his life again.

						A PRAYER

						
							LET me do my work each day; and if the darkened hours of despair
								overcome me, may I not forget the strength that comforted me in the desolation of
								other times. May I still remember the bright hours that found me walking over the
								silent hills of my childhood, or dreaming on the margin of the quiet river, when a
								light glowed within me, and I promised my early God to have courage amid the
								tempests of the changing years. Spare me from bitterness and from the sharp passions
								of unguarded moments. May I not forget that poverty and riches are of the spirit.
								Though the world know me not, may my thoughts and actions be such as shall keep me
								friendly with myself. Lift my eyes from the earth, and let me not forget the uses of
								the stars. Forbid that I should judge others, lest I condemn myself. Let me not
								follow the clamor of the world, but walk calmly in my path. Give me a few friends
								who will love me for what I am; and keep ever burning before my vagrant steps the
								kindly light of hope. And though age and infirmity overtake me, and I come not
								within sight of the castle of my dreams, teach me still to be thankful for life, and
								for time's olden memories that are good and sweet; and may the evening's twilight
								find me gentle still.
						

					
					
						AN ARTIST'S PRAYER

						
							LORD God, Thou who dost paint with magic touch
							The curtains of the soft and silent night,
							This gift I ask, that o'er whatever cloth
							My brush may glide, now to and fro and round,

							

							There will come that which ever pleases Thee;
							For surely Thou dost love the good of men.
							Help me to make the things that beauty hold
							Amid these veering lines and diverse shades,
							That cheer will bring to sad and solemn men
							And tired women in their dreary haunts,
							That youth will not forget on highways hard
							With troubled years, when somber night is on,
							And when no kindly light leads through the way,
							That joy and love may dawn like newborn days
							In hearts where long the chambers have been dark.
							Let lowly life and dusty daily toil
							Come near me evermore and day by day,
							That I forget not them that still are kind
							Though tried by years of unrequited toil,
							Alas! and sometimes want and age and pain.
							Let me not love my pictures more than men,
							Nor follow the wild lead of some mad dream,
							Nor see myself as if above the crowd
							Commanding that they all bow low their heads;
							Instead, with kindly heart and gentle hand
							And smiles upon my face, let me serve them
							Whose muscles ache in evening's twilight hour,
							While mine in comfort still are fresh and strong.
							May all these be not empty, idle words,
							But all the burden of my life's sweet task.
							And when Thou seest that my work is done,
							Let me feel Thy soft evening shadows fall,
							As when I climbed into my nursery bed
							With childish faith, in time's old long ago;
							And let the kiss of peace lie on my lips.
						

					
					
					
						AN EASTER PRAYER

						
							RESURRECT Thou the dreams and songs and love that enchanted the
								garden of my youth, filled with the joys of a thousand hopes in the still morning's
								twilight, and dawning visions in the shadowed, starry night. As the kindly earth
								yields forth each spring her budding brood, so in the barren winter of my heart may
								there bloom again the rose of sweet content.
						

						
							O'er the din of the world and the strife of men, let rise the symphonies of eternal
								peace. Resurrect them that slumber in graves of gold; and deliver humanity from
								those cruel conventions that are but the husks of virtue. Make kindness king, and
								teach us that good deeds are greater than philosophy. To tired men that daily tread
								the crowded streets, give Thou a place of sweet repose at night; and fill with love
								the hearts of lonely women. Bring forth sweet babes from out the arms of each, to
								light with joy the byways of the earth.
						

						
							Thou great God, uphold me also in the lonely hour; and though I fall in the din and
								the dust of the world, resurrect Thou me. Even to the last, turn my hands to kindly
								service, and part my lips in gleeful songs of love. And in the softly falling dark,
								when all grows strangely still, may I be glad to have trod the sweet green earth,
								and known the tender touch of love. Yet may I depart with joy, as one who journeys
								home at evening.
						

					
					
					
						A PRAYER OF SUMMER


						
							O WORLD of green and shafts of golden sun; of nightly, silent,
								silver moonlight; and the strange songs of lisping winds! O time of dreams, and
								trysts, and olden memories come to life Sweet summer, may I sing as thou, for every
								leaf of thine is pregnant with music in the soft winds, and every rose inspires the
								tenderness of song. I yield myself to the thousand enchantments of sky and field and
								wood, and play again like a child on the soft green of the earth. And as the God of
								the universe has made thee to bloom in tenderness, so also may my heart be softened,
								and the gardens of my life be made to bloom again.
						

					
					
						EVENING SONG

						
							GIVE me to gladly go
							My way
							And say
							No word of mine own woe;
							But let me smile each day.
						

						
							Give me the strength to do
							My task
							I ask;
							And that I shall not rue
							The toiler's grimy mask.
						

						
							Give one loved hand to me,
							And leave
							The eve
							All undisturbed as we
							Our strength of souls retrieve.
						

						

						
							And lastly give sweet sleep,
							Closed sight,
							No fright
							That fears will o'er me creep;
							And now a sweet good-night.
						

					
					
						AN AUTUMN PRAYER

						
							NOW the great green earth has turned to g old; and the fruit is
								gathered, and the grain is garnered. So may we in the autumn of life, mellowed by
								experience, grow rich in beauty and service, as the green of the earth and the grain
								of the field.
						

					
					
						SHIPS RETURNING HOME

						
							WE ARE all ships returning home laden with life's experience,
								memories of work, good times and sorrows, each with his especial cargo;
						

						
							And it is our common lot to show the marks of the voyage, here a shattered prow,
								there a patched rigging, and every hulk turned black by the unceasing batter of the
								restless wave.
						

						
							May we be thankful for fair weather and smooth seas, and in times of storm have the
								courage and patience that mark every good mariner;
						

						
							And, over all, may we have the cheering hope of joyful meetings, as our ship at
								last drops anchor in the still water of the eternal harbor.
						

					
					
					
						THOU WHOM WE CALL GOD

						
							LONG has been the time since I spoke with thee, Thou whom we call
								God. Now I soften the stern face I carry upon the street as a weapon in the struggle
								for existence, and I cast out of myself all the evil of the world, all possession,
								all malice; and I yield up my soul, as a flower lifts its petals in the twilight of
								morning. Unbind me from the things of the earth, and let me wander through the world
								like the still stars of the night. Come Thou near to me, as in the olden days when I
								saw Thee everywhere, in the woods and the sky, and heard Thy voice in the silence of
								the fields. Take my hand and lead me as my earthly father when my steps were feeble.
								Warm me as a mother warms her child close to her bosom. Teach me again to love, and
								make soft my voice with gentle words. As a gardener waters his garden, refresh Thou
								my soul with tenderness, and bring peace within the troubled household of my heart.
								Knock at my door in the dead and lonesome night; and as I have need of Thee, send
								Thou me forth to others who sit with drooping faces at the table of despair and see
								Thee not. This prayer is born of my need; and if indeed men convince me that Thou
								art not, and that these words are spoken but to die unheard, yet have I been
								answered, and shall believe that Thou art--Thou whom we call God.
						

					
					
						A WINTER PRAYER

						
							COLD lies the lifeless earth, the birds are gone, and through the
								naked trees the shrill wind whistles. Though the world outside be chill and dead,
									 may the world within us resound with gleeful songs,
								and the chambers of our hearts be warm with hope and love. And may many an evening's
								merriment, beside the hearthstone's cheerful glow, make sweet the passing time.
						

					
					
						THE LAST PRAYER

						
							I AM weary lying here so long. Many things that once I thought
								important do not seem so now. If this is the end of earth for me, I pray I shall
								have a last conscious moment, in which I may gladly remember that, in the days of my
								strength, I had had the courage now and then to raise my voice for the right as I
								saw it; that amid the struggles for the necessities of existence I had had time to
								record a few moments of spiritual ecstasy; and that in the stern ways of life I had
								known a little of the tenderness of a woman's love. May these things abide with me;
								and if in the infinite universe I retain aught of my earthly self, may they remind
								me that in my feeble way I was one who tried--a lovely memory out of the beautiful
								earth. Then closing my eyes--consciousness slowly dwindling like a day that is
								spent--let me fall quietly asleep, a tired child at sundown. Peace.

						PRELUDE

						
							I AM not making a book that will live or a book that will die. I
								have no thought whether it will live or die.
						

						
							I am for my own sake manifesting myself, looking at myself, encouraging and
								criticising myself.
						

						
							I see you as you pass on the street, but I do not see the inner chamber where you
								live--the many colored chamber of the soul.
						

						
							I think I must be taking an inventory of the chamber of my soul, cataloguing its
								contents.
						

						
							Many items I do not set down, for I have not yet full courage; if I set down aught
								in shame, it will not be in defiance or bravado; it will be to satisfy my
								honesty.
						

						
							But most of all would I catalogue the love of my soul; for I do not know but that
								after a while I may be hard and dead within. Therefore I think it well that I make a
								record of the love of my soul--
						

						
							A record that may soften a little the stern world, and abide with me until the
								evening, when I am worn out, and the world is discharging me from service; the sun
								gone down, darkness come, and I sit still in the quiet night.
						

					


					

						MY NATIVE CITY

						

							I

							
								A LONG walk. Tired and contented. I have been dreaming again.
									My walk led me upon a hill to the southeast. When at the top, I turned to see some
										 cattle grazing on the wayside--and behold! my
									native city lay at my feet.
							

							
								How silent, how small, how secluded! Like a new toy in the grass, or a nest
									tucked away among the trees of the surrounding valley; or--save for the lines of
									smoke moving slowly to the north--like a picture hanging in a gallery.
							

							
								No one was near me, and only a few farmhouses stood in the distance. And I
									thought and dreamed of the wanderings of men amid the toy-town in the grass, of
									the desires and hopes that had come and passed in this nest among the trees.
							

							
								I thought of my own wanderings, and remembered some sleepless hours divine with
									the music of the night. A thousand memories filled me with the joys of other
									years--memories of friends changed and gone, and of the dawning sun lighting up
									the nimble fancy worlds of youth.

							

							
								I thought I could see the place where two lovers met in the dim past, and out of
									the kiss of their lips I crawled into the morning of the world--and these poems
									after me.
							

							
								Though I did not hear their words, unforgotten is their lover's parley; for ere
									they knew me, it was I who moved their lips to speech in the still night.
							

							
								How much history has passed within this small space of earth-of no importance to
									the world; yet all important the life of each to himself!
							

							
								How many have lived and toiled and planned here--how many, tired and care-worn,
									have lain down here to repose at night!
							

							

							
								How many places where elegance and beauty once reigned have fallen to base uses!
									and how many, merry with midnight music and the dance, have been lifted into
									immortal joy, as if death were not!
							

						




						
							II


							
								O my native city! thou knowest not how often I have thought of thee when far'
									away. When I have wandered amid other scenes, and other men and women and children
									have passed by me, fondly have I thought of thee.
							

							
								The cool shade of thy many trees, and the memory of the gentle river at thy
									margin, have been a solace to me in strange and distant places.
							

							
								But thou wilt go on unconcerned as eve r when I am gone into the silent land.
									Soon wilt thou forget that I wandered about thy streets in the shadow of thy
									buildings. Within thy bosom I lay as a child, have grown to manhood, and shall at
									last rest in dreamless sleep.
							

							
								But thou, too, must pass away; and where now is trade and manufacture, God in His
									time will plant another forest; and it will grow, and no man will know that thou
									dwelt there.
							

							
								On new-born branches birds will whisper songs of love, and flowered children of
									the wilderness will drink the sun-wine, and gloaming eve shall know the wild
									dove's voice, and this race of hurrying, contentious men shall lie--oh, so still
									under the grass!
							

							

							
								So, too, all things shall pass away--I, thou, country, earth, solar systems.
							

							
								What remains?
							

						
					

					
						I SIT AFRAID

						
							O WORLD, how I have loved you!
							And you have stripped me and scourged me;
							Yet have I loved you,
							And my heart has been full of you.
							I hear you say, "Who are you
							That we should care for your love?"
							I answer, "I am nothing,
							But I loved you."
							And I answer again, "I am nothing,
							But I have reached my hand to the lowest,
							And I have sat with want
							That the weak might be nourished,
							And the lonely filled with love."
							Each one of you would I have folded in my arms,
							Not in the public place in view of eyes,
							But on the unseen path of every day,
							For my heart was full of you,
							My lips blooming with wild, sweet songs at morn,
							And softer strains in evening's twilight hour.
							But you stripped me and scourged me.
							Now silent I sit afraid.
						

					

					
						LIFE

						
							I SAT with the stars on the hill of life
							And looked at the world below.
							I ran with the winds where the winds begin
							And followed them where they blow.
						

						

						
							I lay by the sea on the beaten rock
							And rode on the farthest wave.
							I watched by a child on its night of birth
							And followed it to its grave.
						

						
							The lips with a sting in their passions' press
							Touched mine to my soul within;
							I know all the cavernous earthly hells,
							The gold-garnished seats of sin.
						

						
							And love in the still of the star-flecked night,
							When earth was all strewn with gold,
							Has lifted my heart like the chords of song
							Oft sung in the worlds of old.
						

						
							And though I have not understood all this,
							Made up of a laugh and a wail;
							I think that the God of the world knows all,
							And some day will tell the tale.
						
					


					
						IN THE MORNING TWILIGHT

						
							HERE I stand watching the dawn. In miniature I am living my whole
								life over again. Other years flit before me and are gone, like fire-flies in the
								night. The past marches again through the archway of consciousness, and I stand
								looking on.
						

						
							You are marching through this archway--you who sit with me in the evening and think
								these thoughts after me; you who are old; you with bodily beauty, battling against
								commerce of the flesh, whether in or out of the law; you ill-formed and unloved
								person; you, disappointed one, making a sorry figure on the streets of life; you who
								nervously watch with a hawk's eye the outgoings and incomings of your shop; you
								criminal  awaiting trial; you idler in dandy's attire;
								you who think yourself learned; and you who know yourself to be ignorant--
						

						
							You--each of you I know, for each of you has passed through me, as I have passed
								through you. Each of you is my kin, coming where I came from, going whither I shall
								go, out of darkness before the morning, back somewhere after the day.
						

						
							O my friend! you should have seen me playing seriously many parts in the human
								comedy; you should have seen me puffed up with learning, and stepping the nimble
								step of fashion, with platitudes and quiet flattery on my lips, wearing the
								political social smile. (I could do them perfectly.) Long, too, with a sad kind of
								joy, have I made a specialty of virtue; and then in days of inner flame have I felt
								in me the passion to swim a sea of lust.
						

						
							The red weeds of vengeance have poisoned my reason; and the dagger of death has
								trembled in my hand. I have sat in mighty earthly places with the rulers of men; and
								silently with seers have I seen this world grow small and dim, as I looked down upon
								it from the immortal thrones on the mountain tops of greater worlds.
						

						
							I have worked with my hands day after day, and I know the joy; and I know the numb
								hell of overwork--the leech at the throat; I have been loved by many children, as if
								I were their father; and I have been looked upon with suspicion.
						

						
							There you go--all who have passed in and out me. I know each of you; and as you,
								singing audibly or  inaudibly, passing me on the
								highway, have nourished me, so would I have you sit and rest yourself in the shadow
								of my faith. Now in this hour of still dawn would I whisper to you the faith that is
								in me. I would banish civilization, and turn mankind loose over this emerald field
								sparkling with dew.
						

						
							This burst of sunlight out of the east, this mystery of the dawning, has filled me
								with a new peace, and I lay aside the cares of life and sit with smiling face in the
								doorway of the world; and the many persons I have been are unified and yield to the
								world beyond the senses--the world of the soul.
						

						
							O you who are looking downward with still face, sitting with unlighted candles in
								the house of life, and you surrounded by the noise of the crowded world with its
								cruelty and haste, and you unloved one with starving heart, and you who have failed,
								sitting beside the ashes of grandeur that is past--
						

						
							You, all of you, shall yet be filled, though I know not how, and the dream shall
								one day meet you face to face as a thing that is real, and you will embrace it
								caressingly, as this morning light caresses the waking earth.
						
					

					
						EHEU!

						
							I WAS not called for greater tasks than these brief half-born
								songs;
							I was not called to smite the lyre and right a nation's wrongs.
							Not even was I bidden touch the finger tips of fame;
							But in the eddies of a stream I scrolled my name.
							

							Yet you who read perchance in after years by glow of light
							In evening still, or by the music of some lonely stream,
							Or on some silent, God-lit hill above the noisy world--
							To you I whisper love, not fame, was my one dream.
							Oh, that in youth but once I could have sung a song that held
							The magic music of my soul, which ever upward welled
							Against my tuneless lips! I sit alone and know the truth,
							With broken harp beside the ashes of my youth.
						
					


					
						OUT OF THE DEPTHS

						
							MY LIFE is like a ship that's lost at sea,
							A worn-out toy with which no child will play,
							The sombre twilight after a rainy day,
							A sieged city that no arms will free,
							A lonely hovel on a grassless lea
							To which no friendly footsteps wend their way.
							I sometimes think I see myself decay,
							Like cankered fruit upon a withered tree.
							Was that one voice I heard of old a lie,
							Some drunken poison in the blood of youth
							That made my hope seem like the dawn of truth?
							Thou God of my forgotten boyhood, I
							Am sick of soul, decaying with each breath,
							Like one whose lips have touched the cup of death.
						
					

					
						STERILITY

						
							I HAVE been urged to deliver some great work, something with
								magic that shall set astir the world, and make flow again the dried-up rivers of the
								heart, something that shall endure and prove my power.
								But instead I do nothing, and sit whimpering in a corner.
						

						
							Oh! I have chidden myself and whipped myself, smarting under the lash, like a slave
								feeling the stripes in his dungeon; but I cannot reach out; my imagination is linked
								to the rocks, and I cannot break the chain; my will lies ill abed; and desire in me
								has starved as in a famine.
						

						
							I spend my days in drudgery, and the endless round of daily duties has calloused my
								heart. I turn as a wheel and cannot break away from the axis of steel that holds me
								tight. Song has left me like the foliage of a summer that is past, and memories of
								olden dreams knock no more at the door of thought.
						

						
							Oh, who will unchain me from the rocks! Who will set me free and light again the
								candles in the house of hope! Who will teach me desire and rebuild the enchanted
								palaces! I am ungathered grain that the frost has nipped, a cloud that sends no rain
								when the earth is parched.
						

						
							Oh, how often I have set out with boldness to soar afar in some great task only to
								return with bleeding breast and broken wing! I was made for small performances, and
								my ambition is like a child reaching for the sun, or like a wild beast that roams in
								forsaken lands, contemplating the spires of a dead civilization.
						

						
							Henceforth, I will shut myself in and be silent. And if no other virtue be mine,
								this shall I strive to attain: that though I dash yet again and again on the rocks,
								I utter no more cry; though my soul die, I go as one who lives; though all be taken
								from me, I abide as  one who has; and though my
								triumphs exist only in the painted world of my brain, I live as if indeed the laurel
								had pressed my brow, and my song had mingled a little with the music of the
								world.
						
					

					
						THE THINGS OF THE SPIRIT

						
							HAVE I spoken in vain, or has some one somewhere understood me?
								Have I bared my breast to dead book-shelves, and shall the tenderness that has
								bloomed in me wither like some wild plant in an unfrequented forest?
						

						
							The world that passes by me in fevered haste knows me not; nor takes me by the
								hand, for what shall it profit any man loving only things to be my friend?
						

						
							Once my poems mingled with the thoughts of two lovers in a wood; and once an old
								man told me that I had given him courage to live;
						

						
							And these things have I lovingly nursed in my soul; and as many flowers grow from a
								single seed, so full a hundred songs have bloomed in me, out of the thought that my
								task had not been all in vain.
						

						
							And now I know that the things of the spirit that are given will return
								sometime--maybe only after long years, but they will return.
						

						
							Meanwhile you who serve and wait, linger here a moment and rest in the shadow of my
								faith; for the things I give, you will give to me again--perhaps when I wander lost
								in the night in the city of strange experience.
						
					


					
					
						A PSALM

						
							WHEN I wander in places of greed for gain I have no desire; the
								grass of the meadow and the stars of the night comfort me. Though darkness overcome
								me, I shall not despair; the God of my youth still abides with me. He showeth me the
								palaces of the rich and the haunts of the poor, yet keepeth sweet my soul. When
								weariness overtakes me, I lie down in slumber, and the peace of the world is upon
								me. Though poverty abide with me, I pray that courage and gentleness forsake me not.
								And with all living things out of the earth and out of other worlds I believe I
								shall grow in the fields of God forever.
						
					
					
						I AM OVER ANXIOUS

						
							DAYS and weeks, months and years pass and we grow old; the senses
								respond more and more slowly to sight and sound, desire withers like a flower out of
								season, and passion perishes on the snows of many winters.
						

						
							Hope of grand deeds, like a memory, returns less and less often; and the fine
								daring of youth lies lifeless in the comfort of some little corner of the world.
						

						
							Dreams vanish, ambitions are forgotten, and the passion of love warms no more the
								hearthstones of the human heart.
						

						
							Melodies pass unheard in the singing winds, and the whispers of evening twilight
								enchant no more.
						

						
							O age, where is thy fulfillment of youth!
						

						

						
							We go out like a candle that is spent, vanish like the waters of a sunken river,
								and are forgotten like a garment that is cast aside.
						

						
							If this is all, then life is water that does not quench the thirst, tears that do
								not unburden the heart. Then the crimson lure in the west at sunset is a lie, and
								vainly burns the candle in the heart of hope.
						

						
							But surely this is not all. Every star is a witness that this is not all.
						

						
							And what if to die is but to awaken out of a dreaming sleep--to awaken in a room
								with doors that lead to every chamber in the household of the universe, alike to the
								subterranean caverns of an ant-hill and to the mammoth palaces built on infinitely
								distant worlds that wander through the night in their luster of gold!
						

						
							And you who quarrel with me at the market, and contend with me upon the street, you
								shall see, when I am dead, how still I shall lie, and with what peace my face is
								composed.
						

						
							But you shall not see me, for I shall have slipped away.
						

						
							Oh, I am over anxious to know how I shall conduct myself when I have slipped
								away--more anxious than how I shall conduct myself to-morrow or the next day!
						

						
							And though I know not why, I cannot say how sure I am that I shall conduct myself
								well, and that you will conduct yourself well, and that we shall be satisfied.
						
					


					

					
						THE HOUSE INSIDE

						
							I WANDER again inside myself, door after door I open, pass
								through, and close again slowly, noiselessly.
						

						
							The outer world I leave behind, I hear no more the noise of the street, and I see
								no more the sights of daily life.
						

						
							As I pass from chamber to chamber in the house of my soul, everything becomes more
								and more quiet. Now I pause a moment in the still room which is not far removed from
								the inner chamber of the quick of me.
						

						
							All passion, all desire, all possession are stripped from me; the world of the
								senses is gone, and a light not of the world but of the inner world guides my
								steps.
						

						
							Color and shape are gone; something like music but not music I hear and yet hear
								not. Something like feeling, but neither of pleasure nor pain, presses gently
								against me at the heart of myself.
						

						
							The next chamber and the next, and I stand face to face with the flame, the spirit,
								the God. It seems to me it must be a chamber of mother-of-pearl, with living iris
								hues, and a flame of saffron--a still flame of saffron. I tremble, for the house has
								grown strange to me, and I feel I shall lose my way. I have passed the chambers of
								human speech and can therefore explain no more save in symbols. I search for
								symbols.
						

						
							It seems like a light, a still, warm light with a face in it, the face of the human
								soul, the face of the faint and changeless smile, noiseless, eternal, gentle, oh!
								very gentle.
						

						

						
							This I say, though I have not yet passed the last door. I have lost my way, fear
								overtakes me, I can remember nothing, it seems that I am sinking, a piercing chill
								runs through my body, I tremble and shriek inwardly, I retrace my steps, groping in
								the dark, urging my will as with an iron spear, I hurry out, away, back to the
								chamber of memory and imagination, back to the world of speech, then out of doors to
								the world of sight and sound and color.
						

						
							I lack the full measure of courage, yet I remember that I stood in the ante-chamber
								of my soul.
						
					


					
						THROUGH THE MIST OF THE WORLD

						
							DO NOT think I am one who would cover with sweet speech the
								tragedies of life.
						

						
							It seems to me that I have drunk the lees of every poison, and sat at midnight with
								every woe.
						

						
							Thrice have I stood on a precipice and looked into the caverns of the nether world,
								and thrice have been recalled by the voice of a friend.
						

						
							I have ached in body from toil, and hope has died in me a thousand times.
						

						
							I walked out in youth with Christ in my soul and was crucified at the first
								crossing.
						

						
							Curses have been given me for kindness, and the tongue of hate has mingled my name
								with poison.
						

						
							So low has courage ebbed in me that I have asked nothing of the world but a corner
								in which to breathe and hide my face.
						
						

						
							Years of patient toil, instead of wealth and the good-will of friends, brought me,
								want and the sneers of them I loved.
						

						
							Oh, how I should have joyed in one kind word and the touch of a sympathetic
								hand!
						

						
							Sorrow, fear, envy, hate, bitterness, passed in and out of me, like miasmatic fumes
								from the foul places of the earth.
						

						
							The God of my youth was dead, and on His grave danced the devils of every sin.
						

						
							Vulgarity triumphed over gentleness, and the fat tradesman was master of them that
								are sweet in spirit.
						

						
							Every ideal I had was the mother of a brood of sorrows, for to follow a vision in a
								land of bog is death.
						

						
							And the end of all human effort is as the grass of a forgotten summer.
						

						
							Yet through the night of this despair again and again have burst the rays of
								morning.
						

						
							And in the dim light I have bound the broken chords of life.
						

						
							Out of the winter of the past have crept the buds of spring, and once again have I
								planted love in my heart, and therefore found love in others.
						

						
							The lips of malice have at last whispered a gentle word and courage was born in me
								again.
						

						
							Toil, though it brought not what I sought, brought something, and nursed again to
								life the withered blooms of hope.
						

						
						
							The dogmas of the world that bound me to pain I cut, as with a knife;
						

						
							And now I wander freely, taking counsel of my human nature and the love of life,
								lingering where I will, denying me nothing.
						

						
							And through the mist of the world I seem to see again the God of my youth; but
								grown older, gentler, and more compassionate, as I myself am older and more
								compassionate.
